25586380	a reputed changeling or three seventh years two centuries ago     preface   i do not think i have here forced the hand of history except by giving portchester to two imaginary rectors and by a little injustice to her whom princess anne termed the brickbat woman  the trial is not according to present rules but precedents for its irregularities are to be found in the doings of the seventeenth century notably in the trial of spencer cowper by the same judge hatsel and i have done my best to represent the habits of those country gentry who were not infected by the evils of the later stewart reigns  there is some doubt as to the proper spelling of portchester but judging by analogy the t ought not to be omitted  c m yonge 2d may 1889    chapter i the experiences of goody madge   dear madam think me not to blame invisible the fairy came your precious babe is hence conveyed and in its place a changeling laid where are the fathers mouth and nose the mothers eyes as black as sloes see here a shocking awkward creature that speaks a fool in every feature  gay  he is an ugly illfavoured boyjust like riquet a la houppe  that he is  do you not know that he is a changeling  such were the words of two little girls walking home from a school for young ladies kept at the cathedral city of winchester by two frenchwomen of quality refugees from the persecutions preluding the revocation of the edict of nantes and who enlivened the studies of their pupils with the contes de commere loie  the first speaker was anne jacobina woodford who had recently come with her mother the widow of a brave naval officer to live with her uncle the prebendary then in residence  the other was lucy archfield daughter to a knight whose home was a few miles from portchester dr woodfords parish on the southern coast of hampshire  in the seventeenth century when roads were mere ditches often impassable and countryhouses frequently became entirely isolated in the winter it was usual with the wealthier county families to move into their local capital where some owned mansions and others hired prebendal houses or went into lodgings in the roomy dwellings of the superior tradesmen  for the elders this was the season of social intercourse for the young people of education  the two girls who were about eight years old had struck up a rapid friendship and were walking hand in hand to the close attended by the nurse in charge of mistress lucy  this little lady wore a black silk hood and cape trimmed with light brown fur and lined with pink while anne woodford being still in mourning for her father was wrapped in a black cloak unrelieved except by the white border of her round cap fringed by fair curls contrasting with her brown eyes  she was taller and had a more upright bearing of head and neck with more promise of beauty than her companion who was much more countrified and would not have been taken for the child of higher station  they had traversed the graveyard of the cathedral and were passing through a narrow archway known as the slype between the south western angle of the cathedral and a heavy mass of old masonry forming part of the garden wall of the present abode of the archfield family when suddenly both children stumbled and fell while an elfish peal of laughter sounded behind them  lucy came down uppermost and was scarcely hurt but anne had fallen prone striking her chin on the ground so as to make her bite her lip and bruising knees and elbows severely  nurse detected the cause of the fall so as to avoid it herself  it was a cord fastened across the archway close to the ground and another shout of derision greeted the discovery while lucy regaining her feet beheld for a moment a weird exulting grimace on a visage peeping over a neighbouring headstone  it is he it is he  the wicked imp  theres no peace for him  i say she screamed see if you dont get a sound flogging and she clenched her little fist as the provoking ho ho ho rang farther and farther off  dont cry anne dear the dean and chapter shall take order with him and he shall be soundly beaten  are you hurt o nurse her mouth is all blood  i hope she has not broken a tooth said nurse who had been attending to the sobbing child  come in my lamb we will wash your face and make you well  anne blinded with tears jarred bruised bleeding and bewildered submitted to be led by kind nurse the more willingly because she knew that her mother together with all the quality were at sir thomas charnocks  they had dined at the fashionable hour of two and were to stay till suppertime the elders playing at ombre the juniors dancing  as a rule the ordinary clergy did not associate with the county families but dr woodford was of good birth and a royal chaplain and his deceased brother had been a favourite officer of the duke of york and had been so severely wounded by his side in the battle of southwold as to be permanently disabled indeed anne jacobina was godchild to the duke and his first duchess whose favoured attendant her mother had been  thus mrs woodford was in great request and though she had not hitherto gone into company since her widowhood she had yielded to lady charnocks entreaty that she would come and show her how to deal with that strange new chinese infusion a costly packet of which had been brought to her from town by sir thomas as the queens favourite beverage wherewith the ladies of the place were to be regaled and astonished  it had been already arranged that the two little girls should spend the evening together and as they entered the garden before the house a rude voice exclaimed holloa  london nan whimpering  has my fine lady met a spider or a cow and a big rough lad of twelve in a college gown spread out his arms and danced up and down in the doorway to bar the entrance  dont sedley said a sturdy but more gentlemanlike lad of the same age thrusting him aside  is she hurt  what is it  that spiteful imp peregrine oakshott said lucy passionately he had a cord across the slype to trip us up  i heard him laughing like a hobgoblin and saw him too grinning over a tombstone like the malicious elf he is  the college boy uttered a horse laugh which made lucy cry cousin sedley you are as bad but the other boy was saying dont cry anne nonesopretty  ill give it him well  though im younger im bigger and ill show him reason for not meddling with my little sweetheart  have with you then shouted sedley ready for a fray on whatever pretext and off they rushed as nurse led little anne up the broad shallow steps of the dark oak staircase but lucy stood laughing with exultation in the intended vengeance as her brother took down her fathers huntingwhip  he must be wellnigh a fiend to play such wicked pranks under the very minster she said  and a rascal of a whig and thats worse added charles but ill have it out of him  take care charley if you offend him and he does really belong to thosethose creatureslucy lowered her voicewho knows what they might do to you  charles laughed long and loud  ill take care of that he said swinging out at the door  elf or no elf he shall learn what it is to play off his tricks on my sister and my little sweetheart  lucy betook herself to the nursery where anne was being comforted her bleeding lip washed with essence and repaired with a pinch of beaver from a hat and her other bruises healed with lily leaves steeped in strong waters  charley is gone to serve him out announced lucy as the sovereign remedy  oh but perhaps he did not mean it anne tried to say  mean it  small question of that the cankered young slip  nurse do you think those he belongs to can do charley any harm if he angers them  i cannot say missie  only tis well we be not at home or there might be elf knots in the horses manes tonight  i doubt me whether that sort can do much hurt here seeing as tis holy ground  but is he really a changeling  i thought there were no such things as  hist hist missie anne cried the dame tis not good to name them  oh but we are on the minster ground nurse said lucy trembling a little however looking over her shoulder and coming closer to the old servant  why do they think so asked anne  is it because he is so ugly and mischievous and rude  not like boys in london  prithee nurse tell her the tale entreated lucy who had made large eyes over it many a time before  ay and who should tell you all about it save me who had it all from goody madge bulpett as saw it all  goody madge  it was she that came when poor little kitty was born and died suggested lucy as anne laying her aching head upon nurses knees prepared to listen to the story  well deary darlings you see poor madam oakshott never had her health since the great fire in london when she was biding with her kinsfolk to be near major oakshott who had got into trouble about some of his nonconforming doings  the poor lady had a mortal fright before she could be got out of gracechurch street as was all of a blaze and she was so afeard of her husband being burnt as he lay in newgate that she could scarce be got away and whether it was that or that she caught cold lying out in a tent on highgate hill she has never had a days health since  and the gentlemanher husband asked anne  they all broke prison poor fellows as they had need to do and the majors time was nearly up  he made himself busy in saving and helping the folk in the streets and his brother sir peregrine who was thick with the king and is in foreign parts now took the chance to speak of the poor ladys plight and say it would be the death of her if he could not get his discharge and his majesty bless his kind heart gave the order at once  so they took madam home to the chace but she has been but an ailing body ever since  but the fairy the fairy how did she change the babe cried anne  hush hush dearie name them not  i am coming to it all in good time  i was telling you how the poor lady failed and pined from that hour and was like to die  my gossip madge told me how when next midsummer this unlucky babe was born they had to take him from her chamber at once because any sound of crying made her start in her sleep and shriek that she heard a poor child wailing who had been left in a burning house  moll owens the hinds wife a comely lass was to nurse him and they had him at once to her in the nursery where was the elder child two years old master oliver as you know well mistress lucy a finegrown sturdy little turk as ever was  yes i know him answered lucy and if his brothers a changeling he is a bear  the whig bear is what charley calls him  well what does that child do but trot out of the nursery and try to scramble down the stairsnever tell me but that they you wot of trained him outnot that they had power over a christian child but that they might work their will on the little one  so they must needs trip him up so that he rolled down the stair hollering and squalling all the way enough to bring the house down and his poor lady mother she woke up in a fit  the womenfolk ran molly and all she being but a slip of a girl herself and giddypated and when they came back after quieting master oliver the babe was changed  then they didnt see the  hush hush missie no one never sees em or they couldnt do nothing  they cannot if a body is looking  but what had been as likely a child before as you would wish to handle was gone  the poor little mouth was all of a twist and his eyelid drooped and he never ceased mourn mourn mourn wail wail wail day and night and whatever food he took he never was satisfied but pined and peaked and dwined from day to day so as his little legs was like knitting pins  the lady was nigh upon death as it seemed so that no one took note of the child at first but when madge had time to look at him she saw how it was as plain as plain could be and told his father  but men are unbelieving my dears and always think they know better than them as has the best right and major oakshott would hear of no such thing only if the boy was like to die he must be christened  well madge knew that sometimes they flee at touch of holy water but no though the thing mourned and moaned enough to curdle your blood and screeched out when the water touched him there he was the same puny little canker  so when madam was better and began to fret over the child that was nigh upon three months old and no bigger than a newborn babe madge up and told her how it was and the way to get her own again  what was that nurse  there be different ways my dear  madge always held to breaking five and twenty eggs and have a pot boiling on a good seacoal fire with the poker in it red hot and then drop the shells in one by one in sight of the creature in the cradle  presently it will up and ask whatever you are about  then you gets the poker in your hand as you says abrewing of egg shells  then it says im forty hundred years old and odd and yet i never heard of abrewing of egg shells  then you ups with the poker and at him to thrust it down his ugly throat and theres a hissing and a whirling and he is snatched away and the real darling all plump and rosy is put back in the cradle  and did they  no my dears  madam was that softhearted she could not bring her mind to it though they promised her not to touch him unless he spoke  but nigh on two years later master robert was born as fine and lusty and straightlimbed as a chrisom could be while the other could not walk a step but sat himself about on the floor amoaning and afretting with the legs of him for all the world like the drumsticks of a fowl and his hands like claws and his face wizened up like an old gaffer of a hundred or the jackanapes that martin boatsn brought from barbary  so after a while madam saw the rights of it and gave consent that means should be taken as madge and other wise folk would have it but he was too old by that time for the egg shells for he could talk talk and ask questions enough to drive you wild  so they took him out under the privet hedge madge and her gossip deborah clint and had got his clothes off to flog him with nettles till they changed him when the illfavoured elf began to squall and shriek like a whole litter of pigs and as ill luck would have it the master was within hearing though they had watched him safe off to one of his own venticles but it seems there had been warning that the justices were on the lookout so home he came  and behold the thing that never knew the use of his feet before ups and flies at him and lays hold of his leg hollering out sir father dont let them and what not  so then it was all over with them as though that were not proof enow what manner of thing it was  madge tried to put him off with washing with yarbs being good for the limbs but when he saw that deb was there he saith saith he as grim as may be thou shalt not suffer a witch to live which was hard for she is but a white witch and he stormed and raved at them with bible texts and then he vowed men are so headstrong my dears that if ever he ketched them at it again he would see deb burnt for a witch at the stake and madge hung for the murder of the child and he is well known to be a man of his word  so they had to leave him to abide by his bargain and a sore handful he has of it  anne drew a long sigh and asked whether the real boy in fairyland would never come back  theres no telling missie dear  some say they are bound there for ever and a day some that they as holds em are bound to bring them back for a night once in seven years and in the old times if they was sprinkled with holy water and crossed they would stay but theres no such thing as holy water now save among the papists and if one knew the way to cross oneself it would be as much as ones life was worth  if peregrine was to die suggested lucy  bless your heart dearie hell never die  when the true ones time comes youll see if so be you be alive to see it as heaven grant he will go off like the flame of a candle and nothing be left in his place but a bit of a withered sting nettle  but come my sweetings tis time i got your supper  ill put some nice rosy cheeked apples down to roast to be soft for mistress woodfords sore mouth  before the apples were roasted charles archfield and his cousin the colleger sedley archfield a big boy in a black cloth gown came in with news of havingtogether with the other boys including oliver and robert oakshotthunted peregrine all round the close but he ran like a lapwing and when they had pinned him up in the corner by dr kens house he slipped through their fingers up the ivy and grinned at them over the wall like the imp he was  noll said it was always the way he was no more to be caught than a bit of thistledown but sedley meant to call out all the college boys and hunt and bait him down like a badger on hills    chapter ii high treason   whateer it be that is within his reach the filching trick he doth his fingers teach  robin badfellow  there was often a considerable distance between children and their parents in the seventeenth century but anne woodford as the only child of her widowed mother was as solace comfort and companion and on her pillow in early morning the child poured forth in grave earnest the entire story of the changeling asking whether he could not be taken to good dr ken or the dean or the bishop to be ex exwhat is it mother  not whipped with nettles  oh no nor burnt with red hot pokers but have holy words said so that the right one may come back  my dear child did you really believe that old nurses tale  o madam she knew it  the other old woman saw it  i always thought fairies and elves were only in tales but lucys nurse knows it is true  and he is not a bit like other lads mamma dear  he is lean and small and his eyes are of different colours look two ways at once and his mouth goes awry when he speaks and he laughs just likelike a fiend  lucy and i call him riquet a la houppe because he is just like the picture in mademoiselles book with a great stubbly bunch of hair sticking out on one side and though he walks a little lame he can hop and skip like a grasshopper faster than any of the boys and leap up a wall in a moment and grinoh most frightfully  have you ever seen him mamma  i think so  i saw a poor boy who seemed to me to have had a stroke of some sort when he was an infant  but madam that would not make him so spiteful and malicious  if every one is against him and treats him as a wicked mischievous elf it is only too likely to make him bitter and spiteful  nay anne if you come back stuffed with old wives tales i shall not allow you to go home with lucy archfield  the threat silenced anne who was a grave and rather silent little person and when she mentioned it to her friend the answer was did you tell your mother  if i had told mine i should have been whipped for repeating lying tales  oh then you dont believe it  it must be true for madge knew it  but thats the way always if one lets out that one knows more than they think  it is not the way with my mother stoutly said anne drawing up her dignified little head  and she kept her resolution for though a little excited by her first taste of lively youthful companionship she was naturally a thoughtful reticent child with a character advanced by companionship with her mother as an only child through a great sorrow  thus she was in every respect more developed than her contemporary lucy who regarded her with wonder as well as affection and she was the object of the boyish devotion of charley who often defended her from his cousin sedleys endeavours to put down what he considered upstart airs in a little nobody from london  sedley teased and baited every weak thing in his way and lucy had been his chief butt till anne woodfords unconscious dignity and more cultivated manners excited his utmost spleen  lucy might be incredulous but she was eager to tell that when her cousin sedley archfield was going back to chambers down from the close gate came the imp on his shoulders in the twilight and twisted both legs round his neck holding tight on in spite of plunges pinches and endeavours to scrape him off against the wall which were frustrated or retaliated by hair pulling choking till just ere entering the college gateway where sedley looked to get his revenge among his fellows he found his shoulders free and heard ho ho ho from the top of a wall close at hand  all the more was the young peoples faith in the changeling story confirmed and childworld was in those days even more impenetrable to their elders than at present  changeling or no it was certain that peregrine oakshott was the plague of the close where his father an exofficer of the parliamentary army had unwillingly hired a house for the winter for the sake of medical treatment for his wife a sufferer from a complication of ailments  oakwood his home was about five miles from dr woodfords living of portchester and as the families would thus be country neighbours mrs woodford thought it well to begin the acquaintance at winchester  while knocking at the door of the house on the opposite side of the close she was aware of an elfish visage peering from an upper window  there was the queer mop of dark hair the squinting light eyes the contorted grin crooking the mouth the odd sallow face making her quite glad to get out of sight of the strange grimaces which grew every moment more hideous  mrs oakshott sat in an armchair beside a large fire in a wainscotted room with a foldingscreen shutting off the window her spinningwheel was near but it was only too plain that feeble was the hand and silly the thread  she bent her head in its wadded black velvet hood but excused herself from rising as she was crippled by rheumatic pains  she had evidently once been a pretty little person innocent and inane and her face had become like that of a withered baby piteous in its expression of pain and weariness but otherwise somewhat vacant  at first indeed there was a look of alarm  perhaps she expected every visitor to come with a complaint of her unlucky peregrine but when mrs woodford spoke cheerfully of being her neighbour in the country she was evidently relieved and even gratified prattling in a soft plaintive tone about her sufferings and the various remedies ranging from woodlice rolled into natural pills and grease off the church bells to diamond dust and goa stones since as she said there was no cost to which major oakshott would not go for her benefit  he had even procured for her a pound of the queens new chinese herb and it certainly was as nauseous as could be wished when boiled in milk but she was told that was not the way it was taken at my lady charnocks  she was quite animated when mrs woodford offered to show her how to prepare it  therewith the master of the house came in and the aspect of affairs changed  he was a tall dark grave man plainly though handsomely dressed and in a gentlemanly way making it evident that visits to his wife were not welcome  he said that her health never permitted her to go abroad and that his poor house contained nothing that could please a court lady  mrs oakshott shrank into herself and became shy and silent and mrs woodford felt constrained to take leave courteously conducted to the door by her unwilling host  she had not taken many steps before she was startled by a sharp shower from a squirt coming sidelong like a blow on her cheek and surprising her into a low cry which was heard by the major so that he hastened out exclaiming madam i trust that you are not hurt  oh no sir  it is nothingnot a stoneonly water she said wiping it with her handkerchief  i am grieved and ashamed at the evil pranks of my unhappy son but he shall suffer for it  nay sir i pray you  it was only childish mischief  he had not waited to hear her pleadings and before she was half across the close he had overtaken her dragging the cowering struggling boy in his powerful grasp  now peregrine he commanded let me instantly hear you ask the ladys pardon for your dastardly trick  or and his other hand was raised for a blow  i am sure he is sorry said mrs woodford making a motion to ward off the stroke and as the queer eyes glanced up at her in wondering inquiry she laid her hand on the bony shoulder saying i know you did not mean to hurt me  you are sorry are you not  ay the boy muttered and she saw a look of surprise on his fathers face  there she said he has made his amends and surely that may suffice  nay madam it would be a weak and ungodly tenderness that would spare to drive forth the evil spirit which possesses the child by the use of the rod  i should fail in my duty alike to god and man he added in reply to a fresh gesture of intercession did i not teach him what it is to insult a lady at mine own door  mrs woodford could only go away heartily sorry for the boy  from that time however both she and her little daughter were untouched by his tricks though every one else had some complaint  peas were shot from unknown recesses at venerable canons mice darted out before shrieking ladies frogs clammy forms descended on the nape of their necks hedgehogs were curled up on their chairs and though peregrine oakshott was not often caught in the act no mischief ever took place that was not attributed to him and it was popularly believed in the close that his father flogged him every morning for what he was about to do and his tutor repeated the castigation every evening for what he had done besides interludes at each detection  perhaps frequent usage had toughened his skin or he had become expert in wriggling from the full force of the blow or else as many believed the elfish nature was impervious for he was as ready as ever for a trick the moment he was released like as his brother said the dog keeper who with a slaughtered chick hung round his neck in penance rushed murderously upon the rest of the brood  yet mrs woodford on her way through the cathedral nave was aware of something leaning against one of the great columns crouching together so that the dark head supported on the arms rested against the pillar which fluted the pier  the organ was pealing softly and plaintively and the little gray coat seemed to heave as with a sob  she stood impelled to offer to take him with her into the choir but a verger spying him began rating him in a tone fit for expelling a dog come master none of your pranks here  be not you ashamed of yourself to be lying in wait for godly folk on their way to prayers  if i catch you here again the dean shall hear of it and you shall smart for it  mrs woodford began he was only hearkening to the music but she caught such a look of malignity cast upon the verger as perfectly appalled her and in another moment the boy had dashed head over heels out at the nearest door  the next report that reached her related how a cloud of lime had suddenly descended from a broken arch of the cloister on the solemn verger on his way to escort the dean to the minster powdering his wig whitening his black gown from collar to hem and not a little endangering his eyesight  the culprit eluded all pursuit on this occasion but mrs woodford soon after was told that the major had caught peregrine listening at the little south door of the choir had collared him and flogged him worse than ever for being seduced by the sounds of the popish and idolatrous worship and had told all his sons that the like chastisement awaited them if they presumed to cross the threshold of the steeple house  nevertheless the senior prefect of the college boys when about to come out of the cathedral on sunday morning found his gown pinned with a skewer so fast to the seat that he was only set free at the expense of a rent  public opinion decided that the deed had been done by the imp of oakshott and accordingly the whole of the wykeham scholars set on him with hue and cry the first time they saw him outside the close and hunted him as far as st cross where he suddenly and utterly vanished from their sight  mrs woodford agreed with anne that it was a very strange story for how could he have been in the cathedral at service time when it was well known that major oakshott had all his family together at his own form of worship in his house  anne who had been in hopes that her mother would be thus convinced of his supernatural powers looked disappointed but she had afterwards to confess that charles archfield had found out that it was his cousin sedley archfield who had played the audacious trick in revenge for a wellmerited tunding from the prefect  and then saddled it on young oakshott asked her mother  charley says one such matter more or less makes no odds to the whig ape but i cannot endure sedley archfield mamma  if he lets another lad bear the blame of his malice he cannot indeed be a good lad  so charley and lucy say returned anne  we shall be glad to be away from winchester for while peregrine oakshott torments slyly sedley archfield loves to frighten us openly and to hurt us to see how much we can bear and if charley tries to stand up for us sedley calls him a puny wench and a milksop and knocks him down but dear madam pray do not tell what i have said to her ladyship for there is no knowing what sedley would do to us  my little maid has not known before what boys can be  no but indeed charles archfield is quite different almost as if he had been bred in london  he is a very gentleman  he never is rude to any girl and he is courteous and gentle and kind  he gathered walnuts for us yesterday and cracked all mine and i am to make him a purse with two of the shells  mrs woodford smiled but there was a short thrill of anxiety in her motherly heart as her glance brought up a deeper colour into annes cheeks  there was a reserve to bring that glow for the child knew that if she durst say that charles called her his little sweetheart and wife and that the walnutshell purse would be kept as a token she should be laughed at as a silly child perhaps forbidden to make it or else her uncle might hear and make a joke of it  it was not exactly disingenuousness but rather the first dawn of maidenly reserve and modesty that reddened her cheek in a manner her mother did not fail to observe  yet it was with more amusement than misgiving for children played at courtship like other games in mimicry of being grown up and a baronets only son was in point of fact almost as much out of the reach of a sea captains daughter and clergymans niece as a prince of the blood royal and master archfield would probably be contracted long before he could choose for himself for his family were not likely to take into account that if captain woodford had not been too severely wounded to come forward after the battle of southwold bay he would have been knighted  on the strength of which anne as her companions sometimes said gave herself in consequence more airs than mistress lucy ever did  sedley a poor cousin a destitute cavaliers orphan who had been placed on the foundation at winchester college in hopes that he might be provided for in the church would have been far more on her level and indeed lady archfield a notable matchmaker had already hinted how suitable such a thing would be  however the present school character of master sedley as well as her own observations by no means inclined mrs woodford towards the boy large limbed and comely faced but with a bullying scowling air that did not augur well for his wife or his parish  whether it were this lads threats or more likely the fact that all the close was on the alert peregrines exploits were less frequent there and began to extend to the outskirts of the city there were some fine yew trees on the southern borders towards the chalk down with massive dark foliage upon stout ruddy branches among which peregrine armed with a fishingrod line and hook sat perched angling for what might be caught from unconscious passengers along a path which led beneath  from a marketwomans basket he abstracted thus a fowl  his ho ho ho startled her into looking up and seeing it apparently resuscitated and hovering aloft  full of dismay she hurried shrieking away to tell the story of the bewitched chick at the marketcross among her gossips  his next capture was a chop from a butcher boys tray but this involved more peril for with a fierce oath that he would be revenged on the whiggish imp the lad darted at the tree in vain however for peregrine had dropped down on the other side and crept unseen to another bush where he lay perdu under the thick green branches rod and all while the youth swearing and growling was shaking his former refuge  as soon as the coast was clear he went back to his post and presently was aware of three gentlemen advancing over the down pointing measuring and surveying  one was small and slight as simply dressed as a gentleman of the period could be another was clad in a gay coat with a good deal of fluttering ribbon and rich lace the third a tall wellmade man had a plain walking suit surmounted by a flowing periwig and plumed beaver  coming close beneath peregrines tree and standing with their backs to it they eagerly conversed  such a cascade will drown the honours of the versailles fountains if only the water can be raised to such a height  are you sure of it wren  as certain as hydraulics can make me sir and the lesser man began drawing lines with his stick in the dust of the path in demonstration  the opportunity was irresistible and the hook from above deftly caught the band of the feathered hat of the taller man slowly and steadily drawing it up entirely unperceived by the owner on whose wig it had rested and who was bending over the dusttraced diagram in absorbed attention  peregrine deferred his hobgoblin laughter for success emboldened him farther  detaching the hat from his hook and depositing it safely in a fork of the tree he next cautiously let down his line and contrived to get a strong hold of one of the black locks on the top of the wig just as the wearer was observing olivers battery eh  a cupola with a light to be seen out at sea  our sailors will make another st christopher of you ha whats this  for feeling as if a branch were touching the structure on his head he had stepped forward thus favouring peregrines manoeuvres so that the wig dangled in the air suddenly disclosing the bare skull of a very dark man with such marked features that it needed not the gentlemens outcry to show the boy who was the victim of his mischief  what imp is there cried the king spying up into the tree while his attendant drew his sword how now as peregrine half climbed half tumbled down bringing hat and wig with him and whether by design or accident fell at his feet  will nothing content you but royal game he continued laughing as sir christopher wren helped him to resume his wig  why what a shrimp it is a mere goblin sprite  whats thy name master wag  peregrine oakshott so please you the boy answered raising himself with a face scared indeed but retaining its queer impishness  sir i never guessed  young rogue have you our licence to waylay our loyal subjects demanded the king with an affected fierceness  know you not tis rank treason to discrown our sacred majesty far more to dishevel or destroy our locks  why  i might behead you on the spot  to his great amazement the boy with an eager face and clasped hands exclaimed o sir  oh please your majesty do so  do so exclaimed the king astounded  didst hear what i said  yes sir  you said it was a beheading matter and im willing sir  of all the petitions that ever were made to me this is the strangest exclaimed charles  an urchin like this weary of life what next  so with a wink to his companions peregrine oakshott we condemn thee for high treason against our most sacred majestys beaver and periwig and sentence thee to die by having thine head severed from thy body  kneel down open thy collar bare thy neck ay so lay thy neck across that bough  killigrew do thy duty  to the general surprise the boy complied with all these directions never flinching nor showing sign of fear except that his lips were set and his cheek whitened  as he knelt with closed eyes the flat cold blade descended on his neck the tension relaxed and he sank  hold cried the king  it is gone too far  he has surely not carried out the jest by dying on our hands  no no sir said wren after a moments alarm he has only swooned  has any one here a flask of wine to revive him  several gentlemen had come up and as peregrine stirred some wine was held to his lips and he presently asked in a faint voice is this fairyland  not yet my lad said charles whatever it may be when wrens work is done  the boy opened his eyes and as he beheld the same face and the too familiar sky and trees he sighed heavily and said then it is all the same  o sir would you but have cut off my head in good earnest i might be at home again  home what means the elf  an elf  that is what they say i amchanged in the cradle said peregrine incited to confidence by the goodnatured eyes and i thought if i were close on death mine own people might take me home and bring back the right one  he really believes it exclaimed charles much diverted  tell me good master elf who is thy father i mean not my brother oberon but him of the right one as thou sayst  mr robert oakshott of oakwood sir said peregrine  a sturdy squire of the country party said the king  i am much minded to secure the lad for an elfin page he added aside to killigrew  theres a fund of excellent humour and drollery in those queer eyes of his  so sir hobgoblin if you are proof against cold steel i know not what is to be done with you  get you back and devise some other mode of finding your way home to fairyland  peregrine said not a word of his adventure so that the surprise of his family was the greater when overtures were made through sir christopher wren for his appointment as a royal page  i would as soon send my son at once to be a page to beelzebub returned major oakshott  and though sir christopher did not return the answer exactly in those terms he would not say that the puritan major did not judge rightly    chapter iii the fairy king   shes turned her right and round about    and thrice she blew on a grassgreen horn and she sware by the moon and the stars above    that shed gar me rue the day i was born  old ballad of alison cross  dr woodfords parish was portchester where stood the fine old royal castle at present ungarrisoned and partly dismantled in the recent troubles on a chalk peninsula a spur from portsdown projecting above the alluvial flats and even into the harbour whose waves at high tide laved the walls  the church and churchyard were within the ample circuit of the fortifications about two furlongs distant from the main building where rose the mighty norman keep above the inner court with a gate tower at this date only inhabited by an old soldier as porter with his family  a massive square tower at each angle of the huge wall likewise defied decay  it was on midsummer eve that nearly about sundown dr woodford was summoned by the severe illness of the gatekeepers old father and his sisterinlaw went with him to attempt what her skill could accomplish for the old mans relief  they were detained there till the sun had long set though the air saturated with his redness was full of soft twilight while the moon scarcely past the full was just high enough to silver the quiet sea and throw the shadow of the battlements and towers on the sward whitened with dew  after the close atmosphere of the sickroom the freshness was welcome and mrs woodford once a friend of katherine phillips the matchless orinda had an eye and a soul to appreciate the beauty and she even murmured the lines of il penseroso as she leant on the arm of her brotherinlaw who in his turn thought of homer  suddenly as they stood in the shadow they were aware of a small slight fantastic figure in the midst of the grassgrown court where there was a large green mushroom circle or fairy ring  on the borders of this ring it paused with an air of disappointment  then entering it stood still took off the hat whose lopsided appearance had given so strange an outline and bowed four times in opposite directions when as the face was turned towards the spectators invisible in the dark shadow the lady recognised peregrine oakshott  she pressed the doctors arm and they both stood still watching the boy bathing his hand in the dew and washing his face with it then kneeling on one knee and clasping his hands as he cried aloud in a piteous chant  fairy mother fairy mother  oh come come and take me home  my very life is sore to me  they all hate me  my brothers and the servants every one of them  and my father and tutor say i am possessed with an evil spirit and i am beaten daily and more than daily  i can never never get a good word from living soul  this is the second seven years and midsummer night  oh bring the other back again  im weary im weary  good elves good elves take me home  fairy mother  come come come  shutting his eyes he seemed to be in a state of intense expectation  tears filled mrs woodfords eyes  the doctor moved forward but no sooner did the boy become conscious of human presence than he started up and fled wildly towards a postern door but no sooner had he disappeared in the shadow than there was a cry and a fall  poor child exclaimed dr woodford he has fallen down the steps to the vault  it is a dangerous pitfall  they both hurried to the place and found the boy lying on the steps leading down to the vault but motionless and when they succeeded in lifting him up he was quite unconscious having evidently struck his head against the mouth of the vault  we must carry him home between us said mrs woodford  that will be better than rousing miles gateward and making a coil  dr woodford however took the entire weight which he declared to be very slight  no one would think the poor child fourteen years old he observed yet did he not speak of a second seven  true said mrs woodford he was born after the great fire of london which as i have good cause to know was in the year 66  there was still little sign of revival about the boy when he had been carried into the parsonage undressed and laid in the doctors own bed only a few moans when he was handled and on his thin sharp features there was a piteous look of sadness entirely unlike his ordinary expression of malignant fun and which went to the kind hearts of the doctor and mrs woodford  after exhausting their own remedies as soon as the early daylight was available dr woodford called up a couple of servants and sent one into portsmouth for a surgeon and another to oakwood to the parents  the doctor was the first to arrive though not till the morning was well advanced  he found that three ribs were broken against the edge of the stone step and the head severely injured and having had sufficient experience in the navy to be a reasonably safe practitioner he did nothing worse than bleed the patient and declared that absolute rest was the only hope of recovery  he was being regaled with cold roast pig and ale when major oakshott rode up to the door  four horses were dragging the great lumbering coach over portsdown hill but he had gone on before to thank dr and mrs woodford for their care of his unfortunate son and to make preparations for his transport home under the care of his wifes own woman who was coming in the coach in the stead of the invalid lady  nay sir  master brent here has a word to say to that matter replied the doctor  truly sir i have said the surgeon in his present state it is as much as your sons life is worth to move him  be that as it may seem to man he is in the hand of heaven and he ought to be at home whether for life or death  for death it will assuredly be sir if he be jolted and shaken along the portsdown roadsyea i question whether you would get him to oakwood alive said brent with naval roughness  indeed sir added mrs woodford mrs oakshott may be assured of my giving him as tender care as though he were mine own son  i am beholden to you madam said the major i know your kindliness of heart but in good sooth the unhappy and rebellious lad merits chastisement rather than pity since what should he be doing at this distance from home where he was shut up for his misdemeanours save fleeing like the prodigal of the parable or else planning another of his malicious pranks as i greatly fear on you or your daughter madam  if so he hath fallen into the pit that he made for others  the impulse was to tell what had occurred but the surgeons presence and the dread of making all worse for the poor boy checked both the hosts and mrs woodford only declared that since the day of the apology he had never molested her or her little girl  still said the major it is not possible to leave him in a strangers house where at any moment the evil spirit that is in him may break forth  come and see him and judge said dr woodford  when the father beheld the deathly face and motionless form stern as he was he was greatly shocked  his heavy tread caused a moan and when he said what perry how now there was a painful shrinking and twitching which the surgeon greeted as evidence of returning animation but which made him almost drag the major out of the room for fear of immediate consequences  major oakshott and still more the servant who had arrived in the coach and come upstairs could not but be convinced that removal was not to be thought of  the maid was moreover too necessary to her mistress to be left to undertake the nursing much to her masters regret but to the joy of mrs woodford who felt certain that by far the best chance for the poor boy was in his entire separation from all associations with the home where he had evidently suffered so much  there was perhaps nothing except the pageship at court that could have gone more against major oakshotts principles than to leave his son in the house of a prelatical minister but alternative there was none and he could only express how much he was beholden to the dr and mrs woodford  all their desire was that he would remain at a distance for during the long and weary watch they had to keep over the halfconscious lad the sound of a voice or even a horses tread from oakwood occasioned moans and restlessness  the major rode over or sent his sons or a servant daily to inquire during the first fortnight except on the sundays and on each of these the patient made a step towards improvement  at first he lay in a dull deathlike stupor only groaning if disturbed but by and by there was a babbling murmur of words and soon the sound of his brothers loud voice at the door demanding from the saddle how it went today with peregrine caused a shriek of terror and such a fit of trembling that mrs woodford had to go out and make a personal request that oliver would never again speak under the window  to her great relief when the balance between life and death had decidedly turned the inquiries became less frequent and could often be forestalled by sending messengers to oakwood  the boy usually lay still all day in the darkened room only showing pain at light or noise but at night he often talked and rambled a good deal  sometimes it was greek or latin sometimes whole chapters of scripture either denunciating portions or genealogies from the first book of chronicles the polysyllabic names pouring from his mouth whenever he was particularly oppressed or suffering so that when mrs woodford had with some difficulty made out what they were she concluded that they had been set as tasks of penance  at other times peregrine talked as if he absolutely believed himself in fairyland accepting a strawberry or cherry as elfin food promising a tester in annes shoe when she helped to change his pillow or conversing in the style of puck or robin goodfellow on intended pranks  often he fancied himself the lubber fiend resting at the fire his hairy strength and watching for cockcrow as the signal for flinging outofdoors  it was wonderful how in the grim and strict puritanical household he could have imbibed so much fairy lore but he must have eagerly assimilated and recollected whatever he heard holding them as tidings from his true kith and kin and indeed when he was running on thus mrs woodford sometimes felt a certain awe and chill as of the preternatural and could hardly believe that he belonged to ordinary human nature  either she or the doctor always took the nightwatch after the talking mood set in for they could not judge of the effect it might have on any of the servants  indeed they sometimes doubted whether this were not the beginning of permanent insanity as the delusion seemed to strengthen with symptoms of recovery  then said dr woodford heaven help the poor lad  for sad indeed was the lot in those days of even the most harmless lunatic  yet said the lady i scarcely think anything can be worse than what he undergoes at home  when i hear the terror and misery of his voice i doubt whether we did him any true kindness by hindering his father from killing him outright by the shaking of his old coach  nay sister we strove to do our duty though it may be we have taken on ourselves a further charge    chapter iv imp or no imp   but wist i of a woman bold    who thrice my brow durst sign i might regain my mortal mould    as fair a form as thine  scott  at last came a wakening with intelligence in the eyes  in the summer morning light that streamed through the chinks of the shutters mrs woodford perceived the glance of inquiry and when she brought some cool drink a rational though feeble voice asked those first questions who and where  i am mrs woodford my dear child  you remember me at winchester you are at portchester  you fell down and hurt yourself but you are getting better  she was grieved to see the look of utter disappointment and weariness that overspread the features and the boy hardly spoke again all day  there was much drowsiness but also depression and more than once mrs woodford detected tears but at other times he received her attentions with smiles and looks of wondering gratitude as though ordinary kindness and solicitude were so new to him that he did not know what to make of them and perhaps was afraid of breaking a happy dream by saying too much  the surgeon saw him and declared him so much better that he might soon be taken home recommending his sitting up for a little while as a first stage  peregrine however seemed far from being cheered and showed himself so unwilling to undergo the fatigue of being dressed even when good dr woodford had brought up his own large chairthe only approach to an easy one in the housethat the proposal was dropped and he was left in peace for the rest of the day  in the evening mrs woodford was sitting by the window letting her needlework drop as the light faded and just beginning to doze when her repose was broken by a voice saying madam  yes peregrine  come near i pray  will you tell no one  no what is it  in so low a tone that she had to bend over him  do you know how the papists cross themselves  yes i have seen the queens confessor and some of the ladies make the sign  dear lady you have been very good to me  if you would only cross me thrice and not be afraid  they could not hurt you  who  what do you mean she asked for fairy lore had not become a popular study but comprehension came when he said in an awe stricken voice you know what i am  i know there have been old wives tales about you my poor boy but surely you do not believe them yourself  ah if you will not believe them there is no hope  i might have known  you were so good to me and he hid his face  she took his unwilling hand and said be you what you will my poor child i am sorry for you for i see you are very unhappy  come tell me all  nay then you would be like the rest said peregrine and i could not bear that and he wrung her hand  perhaps not she said gently for i know that a story is afloat that you were changed in your cradle and that there are folk ignorant enough to believe it  they all know it he said impressively  my mother and brothers and all the servants  every soul knows it except my father and mr horncastle and they will never hear a word but will have it that i am possessed with a spirit of evil that is to be flogged out of me goody madge and moll owens they knew how it was at the first and would fain have forced themmine own peopleto take me home and bring the other back but my father found it out and hindered them  to save your life  much good does my life do me  every one hates or fears me  no one has a word for me  every mischance is laid on me  when the kitchen wench broke a crock it was because i looked at it  if the keeper misses a deer he swears at master perry  oliver and robert will not let me touch a thing of theirs they bait me for a mooncalf and grin when i am beaten for their doings  even my mother quakes and trembles when i come near and thinks i give her the creeps  as to my father and tutor it is ever the rod with them though i can learn my tasks far better than those jolterheads noll and robin  i never heard so many kind words in all my life as you have given me since i have been lying here  he stopped in a sort of awe for tears fell from her eyes and she kissed his forehead  will you not help me good madam he entreated  i went down to goody madge and she said there was a chance for me every seven years  the first went by but this is my fourteenth year  i had a hope when the king spoke of beheading me but he was only in jest as i might have known  then methought i would try what midsummer night in the fairy ring would do but that was in vain and now you who could cross me if you would will not believe  oh will you not make the trial  alas  peregrine supposing i could do it in good faith would you become a mere tricksy sprite a thing of the elements and yield up your hopes as a christian soul a child of god and heir of heaven  my father says i am an heir of hell  no no never she cried shuddering at his quiet way of saying it  you are flesh and blood christened and with the hope set before you  the christening came too late he said  o lady you who are so good and pitiful let my mother get back her true peregrinea straightlimbed comely dullard such as would be welcome to her she would bless and thank you and for me to be a willofthewisp or what not would be far better than the life i lead  never did i know what my mother calls peace till i lay here  ah peregrine poor lad your value for peace and for my poor kindness proves that you have a human heart and are no elf  indeed i meant to flit about and give you good dreams and keep off all that could hurt or frighten you he said earnestly  only the human soul could feel so dear boy she answered tenderly  and you really disbelievethe other he said wistfully  this is what i verily believe my child  that there were causes to make you weakly and that you may have had some palsy stroke or convulsive fit perhaps at the moment you were left alone  such would explain much of your oddness of face which made the ignorant nurses deem you changed and thus it was only your father who by gods mercy saved you from a miserable death to become as i trust a good and true man and servant of god  then answering a hopeless groan she added yes it is harder for you than for many i see that these silly servants have so nurtured you in this belief that you have never even thought it worth while to strive for goodness but supposed tricksomeness and waywardness a part of your nature  the only pleasure in life is paying folk off said peregrine with a glitter in his eye  it serves them right  and thus she said sadly you have gone on hating and spiting deeming yourself a goblin without hope or aim but now you feel that you have a christian soul you will strive with evil you will so love as to win love you will pray and conquer  my father and mr horncastle pray said peregrine bitterly  i hate it  they go on for ever past all bearing i must do somethingstand on my head pluck some ones stool away or tickle robin with a straw if i am birched the next moment  thats the goblin  yet you love the minster music  ay  father calls it rank popery  i listened many a time he never guessed hid away in the holy hole or within old bishop wykehams little house  ah peregrine could an imp of evil brook to lie hidden in the holy hole behind the very altar said mrs woodford  but i hear nick bringing in supper and i must leave you for the present  god in his mercy bless you his poor child and lead you in his ways  as she went peregrine muttered is that a prayer  it is not like fathers  she was anxious to consult her brotherinlaw on the strange mood of her patient  she found that he had heard more than he had told her of what major oakshott deemed the hopeless wickedness of his son the antics at prayers the hatred of everything good the spiteful tricks that were the family torment  no doubt much was due to the boys entire belief in his own elfship and these two good people seriously considered how to save him from himself  if we could only keep him here said mrs woodford i think we might bring him to have some faith and love in god and man  you could dear sister said the doctor smiling affectionately but major oakshott would never leave his son in our house  he abhors our principles too much and besides it is too near home all the servants have heard rumours of this cruel fable and would ascribe the least misadventure to his goblin origin  i must ride over to oakwood and endeavour to induce his father to remove him to safe and judicious keeping  some days however elapsed before dr woodford could do this and in the meantime the good lady did her best to infuse into her poor young guest the sense that he had a human soul responsible for his actions and with hope set before him and that he was not a mere frolicsome and malicious sprite the creature of unreasoning impulse  it was a matter only to be attempted by gentle hints for though reared in a strictly religious household peregrines ears seemed to have been absolutely closed partly by nursery ideas of his own exclusion from the pale of humanity partly by the harsh treatment that he was continually bringing on himself  preachings and prayers to him only meant a time of intolerable restraint usually ending in disgrace and punishment scripture and the westminster catechism contained a collection of tasks more tedious and irksome than the latin and greek grammar sunday was his worst day of the week and these repugnances as he had been taught to believe were so many proofs that he was a being beyond the power of grace  mrs woodford scrupled to leave him to any one else on this first sunday of his recovered consciousness and in hopes of keeping him quiet through fatigue she contrived that it should be the first day of his being dressed and seated in the armchair resting against cushions beside the open window whence he could watch the church goers anne in her little white cap with her book in one hand and a posy in the other tripping demurely beside her uncle stately in gown cassock and scarlet hood  peregrine could not refrain from boasting to his hostess how he had once grimaced from outside the church window at havant and at the women shrieking that the fiend was there  she would not smile and shook her head sadly so that he said i would never do so here  nor anywhere i hope  whereupon thinking better to please the churchwoman he related how when imprisoned for popping a toad into the soup he had escaped over the leads and had beaten a drum outside the barn during a discourse of the godly tinker john bunyan tramping and rattling so that all thought the troopers were come and rushed out tumbling one over the other while he yelled out his ho ho ho from the haystack where he had hidden  when you feel how kind and loving god is said mrs woodford gravely you will not like to disturb those who are doing him honour  is he kind asked peregrine  i thought he was all wrath and anger  she replied the lord is loving unto every man and his mercy is over all his works  he made no answer  if he were sullen this subsided into sleepiness and when he awoke he found the lady on her knees going through the service with her prayerbook  she encountered his wistful eyes but no remark was made though on her return from fetching him some broth she found him peeping into her book which he laid down hastily as though afraid of detection  she had to go down to the sunday dinner where according to good old custom half a dozen of the poor and aged were regaled with the parish priest and his household  there she heard inquiries and remarks showing how widely spread and deeply rooted was the notion of peregrines elfish extraction  if daddy hoskins did ask after the poor young gentleman as if he were a human being the three old dames present shook their heads and while the more bashful only groaned granny perkins demanded well now my lady do he eat and sleep like other folk  exactly granny now that hes mending in health  and dont he turn and writhe when theres prayers  mrs woodford deposed to having observed no such demonstrations  think of that now  laukadaisy  ive heard tell by my nevvy davy as is turnspit at oakood as how when theres prayers and expounding by master horncastle as is a godly man saving his reverences presence he have seen him have davymaster perry as they calls him atwisted round with his heels on the chair and his head where his heels should be and a grin on his face enough to give one a turn  did davy never see a mischievous boy fidgeting at prayers asked the doctor who was nearer than she thought  if so he has been luckier than i have been  there was a laugh out of deference to the clergyman but the old woman held to her point  begging your reverences pardon sir there be more in this than we knows  they says up at oakwood theres no peace in the place for the spite of him and when they thinks he is safe locked into his chamber there he be aclogging of the spit or changing sugar into pepper or making the stool break down under one  oh he be a strange one sir or summat worse  i have heerd him myself hollaing ho ho ho on the downs enough to make ones flesh creep  i will tell you what he is dame said the doctor gravely  he is a poor child who had a fit in his cradle and whom all around have joined in driving to folly evil and despair through your foolish superstitions  he is my guest and i will have no more said against him at my table  the village gossips might be silenced by awe of the parson but their opinion was unshaken and silas hewlett a weatherbeaten sailor with a wooden leg was bold enough to answer ay ay sir you parsons and gentlefolk dont believe naught but youve not seen what i have with my own two bodily eyes and this of course was the prelude to the history of an encounter with a mermaid which alternated with the flying dutchman and a combat with the moors as regular entertainment at the sunday meal  when mrs woodford went upstairs she was met by the servant nicolas declaring that she might get whom she would to wait on that there mooncalf he would not go neist the spiteful thing and exhibiting a swollen finger stung by a dead wasp which peregrine had cunningly disposed on the edge of his empty plate  she soothed the mans wrath and healed his wound as best she might ere returning to her patient who looked at her with an impish grin on his lips and yet human deprecation in his eyes  feeling unprepared for discussion she merely asked whether the dinner had been relished and sat down to her book but there was a grave sorrowful expression on her countenance and after an interval of lying back uneasily in his chair he exclaimed it is of no use i could not help it  it is my nature  it is the nature of many lads to be mischievous she answered but grace can cure them  therewith she began to read aloud  she had bought the pilgrims progress the first part from a hawker and she was glad to have at hand something that could hardly be condemned as frivolous or prelatical  the spell of the marvellous book fell on peregrine he listened intently and craved ever to hear more not being yet able to read without pain and dizziness  he was struck by hearing that the dream of christians adventures had visited that same tinker whose congregation his own wicked practices had broken up  he would take me for one of the hobgoblins that beset master christian  nay said mrs woodford he would say you were christian floundering in the slough of despond and deeming yourself one of its efts or tadpoles  he made no answer but on the whole behaved so well that the next day mrs woodford ventured to bring her little daughter in after having extracted a promise that there should be no tricks nor teasing a pledge honourably kept  anne did not like the prospect of the interview  oh maam dont leave me alone with him she said  do you know what he did to mistress martha browning his own cousin you know who lives at emsworth with her aunt  he put a horsehair slily round her glass of wine and tipped it over her best gray taffeta and her aunt whipped her for the stain  she never would say it was his doing and yet he goes on teasing her the same as ever though his brother oliver found it out and thrashed him for it  you know oliver is to marry mistress martha  my dear child where did you hear all this asked mrs woodford rather overwhelmed with this flood of gossip from her usually quiet daughter  lucy told me mamma  she heard it from sedley who says he does not wonder at any one serving out martha browning for she is as ugly as sin  hush hush anne  such sayings do not become a young maid  this poor lad has scarce known kindness  every ones hand has been against him and so his hand has been against every one  i want my little daughter to be brave enough not to pain and anger him by shrinking from him as if he were not like other people  we must teach him to be happy before we can teach him to be good  madam i will try said the child with a great gulp only if you would be pleased not to leave me alone with him the first time  this mrs woodford promised  at first the boy lay and looked at anne as if she were a rare curiosity brought for his examination and it took all her resolution even to a heroic exertion of childish fortitude not to flinch under the gaze of those queer eyes  however mrs woodford diverted the glances by producing a box of spillekins and in the interest of the game the children became better acquainted  over their next days game mrs woodford left them and anne became at ease since peregrine never attempted any tricks  she taught him to play at draughts the elders thinking it expedient not to doubt whether such vanities were permissible at oakwood  soon there was such merriment between them that the kind doctor said it did his heart good to hear the boys hearty natural laugh in lieu of the ho ho ho of malice or derision  they were odd conversations that used to take place between that boy and girl  the kings offer of a pageship had oozed out in the oakshott family and peregrine greatly resented the refusal which he naturally attributed to his fathers whiggery and spite at all things agreeable and he was fond of discussing his wrongs and longings with anne who from her childish point of view thought the walls of portchester and the sluggish creek a very bad exchange for her enjoyments at greenwich where she had lived during her fathers years of broken health after he had been disabled at southwold by a wound which had prevented his being knighted by the duke of york for his daring in the excitement of the critical moment a fact which mistress anne never forgot though she only knew it by hearsay as it happened a few weeks after she was born and her father always averred that he was thankful to have missed the barren and expensive honour and that the worst which had come of his exploit was the royal sponsorship to his little maid  anne had however been the pet of her fathers old friends the sea captains had played with the little evelyns under the yew hedges of says court had been taken to london to behold the lord mayors show and more than one court pageant had been sometimes at the palaces as the plaything of the ladies mary and anne of york had been more than once kissed by their father the duke and called a pretty little poppet and had even shared with them a notable game at romps with their goodnatured uncle the king when she had actually caught him at blindmansbuff  ignorant as she was of evil her old surroundings appeared to her delightful and peregrine bred in a puritan home was at fourteen not much more advanced than she was in the meaning of the vices and corruptions that he heard inveighed against in general or scriptural terms at home and was only too ready to believe that all that his father proscribed must be enchanting  thus they built castles together about brilliant lives at a court of which they knew as little as of that at timbuctoo  there was another court however of which peregrine seemed to know all the details namely that of king oberon and queen mab  how much was village lore picked up from moll owens and her kind or how much was the work of his own imagination no one could tell probably not himself certainly not anne  when he appeared on intimate terms with hip nip and skip and described catching daddy long legs to make a fence with his legs or dwelt upon a terrible fight between two armies of elves mounted on grasshoppers and crickets and armed with lances tipped with stings of bees and wasps she would exclaim is it true perry and he would wink his green eye and look at her with his yellow one till she hardly knew where she was  he would tell of his putting a hornet in a sluttish maids shoe which was credible if scarcely meriting that elfish laughter which made his auditor shrink but when he told of dancing over the mud banks with a lantern like a willofthewisp till he lured boats to get stranded or horsemen to get stuck in the hopeless mud anne never questioned the possibility but listened with wide open eyes and a restrained shudder feeling as if under a spell  that mysterious childish feeling which dreads even what common sense forbids the calmer mind to believe made her credit peregrine for the time at least with strange affinities to the underground folk and kept her under a strange fascination half attraction half repulsion which made her feel as if she must obey and follow him if he turned those eyes on her whether she were willing or not  nor did she ever tell her mother of these conversations  she had been rebuked once for repeating nurses story of the changeling and again for her shrinking from him and this was quite enough in an essentially reserved as well as proud and sensitive nature to prevent further confidences on a subject which she knew would be treated as a foolish fancy bringing both herself and her companion into trouble    chapter v peregrines home   for at a word be it understood he was always for ill and never for good  scott  a week had passed since any of the family from oakwood had come to make inquiries after the convalescent at portchester when dr woodford mounted his sleek soberpaced pad and accompanied by a groom rode over to make his report and tender his counsel to major oakshott  he arrived just as the great bell was clanging to summon the family to the midday meal since he had reckoned on the squire being more amenable as a full man especially towards a guest and he was well aware that the major was thoroughly a gentleman in behaviour even to those with whom he differed in politics and religion  accordingly there was a ready welcome at the door of the old red house which was somewhat gloomy looking being on the north side of the hill and a good deal stifled with trees  in a brief interval the doctor found himself seated beside the pale languid lady at the head of the long table placed in a large hall wainscotted with the blackest of oak which seemed to absorb into itself all the light from the windows large enough indeed but heavily mullioned and with almost as much of leading as of octagons and lozengesgreenish glassin them while the coats of arms repeated in upper portions and at the intersections of beams and rafters were not more cheerful being sable chevrons on an argent field  the crest a horse shoe was indeed azure but the blue of this and of the coats of the servingmen only deepened the thunderous effect of the black strangely however among these sadcoloured men there moved a figure entirely differently  a negro white turbaned and with his blue livery of a lighter shade of fantastic make and relieved by a great deal of white and shining silver so as to have an entirely different effect  he placed himself behind the chair of dr woodfords opposite neighbour a shrewd businesslike looking gentleman soberly but handsomely dressed with a certain foreign cut about his clothes and a cravat of rich flemish lace  he was presented to the doctor as major oakshotts brother sir peregrine  the rest of the party consisted of oliver and robert sturdy ruddy lads of fifteen and twelve and their tutor mr horncastle an elderly man who twenty years before had resigned his living because he could not bring himself to accept all the liturgy  while sir peregrine courteously relieved his sisterinlaw of the trouble of carving the gammon of bacon which accompanied the veal which her husband was helping dr woodford informed her of her sons progress towards recovery  ah she said i knew you had come to tell us that he is ready to be brought home and her tone was fretful  we are greatly beholden to you sir said the major from the bottom of the table  the boy shall be fetched home immediately  not so sir as yet i beg of you  neither his head nor his side can brook the journey for at least another week and indeed my good sister woodford will hardly know how to part with her patient  she will not long be of that mind after master perry gets to his feet again muttered the chaplain  indeed no chimed in the mother  there will be no more peace in the house when he is come back  i assure you madam said dr woodford that he has been a very good child grateful and obedient nor have i heard any complaints  your kindness or else that of mrs woodford carries you far sir answered his host  what  is my nephew and namesake so peevish a scapegrace demanded the visitor  on which anecdotes broke forth from all quarters  peregrine had greased the already slippery oak stairs had exchanged olivers careful exercise for a ribald broadsheet had filled mr horncastles pipe with gunpowder and mixed snuff with the chocolate specially prepared for the peculiar godly guest dame priscilla waller  every one had something to adduce even the servingmen behind the chairs and if oliver and robert did not add their quota it was because absolute silence at meals was the rule for nonage however the subject was evidently distasteful to the father who changed the conversation by asking his brother questions about the young prince of orange and the grand pensionary de witt  for the gentleman had been acting as english attache to the embassy at the hague whence he had come on affairs of state to london and after being knighted by charles had newly arrived at the old home which he had scarcely seen since his brothers marriage  dr woodford enjoyed his conversation and his information on foreign politics and the major though now and then protesting was evidently proud of his brother  when grace had been pronounced by the chaplain the lady withdrew to her parlour the two boys each with an obeisance and request for permission departed for an hours recreation and dr woodford intimated that he wished for some conversation with his host respecting the boy peregrine  let us discuss it here said major oakshott turning towards a small table set in the deep bay window and garnished with wine fruit and long slender glasses  good mr horncastle he added as he motioned his guest to one of the four seats is with me in all that concerns my children and i desire my brothers counsel respecting the untoward lad with whom it has pleased heaven to afflict me  when the glasses had been filled with claret dr woodford uttered a diplomatic compliment on the healthful and robust appearance of the eldest and youngest sons and asked whether any cause had been assigned for the difference between them and the intermediate brother  none sir returned the father with a sigh save the will of the almighty to visit us for our sins with a son who has thus far shown himself one of the marred vessels doomed to be broken by the potter it may be in order to humble me and prove me that this hath been laid upon me  the chaplain groaned acquiescence but there was vexation in the brothers face  sir said the doctor it is my opinion and that of my sisterin law an excellent discreet and devout woman that the poor child would give you more cause for hope if the belief had not become fixed in his mind that he is really and truly a fairy elfyes in very sootha changeling  all the auditors broke out into exclamations that it was impossible that a boy of fourteen could entertain so absurd an idea and the tutor evidently thought it a fresh proof of depravity that he should thus have tried to deceive his kind hosts  in proof that peregrine veritably believed it himself dr woodford related what he had witnessed on midsummer night mentioning how in delirium the boy had evidently believed himself in fairyland and how disappointed he had been on regaining his senses to find himself on common earth telling also of the adventure with the king which sir christopher wren had described to him but of which major oakshott was unaware though it explained the offer of the pageship  he was a good deal struck by these revelations proving misery that he had never suspected though as he said he had often pleaded why will ye revolt more and more ye will be stricken more and more  have you ever sought his confidence asked the travelled brother a question evidently scarcely understood for the reply was i have always required of my sons to speak the truth nor have they failed of late years save this unfortunate peregrine  and said sir peregrine if the unlucky lad actually supposes himself to be no human being admonitions and chastisements would naturally be vain  i cannot believe it exclaimed the major  tis true as i now remember i once came on a couple of beldames my wifes nurse and another who has since been ducked for witchcraft and found them about to flog the babe with nettles and lay him in the thorn hedge because he was a sickly child whom forsooth they took to be a changeling but i forbade the profane folly to be ever again mentioned in my household nor did i ever hear thereof again  there are a good many more things mentioned in a household brother than the master is wont to hear of remarked sir peregrine  dr woodford then begged as a personal favour for an individual examination of the family and servants on their opinion  the master was reluctant thus as he expressed it to go afooling but his brother backed the doctor up and further prevented a general assembly to put one another to shame but insisted on the witnesses being called in one by one  oliver the first summoned was beginning to be somewhat less overawed by his father than in his earlier boyhood  to the inquiry what he thought of his brother peregrine he made a tentative sort of reply that he was a strange fellow who never could keep out of disgrace  that is not the question said his father  i am almost ashamed to speak it  do younay have you ever supposed him to be a he really could not bring out the word  a changeling sir returned oliver  i do not believe so now knowing that it is impossible but as a child i always did  who durst possess you with so foolish and profane a falsehood  every one sir  i cannot recollect the time when i did not as entirely deem peregrine a changeling elf as that robin was my own brother  he believes so himself  you have never striven to disabuse him  indeed sir he would scarce have listened to me had i done go besides to tell the truth it has only been of late since i have been older and have studied more that i have come to perceive the folly of it  major oakshott groaned and bade him call robert without saying wherefore  the little fellow came in somewhat frightened and when asked the question that had been put to his elder his face lighted up and he exclaimed oh have they brought him back again  whom  our real brother sir who was carried off to fairyland  who told you so robert  he looked puzzled and said sir they all know it  molly owens that was his fostermother saw the fairies bear him off on a broomstick up the chimney  robert no lying  the boy was only restrained from tears by fear of his father and just managed to say tis what they all say and perry knows  knows muttered major oakshott in despair but the uncle drawing robin towards him extracted that perry had been seen flying out of the loft window when he had been locked uprobin had never seen it himself but the maids had often done so  moreover there was proof positive in the mark on olivers head where he had nearly killed himself by tumbling downstairs being lured by the fairies while they stole away the babe  the major could not listen with patience  a boy of that age to repeat such blasphemous nonsense he exclaimed and robert restraining with difficulty his sobs of terror was dismissed to fetch the butler  the old ironside who now appeared would not avouch his own disbelief in the identity of master peregrine being as he said a man who had studied his bible listened to godly preachers and seen the world but he had no hesitation in declaring that almost every other soul in the household believed in it as firmly as in the gospel certainly all the women and probably all the men nor was there any doubt that the young gentleman conducted himself more like a goblin than the son of pious christian parents  in effect both the clergyman and the diplomate could not help suspecting that in other company the worthy butlers disavowal of all share in the superstition might have been less absolute  after this said major oakshott with a sigh it seems useless to carry the inquiry farther  what says my sister oakshott inquired sir peregrine  she  poor soul she is too feeble to be fretted said her husband  she has never been the same woman since the fire of london and it would be vain to vex her with questions  she would be of one mind while i spoke to her and another while her women were pouring their tales into her ear  methinks i now understand why she has always seemed to shrink from this unfortunate child and to fear rather than love him  even so sir added the tutor  much is explained that i never before understood  the question is how to deal with him under this fresh light  i will so please your honour assemble the family this very night and expound to them that such superstitions are contrary to the very word of scripture  much good will that do muttered the knight  i should humbly suggest put in dr woodford that the best hope for the poor lad would be to place him where these foolish tales were unknown and he could start afresh on the same terms with other youths  there is no school in accordance with my principles said the squire gloomily  godly men who hold the faith as i do are inhibited by the powers that be from teaching in schools  and said his brother you hold these principles as more important than the causing your son to be bred up a human being instead of being pointed at and rendered hopeless as a demon  i am bound to do so said the major  surely said dr woodford some scholar might be found either here or in holland who might share your opinions and could receive the boy without incurring penalties for opening a school without license  it is a matter for prayer and consideration said major oakshott meantime reverend sir i thank you most heartily for the goodness with which you have treated my untoward son and likewise for having opened my eyes to the root of his freakishness  the doctor understood this as dismissal and asked for his horse intimating however that he would gladly keep the boy till some arrangement had been decided upon  then he rode home to tell his sisterinlaw that he had done his best and that he thought it a fortunate conjunction that the travelled brother had been present    chapter vi a relapse   a telltale in their company    they never could endure and whoso kept not secretly    their pranks was punished sure it was a just and christian deed    to pinch such black and blue oh how the commonwealth doth need    such justices as you  bishop corbett  several days passed during which there could be no doubt that peregrine oakshott knew how to behave himself not merely to grown up people but to little anne who had entirely lost her dread of him and accepted him as a playfellow  he was able to join the family meals and sit in the pleasant garden shaded by the walls of the old castle as well as by its own appletrees and looking out on the little bay in front at full tide as smooth and shining as a lake  there while anne did her task of spinning or of white seam mrs woodford would tell the children stories or read to them from the pilgrims progress a wonderful romance to both  peregrine still tamed by weakness would lie on the grass at her feet in a tranquil bliss such as he had never known before and his fairy romances to anne were becoming mitigated when one day a big coach came along the road from fareham with two boys riding beside it escorting lady archfield and mistress lucy  the lady was come to study mrs woodfords recipe for preserved cherries the young people charles lucy and their cousin sedley now at home for the summer holidays to spend an afternoon with mistress anne  great was lady archfields surprise at finding that major oakshotts crossgrained slip of a boy was still at portchester  if you were forced to take him in for very charity when he was hurt she said i should have thought you would have been rid of him as soon as he could leave his bed  the road to oakwood is too rough for broken ribs as yet said mrs woodford nor is the poor boy ready for discipline  ay i fancy that major oakshott is a bitter puritan in his own house but no discipline could be too harsh for such a boy as that according to all that i hear said her ladyship nor does he look as if much were amiss with him so far as may be judged of features so strange and writhen  he is nearly well but not yet strong and we are keeping him here till his father has decided on what is best for him  you even trust him with your little maid  and alone  i wonder at you madam  indeed my lady i have seen no harm come of it  he is gentle and kind with anne and i think she softens him  still mrs woodford would gladly not have been bound to her colander and preservingpan in her stillroom where her guests housewifely mind found great scope for inquiry and comment lasting for nearly two hours  when at length the operations were over and numerous little pots of jam tied up as specimens for the archfield family to taste at home the children were not in sight  no doubt said mrs woodford they would be playing in the castle court and the visitor accompanied her thither in some anxiety about broken walls and steps but they were not in sight nor did calls bring them  the children had gone out together anne feeling altogether at ease and natural with congenial playmates  even sedleys tortures were preferable to peregrines attentions since the first were only the tyranny of a graceless boy the other gave her an indescribable sense of strangeness from which these ordinary mundane comrades were a relief and protection  however charles and sedley rushed off to see a young colt in which they were interested and lucy in spite of her first shrinking found peregrine better company than she could have expected when he assisted in swinging her and anne by turns under the old ash tree  when the other two were seen approaching the swinging girl hastily sprang out only too well aware what sedleys method of swinging would be  then as the boys came up followed inquiries why peregrine had not joined them and jests in schoolboy taste ensued as to elf locks in the horses manes and inquiries when he had last ridden to a witchs sabbath  little anne in duty bound made her protest but this only incited charles to add his word to the teasing till lucy joined in the laugh  by and by as they loitered along they came to the doctors little boat and there was a proposal to get in and rock  lucy refused out of respect for her company attire and anne could not leave her so the two young ladies turned away with arms round each others waists lucy demonstratively rejoicing to be quit of the troublesome boys  before they had gone far an eldritch shout of laughter was responded to by a burst of furious dismay and imprecation  the boat with the two boys was drifting out to sea and peregrine capering wildly on the shore but in another instant he had vanished into the castle  anne had presence of mind enough to rush to the nearest fishermans cottage and send him out to bring them back and it was at this juncture that the two mothers arrived on the scene  there was little real danger  a rope was thrown and caught and after about half an hour of watching they were safely landed but the tide had ebbed so far that they had to take off their shoes and stockings and wade through the mud  they were openmouthed against the imp who had enticed them to rock in the boat then in one second had cut the painter bounded out and sent them adrift with his mocking ho ho ho  sedley archfield clenched his fists and gazed round wildly in search of the goblin to chastise him soundly and charles was ready to rush all over the castle in search of him  two to one cried anne and he so small you would never be so cowardly  as if he were like an honest fellow said charley  a goblin like that has his odds against a dozen of us  id teach him if i could but catch him cried sedley  i told you said anne that he would be good if you would let him alone and not plague him  now anne said charles as he sat putting on his stockings how could i stand being cast off for that hobgoblin that looks as if he had been cut out of a root of yew with a blunt knife and all crooked  i that always was your sweetheart to see you consorting with a misshapen squinting whig of a nonconformist like that  nonconformist  ill nonconform him indeed added sedley  i wish i had the wringing of his neck  now is not that hard said anne a poor lad who has been very sick and that every one baits and spurns  serve him right said sedley he shall have more of the same sauce  i think he has cast his spell on anne added charles or how can she stand up for him  my mamma bade me be kind to him  kind  i would as lief be kind to a toad put in lucy  to see you kind to him makes me sick exclaimed charles  you see what comes of it  it did not come of my kindness but of your unkindness reasoned anne  i told you so said charles  you would have been best pleased if we had been carried out to sea and drowned  anne burst into tears and disavowed any such intention and charles was protesting that he would only forgive her on condition of her never showing any kindness to peregrine again when a sudden shower of sand and pebbles descended one of them hitting sedley pretty sharply on the ear  the boys sprang up with a howl of imprecation and vengeance but no one was to be seen only ho ho ho resounded from the battlements  off they rushed headlong but the nearest door was in a square tower a good way off and when they reached it the door defied their efforts of frantic rage whilst another shower descended on them from above accompanied by the usual shout  but while they were dashing off in quest of another entrance they were met by a servant sent to summon them to return home  coach and horses were at the door and lady archfield was in haste to get them away declaring that she should not think their lives safe near that fiendish monster  considering that sedley was nearly twice as big as peregrine and charles a strong wellgrown lad this was a tribute to his preternatural powers  very unwillingly they went and if lady archfield had not kept a strict watch from her coach window they would certainly have turned back to revenge the pranks played on them  the last view of them showed sedley turning round shaking his whip and clenching his teeth in defiance  mrs woodford was greatly concerned especially as peregrine could not be found and did not appear at supper  had he run away to sea the usual course of refractory lads at portchester but for so slight a creature only half recovered it did not seem probable  it was more likely that he had gone home and that mrs woodford felt as somewhat a mortifying idea  however on looking into his chamber as she sought her own she beheld him in bed with his face turned into the pillow whether asleep or feigning slumber there was no knowing  later she heard sounds that induced her to go and look at him  he was starting moaning and babbling in his sleep  but with morning all his old nature seemed to have returned  there was a hedgehog in annes bowl of milk mrs woodfords poultry were cackling hysterically at an unfortunate kitten suspended from an apple tree and let down and drawn up among them  the three legged stool of the old waitingwoman toppled down headlong as though by the hands of puck and even on annes arms certain black and blue marks of nails were discovered and when her mother examined her on them she only cried and begged not to be made to answer  and while dr woodford was dozing in his chair as usual after the noonday dinner mrs woodford actually detected a hook suspended from a horsehair descending in the direction of his big horn spectacles and quietly moving across to frustrate the attempt she unearthed peregrine on a chair angling from behind the window curtain  she did not speak but fixed her calm eyes on him with a look of sad grave disappointment as she wound up the line  in a few seconds the boy had thrown himself at her feet rolling as if in pain and sobbing out tis all of no use  let me alone  nevertheless he obeyed the hushing gesture of her hand and held his breath as she led him out to the gardenseat where they had spent so many happy quiet hours  then he flung himself down and repeated his exclamation half piteous half defiant  leave me alone leave me alone  it has me  it is all of no use  what has you my poor child  the evil spirit  you will have it that im not one ofone of themso it must be as my father says that i am possessedthe evil spirit  i was at peace with youso happyhappier than ever i was beforeand nowthose boys  it has me againi could not help it ive even hurt hermistress anne  let me alonesend me hometo be scorned and shunned and browbeatenand as bad as everthen at least she will be safe from me  all this came out between sobs such that mrs woodford could not attempt to speak but she kept her hand on him and at last she said when he could hear her  every one of us has to fight with an evil spirit and when we are not on our guard he is but too apt to take advantage of us  the boy rather sullenly repeated that it was of no use to fight against his  indeed  nay  were you ever so much grieved before at having let him have the mastery  nobut no one ever was good to me before  yes all about you lived under a cruel error and you helped them in it  but if you had not a better nature in you my poor child you would not be happy here and thankful for what we can do for you  i was like some one else here said peregrine picking a daisy to pieces but they stirred it all up  and at home i shall be just the same as ever i was  she longed to tell him that there was hope of a change in his life but she durst not till it was more certain so she said  there was one who came to conquer the evil spirit and the evil nature and to give each one of us the power to get the victory the harder the victory the more glorious and her eyes sparkled at the thought  he caught a moments glow then fell back  for those that are chosen he said  you are chosenyou were chosen by your baptism  you have the stirrings of good within you  you can win and beat back the evil side of you in christs strength if you will ask for it and go on in his might  the boy groaned  mrs woodford knew that the great point with him would be to teach him to hope and to pray but the very name of prayer had been rendered so distasteful to him that she scarce durst press the subject by name and her heart sank at the thought of sending him home again but she was glad to be interrupted and said no more  at night however she heard sounds of moaning and stifled babbling that reminded her of his times of delirium and going into his room she found him tossing and groaning so that it was manifestly a kindness to wake him but her gentle touch occasioned a scream of terror and he started aside with open glassy eyes crying oh take me not  my dear boy  it is i  perry do you not know me  oh madam in infinite relief it is you  i thoughti thought i was in elfland and that they were paying me for the tithe to hell and he still shuddered all over  no elfno elf dear boy a christened boygods child and under his care and she began the 121st psalm  oh but i am not under his shadow  the evil one has had me again he will have me  arent those his claws  he will have me  never my child if you will cry to god for help  say this with me lord be thou my keeper  he did so and grew more quiet and she began to repeat dr kens evening hymn which had become known in manuscript in winchester it soothed him and she thought he was dropping off to sleep but no sooner did she move than he started with there it is againthe black wingsthe claws then while awake say it again  oh say it again  fold me in your prayersyou can pray  she went back to the verse and he became quiet but her next attempt to leave him caused an entreaty that she would remain nor could she quit him till the dawn happily very early was dispelling the terrors of the night and then when he had himself murmured once  let no ill dreams disturb my rest no powers of darkness me molest  he fell asleep at last with a softer look on his pinched face poor boy would that verse be his first step to prayer and deliverance from his own too real enemy    chapter vii the envoy   i then did ask of her her changeling child  midsummer nights dream  mrs woodford was too good a housewife to allow herself any extra rest on account of her vigil and she had just put her juneating appletart into the oven when anne rushed into the kitchen with the warning that there was a grand gentleman getting off his horse at the gateway and speaking to her uncleshe thought it must be peregrines uncle  mrs woodford was of the same opinion and asked where peregrine was  fast asleep in the windowseat of the parlour mother  i did not waken him for he looked so tired  that was right my little maiden said mrs woodford hastily washing her hands taking off her cooking apron letting down her black gown from its pocket holes and arranging her veillike widows coif after which in full trim for company she sallied out to the front door to avert if possible the wakening of the boy whom she wished to appear to the best advantage  she met in the garden her brotherinlaw and sir peregrine oakshott on being presented to her made such a bow as had seldom been seen in those parts as he politely said that he was the bearer of his brothers thanks for her care of his nephew  mrs woodford explained that the boy had had so bad a night that it would be well not to break his present sleep and invited the guest to walk in the garden or sit in the doctors study or in the shade of the castle wall  this last was what he preferred and there they seated themselves with a green slope before them down to the pale gray creek and the hill beyond lying in the summer sunshine  i have been long in coming hither said the knight partly on account of letters on affairs of state and partly likewise because i desired to come alone thinking that i might better understand how it is with the lad without the presence of his father or brothers  i am very glad you have so done sir  then madam i entreat of you to speak freely and tell me your opinion of him without reserve  you need not fear offence by speaking of the mode in which they have treated him at home  my poor brother has meant to do his duty but he has stood so far aloof from his sons that he has dealt with them in ignorance and their mother between sickliness and timidity is a mere prey to the folly of her gossips  so speak plainly madam i beg of you  mrs woodford did speak plainly of the boys rooted belief in his own elfish origin and how when arguing against it she had found the alternative even sadder and more hopeless how well he comported himself as long as he was treated as a human and rational being but how the taunts and jests of the young archfields had renewed all the mischief to the poor fellows own remorse and despair  sir peregrine listened with only a word of comment or question now and then like a man of the world well used to hearing all before he committed himself and the description was only just ended when the clang of the warning dinnerbell sounded and they rose but as they were passing the window of the diningparlour a shriek of annes startled them all and as they sprang forward mrs woodford first peregrines voice was heard no no anne dont be afraid  it is for me he is come i knew he would  something in a strange language was heard  a black face with round eyes and gleaming teeth might be seen bending forward  anne gave another shriek but was heard crying no no  get away sir  he is our lord christs  he is  you cant you shant have him  and anne was seen standing over peregrine who had dropped shuddering and nearly fainting on the floor while she stood valiantly up warding off the advance of him whom she took for the prince of darkness and in her excitement not at first aware of those who were come to her aid at the window  in one second the negro was saying something which his master answered and sent him off  mrs woodford had called out dont be afraid dear children tis sir peregrines black servant and the doctor foolish children  what is this nonsense  a moment or two more and they were in the room anne all trembling flying up to her mother and hiding her face against her between fright and shame at not having thought of the black servant and the while they lifted up peregrine who as he met his kind friends eyes said faintly is he gone  was it the dream again  it was your uncles blackamoor servant said mrs woodford  you woke up and no wonder you were startled  come with me both of you and make you ready for dinner  peregrine had rather collapsed than fainted for he was able to walk with her hand on his shoulder and sir peregrine understood her sign and did not attempt to accost either of the children though as the doctor took him to his chamber he expressed his admiration of the little maiden  thats the right woman he said losing herself when there is one to guard  nay sir she needs no excuse  such a spirit may well redeem a childs mistake  mrs woodford had reassured the children so that they were more than half ashamed though scarce willing to reappear when she had made peregrine wash his face and hands smooth the hair ruffled in his nap freshly tying his little cravat and the ribbons on his shoes and at his knees  to make his hair into anything but elf locks or to obliterate the bristly tuft that made him like riquet was impossible illness had made him additionally lean and sallow and his keen eyes under their black contracted brows and dark lashes showed all the more the curious variation in their tints and with an obliquity that varied according to the state of the nerves  there was a satirical mischievous cast in the mould of the face though individually the features were not amiss except for their thinness and in fact the unpleasantness of the expression had insensibly been softened during this last month and there was nothing repellent though much that was quaint in the slight figure with the indescribably onesided air and stature more befitting ten than fourteen years  what would the visitor think of him  the doctor called to him come peregrine your uncle sir peregrine oakshott has been good enough to come over to see you  peregrine had been well trained enough in that bitter school of home to make a correct bow though his feelings were betrayed by his yellow eye going almost out of sight  my namesakeyour father will not let me say my godson said sir peregrine smiling  we ought to be good friends  the boy looked up  perhaps he had never been greeted in so human a manner before and there was something confiding in the way those bony fingers of his rested a moment in his uncles clasp  and this is your little daughter madam peregrines kind playmate you may well be proud of her valour said the knight while anne made her courtesy which he in the custom of the day returned with a kiss and she who had been mortally ashamed of her terror marvelled at his praise  the pair of fowls were by this time on the table and good manners required silence on the part of the children but while sir peregrine explained that he had been appointed by his majesty as envoy to the elector of brandenburg and gave various interesting particulars of foreign life mrs woodford saw that he was keeping a quiet watch over his nephews habits at table and she was thankful that when unmoved by any wayward spirit of mischief they were quite beyond reproach  something of the refinement of his poor mothers tastes must have been inherited by peregrine for a certain daintiness of taste and habit had probably added to his discomforts in the austere not to say rude simplicity imposed upon the children of the family  when the meal was over the children were dismissed to the garden but bidden to keep within call in case sir peregrine should wish to see his nephew again  the others repaired again to the garden seat with wine and fruit but the knight begged mrs woodford not to leave them  i am satisfied he said  the boy shows gentle blood and breeding  there was cause enough for fright without cowardice and there is not what i was led to fear such uncouthness or ungainliness as should hinder me from having him with me  oh sir is that your purpose cried the lady almost as eagerly as if it had been high preferment for her own child  i had thought thereon said the envoy  there is reason that he should be my charge and my brother is like to give a ready consent since he is sorely perplexed what to do with this poor untoward slip  he would be less untoward were he happier said mrs woodford indeed sir i do not think you will repent it if and she paused  what would you say madam  if only all your honours household are absolutely ignorant of all these tales  that can well be madam  i have only one bodyservant with me this unlucky blackamoor who speaks nothing save dutch  i had already thought of leaving my grooms here and returning to london by sea and this could well be done and would cut off all channels of gossiping  the boy is the chaplain tells me quickwitted and a fair scholar for his years and i can find good schooling for him  when his head is able to bear it said mrs woodford  truly sir added the doctor you are doing a good work and i trust that the boy will requite you worthily  i tell your reverence said sir peregrine crooked stick though they term him i had ten times rather have the dealing with him than with those comely great lubbers his brothers  the question now is shall i tell him what is in store for him  i should say returned dr woodford that provided it is certain that the intention can be carried out nothing would be so good for him as hope  do you not say so sister  indeed i do she replied  i believe that he would be a very different boy if he were relieved from the misery he suffers at home and requites by mischievous pranks  i do not say he will or can be a good lad at once but if your honour can have patience with him i do believe there is that in him which can be turned to good  if he only can believe in the better nature and higher guidings and pray and not give himself up in despair  she had tears in her eyes  my good madam i can believe it all said sir peregrine  short of being supposed an elf i have gone through the same and it was not my good fathers fault that i did not loathe the very name of preaching or prayer  but i had a mother who knew how to deal with me whereas this poor childs mother i am sure believes in her secret heart that he is none of hers though she has enough sense not to dare to avow it  alas  i cannot give the boy the womans tending by which you have already wrought so much and mrs woodford remembered to have heard that his wife had died at rotterdam but i can treat him like a human being i hope indeed as a son and at any rate there will be no one to remind him of these old wives tales  i can only say that i am heartily rejoiced said mrs woodford  so peregrine was summoned and shambled up his eyes showing that he expected a trying interview and moreover with a certain twinkle of mischief or perverseness in their corners  soh my lad we ought to be better acquainted said the uncle dye know what our name means  peregrinus a vagabond responded the boy  eh  the translation may be correct but tis scarce the most complimentary  i wonder now if you like me were born on a wednesday  wednesdays child has far to go  no  i was born on a sunday and if to see goblins and oafs  nay i read it sundays child is full of grace  peregrines mouth twitched ironically but his uncle continued look you my boy what say you to fulfilling the augury of your name with me  his majesty has ordered me off again to represent the british name to the elector of brandenburg and i have a mind to carry you with me  what do you say  if any one expected peregrine to be overjoyed his demeanour was disappointing  he shuffled with his feet and after two or three ehs from his uncle he mumbled i dont care and then shrank together as one prepared for the stripe with the ridingwhip which such a rude answer merited  but his uncle had as a diplomate learnt a good deal of patience and he said ha dont care to leave home and brothers  eh  peregrines chin went down and there was no answer his hair dropped over his heavy brow  see boy this is no jest said his uncle  you are too big to be told that ill put you into my pocket and carry you off  i am in earnest  peregrine looked up and with one sudden flash surveyed his uncle his lips trembled but he did not speak  it is sudden said the knight to the other two  see boy i am not about to take you away with me now  in a week or ten days time i start for london and there we will fit you out for konigsberg or berlin and i trust we shall make a man of you and a good man your tutor tells me you have excellent parts and i mean that you shall do me credit  dr woodford could not help telling the lad that he ought to thank his uncle whereat he scowled but sir peregrine said he is not ready for that yet  wait till he feels he has something to thank me for  so peregrine was dismissed and his friends exclaimed with some wonder and annoyance that the boy who had been willing to be decapitated to put an end to his wretchedness should be so reluctant to accept such an offer but sir peregrine only laughed and said  the lad has pith in him  i like him better than if he came like a spaniel to my foot  but i will say no more till i fully have my brothers consent  no one knows what crooks there may be in folks minds  he took his leave and presently mrs woodford had a fresh surprise she found this strange boy lying flat on the grass sobbing as if his heart would break and when she tried to soothe and comfort him it was very hard to get a word from him but at last as she asked and does it grieve you so much to leave home the answer was  no no not home  what is it then  what are you sorry to leave  oh you dont know you and annethe only ones that ever were good to meand drove awayit  nay my dear boy  your uncle means to be good to you  no no  no one ever will be like you and anne  oh let me stay with you or they will have me at last  he was too much shaken in his still halfrecovered state by the events of these last days to be reasoned with  mrs woodford was afraid he would work himself into delirium and could only soothe him into a calmer state  she found from anne that the children had some vague hopes of his being allowed to remain at portchester and that this was the ground of his disappointment since he seemed to be attaching himself to them as the first who had ever touched his heart or opened to him a gleam of better things  by the next day however he was in a quieter and more reasonable state and mrs woodford was able to have a long talk with him  she represented that the difference of opinions made it almost certain that his father would never consent to his remaining under her roof and that even if this were possible portchester was far too much infected with the folly from which he had suffered so much and his uncle would take care that no one he would meet should ever hear of it  theres little good in that said the boy moodily  im a thing theyll jibe at and bait any way  i do not see that if you take pains with yourself  your uncle said you showed blood and breeding and when you are better dressed and with him no one will dare to mock his excellencys nephew depend upon it peregrine this is the fresh start that you need  if you were there  my boy you must not ask for what is impossible  you must learn to conquer in gods strength not mine  all however that passed may not here be narrated and it apparently left that wayward spirit unconvinced  nevertheless when on the second day major oakshott himself came over with his brother and informed peregrine that his uncle was good enough to undertake the charge of him and to see that he was bred up in godly ways in a protestant land free from prelacy and superstition the boy seemed reconciled to his fate  major oakshott spoke more kindly than usual to him being free from fresh irritation at his misdemeanours but even thus there was a contrast with the gentler more persuasive tones of the diplomatist and no doubt this tended to increase peregrines willingness to be thus handed over  the next question was whether he should go home first but both the uncle and the friends were averse to his remaining there amid the unavoidable gossip and chatter of the household and it was therefore decided that he should only ride over with dr woodford for an hour or two to take leave of his mother and brothers  this settled mrs woodford found him much easier to deal with  he had really through his midnight invocation of the fairies obtained an opening into a new world and he was ready to believe that with no one to twit him with being a changeling or worse he could avoid perpetual disgrace and punishment and live at peace  nor was he unwilling to promise mrs woodford to say daily and especially when tempted one or two brief collects and ejaculations which she selected to teach him as being as unlike as possible to the long extempore exercises which had made him hate the very name of prayer the doctor gave him a greek testament as being least connected with unpleasant recollections  and entreated peregrine humbly in a low voice to mrs woodford on his last sunday evening may i not have something of yours to lay hold of and remember you ifwhenthe evil spirit tries to lay hold of me again  she would fain have given him a prayerbook but she knew that would be treason to his father and with tears in her eyes and something of a pang she gave him a tiny miniature of herself which had been her husbands companion at sea and hung it round his neck with the chain of her own hair that had always held it  it will always keep my heart warm said peregrine as he hid it under his vest  there was a shade of disappointment on annes face when he showed it to her for she had almost deemed it her own  never mind anne he said i am coming back a knight like my uncle to marry you and then it will be yours again  iim not going to wed youi have another sweetheart added anne in haste lest he should think she scorned him  oh that lubberly charles archfield  no fear of him  he is promised long ago to some little babe of quality in london  you may whistle for him  so youd better wait for me  it is not true  you only say it to plague me  its as true as gospel  i heard sir philip telling one of the big black gowns one day in the close when i was sitting up in a tree overhead how they had fixed a marriage between his son and his old friends daughter who would have ever so many estates  so id give thatsnapping his fingersfor your chances of being my lady archfield in the salt mud at fareham  i shall ask lucy  it is not kind of you perry when you are just going away  come come dont cry anne  but i knew charley ever so long first and  oh yes  maids always like straight comely dull fellows i know that  but as you cant have charles archfield i mean to have you annefor i shall look to you as the only one as can ever make a good man of me  ayyour motherid wed her if i could but as i cant i mean to have you anne woodford  i dont mean to have you  i shall go to court and marry some noble earl or gentleman  why do you laugh and make that face peregrine you know my father was almost a knight  nobody is long with you without knowing that retorted peregrine but a miss is as good as a mile and you will find the earls and the lords will think so and be fain to take the crooked stick at last  mistress anne tossed her headand peregrine returned a grimace nevertheless they parted with a kiss and for some time the thought of peregrine haunted the little girl with a strange fateful feeling between aversion and attraction which wore off as a folly of her childhood with her growth in years    chapter viii the return   i think he bought his doublet in italy his round hose in france his bonnet in germany and his behaviour everywhere  merchant of venice  it was autumn but in the year 1687 when again lucy archfield and anne jacobina woodford were pacing the broad gravel walk along the south side of the nave of winchester cathedral  lucy in spite of her brocade skirt and handsome gown of blue velvet tucked up over it was still devoid of any look of distinction but was a round faced blooming cheerful maiden of that ladylike thoroughly countrified type happily frequent in english girlhood throughout all time  anne or jacobina as she tried to be called towered above her head and had never lost that tincture of courtly grace that early breeding had given her and though her skirt was of gray wool and the upper gown of cherry tabinet she wore both with an air that made them seem more choice and stylish than those of her companion while the simple braids and curls of her brown hair set off an unusually handsome face pale and clear in complexion with regular features fine arched eyebrows over clear brown eyes a short chin and a mouth of perfect outline but capable of looking very resolute  altogether she looked fit for a court atmosphere and perhaps she was not without hopes of it for dr woodford had become a royal chaplain under charles ii and was now continued in the same office and though this was a sinecure as regarded the present king yet tory and high church views were as much in the ascendant as they could be under a romanist king and there were hopes of a canonry at windsor or westminster or even higher preferment still if he were not reckoned too staunch an anglican  that mrs woodfords health had been failing for many months past would her sanguine daughter thought be remedied by being nearer the best physicians in london which had been quitted with regret  meantime lucys first experiences of wedding festivities were to be heard  for the archfield family had just returned from celebrating the marriage of the heir  long ago anne jacobina had learnt to reckon master charless pledges of affection among the sports and follies of childhood and the strange sense of disappointment and shame with which she recollected them had perhaps added to her natural reserve and made her feel it due to maidenly dignity to listen with zest to the account of the bride who was to be brought to supper at doctor woodfords that eve  she is a pretty little thing said lucy but my mother was much concerned to find her so mere a child and would not if she had seen her have consented to the marriage for two years to come except for the sake of having her in our own hands  i thought she was sixteen  barely fifteen my dear and far younger than we were at that age she cried because her woman said she must leave her old doll behind her and when my brother declared that she should have anything she liked she danced about and kissed him and made him kiss its wooden face with half the paint rubbed off  he did  oh yes  she is like a pretty fresh plaything to him and they go about together just like big towzer and little frisk at home  he is very much amused with her and she thinks him the finest possession that ever came in her way  well so he is  that is true but somehow it is scarcely like husband and wife and my mother fears that she may be sickly for she is so small and slight that it seems as if you could blow her away and so white that you would think she had no blood except when a little heat brings the purest rose colour to her cheek and that my lady says betokens weakliness  you know of course that she is an orphan her father died of a wasting consumption and her mother not long after when she was a yearling babe  it was her grandfather who was my fathers friend in the old cavalier days and wrote to propose the contract to my brother not long before his death when she was but five years old  the pity was that she was not sent to us at once for the old lord her granduncle never heeded or cared for her but left her to servants who petted her but understood nothing of care of her health or her education so that the only wonder is that she is alive or so sweet and winning as she is  she can hardly read without spelling and i had to make copies for her of alice fitzhubert to show her how to sign the book  all she knew she learnt from the old steward and only when she liked  my father laughs and is amused but my lady sighs and hopes her portion is not dearly bought  is not she to be a great heiress  not of the bulk of the landsthey go to heirs male but there is much besides enough to make charles a richer man than our father i wonder what you will think of her  my mother is longing to talk her over with mrs woodford  and my mother is longing to see my lady  i fear she is still but poorly  we think she will be much better when we get home said anne  i am sure she is stronger for she walked round the close yesterday and was scarcely tired  but tell me anne is it true that poor master oliver oakshott is dead of smallpox  quite true  poor young gentleman he was to have married that cousin of his mothers mistress martha browning living at emsworth  she came on a visit and they think she brought the infection for she sickened at once and though she had it favourably is much disfigured  master oliver caught it and died in three days and all the house were down with it  they say poor mrs oakshott forgot her ailments and went to and fro among them all  my mother would have gone to help in their need if she had been as well as she used to be  how is it with the other son  he was a personable youth enough  i saw him at the ship launch in the spring and thought both lads would fain have staid for the dance on board but for their grim old father  you saw robert but he is not the elder  what  is that shocking impish urchin whom we used to call riquet with the tuft older than he  certainly he is  he writes from time to time to my mother and seems to be doing well with his uncle  i cannot believe he would come to good  do you remember his sending my brother and cousin adrift in the boat  i think that was in great part the fault of your cousin for mocking and tormenting him  sedley archfield was a bad boy  theres no denying that  i am afraid he had good reason for running away from college  have you heard of him since  yes he has been serving with the lifeguards in scotland and mayhap he will come home and see us  my father wishes to see whether he is worthy to have a troop procured by money or favour for him and if they are recalled to the camp at november it will be an opportunity  but seewho is coming through the slype  my uncle  and who is with him  dr woodford advanced and with him a small slender figure in black as the broad hat with sable plume was doffed with a sweep on approaching the ladies a dark head and peculiar countenance appeared while the doctor said here is an old acquaintance young ladies whom i met dismounting at the white hart and have brought home with me  mr peregrine oakshott exclaimed anne feeling bound to offer in welcome a hand which he kissed after the custom of the day while lucy dropped a low and formal courtesy and being already close to the gate of the house occupied by her family took her leave till suppertime  even in the few steps before reaching home anne was able to perceive that a being very unlike the imp of seven years ago had returned though still short in stature and very slight with long dark hair hanging straight enough to suggest elflocks but his figure was well proportioned and had a finished air of high breeding and training  his riding suit was point device from the ostrich feather in his hat to the toes of his well made boots and his sword knew its place as well as did those of the gentlemen that anne remembered at the duke of yorks when she was a little child his thin marked face was the reverse of handsome but it was keen shrewd perhaps satirical and the remarkable eyes were very bright under dark eyebrows and lashes and the thin lips devoid of hair showed fine white teeth when parted by a smile of gladnessat the meetingthough he was concerned to hear that mrs woodford had been very ill all the last spring and had by no means regained her former health and even in the few words that passed it might be gathered that anne was far more hopeful than her uncle  she did indeed look greatly changed though her countenance was sweeter than ever as she rose from her seat by the fire and held out her arms to receive the newcomer with a motherly embrace while the expression of joy and affection was such as could never once have seemed likely to sit on peregrine oakshotts features  they were left together for anne had the final touches to put to the supper and dr woodford was sent for to speak to one of the cathedral staff  peregrine explained that he was on his way home his father having recalled him on his brothers death but he hoped soon to rejoin his uncle whose secretary he now was  they had been for the last few months in london and were thence to be sent on an embassy to the young czar of muscovy an expedition to which he looked forward with eager curiosity  mrs woodford hoped that all danger of infection at oakwood was at an end  there is none for me madam he said with a curious writhed smile  did you not know that they thought they were rid of me when i took the disease at seven years old and lay in the loft over the henhouse with molly owens to tend me and i believe it was thought to be fairy work that i came out of it no more unsightly than before  you are seeking for compliments peregrine you are greatly improved  crooked sticks can be pruned and trained he responded with a courteous bow  you are a travelled man  let me see how many countries have you seen  a year at berlin and konigsbergstrange places enough specially the last two among the scholars and high roofs of leyden half a year at versailles and paris another year at turin whence back for another half year to wait on old king louis then to the hague and the last three months at court  not much like buying and selling cows or growing wheat on the slopes or lying out on a cold winters night to shoot a few wild fowl and i have you to thank for it my first and best friend  nay your uncle is surely your best  never would he have picked up the poor crooked stick save for you madam  moreover you gave me my talisman and he laid his hand on his breast it is your face that speaks to me and calls me back when the elf or whatever it is has got the mastery of me  somewhat startled mrs woodford would have asked what he meant but that intelligence was brought that mr oakshotts man had brought his mail so that he had to repair to his room  mrs woodford had kept up some correspondence with him for which his uncles position as envoy afforded unusual facilities and she knew that on the whole he had been a very different being from what he was at home  once indeed his uncle had written to the doctor to express his full satisfaction in the lad on whom he seemed to look like a son but from some subsequent letters she had an impression that he had got into trouble of some sort while at the university of leyden and she was afraid that she must accept the belief that the wild elfish spirit as he called it was by no means extinct in him any more she said to herself than temptation is in any human creature  the question is what is there to contend therewith  the guests were however about to assemble  the doctor in black velvet cap and stately silken cassock sash and gown sailed down to receive them and again greeted peregrine who emerged in black velvet and satin delicate muslin cravat and cuffs dainty silk stockings and rosetted shoes in a style such as made the far taller and handsomer charles archfield in spite of gay scarlet coat embroidered flowery vest rich laced cravat and thick shining brown curls look a mere big schoolboy almost bumpkinlike in contrast however no one did look at anything but the little creature who could just reach to hang upon that resplendent bridegrooms arm she was in glistening white brocade too stiff and cumbrous for so tiny a figure yet together with the diamonds glistening on her head and breast giving her the likeness of a fairy queen  the whiteness was almost startling for the neck and arms were like pearl in tint the hair flowing in full curls on her shoulders was like shining flax or pale silk just unwound from the cocoon and the only relief of colour was the deep blue of the eyes the delicate tint of the lips and the tender rosy flush that was called up by her presentation to her hosts by stout old sir philip in plumcoloured coat and fullbottomed wig though she did not blush half as much as the husband of nineteen in his new character  indeed had it not been for her childish prettiness her giggle would have been unpleasing to more than lady archfield who broad and matronly gave a courtesy and critical glance at peregrine before subsiding into a seat beside mrs woodford  lucy stood among a few other young people from the close watching for anne who came in trim and bright though still somewhat reddened in face and arms from her last attentions to the supperan elaborate meal on such occasions though lighter than the midday repast  there were standing pies of game lobster and oyster patties creams jellies and other confections on which sir philip and his lady highly complimented anne who had been engaged on them for at least a couple of days her mother being no longer able to assist except by advice  see daughter alice you will learn one day to build up a jelly as well as to eat it said sir philip goodhumouredly whereat the small lady pouted a little and said  bet lets me make shapes of the dough but i wont stir the pans and get to look like a turkeycock  ah ha and you have always done what you liked my little madam  of course sir and so i shall she answered drawing up her pretty little head while lady archfield gave hers a boding shake  time and life and wifehood teach lessons murmured mrs woodford in consolation and the doctor changed the subject by asking peregrine whether the ladies abroad were given to housewifery  the german dames make a great ado about their wirthschaft as they call it was the reply but as to the result  pah  i know not how we should have fared had not hans my uncles black been an excellent cook but it was in paris that we were exquisitely regaled and our maitre dhotel would discourse on ragouts and entremets till one felt as if his were the first of the sciences  so it is to a frenchman growled sir philip  french and frenchifications are all the rage nowadays but what will your father say to your science my young spark  the gesture of head and shoulder that replied had certainly been caught at paris  mrs woodford rushed into the breach asking about the princess of orange whom she had often seen as a child  a stately and sightly dame is she madam peregrine answered towering high above her little mynheer who outwardly excels her in naught save the length of nose and has the manners of a boor  the prince of orange is the hope of the country said sir philip severely  peregrines face wore a queer satirical look which provoked sir philip into saying speak up sir what dye mean  we dont understand french grins here  nor does he nor french courtesies either said peregrine  so much the better exclaimed the baronet  here the little clear voice broke in o mr oakshott if i had but known you were coming you might have brought me a french doll in the latest fashion  i should have been most happy madam returned peregrine but unfortunately i am six months from paris and besides his honour might object lest a french doll should contaminate the dutch puppets  but oh sir is it true that french dolls have real hair that will curl  dont be foolish muttered charles impatiently and she drew up her head and made an indescribably droll moue of disgust at him  supper ended the party broke up into old and young the two elder gentlemen sadly discussing politics over their tall glasses of wine the matrons talking over the wedding and lady archfields stay in london at the parlour fire and the young folk in a window waiting for the fiddler and a few more of the young people who were to join them in the dance  the archfield ladies had kissed the hand of the queen and agreed with peregrine in admiration of her beauty and grace though they did not go so far as he did especially when he declared that her eyes were as soft as mistress annes and nearly of the same exquisite brown which made the damsel blush and experience a revival of the old feeling of her childhood as if he put her under a spell  he went on to say that he had had the good fortune to pick up and restore to queen mary beatrice a gold and coral rosary which she had dropped on her way to st jamess palace from whitehall  she thanked him graciously letting him kiss her hand and asking him if he were of the true church  imagine my fathers feelings he added when she said ah but you will be ere long i give it you as a pledge  he produced the rosary handing it first to anne who admired the beautiful filigree work but it was almost snatched from her by mrs archfield who wound it twice on her tiny wrist tried to get it over her head and did everything but ask for it till her husband turning round said roughly give it back madam  we want no popish toys here  lucy put in a hasty question whether master oakshott had seen much sport and this led to a spirited description of the homely earnest of wild boar hunting under the great elector of brandenburg in contrast with the splendours of la chasse aux sangliers at fontainebleau with the green and gold uniforms the fanfares on the curled horns the ladies in their coaches forced to attend whether ill or well the very boars themselves too well bred not to conform to the sport of the great idol of france  and again he showed the diamond sleeve buttons the trophies of a sort of bazaar held at marly where the stalls were kept by the dauphin monsieur the duke of maine madame de maintenon and the rest where the purchases were winnings at ombre made not with coin but with nominal sums and other games at cards and all was given away that was not purchased  and again the levees when the kings wig was handed through the curtains on a stick  peregrines profane mimicry of the stately march of louis quatorze and the cringing obeisances of his courtiers together with their strutting majesty towards their own inferiors convulsed all with merriment and the bride shrieked out do it again  oh i shall die of laughing  it was very girlish with a silvery ring but the elder ladies looked round and the bridegroom muttered mountebank  the fiddler arrived at that moment and the young people paired off the young couple naturally together and peregrine to the surprise and perhaps discomfiture of more than one visitor securing annes hand  the young lady pupils of madame knew their steps and lucy danced correctly anne with an easy stately grace charles archfield performed his devoir seriously his little wife frisked with childish glee evidently quite untaught but peregrines light narrow feet sprang pointed themselves and bounded with trained agility set off by the tight blackness of his suit  he was like one of the grotesque figures shaped in black paper or as sir philip looking in from the diningparlour observed like a light heeled french fop  as a rule partners retained one another all the evening but little mrs archfield knew no etiquette and maybe her husband had pushed and pulled her into place a little more authoritatively than she quite approved for she shook him off and turning round to peregrine exclaimed  now i will dance with you  you do leap and hop so high and trippingly  never mind her she is only a parsons niece  madam exclaimed charles in a tone of surprised displeasure but she only nodded archly at him and said i must dance with him he can jump so high  let her have her way whispered lucy she is but a child and it will be better not to make a pother  he yielded though with visible annoyance asking anne if she would put up with a poor deserted swain and as he led her off muttering that fellows friskiness is like to be taken out of him at oakwood  meanwhile the small creature had taken possession of her chosen partner who so far as size went was far better suited to her than any of the other men present  they were dancing something original and unpremeditated with twirls and springs sweeps and bends bounds and footings just as the little ladys fancy prompted perhaps guided in some degree by her partners experience of national dances  white and black they figured about she with floating sheeny hair and glistening robes he trim and tight and jetty like fairy and imp  it was so droll and pretty that talkers and dancers alike paused to watch them in a strange fascination till at last quite breathless and pink as a moss rosebud alice dropped upon a chair near her husband  he stood grim stiff and vexed all the more because peregrine had taken her fan and was using it so as to make it wave like butterflys wings while poor charles looked as the doctor whispered to his father far more inclined to lay it about her ears  sir philip laughed heartily for both he and the doctor had been so much entranced and amused as to be far more diverted at the lads discomfiture than scandalised at the brides escapade which they viewed as childs play  perhaps however he was somewhat comforted by her later observation he is as ugly as old nick and looks like always laughing at you but i wish you could dance like him mr archfield only then you wouldnt be my dear old great big husband or so beautiful to look at  oh yes to be sure he is nothing but a skipjack such as one makes out of a chicken bone  and anne meanwhile was exclaiming to her mother oh madam how could they do such a thing  how could they make poor charley marry that foolish illmannered little creature  hush daughter you must drop that childish name said mrs woodford gravely  anne blushed  i forgot madam but i am so sorry for him  there is no reason for uneasiness my dear  she is a mere child and under such hands as lady archfield she is sure to improve  it is far better that she should be so young as it will be the more easy to mould her  i hope there is any stuff in her to be moulded sighed the maiden  my dear child returned her mother i cannot permit you to talk in this manner  yes i know mr archfield has been as a brother to you but even his sister ought not to allow herself to discuss or dwell on what she deems the shortcomings of his wife  the mother in her prudence had silenced the girl but none the less did each fall asleep with a sad and foreboding heart  she knew her child to be good and well principled but those early days of notice and petting from the young princesses of the house of york had never faded from the childish mind and although anne was dutiful cheerful and outwardly contented the mother often suspected that over the spinningwheel or embroidery frame she indulged in day dreams of heroism promotion and grandeur which might either fade away in a happy life of domestic duty or become temptations  before going away next morning peregrine entreated that mistress anne might have the queens rosary but her mother decidedly refused  it ought to be an heirloom in your family said she  he threw up his hands with one of his strange gestures    chapter ix on his travels   for satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do  isaac watts  peregrine went off in good spirits promising a visit on his return to london of which he seemed to have no doubt but no more was heard of him for ten days  at the end of that time the portsmouth carrier conveyed the following note to winchester  honoured and reverend sirseven years since your arguments and intercession induced my father to consent to what i hoped had been the rescue of me body and soul  i know not whether to ask of your goodness to make the same endeavour again  my father declares that nothing shall induce him again to let me go abroad with my uncle and persists in declaring that the compact has been broken by our visits to papist lands nor will aught that i can say persuade him that the muscovite abhors the pope quite as much as he can  he likewise deems that having unfortunately become his heir i must needs remain at home to thin the timber and watch the ploughmen and when i have besought him to let me yield my place to robert he replies that i am playing the part of esau  i have written to my uncle who has been a true father to me and would be loth to part from me for his own sake as well as mine but i know not whether he will be able to prevail and i entreat of you reverend sir to add your persuasions for i well know that it would be my perdition to remain bound where i am  commend me to mrs woodford and mistress anne  i trust that the former is in better healthi remain reverend sir your humble servant to command peregrine oakshott  given at oakwood house this 10th of october 1687  this was very bad news but dr woodford knew not how to interfere moreover being in course at the cathedral he could not absent himself long enough for an expedition to oakwood through wintry roads in short days  he could only write an encouraging letter to the poor lad and likewise one to mr horncastle who under the indulgence had a chapel of his own  the doctor had kept up the acquaintance formed by peregrines accident and had come to regard him with much esteem and as likely to exercise a wholesome influence upon his patron  nothing more was heard for a week and then came another visitor to the doctors door sir peregrine himself on his way down at considerable inconvenience to endeavour to prevail with his brother to allow him to retain his nephew in his suite  surely he said my brother had enough of camps in his youth to understand that his son will be none the worse squire for having gone a little beyond hampshire bogs and learnt what the world is made of  i cannot tell said dr woodford i have my fears that he thinks the less known of the world the better  that might answer with a heavy clod of a lad such as the poor youth who is gone and such as for his own sake and my brothers i trust the younger one is fruges consumere natus but as for this boy dulness and vacancy are precisely what would be the ruin of him let my brother keep master robert at home and give him oakwood i will provide for perry as i always promised to do  if he is wise he will accept the offer said dr woodford but tis hard to be wise for others  nothing harder sir  i would that i had gone home with perry but mine audience of his majesty was fixed for the ensuing week and my brothers summons was peremptory  i trust your honour will prevail said mrs woodford gently  you have effected a mighty change in the poor boy and i can well believe that he is as a son to you  well madam yesas sons go said the knight in a somewhat disappointing tone  she looked at him anxiously and ventured to murmur a hope so very like an inquiry and so full of solicitous hope that it actually unlocked the envoys reserve and he said ah madam you have been the best mother that the poor youth has ever had  i will speak freely to you for should i fail in overcoming my brothers prejudices you will be able to do more for him than any one else and i know you will be absolutely secret  mrs woodford sighed with forebodings of not long being able to aid any one in this world but still she listened with earnest interest and sympathy  yes madam you implanted in him that which yet may conquer his strange nature  your name is as it were a charm to conjure up his better spirit  of course she said i never durst hope that he could be tamed and under control all at once but and she paused  he has improvedvastly improved said the uncle  indeed when first i took him with me while he was still weak and moreover much overcome by seasickness while all was strange to him and he was relieved by not finding himself treated as an outcast i verily thought him meeker than other urchins and that the outcry against him was unmerited  but no sooner had we got to berlin and while i was as yet too busy to provide either masters or occupations for my young gentleman than he did indeed make me feel that i had charge of a young imp and that if i did not watch the better it might be a case of war with his spanish majesty  for would you believe it his envoys gardens joined ours and what must my young master do but sit atop of our wall making grimaces at the dons and donnas as they paced the walks and pelting them from time to time with walnuts  well i was mindful of your counsel and did not flog him nor let my chaplain do so though i know the good mans fingers itched to be at him but i reasoned with him on the harm he was doing me and would you believe it the poor lad burst into tears and implored me to give him something to do to save him from his own spirit  i set him to write out and translate a long roll of latin despatches sent up by that pedant court in hungary and i declare to you i had no more trouble with him till next he was left idle  i gave him tutors and he studied with fervour and made progress at which they were amazed  he learnt the high dutch faster than any other of my people and could soon jabber away in it with the best of the electors folk and i began to think i had a nephew who would do me no small credit  i sent him to perfect his studies at leyden but shall i confess it to you it was to find that no master nor discipline could keep him out of the riotings and quarrels of the worse sort of students  nay i found him laid by with a rapier thrust in the side from a duel for no better cause than biting his thumb at a scots law student in chapel his apology being that to sit through a dutch sermon drove him crazy  tis not that he is not trustworthy  find employment for the restless demon that is in him and all is well with him moreover he is full of wit and humour and beguiles a long journey or tedious evening at an inn better than any comrade i ever knew extracting mirth from all around even the very discomforts and searching to the quick all that is to be seen  but if left to himself the restless demon that preys on him is sure to set him to something incalculable  at turin it set him to scraping acquaintance with a capuchin friar a dirty rogue whom i would have kept on the opposite side of the street that was his graver mood but what more must he do but borrow or steal i know not how the ghastly robes of the confraternity of deaththe white garb and peaked cap with two holes for the eyes wherewith men of all degrees disguise themselves while doing the pious work of bearing the dead to the grave  none suspected him for the disguise is complete and a duke may walk unknown beside a watercarrier bearing the corpse of a cobbler  all would have been well but that at the very brink of the grave the boys fiendtis his own wordimpelled him to break forth into his wild ho ho ho with an eldritch shriek and slipping out of his cerements dash off headlong over the wall of the cemetery  he was not followed  i believe the poor body belonged to a fellow whose salvation was more than doubtful in spite of all the priests could do and that the bearers really took him for the foul fiend  it was not till a week or two after that the ring of his voice and laugh caused him to be recognised by one of the duke of savoys gentlemen happily a prudent man loth to cause a tumult against one of my suite and he told me all privately in warning  ay and when i spoke to peregrine i found him thoroughly penitent at having insulted the dead he had been unhappy ever since and had actually bestowed his last pocketpiece on the widow  he made handsome apologies in good italian which he had picked up as fast as the german to the gentleman who promised that it should go no farther and kept his word  it was the solemnity peregrine assured me that brought back all the intolerableness of the preachings at home and awoke the same demon  how long ago was this sir  about eighteen months  and has all been well since  fairly well  he has had fuller and more responsible work to do for me his turn for languages making him a most valuable secretary and in the french court really the most perilous of all to a young mans virtue he behaved himself well  it is not debauchery that he has a taste for but he must be doing something and if wholesome occupations do not stay his appetite he will be doing mischief  he brought on himself a very serious rebuke from the prince of orange churlishly and roughly given i allow but fully merited for making grimaces at his acquaintance among the young officers at a military inspection  heaven help the lad if he be left with his father whose most lively notion of innocent sport is scratching the heads of his hogs  nothing could be said in answer save earnest wishes that the knight might persuade his brother  mrs woodford wished her brotherinlaw to go with him to add force to his remonstrance but on the whole it was thought better to leave the family to themselves dr woodford only writing to major oakshott as well as to the youth himself  the result was anxiously watched for and in another week earlier in the day than mrs woodford was able to leave her room sir peregrines horses stopped at the door and as anne ascertained by a peep from the window he was only accompanied by his servants  yes he said to the doctor in his vexation one would really think that by force of eating southdown mutton my poor brother had acquired the brains of one of his own rams  i declare tis a piteous sight to see a man resolute on ruining his son and breaking his own heart all for conscience sake  say you so sir  i had hoped that the sight of what you have made of your nephew might have had some effect  all the effect it has produced is to make him more determined to take him from me  the hampshire mind abhors foreign breeding and the old cromwellian spirit thinks good manners sprung from the world and wit from the evil one  i can quite believe that peregrines courtly airs are not welcomed here i could see what our good neighbour sir philip archfield thought of them but whereas no power on earth could make the young gentleman a steadygoing clownish youth after his fathers heart methought he might prefer his present polish to impishness  so i told him but i might as well have talked to the horse block it is his duty quotha to breed his heir up in godly simplicity  simplicity is all very well to begin with but once flown it cannot be restored  and that is what my brother cannot see  well my poor boy must be left to his fate  there is no help for it and all i can hope is that you sir and the ladies will stand his friend and do what may lie in your power to make him patient and render his life less intolerable  indeed sir we will do what we can i wish that i could hope that it would be of much service  my brother has more respect for your advice than perhaps you suppose and to you madam the poor lad looks with earnest gratitude  nay even his mother reaps the benefit of the respect with which you have inspired him  peregrine treats her with a gentleness and attention such as she never knew before from her bear cubs  poor soul  i think she likes it though it somewhat perplexes her and she thinks it all french manners  there is one more favour your reverence which i scarce dare lay before you you have seen my black boy hans  he was with you at oakwood seven years ago  even so  i bought the poor fellow when a mere child from a dutch skipper who had used him scurvily and he has grown up as faithful as a very spaniel and mightily useful too not only as body servant but he can cook as well as any french maitre dhotel froth chocolate and make the best coffee i ever tasted is as honest as the day and i believe would lay down his life for peregrine or me  i shall be cruelly at a loss without him but a physician i met in london tells me it would be no better than murder to take the poor rogue to so cold a country as muscovy  i would leave him to wait on perry but they will not hear of it at oakwood  my sister inlaw wellnigh had a fit every time she looked at him when i was there before and i found moreover that even when i was at hand the servants jeered at the poor blackamoor gave him his meals apart and only the refuse of their own so that he would fare but ill if i left him to their mercy  i had thought of offering him to mr evelyn of says court who would no doubt use him well but it was peregrine who suggested that if you of your goodness would receive the poor fellow they could sometimes meet and that would cheer his heart and he really is far from a useless knave but is worth two of any servingmen i ever saw  to take an additional manservant was by no means such a great proposal as it would be in most houses at present  men swarmed in much larger proportion than maids in all families of condition and the doctor was wealthy enough for onemore or lessto make little difference but the question was asked as to what wages hans should receive  the knight laughed  wages poor lad what should he do with them he is but a slave i tell you  meat clothes and fire that is all he needs and i will so deal with him that he will serve you in all faithfulness and obedience  he can speak english enough to know what you bid him do but not enough for chatter with the servants  so the agreement was made and poor hans was to be sent down by the portsmouth coach together with peregrines luggage    chapter x the menagerie   the head remains unchanged within    nor altered much the face it still retains its native grin    and all its old grimace  men with contempt the brute surveyed    nor would a name bestow but women liked the motley beast    and called the thing a beau  the monkies merrick  the woodford family did not long remain at winchester  anne declared the cold to be harming her mother and became very anxious to bring her to the milder sea breezes of portchester and though mrs woodford had little expectation that any place would make much difference to her she was willing to return to the quiet and repose of her home under the castle walls beside the tranquil sea  thus they travelled back as soon as the doctors residence was ended plodding through the heavy chalk roads as well as the big horses could drag the cumbrous coach up and down the hills only halting for much needed rest at sir philip archfields red house round three sides of a quadrangle the fourth with a low wall backed by a row of poplar trees looking out on the alternate mud and sluggish waters of fareham creek but with a beautiful garden behind the house  the welcome was hearty  lady archfield at once conducted mrs woodford to her own bedroom where she was to rest and be served apart and anne disrobed her of her wraps covered her upon the bed and at her hostesss desire was explaining what refreshment would best suit her when there was a shrill voice at the door  i want mistress anne  i want to show her my clothes and jewels  coming child she is coming when she has attended to her mother responded the lady  white wine or red did you say anne and a little ginger  is she never coming was again the call and lady archfield muttering was there ever such an impatient poppet released anne who was instantly pounced upon by young mrs archfield  linking her arm into that of her visitor and thrusting lucy into the background the little heiress proceeded to her own wainscotted bedroom bare according to modern views but very luxurious according to those of the seventeenth century and with the toilette apparatus scanty indeed but of solid silver and with a lavish amount of perfumery  her own woman was in waiting to display and refold the whole wedding wardrobe brocade satin taffetas cambric valenciennes and point dalencon  anne had to admire each in detail and then to give full meed to the whole casket of jewels numerous and dazzling as befitted a constellation of heirlooms upon one small head  they were beautiful but it was wearisome to repeat vastly pretty how exquisite that becomes you very well almost mechanically when lucy was standing about all the time longing to exchange the girlish confidences that were burning to come forth  young madam as every one called her in those times when christian names were at a discount seemed to be jealous of attention to any one else and the instant she saw the guest attempt to converse with her sisterinlaw peremptorily interrupted almost as if affronted  perhaps if anne had enjoyed freedom of speech with lucy she would not have learnt as much as did her mother for the young are often more scrupulous as to confidences than their seniors who view them as still children and freely discuss their affairs among themselves  so lady archfield poured out her troubles  how her daughterinlaw refused employment and disdained instruction in needlework housewifery or any domestic art how she jangled the spinnet but would not learn music and was unoccupied fretful and exacting a burthen to herself and every one else and treating lucy as the slave of her whims and humours  as to such discipline as mothers inlaw were wont to exercise upon young wives the least restraint or contradiction provoked such a tempest of passion as to shake the tiny delicate frame to a degree that alarmed the good old matron for the consequences  her health was a continual difficulty for her constitution was very frail every imprudence cost her suffering and yet any check to her impulses as to food exertion or encountering weather was met by a spoilt childs resentment moreover her young husband and even his father always thought the ladies were hard upon her and would not have her vexed and as their presence always brightened and restrained her they never understood the full amount of her petulance and waywardness and when they found her out of spirits or out of temper they charged all on her ailments or on want of consideration from her mother and sisterinlaw  poor lady archfield it was trying for her that her husband should be nearly as blind as his son  the young husband was wonderfully tender indulgent and patient with the little creature but it would not be easy to say whether the affection were not a good deal like that for his dog or his horse as something absolutely his own with which no one else had a right to interfere  it was a relief to the family that she always wanted to be out of doors with him whenever the weather permitted nay often when it was far from suitable to so fragile a being but if she came home aching and crying ever so much with chill or fatigue even if she had to keep her bed afterwards she was equally determined to rush out as soon as she was up again and as angry as ever at remonstrance  charles was gone to try a horse and as the remains of the effects of her last imprudence had prevented her accompanying him the arrival of the guests had been a welcome diversion to the monotony of the morning  he was however at home again by the time the dinnerbell summoned the younger ladies from the inspection of the trinkets and the gentlemen from the live stock all to sit round the heavy oaken table draped with the whitest of napery spun by lady archfield in her maiden days and loaded with substantial joints succeeded by delicacies manufactured by herself and lucy  as to the horse charles was fairly satisfied but that fellow young oakshott had been after him and had the refusal  dont you be outbid mr archfield exclaimed the wife  what is the matter of a few guineas to us  little fear replied charles  the old major is scarcely like to pay down twenty gold caroluses but if he should the bay is his  oh but why not offer thirty she cried  charles laughed  that would be a scurvy trick sweetheart and if peregrine be a crooked stick we need not be crooked too  i was about to ask said the doctor whether you had heard aught of that same young gentleman  i have seen him where i never desire to see him again said sir philip riding as though he would be the death of the poor hounds  nick huntsman swears that he bewitches them said charles for they always lose the scent when he is in the field but i believe tis the wry looks of him that throw them all out  and i say cried the inconsistent bride that tis all jealousy that puts the gentlemen beside themselves because none of them can dance nor make a bow nor hand a cup of chocolate nor open a gate on horseback like him  what does a man on horseback want with opening gates exclaimed charles  thats your manners sir said young madam with a laugh  whats the poor lady to do while her cavalier flies over and leaves her in the lurch  her husband did not like the general laugh and muttered you know what i mean well enough  yes so do i  to fumble at the fastening till your poor beast can bear it no longer and swerves aside and i sit waiting a good half hour before you bring down your pride enough to alight and open it  all because you would send will home for your mask  you would like to have had my poor little face one blister with the glare of sun and sea  blisters dont come at this time of the year  no nor to those who have no complexion to lose she cried with a triumphant look at the two maidens who certainly had not the lilies nor the roses that she believed herself to have though in truth her imprudences had left her paler and less pretty than at winchester  if this were the style of the matrimonial conversations anne again grieved for her old playfellow and she perceived that lucy looked uncomfortable but there was no getting a moments private conversation with her before the coach was brought round again for the completion of the journey  all that neighbourhood had a very bad reputation as the haunt of lawless characters prone to violence and though among mere smugglers there was little danger of an attack on persons well known like the woodford family they were often joined by far more desperate men from the seaport so that it was never desirable to be out of doors after dark  the journey proved to have been too much for mrs woodfords strength and for some days she was so ill that anne never left the house but she rallied again and on coming downstairs became very anxious that her daughter should not be more confined by attendance than was wholesome and insisted on every opportunity of change or amusement being taken  one day as anne was in the garden she was surprised by peregrine dashing up on horseback  you would not take the queens rosary before he said  you must now to save it  my father has smelt it out  he says it is teraphim  micahrachel what not are quoted against it  he would have smashed it into fragments but that martha browning said it would be a pretty bracelet  id sooner see it smashed than on her red fist  to think of her giving in to such vanities  but he said she might have it only to be new strung  when he was gone she said i dont really want the thing but it was hard you should lose the queens keepsake  can you bestow it safely  i said i could and brought it hither  keep it anne i pray  anne hesitated and referred it to her mother upstairs  tell him she said that we will keep it in trust for him as a royal gift  peregrine was disappointed but had to be content  a dutch vessel from the east indies had brought home sundry strange animals which were exhibited at the jolly mariner at portsmouth and thus announced on a bill printed on execrable paper brought out to portchester by some of the market people  an ellefante twice the bignesse of an ocks the trunke or probosces whereof can pick up a needle or roote up an ellum tree  also the royale tyger the same as has slaine and devoured seven yonge gentoo babes three men and two women at the township at chuttergong nie to bombay in the eastern indies  also the sacred ape worshipped by the heathen of the indies the dancing serpent which weareth spectacles and whose bite is instantly mortal with other rare fish fowle idols and the like  all to be seene at the charge of one groat per head  mrs woodford declared herself to be extremely desirous that her daughter should see and bring home an account of all these marvels and though anne had no great inclination to face the tiger with the formidable appetite she could not refuse to accompany her uncle  the jolly mariner stood in one of the foulest and narrowest of the streets of the unsavoury seaport and dr woodford sighed and fumed and wished for a good pipe of tobacco more than once as he hesitated to try to force a way for his niece through the throng round the entrance to the stableyard of the jolly mariner apparently too rough to pay respect to gown and cassock  anne clung to his arm ready to give up the struggle but a voice said allow me sir  mistress anne deign to take my arm  it was peregrine oakshott with his brother robert and she could hardly tell how in a few seconds she had been squeezed through the crowd and stood in the innyard in a comparatively free space for a groat was a prohibitory charge to the vulgar  peregrine  master oakshott  they heard an exclamation of pleasure at which peregrine shrugged his shoulders and looked expressively at anne before turning to receive the salutations of an elderly gentleman and a tall young woman very plainly but handsomely clad in mourning deeper than his own  she was of a tall gaunt angular figure and a face that never could have been handsome and now bore evident traces of smallpox in redness and pits  dr woodford knew the guardian mr browning and his ward mistress martha and mistress anne jacobina were presented to one another the former gave a goodhumoured smile as if perfectly unconscious of her own want of beauty and declared she had hoped to meet all the rest here especially mistress anne woodford of whom she had heard so much  there was just a little patronage about the tone which repelled the proud spirit that was in anne and in spite of the ordinary dread and repulsion she felt for peregrine she was naughty enough to have the feeling of a successful beauty when peregrine most manifestly turned away from the heiress in her silk and velvet to do the honours of the exhibition to the parsons niece  the elephant was fastened by the leg to a post which perhaps he could have pulled up had he thought it worth his while but he was well contented to wave his trunk about and extend its clever finger to receive contributions of cakes and apples and he was too well amused to resort to any strong measures  the tiger to annes relief proved to be only a stuffed specimen  peregrine who had seen a good many foreign animals in holland where the dutch captains were in the habit of bringing curiosities home for the delectation of their families in their lusthausen was a very amusing companion having much to tell about bird and beast while robert stood staring with open mouth  the longlegged secretary and the beautiful doves were however only stuffed but anne was much entertained at second hand with the relation of the numerous objects which on the word of a leyden merchant had been known to disappear in the former birds capacious crop and with stories of the graceful dancing of the cobra though she was not sorry that the present specimen was only visible in a bottle of arrack where his spectacled hood was scarcely apparent  presently a well known shrill young voice was heard  yes yes i know i shall swoon at that terrible tiger  oh dont  i cant come any farther  why you would come madam said charles  yes yes butoh theres a twotailed monster  i know it is the tiger  it is moving  i shall die if you take me any farther  plague upon your folly madam  it is only the elephant said a gruffer rude voice  oh it is dreadful  tis like a mountain  i cant  oh no i cant  come madam you have brought us thus far you must come on and not make fools of us all said charless voice  theres nothing to hurt you  anne understanding the distress and perplexity here turned back to the passage into the court and began persuasively to explain to little mrs archfield that the tiger was dead and only a skin and that the elephant was the mildest of beasts till she coaxed forward that small personage who had of course never really intended to turn back supported and guarded as she was by her husband and likewise by a tall glittering figure in big boots and a handsome scarlet uniform and white feather who claimed her attention as he strode into the court  ha  mistress anne and the doctor on my life  what dont you know me  master sedley archfield said the doctor welcome home sir tis a meeting of old acquaintance  you and this gentleman are both so much altered that it is no wonder if you do not recognise one another at once  no fear of mr perry oakshott not being recognised said sedley archfield holding out his hand but with a certain sneer in his rough voice that brought peregrines eyebrows together  kenspeckle enough as the fools of whigs say in scotland  are you long from scotland sir asked dr woodford by way of preventing personalities  oh ay sir these six months and more  theres not much more sport to be had since the fools of cameronians have been pretty well got under and tis no loss to be at hounslow  and oh what a fright exclaimed mrs archfield catching sight of the heiress  keep her away  she makes me ill  they were glad to divert her attention to feeding the elephant and she was coquetting a little about making up her mind to approach even the defunct tiger while she insisted on having the number of his victims counted over to her  anne asked for lucy to whom she wanted to show the pigeons but was answered that my lady wanted lucy at home over some matter of jellies and blancmanges  charles shrugged his shoulders a little and sedley grumbled to anne the little vixen sets her heart on cates that she wont lay a finger to make and poor lucy is like to be no better than a cook maid while they wont cross her for fear of her tantrums  at that instant piercing screams shriek upon shriek rang through the court and turning hastily round anne beheld a little monkey perched on mrs archfields head having apparently leapt thither from the pole to which it was chained  the keeper was not in sight being in fact employed over a sale of some commodities within  there was a general springing to the rescue  charles tried to take the creature off sedley tugged at the chain fastened to a belt round its body but the monkey held tight by the curls on the ladys forehead with its hands and crossed its legs round her neck clasping the hands so that the effect of the attempts of her husband and his cousin was only to throttle her so that she could no longer scream and was almost in a fit when on peregrine holding out a nut and speaking coaxingly in dutch the monkey unloosed its hold and with another bound was on his arm  he stood caressing and feeding it talking to it in the same tongue while it made little squeaks and chatterings evidently delighted though its mournful old mans visage still had the same piteous expression  there was something most grotesque and almost weird in the sight of peregrines queer figure toying with its odd hands which seemed to be in black gloves and the strange language he talked to it added to the uncanny effect  even the doctor felt it as he stood watching and would have muttered birds of a feather but that the words were spoken more gruffly and plainly by sedley archfield who said something about the devil and his dam which the good doctor did not choose to hear and only said to peregrine you know how to deal with the jackanapes  i have seen some at leyden sir  this is a pretty little beast  pretty  there was a recoil in horror for the creature looked to the crowd demoniacal  something the same was the sensation of charles who assisted by anne and martha had been rather carrying than leading his wife into the inn parlour where she immediately had a fit of hystericsvapours as they called itbringing all the women of the inn about her while martha and anne soothed her as best they could and he was reduced to helplessly leaning out at the bay window  when the sobs and cries subsided under cold water and essences without and strong waters within and the little lady in marthas strong arms between the matronly coaxing of the fat hostess and the kind soothings of the two young ladies had been restored to something of equanimity mistress martha laid her down and said with the utmost good humour and placidity to the young husband now ill go sir  she is better now but the sight of my face might set her off again  oh do not say so madam  we are infinitely obliged  let her thank you  but martha shook her hand and laughed turning to leave the room so that he was fain to give her his arm and escort her back to her guardian  then ensued a scream  wheres he going  mr archfield dont leave me  he is only taking mistress browning back to her guardian said anne  eh oh how can he  a hideous fright she cried  to say the truth she was rather pleased to have had such a dreadful adventure and to have made such a commotion though she protested that she must go home directly and could never bear the sight of those dreadful monsters again or she should die on the spot  but said she when the coach was at the door and anne had restored her dress to its dainty gaiety i must thank master peregrine for taking off that horrible jackanapes  small thanks to him said charles crossly  i wager it was all his doing out of mere spite  he is too good a beau ever to spite me said mrs alice her head a little on one side  then to show off what he could do with the beastsatans imp like himself  no no mr archfield pleaded anne that was impossible i saw him myself  he was with that sailorlooking man measuring the height of the secretary bird  i believe you are always looking after him grumbled charles  i cant guess what all the women see in him to be always gazing after him  because he is so charmingly ugly laughed the young wife tripping out in utter forgetfulness that she was to die if she went near the beasts again  she met peregrine half way across the yard with outstretched hands exclaiming  o mr oakshott it was so good in you to take away that nasty beast  i am glad madam to have been of use said peregrine bowing and smiling a smile that might explain something of his fascination the poor brute was only drawn as all of our kind are  he wanted to see so sweet a lady nearer  he is quite harmless  will you stroke him  see there he sits gazing after you  will you give him a cake and make friends  no no madam it cannot be it is too much grumbled charles and though alice had backed at first perhaps for the pleasure of teasing him or for that of being the centre of observation actually with all manner of pretty airs and graces she let herself be led forward lay a timid hand on the monkeys head and put a cake in its black fingers while all the time peregrine held it fast and talked dutch to it and charles archfield hardly contained his rage though anne endeavoured to argue the impossibility of peregrines having incited the attack and sedley blustered that they ought to interfere and make the fellow know the reason why however charles had sense enough to know that though he might exhale his vexation in grumbling he had no valid cause for quarrelling with young oakshott so he contented himself with black looks and grudging thanks as he was obliged to let peregrine hand his wife into her carriage amid her nods and becks and wreathed smiles  they would have taken dr woodford and his niece home in the coach but anne had an errand in the town and preferred to return by boat she wanted some oranges and turkey figs to allay her mothers constant thirst and peregrine begged permission to accompany them saying that he knew where to find the best and cheapest accordingly he took them to a tiny cellar in an alley by the boat camber where the portugal oranges certainly looked riper and were cheaper than any that anne had found before but there seemed to be an odd sort of understanding between peregrine and the withered old weatherbeaten sailor who sold them such as rather puzzled the doctor  i hope these are not contraband he said to peregrine when the oranges had been packed in the basket of the servant who followed them  peregrine shrugged his shoulders  living is hard sir  ask no questions  the doctor looked tempted to turn back with the fruit but such doubts were viewed as ultra scruples and would hardly have been entertained even by a magistrate such as sir philip archfield  it was not a time for questions and peregrine remained with them till they embarked at the point asking to be commended to mrs woodford and hoping soon to come and see both her and poor hans he left them    chapter xi proposals   hear me ye venerable core    as counsel for poor mortals that frequent pass douce wisdoms door    for glaikit follys portals i for their thoughtless careless sakes    would here propose defences their doucie tricks their black mistakes    their failings and mischances  burns  for seven years anne woodford had kept lucy archfields birthday with her and there was no refusing now though there was more and more unwillingness to leave mrs woodford whose declining state became so increasingly apparent that even the loving daughter could no longer be blind to it  the coach was sent over to fetch mistress anne to fareham and the invalid was left comfortably installed in her easychair by the parlour fire with a little table by her side holding a handbell a divided orange a glass of toast and water and the bible and prayerbook wherein lay her chief studies together with a little needlework which still amused her feeble hands  the doctor divided between his parish his study and his garden had promised to look in from time to time  presently however the door was gently tapped and on her call come in hans all one grin admitted peregrine oakshott bowing low in his foreign courteous manner and entreating her to excuse his intrusion for truly madam in your goodness is my only hope  then he knelt on one knee and kissed the hand she held out to him while desiring him to speak freely to her  nay madam i fear i shall startle you when i lay before you the only chance that can aid me to overcome the demon that is in me  my poor  call me your boy as when i was here seven years ago  let me sit at your feet as then and listen to me  indeed i will my dear boy and she laid her hand on his dark head  tell me all that is in your heart  ah dear lady that is not soon done  you and mistress anne as you well know first awoke me from my firm belief that i was none other than an elf and yet there have since been times when i have doubted whether it were not indeed the truth  nay peregrine at years of discretion you should have outgrown old wives tales  better be an elf at oncea soulless creature of the elementsthan the sport of an evil spirit doomed to perdition he bitterly exclaimed  hush hush  you know not what you are saying  i know it too well madam  there are times when i long and wish after goodnessnay when heaven seems open to meand i resolve and strive after a perfect life but again comes the wild passionate dragging as it were into all that at other moments i most loathe and abhor and i become no more my own master  ah  there was misery in his voice and he clutched the long hair on each side of his face with his hands  st paul felt the same said mrs woodford gently  who shall deliver me from the body of this death  ay ay how many times have i not groaned that forth  and so if that father at turin were right i am but as paul was when he was saul  madam is it not possible that i was never truly baptized he cried eagerly  impossible peregrine  was not mr horncastle chaplain when you were born  yes and i have heard my brother say that both he and your father held the same views as the church upon baptism  so i thought but father geronimo says that at the best it was but heretical baptism and belike hastily and ineffectually performed  put that aside peregrine  it is only a temptation and allurement  it is an allurement you know not how strong said the poor youth could i only bring myself to believe all that father geronimo does and fall down before his madonnas and saints then could i hope for a new nature and scourge away the oldhe set his teeth as he spoketill naught remains of the elf or demon be it what it will  ah peregrine scourging will not do it but grace will and that grace is indeed yours as is proved by these higher aspirations  i tell you madam that if i live on as i am doing now grace will be utterly stifled if it ever abode in me at all  every hour that i live pent in by intolerable forms and immeasurable dulness the maddening temper gains on me  nay i have had to rush out at night and swear a dozen round oaths before i could compose myself to sit down to the endless supper  ah i shock you madam but thats not the worst i am driven to do  nor the way to bring the better spirit my poor youth  oh that you would pray instead of swearing  i cannot pray at oakwood  my father and mr horncastle drive away all the prayers that ever were in me and i mean nothing even though i keep my word to you  i am glad you do that  while i know you are doing so i shall still believe the better angel will triumph  how can aught triumph but hatred and disgust where i am pinned down  listen madam and hear if good spirits have any chance  we break our fast ere the sun is up on chunks of yesterdays half dressed beef and mutton  if i am seen seeking for a morsel not half raw i am rated for dainty french tastes and the same with the sour smallest of beer  i know now what always made me illtempered as a child and i avoid it but at the expense of sneers on my french breeding even though my drink be fair water for wine look you is a sinful expense save for after dinner and frothed chocolate for a man is an invention of satan  the meal is sauced either with blame of me messages from the farmfolk or bobs exploits in the chase then my father goes his rounds on the farm and would fain have me with him to stand kneedeep in mire watching the plough or feeling each greasy and odorous old sheep in turn to see if it be ready for the knife or gloating over the bullocks or swine or exchanging auguries with thomas vokes on this or that crop  faugh  and i am told i shall never be good for a country gentleman if i contemn such matters  i say i have no mind to be a country gentleman whereby i am told of esau till i am sick of his very name  but surely you have not always to follow on this round  oh no  i may go out birding with bob who is about as lively as an old jackass or meet the country boobies for a hunt and be pointed at as the frenchman and left to ride alone or theres mine own chamber when the maids do not see fit to turn me out with their pails and besoms as they do at least twice a weeki sit there in my cloak and furs by the way i am chidden for an effeminate fop if ever i am seen in them  i would give myself to books as my uncle counselled but what think you  by ill hap bob coming in to ask some question found me studying the divina commedia of dante alighieri and hit upon one of the engravings representing the torments of purgatory  what must he do but report it and immediately a hue and cry arises that i am being corrupted with popish books  in vain do i tell them that their admirable john milton the only poet save sternhold and hopkins that my father deems not absolute pagan knew loved and borrowed from dante  all my books are turned over as ruthlessly as ever don quixotes by the curate and the barber and whatever mr horncastles erudition cannot vouch for is summarily handed over to the kitchen wench to light the fires  the best of it is that they have left me my classics as though old terence and lucan were lesser heathens than the great florentine  however i have bribed the young maid and rescued my dante and boiardo with small damage but i dare not read them save with door locked  mrs woodford could scarcely shake her head at the disobedience and she asked if there were really no other varieties  such as fencing with that lubber robert and trying to bend his stiff limbs to the noble art of lescrime  but that is after dinner work  there is the mountain of halfraw flesh to be consumed first and then my father with mr horncastle and bob discuss on what they call the newshappy if a poor rogue has been caught by tom constable stealing faggots  tis argument for a weekalmost equal to the price of a fat mutton at portsmouth  my father and the minister nod in due time over their alecup and bob and i go our ways till dark or till the house bell rings for prayers and exposition  well dear good lady i will not grieve you by telling you how often they make me wish to be again the imp devoid of every shred of selfrespect and too much inured to flogging to heed what my antics might bring on me  i am glad you have that shred of self respect i hope indeed it is some higher respect  well i can never believe that heaven meant to be served by mortal dullness  seven years have only made old horncastle blow his horn to the same note only more drearily  i can see indeed that it is a great trial to one used to the life of foreign courts and to interest in great affairs like you my poor peregrine but what can i say but to entreat you to be patient try to find interest and endeavour to win your fathers confidence so that he may accord you more liberty  did i not hear that your attention made your mothers life happier  peregrine laughed  my mother  she has never seen aught but boorishness all her life and any departure therefrom seems to her unnatural  i believe she is as much afraid of my courtesy as ever she was of my mischief and that in her secret heart she still believes me a changeling  no madam woodford there is but one way to save me from the frenzy that comes over me  your father has already been entreated to let you join your uncle  i know iti know it but if it were impossible before that discovery of dante has made it impossibilissimo as the italian would say to deal with him now  there is a better way  give me the good angel who has always counteracted the evil one  give me mistress anne  anne my anne exclaimed mrs woodford in dismay  o peregrine it cannot be  i knew that would be your first word said peregrine but verily madam i would not ask it but that i know that i should be another man with her by my side and that she would have nothing to fear from the evil that dies at her approach  ah peregrine you think so now but no man can be sure of himself with any mere human care  besides my child is not of degree to match with you  your father would justly be angered if we took advantage of your attachment to us to encourage you in an inclination he could never approve  i tell you madamyes i must tell you allmy madness and my ruin will be completed if i am left to my fathers will  i know what is hanging over me  he is only waiting till i am of ageat midsummer and the year of mourning is over for poor oliveri am sure no one mourns for him more heartily than ito bind me to martha browning if she would only bring the plague or something worse than smallpox to put an end to it at once  but that would make any such scheme all the more impossible  listen madam do but hear me  even as children the very sight of martha brownings solemn faceperegrine drew his countenance down into a portentous lengthher horror at the slightest word or sport her stiff broomstick carriage all impelled me to the most impish tricks  and nowletting alone that pockmarks have seamed her grim face till she is as ugly as alectoshe is a precisian of the precisians  i declare our household is in her eyes sinfully free  if she can hammer out a text of scripture and write her name in characters as big and gawky as herself tis as far as her education has carried her save in pickling preserving stitchery and clear starching the only arts not sinful in her eyes  if i am to have a broomstick i had rather ride off on one at once to the witches sabbath on the wartburg than be tied to one for life  i should think she would scarce accept you  theres no such hope  she has been bred up to regard one of us as her lot and she would accept me without a murmur if i were beelzebub himself horns and tail and all  why she ogles me with her gooseberry eyes already and treats me as a chattel of her own  hush hush peregrine  i cannot have you talk thus  if your father had such designs it would be unworthy of us to favour you in crossing them  nay madam he hath never expressed them as yet  only my mother and brother both refer to his purpose and if i could show myself contracted to a young lady of good birth and education he cannot gainsay it might yet save me from what i will not and cannot endure  not that such is by any means my chief and only motive  i have loved mistress anne with all my heart ever since she shone upon me like a being from a better world when i lay sick here  she has the same power of hushing the wild goblin within me as you have madam  i am another man with her as i am with you  it is my only hope  give me that hope and i shall be able to endure patiently ah what have i done  have i said too much  he had talked longer and more eagerly than would have been good for the invalid even if the topic had been less agitating and the emotion caused by this unexpected complication consternation at the difficulties she foresaw and the present difficulty of framing a reply were altogether too much for mrs woodford  she turned deadly white and gasped for breath so that peregrine in terror dashed off in search of the maids exclaiming that their mistress was in a swoon  the doctor came out of his study much distressed and in annes absence the household was almost helpless in giving the succours in which she had always been the foremost  peregrine lingered about in remorse and despair offering to fetch her or to go for the doctor and finally took the latter course thereto impelled by the angry words of the old cook an enemy of his in former days  no better no sir nor tis not your fault if ever she be  youve been and frought her nigh to death with your terrifying ways  peregrine was hampshire man enough to know that to terrify only meant to tease but he was in no mood to justify himself to old patience so he galloped off to portsmouth and only returned with the doctor to hear that madam woodford was in bed and her daughter with her  she was somewhat better but still very ill and it was plain that this was no moment for pressing his suit even had it not been time for him to return home  going to fetch the doctor might be accepted as a valid reason for missing the evening exhortation and prayer but there were mistrustful looks that galled him  annes return was more beneficial to mrs woodford than the doctors visit and the girl was still too ignorant of all that her mothers attacks of spasms and subsequent weakness implied to be as much alarmed as to depress her hopes  yet mrs woodford lying awake in the night detected that her daughter was restless and unhappy and asked what ailed her and how the visit had gone off  you do not wish me to speak of such things madam was the answer  tell me all that is in your heart my child  it all came out with the vehemence of a reserved nature when the flood is loosed  young madam had been more than usually peevish and exacting jealous perhaps at lucys being the heroine of the day and fretful over a cold which confined her to the house how she worried and harassed all around her with her whims megrims and complaints could only too well be imagined and how the entire pleasure of the day was destroyed  lucy was never allowed a minutes conversation with her friend without being interrupted by a whine and complaints of unkindness and neglect  lady archfields illusage as the young wife was pleased to call every kind of restriction was the favourite theme next to the daughterin laws own finery her ailments and her notions of the treatment befitting her  and young mr archfield himself while handing his old friend out to the carriage that had fetched her could not help confiding to her that he was nearly beside himself  his mother meant to be kind but expected too much from one so brought up and his wifewhat could be done for her  she made herself miserable here and every one else likewise  yet even if his father would consent she was utterly unfit to be mistress of a house of her own and poor charles could only utter imprecations on the guardians who could have had no idea how a young woman ought to be brought up  it was worse than an illtrained hound  mrs woodford heard what she extracted from her daughter with grief and alarm and not only for her friends  indeed my dear child she said you must prevent such confidences  they are very dangerous things respecting married people  it was all in a few moments mamma and i could not stop him  he is so unhappy and annes voice revealed tears  the more reason why you should avoid hearing what he will soon be very sorry you have heard  were he not a mere lad himself it would be as inexcusable as it is imprudent thus to speak of the troubles and annoyances that often beset the first year of wedded life  i am sorry for the poor youth who means no harm nor disloyalty and is only treating you as his old companion and playmate but he has no right thus to talk of his wife above all to a young maiden too inexperienced to counsel him and if he should attempt to do so again promise me my daughter that you will silence himif by no other means by telling him so  i promise said anne choking back her tears and lifting her head i am sure i never want to go to fareham again while that lieutenant sedley archfield is there  if those be army manners they are what i cannot endure  he is altogether mean and hateful above all when he scoffs at master oakshott  i am afraid a great many do so child and that he often gives some occasion put in mrs woodford a little uneasy that this should be the offence  he is better than sedley archfield be he what he will madam said the girl  he never pays those compliments those insolent disgusting compliments such as hethat sedley i meanwhen he found me alone in the hall and i had to keep him at bay from trying to kiss me only mr archfieldcharleycame down the stairs before he was aware and called out i will thank you to behave yourself to a lady in my fathers house  and then he sedley sneered the parsons niece with such a laugh mother i shall never get it out of my ears  as if i were not as well born as he  that is not quite the way to take it my child  i had rather you stood on your maidenly dignity and discretion than on your birth  i trust he will soon be away  i fear he will not mamma for i heard say the troop are coming down to be under the duke of berwick at portsmouth  then dear daughter it is the less mishap that you should be thus closely confined by loving attendance on me  now goodnight compose yourself to sleep and think no more of these troubles  nevertheless mother and daughter lay long awake side by side that night the daughter in all the flutter of nerves induced by offended yet flattered feelinghating the compliment yet feeling that it was a compliment to the features that she was beginning to value she was substantially a good wellprincipled maiden modest and discreet with much dignified reserve yet it was impossible that she should not have seen heads turned to look at her in portsmouth and know that she was admired above her contemporaries so that even if it brought her inconvenience it was agreeable  besides her heart was beating with pity for the archfields  the elder ones might have only themselves to blame but it was very hard for poor charles to have been blindly coupled to a being who did not know how to value him still harder that there should be blame for a confidence where neither meant any harmblame that made her blush on her pillow with indignant shame  perhaps mrs woodford divined these thoughts for she too meditated deeply on the perils of her fair young daughter and in the morning could not leave her room  in the course of the day she heard that master peregrine oakshott had been to inquire for her and was not surprised when her brotherinlaw sought an interview with her  the gulf between the hierarchy and squirearchy was sufficient for a marriage to be thought a mesalliance and it was with a smile at the folly as well as with a certain displeased pity that dr woodford mentioned the proposal so vehemently pressed upon him by peregrine oakshott for his nieces hand  poor boy said mrs woodford it is a great misfortune  you forbade him of course to speak of such a thing  i told him that i could not imagine how he could think us capable of entertaining any such proposal without his fathers consent  he seems to have hoped that to pledge himself to us might extort sanction from his father not seeing that it would be a highly improper measure and would only incense the major  all the more that the major wishes to pass on mistress martha browning to him poor fellow  he did not tell me so  mrs woodford related what he had said to her and the doctor could not but observe  the poor major his whole treatment of that unfortunate youth is as if he were resolved to drive him to distraction  but even if the major were ever so willing i doubt whether master peregrine be the husband you would choose for our little maid  assuredly not poor fellow though if she loved him as he loves herwhich happily she does noti should scarce dare to stand in the way lest she should be the appointed instrument for his good  he assured me that he had never directly addressed her  no and i trust he never will  not that she is ever like to love him although she does not shrink from him quite as much as others do  yet there is a strain of ambition in my childs nature that might make her seek the elevation  but my good brother for this and other reasons we must find another home for my poor child when i am gone  nay brother do not look at me thus you know as well as i do that i can scarcely look to see the spring come in and i would fain take this opportunity of speaking to you concerning my dear daughter  no one can be a kinder father to her than you and i would most gladly leave her to cheer and tend you but as things stand around us she can scarce remain here without a mothers watchfulness  she is guarded now by her strict attendance on my infirmity but when i am gone how will it be  she is as good and discreet a maiden as parent could wish  good and discreet as far as her knowledge and experience go but that is not enough  on the one hand there is a certain wild temper about that young master oakshott such as makes me never know what he might attempt if as he says his father should drive him to desperation and this is a lonely place with the sea close at hand  lady archfield would gladly take charge of her  mrs woodford here related what anne had said of sedleys insolence but this the doctor thought little of not quite believing in the regiment coming into the neighbourhood and mrs woodford most unwillingly was forced to mention her further unwillingness that her daughter should be made a party to the troubles caused by the silly young wife of her old playfellow  what more said the doctor holding up his hands  i never thought a discreet young maid could be such a care but i suppose that is the price we pay for her good looks  three of them eh what is it that you propose  i should like to place her in the household of some godly and kindly lady who would watch over her and probably provide for her marriage  that as you know was my own course and i was very happy in lady sandwichs family till i made the acquaintance of your dear and honoured brother and my greater happiness began  the first day that i am able i will write to some of my earlier friends such as mrs evelyn and mrs pepys and again there is mistress eleanor wall who i hear is married to sir theophilus oglethorpe and who might accept my daughter for my sake  she is a warm loving openhearted creature of irish blood and would certainly be kind to her  there was no indignity in such a plan  most ladies of rank or quality entertained one or more young women of the clerical or professional classes as companions governesses or ladies maids as the case might be  they were not classed with the servants but had their share of the society and amusements of the house and a fair chance of marriage in their own degree though the comfort of their situation varied a good deal according to the amiability of their mistress from that of a confidential friend to a white slave and souffre douleur  dr woodford had no cause to object except his own loss of his nieces society and return to bachelor life after the eight years of companionship which he had enjoyed but such complications as were induced by the presence of an attractive young girl were as he allowed beyond him and he acquiesced with a sigh in the judgment of the mother whom he had always esteemed so highly  the letters were written and in due time received kind replies mrs evelyn proposed that the young gentlewoman should come and stay with her till some situation should offer itself and lady oglethorpe a warmhearted irishwoman deeply attached to the queen declared her intention of speaking to the king or the princess anne on the first opportunity of the daughter of the brave captain woodford  there might very possibly be a nursery appointment to be had either at the cockpit or at whitehall in the course of the year  this was much more than mrs woodford had desired  she had far rather have placed her daughter immediately under some kind matronly lady in a private household but she knew that her good friend was always eager to promise to the utmost of her possible power  she did not talk much of this to her daughter only telling her that the kind ladies had promised to befriend her and find a situation for her and anne was too much shocked to find her mother actually making such arrangements to enter upon any inquiries  the perception that her mother was looking forward to passing away so soon entirely overset her she would not think about it would not admit the bare idea of the loss  only there lurked at the bottom of her heart the feeling that when the crash had come and desolation had over taken her it would be more dreary at portchester than anywhere else and there might be infinite possibilities beyond for the kings godchild almost a knights daughter  the next time that mrs woodford heard that major oakshott was at the door inquiring for her health she begged as a favour that he would come and see her  the good gentleman came upstairs treading gently in his heavy boots as one accustomed to an invalid chamber  i am sorry to see you thus madam he said as she held out her wasted hand and thanked him  did you desire spiritual consolations  there are times when our needs pass far beyond prescribed forms and ordinances  i am thankful for the prayers of good men said mrs woodford but for truths sake i must tell you that this was not foremost in my mind when i begged for this favour  he was evidently disappointed for he was producing from his pocket the little stout blackbound bible which by a dent in one of the lids bore witness of having been with him in his campaigns and perhaps halfdiplomatically as well as with a yearning for oneness of spirit she gratified him by requesting him to read and pray  with all his rigidity he was too truly pious a man for his ministrations to contain anything in which churchwoman as she was she could not join with all her heart and feel comforting but ere he was about to rise from his knees she said one prayer for your son sir  a few fervent words were spoken on behalf of the wandering sheep while tears glistened in the old mans eyes and fell fast from those of the lady and then he said ah madam have i not wrestled in prayer for my poor boy  i am sure you have sir  i know you have a deep fatherly love for him and therefore i sent to speak to you as a dying woman  and i will gladly hear you for you have always been good to him and as i confess have done him more goodif good can be called the apparent improvement in one unregeneratethan any other  except his uncle said mrs woodford  i fear it is vain to say that i think the best hope of his becoming a good and valuable man a comfort and not a sorrow to yourself would be to let him even now rejoin sir peregrine  that cannot be madam  my brother has not kept to the understanding on which i entrusted the lad to him but has carried him into worldly and debauched company such as has made the sober and godly habits of his home distasteful to him and has further taken him into popish lands where he has become infected with their abominations to a greater extent than i can yet fathom  mrs woodford sighed and felt hopeless  i see your view of the matter sir  yet may i suggest that it is hard for a young man to find wholesome occupation such as may guard him from temptation on an estate where the master is active and sufficient like yourself  protection from temptation must come from within madam replied the major but i so far agree with you that in due time when he has attained his twentyfirst year i trust he will be wedded to his cousin a virtuous and pious young maiden and will have the management of her property which is larger than my own  but ififsir the marriage were distasteful to him could it be for the happiness and welfare of either  the boy has been complaining to you  nay madam i blame you not you have ever been the boys best friend according to knowledge but he ought to know that his honour and mine are engaged  it is true that mistress martha is not a court beauty such as his eyes have unhappily learnt to admire but i am acting verily for his true good  favour is deceitful and beauty is vain  most true sir but let me say one more word  i fear i greatly fear that all young spirits brook not compulsion  that means they will not bow their stiff necks to the yoke  ah sir but on the other hand fathers provoke not your children to wrath  forgive me sir i spoke but out of true affection to your son and the fear that what may seem to him severity may not drive him to some extremity that might grieve you  no forgiveness is needed madam  i thank you for your interest in him and for your plain speaking according to your lights  i can but act according to those vouchsafed unto me  and we both agree in praying for his true good said mrs woodford  and with a mutual blessing they parted mrs woodford deeply sorry for both father and son for whom she had done what she could  it was her last interview with any one outside the house  another attack of spasms brought the end during the east winds of march so suddenly as to leave no time for farewells or last words  when she was laid to rest in the little churchyard within the castle walls no one showed such overwhelming tokens of grief as peregrine oakshott who lingered about the grave after the doctor had taken his niece home and was found lying upon it late in the evening exhausted with weeping  yet sedley archfield whose regiment had after all been sent to portsmouth reported that he had spent the very next afternoon at a cockfight ending in a carouse with various naval and military officers at a tavern not drinking but contributing to the mirth by foreign songs tricks and jests    chapter xii the one hope      theres some fearful tie between me and that spirit world which god brands with his terrors on my troubled mind  kingsley  the final blow had fallen upon anne woodford so suddenly that for the first few days she moved about as one in a dream  lady archfield came to her on the first day and showed her motherly kindness and lucy was with her as much as was possible under the exactions of young madam who was just sufficiently unwell to resent attention being paid to any other living creature  she further developed a jealousy of lucys affection for any other friend such as led to a squabble between her and her husband and made her motherinlaw unwillingly acquiesce in the expediency of annes being farther off  and indeed anne herself felt so utterly forlorn and desolate that an impatience of the place came over her  she was indeed fond of her uncle but he was much absorbed in his studies his parish and in anxious correspondence on the state of the church and was scarcely a companion to her and without her mother to engross her love and attention and cut off from the archfields as she now was there was little to counterbalance the restless feeling that london and the precincts of the court were her natural element  so she wrote her letters according to her mothers desire and waited anxiously for the replies feeling as if anything would be preferable to her present unhappiness and solitude  the answers came in due time  mrs evelyn promised to try to find a virtuous and godly lady who would be willing to receive mistress anne woodford into her family and lady oglethorpe wrote with vaguer promises of high preferment which excited annes imagination during those lonely hours that she had to spend while her strict mourning after the custom of the time secluded her from all visitors  meantime in that anxious spring of 1688 when the church of england was looking to her defences the doctor could not be much at home and when he had time to listen to private affairs he heard reports which did not please him of peregrine oakshott  that the young men in the county all abhorred his fine foreign airs was no serious evil though it might be suspected that his sharp ironical tongue had quite as much to do with their dislike as his greater refinement of manner  his father was reported to be very seriously displeased with him for he openly expressed contempt of the precise ways of the household and absented himself in a manner that could scarcely be attributed to aught but the licentious indulgences of the time and as he seldom mingled in the amusements of the young country gentlemen it was only too probable that he found a lower grade of companions in portsmouth  moreover his talk random though it might be offended all the whig opinions of his father  he talked with the dogmatism of the traveller of the glories of louis xiv and broadly avowed his views that the grandeur of the nation was best established under a king who asked no questions of people or parliament that senseless set of chattering pies as he was reported to have called the house of commons  he sang the praises of the gracious and graceful queen mary beatrice and derided the driedup orange stick as he called the hope of the protestants nor did he scruple to pronounce popery the faith of chivalrous gentlemen far preferable to the whining of sullen whiggery  no one could tell how far all this was genuine opinion or simply delight in contradiction especially of his father who was in a constant state of irritation at the son whom he could so little manage  and in the height of the wrath of the whole of the magistracy at the expulsion of their lordlieutenant the earl of gainsborough and the substitution of the young duke of berwick what must peregrine do but argue in high praise of that youth whom he had several times seen and admired  and when not a gentleman in the neighbourhood chose to greet the intruder when he arrived as governor of portsmouth peregrine actually rode in to see him and dined with him  words cannot express the majors anger and shame at such consorting with a person whom alike on account of parentage religion and education he regarded as a son of perdition  yet peregrine would only coolly reply that he knew many a protestant who would hardly compare favourably with young berwick  it was an anxious period that spring of 1688  the order to read the kings declaration of indulgence from the pulpit had come as a thunderclap upon the clergy  the english church had only known rest for twentyeight years and now by this unconstitutional assumption of prerogative she seemed about to be given up to be the prey of romanists on the one hand and nonconformists on the other though for the present the latter were so persuaded that the indulgence was merely a disguised advance of rome that they were not at all grateful expecting as mr horncastle observed only to be the last devoured and he was as much determined as was dr woodford not to announce it from his pulpit whatever might be the consequence the latter thus resigning all hopes of promotion  news letters public and private were eagerly scanned  though the diocesan bishop mew took no active part in the petition called a libel being an extremely aged man the imprisonment of ken so deeply endeared to hampshire hearts when canon of winchester and rector of brighstone and with the bloody assize and the execution of alice lisle fresh in mens memories there could not but be extreme anxiety  in the midst arrived the tidings that a son had been born to the kinga son instantly baptized by a roman catholic priest and no doubt destined by james to rivet the fetters of rome upon the kingdom destroying at once the hope of his elder sisters accession  loyal churchmen like the archfields still hoped recollecting how many infants had been born in the royal family only to die but at oakwood the major and his chaplain shook their heads and spoke of warming pans to the vehement displeasure of peregrine who was sure to respond that the queen was an angel and that the whigs credited every one with their own sly tricks  the major groaned and things seemed to have reached a pass very like open enmity between father and son though peregrine still lived at home and reports were rife that the year of mourning for his brother being expired he was as soon as he came of age to be married to mistress martha browning and have an establishment of his own at emsworth  under these circumstances it was with much satisfaction that dr woodford said to his niece  child here is an excellent offer for you  lady russell who you know has returned to live at stratton has heard you mentioned by lady mildmay  she has just married her eldest daughter and needs a companion to the other and has been told of you as able to speak french and italian and otherwise well trained  what do you not relish the proposal  why sir would not my entering such a house do you harm at court and lessen your chance of preferment  think not of that my child  besides added anne since lady oglethorpe has written it would not be fitting to engage myself elsewhere before hearing from her again  you think so anne  lady russells would be a far safer better home for you than the court  anne knew it but the thought of that widowed home depressed her it might she thought be as dull as oakwood and there would be infinite chances of preferment at court  what she said however was  it was by my mothers wish that i applied to lady oglethorpe  that is true child  yet i cannot but believe that if she had known of lady russells offer she would gladly and thankfully have accepted it  so said the secret voice within the girl herself but she did not yet yield to it  perhaps she would sir she answered if the other proposal were not made  tis a whig household though  a whig household is a safer one than a popish one answered the doctor  lady russell is by all they tell me a very saint upon earth  shall it be owned  anne thought of oakwood and was not attracted towards a saint upon earth  how soon was the answer to be given she asked  i believe she would wish you to meet her at winchester next week when if you pleased her you might return with her to stratton  the doctor hoped that lady oglethorpes application might fail but before the week was over she forwarded the definite appointment of mistress anne jacobina woodford as one of the rockers of his royal highness the prince of wales his majesty having been graciously pleased to remember her fathers services and his own sponsorship if your friends consider the office somewhat beneath you wrote lady oglethorpe it is still open to you to decline it  oh no i would certainly not decline it cried anne  i could not possibly do so could i sir  lady oglethorpe says you might returned the doctor and for my part niece i should prefer the office of a gouvernante to that of a rocker  ah but it is to a prince said anne  it is the way to something further  and what may that something further be  that is the question said her uncle  i will not control you my child for the application to this court lady was by the wish of your good mother who knew her well but i own that i should be far more at rest on your account if you were in a place of less temptation  the court is very different from what it was in the last kings time pleaded anne  in some degree it may be but on the other hand the influence which may have purified it is of the religion that i fear may be a seduction  oh no never uncle nothing could make me a papist  do not be over confident anne  those who run into temptation are apt to be left to themselves  indeed sir i cannot think that the course my mother shaped for me can be a running into temptation  well anne as i say i cannot withstand you since it was your mother who requested lady oglethorpes patronage for you though i tell you sincerely that i believe that had the two courses been set before her she would have chosen the safer and more private one  nay but dear sir still pleaded the maiden what would become of your chances of preferment if it were known that you had placed me with lord russells widow in preference to the queen  let not that weigh with you one moment child  i believe that no staunch friend of our protestant church will be preferred by his majesty nay while the archbishop and my saintly friend of bath and wells are persecuted i should be ashamed to think of promotion spurn the thought from you child  nay twas only love for you dear uncle  i know it child  i am not displeased only think it over and pray over it since the post will not go out until tomorrow  anne did think but not quite as her uncle intended  the remembrance of the goodnatured young princesses the large stately rooms the brilliant dresses the radiance of wax lights had floated before her eyes ever since her removal from chelsea to the quieter regions of winchester and she had longed to get back to them  she really loved her uncle and whatever he might say she longed to push his advancement and thought his unselfish abnegation the greater reason for working for him and in spite of knowing well that it was only a dull backstair appointment she could look to the notice of princess anne when once within her reach and further with the confidence of youth believed that she had that within her which would make her way upwards and enable her to confer promotion honour and dignity on all her friends  her uncle should be a bishop charles a peer fancy his wife being under obligations to the parsons niece lucy should have a perfect husband and an appointment should be found for poor peregrine which his father could not gainsay  it was her bounden duty not to throw away such advantages besides loyalty to her royal godfather could not permit his offer to be rejected and her mother when writing to lady oglethorpe must surely have had some such expectation  nor should she be entirely cut off from her uncle who was a royal chaplain and this was some consolation to the good doctor when he found her purpose fixed and made arrangements for her to travel up to town in company with lady worsley of gatcombe whom she was to meet at southampton on the 1st of july  meantime the doctor did his best to arm his niece against the allurements to romanism that he feared would be held out  lady oglethorpe and other friends had assured him of the matronly care of lady powys and lady strickland to guard their department from all evil but he did fear these religious influences and anne resolute to resist all perhaps not afraid of the conflict was willing to arm herself for defence and listened readily  she was no less anxious to provide for her uncles comfort in his absence and many small matters of housewifery that had stood over for some time were now to be purchased as well as a few needments for her own outfit although much was left for the counsel of her patroness in the matter of garments  accordingly her uncle rode in with her to portsmouth on a shopping expedition and as the streets of the seaport were scarcely safe for a young woman without an escort he carried a little book in his pocket wherewith he beguiled the time that she spent in the selection of his fryingpans fireirons and the like and her own gloves and kerchiefs  they dined at the ordinary at the inn and there dr woodford met his great friends mr stanbury of botley and mr worsley of gatcombe in the isle of wight who both like him were opposed to the reading of the declaration of indulgence as unconstitutional and deeply anxious as to the fate of the greatly beloved bishop of bath and wells  it was inevitable that they should fall into deep and earnest council together and when dinner was over they agreed to adjourn to the house of a friend learned in ecclesiastical law to hunt up the rights of the case leaving anne to await them in a private room at the spotted dog shown to her by the landlady  anne well knew what such a meeting betided and with a certain prevision had armed herself with some knotting wherewith she sat down in a bay window overlooking the street whence she could see marketwomen going home with empty baskets pigs being reluctantly driven down to provision ships in the harbour barrels of biscuit salt meat or beer being rolled down for the same purpose sailors in loose kneebreeches and soldiers in tall peaked caps and cross belts and officers of each service moving in different directions she sat there daydreaming feeling secure in her loneliness and presently saw a slight figure daintily clad in gray and black who catching her eye made an eager gesture doffing his plumed hat and bowing low to her  she returned his salute and thought he passed on but in another minute she was startled to find him at her side exclaiming  this is the occasion i have longed and sought for mistress anne i bless and thank the fates  i am glad to see you once more before i depart said anne holding out her hand as frankly as she could to the old playfellow whom she always thought illtreated but whom she could never meet without a certain shudder  then it is true he exclaimed  yes i am to go up with lady worsley from southampton next week  ah he cried but must that be and she felt his strange power so that she drew into herself and said haughtily  my dear mother wished me to be with her friends nor can the kings appointment be neglected though of course i am extremely grieved to go  and you are dazzled with all these gewgaws of court life no doubt  i shall not be much in the way of gewgaws just yet said anne drily  it will be dull enough in some back room of whitehall or st jamess  say you so  you will wish yourself backyou the lady of my heartmine own good angel  hear me  say but the word and your home will be mine to say nothing of your own most devoted servant  hush hush sir  i cannot hear this said anne anxiously glancing down the street in hopes of seeing her uncle approaching  nay but listen  this is my only hopemy only chancei must speakyou doom me to you know not what if you will not hear me  indeed sir i neither will nor ought  ought  ought  ought you not to save a fellowcreature from distraction and destruction  one who has loved and looked to you ever since you and that saint your mother lifted me out of the misery of my childhood  then as she looked softened he went on  you you are my one hope no one else can lift me out of the reach of the demon that has beset me even since i was born  that is profane she said the more severe for the growing attraction of repulsion  what do i care  it is true  what was i till you and your mother took pity on the wild imp  my old nurse said a change would come to me every seven years  that blessed change came just seven years ago  give me what will make a more blesseda more saving change or there will be one as much for the worse  buti could not  no you must see for yourself that i could not even if i would she faltered really pitying now and unwilling to give more pain than she could help  could not  it should be possible  i know how to bring it about give me but your promise and i will make you mineay and i will make myself as worthy of you as man can be of saintlike maid  nono  this is very wrongyou are pledged already  no such thingbelieve no such tale  my promise has never been given to that grim hag of my fathers choiceno nor should be forced from me by the rack  look you here  let me take this hand call in the woman of the house give me your word and my father will own his power to bind me to martha is at an end  oh no  it would be a sinnever  besides said anne holding her hands tightly clasped behind her in alarm lest against her will she should let them be seized and trying to find words to tell him how little she felt disposed to trust her heart and herself to one whom she might indeed pity but with a sort of shrinking as from something not quite human  perhaps he dreaded her besidesfor he cut her short  it would save ten thousand greater sins  see here are two ways before us  either give me your word your precious word go silent to london leave me to struggle it out with my father and your uncle and follow you  hope and trust will be enough to bear me through the battle without and within deafen the demon of my nature and render me patient of my intolerable life till i have conquered and can bring you home  her tongue faltered as she tried to say such a secret unsanctioned engagement would be treachery but he cut off the words  you have not heard me out  there is another way  i know those who will aid me  we can meet in early dawn be wedded in one of these churches in all secrecy and haste and i would carry you at once to my uncle who as you well know would welcome you as a daughter or better still we would to those fair lands i have scarce seen but where i could make my way with sword or pen with you to inspire me  i have the means  my uncle left this with me  speak  it is death or life to me  this last proposal was thoroughly alarming and anne retreated drawing herself to her full height and speaking with the dignity that concealed considerable terror  no indeed sir  you ought to know better than to utter such proposals  one who can make such schemes can certainly obtain no respect nor regard from the lady he addresses  let me passfor she was penned up in the bay windowi shall seek the landlady till my uncle returns  nay mistress anne do not fear me  do not drive me to utter despair  oh pardon me  nothing but utter desperation could drive me to have thus spoken but how can i help using every effort to win her whose very look and presence is bliss  nothing else soothes and calms me nothing else so silences the demon and wakens the better part of my nature  have you no pity upon a miserable wretch who will be dragged down to his doom without your helping hand  he flung himself on his knee before her and tried to grasp her hand  indeed i am sorry for you master oakshott said anne compassionate but still retreating as far as the window would let her but you are mistaken  if this power be in me which i cannot quite believeyes i see what you want to say but if i did what i know to be wrong i should lose it at once gods grace can save you without me  i will not ask you to do what you call wrong no nor to transgress any of the ties you respect you whose home is so unlike mine only tell me that i may have hope that if i deserve you i may win you that you could grant mewretched mea share of your affection  this was hardest of all mingled pity and repugnance truth and compassion strove within the maiden as well as the strange influence of those extraordinary eyes  she was almost as much afraid of herself as of her suitor  at last she managed to say i am very sorry for you i grieve from my heart for your troubles i should be very glad to hear of your welfare and anything good of you but  but buti seeit is mere frenzy in me to think the blighted elf can aspire to be aught but loathsome to any ladyonly at least tell me you love no one else  no certainly not she said as if his eyes drew it forcibly from her  then you cannot hinder me from making you my guiding starhoping that if yet i can  theres my uncle exclaimed anne in a tone of infinite relief stand up mr oakshott compose yourself  of course i cannot hinder your thinking about me if it will do you any good but there are better things to think about which would conquer evil and make you happy more effectually  he snatched her hand and kissed it nor did she withhold it since she really pitied him and knew that her uncle was near and all would soon be over  peregrine dashed away by another door as dr woodfords foot was on the stairs  i have ordered the horses he began  they told me young oakshott was here  he was but he is gone and she could not quite conceal her agitation  crimson cheeks my young mistress  ah the foolish fellow  you do not care for him i trust  no indeed poor fellow  what did you know sir  know  yes trulyand your mother likewise anne  it was one cause of her wishing to send you to safer keeping than mine seems to be  my young spark made his proposals to us both though we would not disturb your mind therewith not knowing how he would have dealt with his father nor viewing him for all he is heir to oakwood as a desirable match in himself  i am glad to see you have sense and discretion to be of the same mind my maid  i cannot but grieve for his sad condition sir replied anne but as for anything moreit would make me shudder to think of ithe is still too like robin goodfellow  thats my good girl said her uncle  and do you know child there are the best hopes for the bishops  theres a gentleman come down but now from london who says twas like a triumph as the bishops sat in their barge on the way to the tower crowds swarming along the banks begging for their blessing and they waving it with tears in their eyes  the king will be a mere madman if he dares to touch a hair of their heads  well when i was a lad bishops were sent to the tower by the people i little thought to live to see them sent thither by the king  all the way home dr woodford talked of the trial beginning perhaps to regret that his niece must go to the very focus of roman influence in england where there seemed to be little scruple as to the mode of conversion  would it be possible to alter her destination was his thought when he rose the next day but loyalty stood in the way and that very afternoon another event happened which made it evident that the poor girl must leave portchester as soon as possible  she had gone out with him to take leave of some old cottagers in the village and he finding himself detained to minister to a case of unexpected illness allowed her to go home alone for about a quarter of a mile along the white sunny road at the foot of portsdown with the castle full in view at one end and the cottage where he was at the other  many a time previously had she trodden it alone but she had not reckoned on two officers coming swaggering from a cross road down the hill one of them sedley archfield who immediately called out ha ha my pretty maid no wench goes by without paying toll and they spread their arms across the road so as to arrest her  sir said anne drawing herself up with dignity you mistake  not a whit my dear no exemption here and there was a horse laugh and an endeavour to seize her as she stepped back feeling that in quietness lay her best chance of repelling them adding  my uncle is close by  the more cause for haste and they began to close upon her  but at that moment peregrine oakshott leaping from his horse was among them with the cry  dastards insulting a lady  lady forsooth the parsons niece  in a few secondsvery long seconds to herher flying feet had brought her back to the cottage where she burst in withpardon pardon sir come quick there are swords drawn there will be bloodshed if you do not come  he obeyed the summons without further query for when all men wore swords the neighbourhood of a garrison were only too liable to such encounters outside  there was no need for her to gasp out more from the very cottage door he could see the need of haste for the swords were actually flashing and the two young men in position to fight  anne shook her head unable to do more than sign her thanks to the good woman of the cottage who offered her a seat  she leant against the door and watched as her uncle sending his voice before him called on them to desist  there was a start then each drew back and held down his weapon but with a menacing gesture on one side a shrug of the shoulders on the other which impelled the doctor to use double speed in the fear that the parting might be with a challenge reserved  he was in time to stand warning and arguing that if he pardoned the slighting words and condoned the insult to his niece no one had a right to exact vengeance and in truth whatever were his arguments he so dealt with the two young men as to force them into shaking hands before they separated though with a contemptuous look on either sidea scowl from sedley a sneer from peregrine boding ill for the future and making him sigh  ah sister sister you judged aright  would that i could have sent the maid sooner away rather than that all this ill blood should have been bred  yet i may only be sending her to greater temptation and danger  but she is a good maiden god bless her and keep her here and there now and for evermore as i trust he keepeth our good dr ken in this sore strait  the trial may even now be over  ah my child here you are  frightened were you by that rude fellow nay i believe you were almost equally terrified by him who came to the rescue  you will soon be out of their reach my dear  yes that is one great comfort in going sighed anne  one comfortyesthough she would not have stayed had the choice been given her now  and shall the thought be told that flashed over her and coloured her cheeks with a sort of shame yet of pleasure i surely must have power over men  i know mother would say it is a terrible danger one way and a great gift another  i will not misuse it but what will it bring me  or am i only a rustic beauty after all who will be nobody elsewhere  still heartily she wished that her rescuer had been any one else in the wide world  it was almost uncanny that he should have sprung out of the earth at such a moment    chapter xiii the bonfire   from eddystone to berwick bounds    from lynn to milford bay that time of slumber was as    bright and busy as the day for swift to east and swift to west    the fiery herald sped high on st michaels mount it shone    it shone on beachy head  macaulay  doctor woodford and his niece had not long reached their own door when the clatter of a horses hoofs was heard and charles archfield was seen waving his hat and shouting hurrah before he came near enough to speak  good news i see said the doctor  good news indeed  not guilty  express rode from westminster hall with the news at ten oclock this morning  all acquitted expresses could hardly get away for the hurrahing of the people hurrah hurrah hurrah cried the young man throwing up his hat while doctor woodford taking off his own gave graver deeper thanks that justice was yet in england that these noble and honoured confessors were safe and that the king had been saved from further injustice and violence to the church  we are to have a bonfire on portsdown hill added charles  they will be all round the country in the island and everywhere  my father is rid one way to spread the tidings and give orders  im going on into portsmouth to see after tar barrels  youll be there sir and you anne  there was a moments hesitation after the days encounters but he added my mother is going and my little madam and lucy  they will call for you in the coach if you will be at ryders cottage at nine oclock  it will not be dark enough to light up till ten so there will be time to get a noble pile ready  come anne tis lucys last chance of seeing youso strange as you have made yourself of late  this plea decided anne who had been on the point of declaring that she should have an excellent view from the top of the keep however not only did she long to see lucy again but the enthusiasm was contagious and there was an attraction in the centre of popular rejoicing that drew both her and her uncle nor could there be a doubt of her being sufficiently protected when among the archfield ladies  so the arrangement was accepted and then there was the cry  hark the havant bells  ay and the cosham  portsmouth is pealing out  thats alverstoke  they know it there  a salute  another  scarce loyal from the kings ships said the doctor smiling  nay tis only loyalty to rejoice that the king cant make a fool of himself  so my father says rejoined charles  and that seemed to be the mood of all england  when anne and her uncle set forth in the summer sunset light the great hill above them was dark with the multitudes thronging around the huge pyre rising in the midst  they rested for some minutes at the cottage indicated before the arrival of sir philip who rode up accompanying the coach in which his three ladies were seated and which was quite large enough to receive dr woodford and mistress anne  charles was in the throng in the midst of most of the younger gentlemen of the neighbourhood and a good many of the naval and military officers directing the arrangement of the pile  what a scene it was as seen even from the windows of the coach where the ladies remained for the multitude of sailors soldiers town and village people though all unanimous were far too tumultuous for them to venture beyond their open door especially as little mrs archfield was very far from well and nothing but her eagerness for amusement could have brought her hither and of course she could not be left  probably she knew as little of the real bearings of the case or the cause of rejoicing as did the boys who pervaded everything with their squibs and were only restrained from firing them in the faces of the horses by wholesome fear of the big whips of the coachman and outriders who stood at the horses heads  it was hardly yet dark when the match was put to the shavings and to the sound of the loud hurrahs and cries of long live the bishops  down with the pope the flame kindled crackled and leapt up while a responsive fire was seen on st catherines down in the isle of wight and northward eastward westward on every available point each new light greeted by fresh acclamations as it shone out against the summer night sky while the ships in the harbour showed their lights reflected in the sea as the sky grew darker  then came a procession of sailors and other rough folk bearing between poles a chair with a stuffed figure with a kind of tiara followed by others with scarlet hats and capes and with reiterated shouts of down with the pope these were hurled into the fire with deafening hurrahs their more gorgeous trappings being cleverly twitched off at the last moment as part of the properties for the 5th of november  little mrs archfield clapped her hands and screamed with delight as each fresh blaze shot up and chattered with all her might sometimes about some lace and perfumes which she wanted anne to procure for her in london at the sign of the flower pot sometimes grumbling at her husband having gone off to the midst of the party closest to the fire just like mr archfield always leaving her to herself but generally very well amused especially when a group of gentlemen officers and county neighbours gathered round the open door talking to the ladies within  peregrine was there with his hands in his pockets and a queer ironical smile writhing his features  he was asked if his father and brother were present  not my father he replied  he has a logical mind  martha is up here with her guardian and i am keeping out of her way and my brother is full in the thick of the fray  a bonfire is a bonfire to most folks were it to roast their grandsire  oh fie mr oakshott how you do talk laughed mrs archfield  nay but you rejoice in the escape of the good bishops put in lucy  for what asked peregrine  for refusing to say live and let live  not against letting live but against saying so unconstitutionally my young friend said dr woodford or tyrannising over our consciences  generally peregrine was more respectful to dr woodford than to any one else but there seemed to be a reckless bitterness about him on that night and he said i marvel with what face those same eight reverend seigniors will preach against the french king  sir thrust in sedley archfield i am not to hear opprobrious epithets applied to the bishops  what was the opprobrium lazily demanded peregrine and in spite of his unpopularity the laugh was with him  sedley grew more angry  you likened them to the french king  the most splendid monarch in europe said peregrine coolly  a frenchman quoth one of the young squires with withering contempt  he has that ill fortune sir said peregrine  mayhap he would be sensible of the disadvantage if he evened himself with some of my reasonable countrymen  do you mean that for an insult sir exclaimed sedley archfield striding forward  as you please said peregrine  to me it had the sound of compliment  oh la theyll fight cried mrs archfield  dont let them wheres the doctor  wheres sir philip  hush my dear said lady archfield these gentlemen would not fall out close to us  dr woodford was out of sight having been drawn into controversy with a fellowclergyman on the limits of toleration  anne looked anxiously for him but with provoking coolness peregrine presently said theres no crowd near and if you will step out the fires on the farther hills are to be seen well from the knoll hard by  he spoke chiefly to anne but even if she had not a kind of shrinking from trusting herself with him in this strange wild scene she would have been prevented by mrs archfields eager cry  oh ill come let me come  im so weary of sitting here  thank you master oakshott  lady archfields remonstrance was lost as peregrine helped the little lady out and there was nothing for it but to follow her as close as might be as she hung on her cavaliers arm chattering and now and then giving little screams of delight or alarm  lady archfield and her daughter each was instantly squired but mistress woodford a nobody was left to keep as near them as she could and gaze at the sparks of light of the beacons in the distance thinking how changed the morrow would be to her  presently a figure approached and charles archfields voice said is that you anne  did i hear my wifes voice  yes she is there  and with that imp of evil  i would his own folk had him muttered charles dashing forward with how now madam you were not to leave the coach  she laughed exultingly  ha sir see what comes of leaving me to better cavaliers while you run after your fire  i should have seen nothing but for master oakshott  come with me now said charles you ought not to be standing here in the dew  ha ha what a jealous master she said but she put her arm into his saying with a courtesy thank you master oakshott lords must be obeyed  i should have been still buried in the old coach but for you  peregrine fell back to anne  that blaze is at st helens he began  thatwhat will you not wait a moment  no no  they will want to be going home  and have you forgotten that it is only just over midsummer  this is the week of my third sevenththe moment for change  o anne make it a change for the better  say the word and the die will be cast  all is ready  come  he tried to take her hand but the vehemence of his words spoken under his breath terrified her and with a hasty no no you know not what you talk of she hastened after her friends and was glad to find herself in the safe haven of the interior of the coach  ere long they drove down the hill and at the place of parting were set down the last words in annes ears being mrs archfields injunctions not to forget the orange flowerwater at the sign of the flower pot drowning lucys tearful farewells  as they walked away in the moonlight a figure was seen in the distance  is that peregrine oakshott asked the doctor  that young man is in a desperate mood ready to put a quarrel on any one  i hope no harm will come of it    chapter xiv gathering mouseear   i heard the groans i marked the tears    i saw the wound his bosom bore  scott  after such an evening it was not easy to fall asleep and anne tossed about heated restless and uneasy feeling that to remain at home was impossible yet less satisfied about her future prospects and doubtful whether she had not done herself harm by attending last nights rejoicings and hoping that nothing would happen to reveal her presence there  she was glad that the night was not longer and resolved to take advantage of the early morning to fulfil a commission of lady oglethorpe whose elder children lewis and theophilus had the whoopingcough  mouseear namely the little sulphurcoloured hawkweed was and still is accounted a specific and anne had been requested to bring a supplya thing easily done since it grew plentifully in the court of the castle  she dressed herself in haste made some of her preparations for the journey and let herself out of the house going first for one last look at her mothers green grave in the dewy churchyard and gathering from it a daisy which she put into her bosom then in the fair morning freshness and exhilaration of the rising sun crossing the wide tiltyard among haycocks waiting to be tossed and arriving at the court within filling her basket between the churchyard and the gateway tower and keep when standing up for a moment she was extremely startled to see peregrine oakshotts unmistakable figure entering at the postern of the court  with vague fears of his intentions and instinctive terror of meeting him alone heightened by that dread of his power she flew in at the great bailey tower door hoping that he had not seen her but tolerably secure that even if he had and should pursue her she was sufficiently superior in knowledge of the stairs and passages to baffle him and make her way along the battlements to the tower at the corner of the court nearest the parsonage where there was a turret stair by which she could escape  up the broken stairs she went shutting behind her every available door in the chambers and passages but not as quickly as she wished since attention to her feet was needful in the ruinous state of steps and walls  through those massive walls she could hear nothing distinctly but she fancied voices and a cry making her seek more intricate windings nor did she dare to look out till she had gained a thick screen of bushy ivy at the corner of the turret where a little door opened on the broad summit of the battlemented wall  then what horror was it that she beheld  or was it a dream  she even passed her hands over her face and looked again  peregrine and charles yes it was charles archfield were fighting with swords in the court beneath  she gave a shriek in a wild hope of parting them but at that instant she saw peregrine fall and with the impulse of rushing to aid she hurried down impeded however by stumbles and by the doors she herself had shut and when she emerged she saw only charles standing like one dazed and white as death  o mr archfield where is he  what have you done  the young man pointed to the opening of the vault  then speaking with an effort he was quite dead my sword went through him  he forced it on me he was pursuing you  i withstood himand  he gasped heavily as the words came one by one  she trembled exceedingly and would have looked into the vault with are you quite sure but he grasped her hand and withheld her  only too sure  yes i have done it  it could not be helped  i would give myself up at once but anne there is my wife  they tell me any shock would kill her as she is now  i should be double murderer  will you keep the secret anne always my friend  and twas for you  indeed indeed i will not betray you  i go away in two hours said anne and he caught her hand  but oh and she pointed to the blood on the grass then with sudden thought heap the hay over it running to fill her arms with the latelycut grass  he mechanically did the same and then they stood for a moment awe stricken  god forgive me said the poor young man  how to hide it i hardly know but for her sake ahtwas that brought me here  she could not rest last night till i had promised to be here early enough in the morning to give you a piece of sarcenet to be matched in london where is it  ah  i forget  it seems to be ages ago that she was insisting that i should ride over so as to be in time  lucy must write said anne o charley wipe that dreadful sword look like yourself  i am going in a couple of hours  there is no fear of me but oh that you should have done such a thing and through me  hush hush dont talk  i must be gone ere folks are about  my horse is outside  he wrung her hand and kissed it forgetting to give her the pattern and anne still stunned walked back to the parsonage her one thought how to control herself so as to guard charless secret  it must be remembered that in the generation succeeding that which had fought a long civil war and when duels were common assertions of honour and selfrespect among young gentlemen homicide was not so exceptional and heinous an offence in ordinary eyes as when a higher value has come to be set on life and acts of violence are far less frequent  charles had drawn his sword in fair fight and in her own defence and thus it was natural that anne woodford should think of his deed certainly with a shudder but with more of pity than of horror and with gratitude that made her feel bound to do her utmost to guard him from the consequences also there was a sense of relief and perhaps a feeling as if the victim were scarcely a human creature like others  it never occurred to her till some time after to recollect it would have had an unpleasant sound that she had been the occasion of such an unseemly brawl between two young men one of them a married man  when the thought occurred to her it made the blood rash hotly to her cheeks  it was well for her that the pain of leaving home and the bustle of preparation concealed that she had suffered a great shock and accounted for her not being able to taste any breakfast beyond a draught of milk  her ears were intent all the time to perceive any token whether the haymakers had come into the court and had discovered any trace of the ghastly thing in the vault and she hardly heard the kind words of her uncle or the coaxings of his old housekeeper  she dreaded especially the sight of hans so fondly attached to his masters nephew and it was with a sense of infinite reliefinstead of the tender grief otherwise naturalthat she was seated in the boat for portsmouth and her uncle believing her to be crying left her undisturbed till she had composed herself to wear the front that she knew was needful however her heart might throb beneath it and as their boat threaded its way through the ships even then numerous she looked wistfully up at the tall tower of the castle with earnest prayers for the living and a longing she durst not utter to ask her uncle whether it were right to pray for the poor strange struggling soul always so cruelly misunderstood and now so summarily dismissed from the world of trial  yet presently there was a revulsion of feeling as she was roused from her meditations by the coxswains answer to her uncle who had asked what was a smart swift little smack which after receiving something from a boat began stretching her wings and making all sail for the isle of wight  the men looked significant and hesitated  smugglers eh  traders in french brandy asked the doctor  well your reverence so they says  they be a rough lot out there by at the back of the island  there would be small harm in letting a poor man get a drink of spirits cheap to warm his heart said one of the other men but they say as how tis a very nest of em out there and thats how no one can ever pitch on the highwaymen such as robbed farmer vine tother day a coming home from market  they do say added the other that theres them as ought to know better that is thick with them  theres that young master up at oakwoodthat crooked slip as they used to say was a changeling gets out o window o nights and sails with them  he has nought to do with the robberies they say added the coxswain but i could tell of many a young spark who has gone out with the fair traders for the sports sake and because gentle folk dont know what to do with their time  and they do say the young chap is kept uncommon tight at home  here the sight of a vessel of war coming in changed the topic but it had given anne something more to think of  peregrine had spoken of means arranged for making her his own  could that smuggling yacht have anything to do with them  he could hardly have reckoned on meeting her alone in the morning but he might have attempted to find her thusor failing that he might have run down the boat  if so she had a great deliverance to be thankful for and charless timely appearance had been a great blessing  but peregrine poor peregrine it became doubly terrible that he should have perished on the eve of such a deed  it was cruel to entertain such thoughts of the dead yet it was equally impossible not to feel comfort in being rid for ever of one who had certainly justified the vague alarm which he had always excited in her  she could not grieve for him now that the first shock was over but she must suppress all tokens of her extreme anxiety on account of charles archfield  thus she was landed at portsmouth and walked up the street to the spotted dog where lady worsley was taking an early noonchine before starting for london having crossed from the little fishing village of ryde  here anne parted with her uncle who promised an early letter though she could hardly restrain a shudder at the thought of the tidings that it might contain    chapter xv news from fareham   my soul its secret hath my life too hath its mystery hopeless the evil is i have not told its history  jean ingelow  lady worsley was a handsome commanding old dame who soon made her charge feel the social gulf between a county magnate and a clergymans niece  she decidedly thought that mistress anne jacobina held her head too high for her position and was moreover conceited of an unfortunate amount of good looks  therefore the good lady did her best to repress these dangerous tendencies by making the girl sit on the back seat with two maids and uttering long lectures on humility modesty and discretion which made the blood of the seacaptains daughter boil with indignation  yet she always carried with her the dread of being pursued and called upon to accuse charles archfield of peregrines death  it was a perpetual cloud dispersed indeed for a time by the events of the day but returning at night when not only was the combat acted over again but when she fell asleep it was only to be pursued by peregrine through endless vaulted dens of darkness or what was far worse to be trying to hide a stream of blood that could never be stanched  it was no wonder that she looked pale in the morning and felt so tired and dejected as to make her sensible that she was cast loose from home and friends when no one troubled her with remarks or inquiries such as she could hardly have answered  however when on the evening of the second days journey anne was set down at sir theophilus oglethorpes house at westminster she met with a very different reception  lady oglethorpe a handsome warmhearted irish woman met her at once in the hall with outstretched hands and a kiss on each cheek  come in my dear my poor orphan the daughter of one who was very dear to me  ah how you have grown  i could never have thought this was the little anne i recollect  you shall come up to your chamber at once and rest you and make ready for supper by the time sir theophilus comes in from attending the king  anne found herself installed in a freshsmelling wainscotted room where a glass of wine and some cake was ready for her and where she made herself ready feeling exhilarated in spirits as she performed her toilette putting on her black evening dress and refreshing the curls of her brown hair  it was a simple dress of deep mourning but it became her well and the two or three gentlemen who had come in to supper with sir theophilus evidently admired her greatly and complimented her on having a situation at court which was all that lady oglethorpe mentioned  child she said afterwards when they were in private if i had known what you looked like i would have sought a different position for you  but there to get ones footwere it but the toe of ones shoein at court is the great point after all the rest must come after  i warrant me you are well educated too  can you speak french  oh yes madam and italian and dance and play on the spinnet  i was with two french ladies at winchester every winter who taught such things  well well mayhap we may get you promoted to a subgovernesss placethough your religion is against you  you are not a catholic eh  no your ladyship  thats the only road to favour nowadays though for the name of the thing they may have a protestant or two  you are the kings godchild too so he will expect it the more from you  however we may find a better path  you have not left your heart in the country eh  anne blushed and denied it  you will be mewed up close enough in the nursery ran on lady oglethorpe  lady powys keeps close discipline there and i expect she will be disconcerted to see how fine a fish i have brought to her net but we will seewe will see how matters go  but my dear have you no coloured clothes  there is no appearing in the royal household in private mourning  it might daunt the princes spirits in his cradle and she laughed though anne felt much annoyed at thus disregarding her mother as well as at the heavy expense however there was no help for it the gowns and laces hidden in the bottom of her mails were disinterred and the former were for the most part condemned so that she had to submit to a fresh outfit in which lady oglethorpe heartily interested herself but which drained the purse that the canon had amply supplied  these arrangements were not complete when the first letter from home arrived and was opened with a beating heart and furtive glances as of one who feared to see the contents but they were by no means what she expected  i hope you have arrived safely in london and that you are not displeased with your first taste of life in a court  neither town nor country is exempt from sorrow and death  i was summoned only on the second day after your departure to share in the sorrows at archfield where the poor young wife died early on friday morning leaving a living infant a son who i hope may prove a blessing to them if he is spared which can scarcely be expected  the poor young man and indeed all the family are in the utmost distress and truly there were circumstances that render the event more than usually deplorable and for which he blames himself exceedingly even to despair  it appears that the poor young gentlewoman wished to add some trifle to the numerous commissions with which she was entrusting you on the night of the bonfire and that she could not be pacified except by her husband undertaking to ride over to give the patterns and the orders to you before your setting forth  you said nothing of having seen himnor do i see how it was possible that you could have done so seeing that you only left your chamber just before the breakfast that you never tasted my poor child  he never returned till long after noon and what with fretting after him and disappointment that happened which lady archfield had always apprehended and the poor fragile young creature worked herself into a state which ended before midnight in the birth of a puny babe and her own death shortly after  she wanted two months of completing her sixteenth year and was of so frail a constitution that dr brown had never much hope of her surviving the birth of her child  it was a cruel thing to marry her thus early ungrown in body or mind but she had no one to care for her before she was brought hither  the blame as i tell sir philip and would fain persuade poor charles is really with those who bred her up so uncontrolled as to be the victim of her humours but the unhappy youth will listen to no consolation  he calls himself a murderer shuts himself up and for the most part will see and speak to no one but if forced by his fathers command to unlock his chamber door returns at once to sit with his head hidden in his arms crossed upon the table and if father mother or sister strive to rouse him and obtain answer from him he will only murmur forth i should only make it worse if i did  it is piteous to see a youth so utterly overcome and truly i think his condition is a greater distress to our good friends than the loss of the poor young wife  they asked him what name he would have given to his child but all the answer they could get was as you will only not mine and in the enforced absence of my brother of fareham i baptized him philip  the funeral will take place tomorrow and sir philip proposes immediately after to take his son to oxford and there endeavour to find a tutor of mature age and of prudence with whom he may either study at new college or be sent on the grand tour  it is the only notion that the poor lad has seemed willing to entertain as if to get away from his misery and i cannot but think it well for him  he is not yet twenty and may as it were begin life again the wiser and the better man for his present extreme sorrow  lady archfield is greatly wrapped up in the care of the babe who i fear is in danger of being killed by overcare if by nothing else though truly all is in the hands of god  i have scarce quitted the afflicted family since i was summoned to them on friday since sir philip has no one else on whom to depend for comfort or counsel and if i can obtain the services of mr ellis from portsmouth for a few sundays i shall ride with him to oxford to assist in the choice of a tutor to go abroad with mr archfield  one interruption however i had namely from major oakshott who came in great perturbation to ask what was the last i had seen of his son peregrine  it appears that the unfortunate young man never returned home after the bonfire on portsdown hill where his brother robert lost sight of him and after waiting as long as he durst returned home alone  it has become known that after parting with us high words passed between him and lieutenant sedley archfield insomuch that after the unhappy fashion of these times blood was demanded and early in the morning sedley sent the friend who was to act as second to bear the challenge to young oakshott  you can conceive the reception that he was likely to receive at oakwood but it was then discovered that peregrine had not been in his bed all night nor had any one seen or heard of him  sedley boasts loudly that the youngster has fled the country for fear of him and truly things have that appearance although to my mind peregrine was far from wanting in spirit or courage  but as he had not received the cartel he might not have deemed his honour engaged to await it and i incline to the belief that he is on his way to his uncle in muscovy driven thereto by his dread of the marriage with the gentlewoman whom he holds in so much aversion  i have striven to console his father by the assurance that such tidings of him will surely arrive in due time but the major is bitterly grieved and is galled by the accusation of cowardice  he could not even be true to his own maxims of worldly honour says the poor gentleman  so true it is that only by grace we stand fast the which is true enough but the poor gentleman unwittingly did his best to make grace unacceptable in his sons eyes  i trust soon to hear again of you my dear child  i rejoice that lady oglethorpe is so good to you and i hope that in the palace you will guard first your faith and then your discretion  and so praying always for your welfare alike spiritual and temporal your loving uncle jno  woodford  truly it was well that anne had secluded herself to read this letter  so the actual cause for which poor charles archfield had entreated silence was at an end  the very evil he had apprehended had come to pass and she could well understand how on his return in a horror stricken distracted state of mind the childish petulance of his wife had worried him into loss of temper so that he hardly knew what he said  and what must not his agony of remorse be  she could scarcely imagine how he had avoided confessing all as a mere relief to his mind but then she reflected that when he called himself a murderer the words were taken in another sense and no questions asked nor would he be willing to add such grief and shame to his parents present burthen especially as no suspicion existed  that peregrines fate had not been discovered greatly relieved her she believed the vault to go down to a considerable depth after a first platform of stone near the opening and it was generally avoided as the haunt of hobgoblins fairies or evil beings so that no one was likely to be in its immediate neighbourhood after the hay was carried so that there might have been nothing to attract any one to the near neighbourhood and thus lead to the discovery  if not made by this time charles would be far away and there was nothing to connect him with the deed  no one save herself had even known of his having been near the castle that morning  how strange that the only persons aware of that terrible secret should be so far separated from one another that they could exchange no confidences and each was compelled to absolute silence  for as long as no one else was suspected anne felt her part must be not to betray charles though the bare possibility of the accusation of another was agony to her  she wrote her condolences in due form to fareham and in due time was answered by lucy archfield  the letter was full of details about the infant who seemed to absorb her and her mother and to be as likely to live as any child of those days ever wasand it was in his favour that his grandmother and her old nurse had better notions of management than most of her contemporaries  in spite of all that lucy said of her brothers overwhelming grief and the melancholy of thus parting with him there was a strain of cheerfulness throughout the letter betraying that the poor young wife of less than a year was no very great loss to the peace and comfort of the family  the letter ended with  there is a report that sir peregrine oakshott is dead in muscovy nothing has been heard of that unfortunate young man at oakwood if he be gone in quest of his uncle i wonder what will become of him  however nurse will have it that this being the third seventh year of his life the fairies have carried off their changelingyou remember how she told us the story of his being changed as an infant when we were children at winchester she believes it as much as ever and never let little philip out of her sight before he was baptized  i ask her if the changeling be gone where is the true peregrine but she only wags her head in answer  a day or two later anne heard from her uncle from oxford  he was extremely grieved at the condition of his beloved alma mater with a roman catholic master reigning at university college a doctor from the sorbonne and fellows to match inflicted by military force on magdalen whose lawful children had been ejected with a violence beyond anything that the colleges had suffered even in the time of the rebellion  if things went on as they were he pronounced oxford would be no better than a popish seminary  and he had the more readily induced his old friend to consent to charless desire not to remain there as a student but to go abroad with mr fellowes one of the expelled fellows of magdalen a clergyman of mature age but a man of the world who had already acted as a travelling tutor considering that the young widower was not yet twenty and that all his wifes wealth would be in his hands also that his cousin sedley formed a dangerous link with the questionable diversions of the garrison at portsmouth both father and friend felt that it was well that he should be out of reach and have other occupations for the present  change of scene had dr woodford said brightened the poor youth and he was showing more interest in passing events but probably he would never again be the lighthearted boy they used to know  anne could well believe it    chapter xvi a royal nursery   the duty that i owe unto your majesty i seal upon the lips of this sweet babe  king richard iii  it was not till the queen had moved from st jamess where her son had been born to take up her abode at whitehall that lady oglethorpe was considered to be disinfected from her childrens whoopingcough and could conduct mistress anne jacobina woodford to her new situation  anne remembered the place from times past as she followed the lady up the broad stairs to the state rooms where the child was daily carried for inspection by the nation to whom it was assumed he was so welcome but who on the contrary regarded him with the utmost dislike and suspicion  whitehall was in those days free to all the world and though sentries in the lifeguards uniform with huge grenadier caps were posted here and there every one walked up and down  members of parliament and fine gentlemen in embroidered coats and flowing wigs came to exchange news country cousins came to stare and wonder some to admire some to whisper their disbelief in the princes identity clergy in gown cassock and bands came to win what they could in a losing cause and one or two other clergy who were looked at askance whose dress had a foreign air and whose tonsure could be detected as they threaded their way with quick gliding steps to the kings closet  lady oglethorpe as one to the manner born made her way through the midst of this throng in the magnificent gallery and anne followed her closely conscious of words of admiration and inquiries who she was  into the princes presence chamber in fact his daynursery they came and a sweet and gentlelooking lady met them and embraced lady oglethorpe who made known mistress woodford to lady strickland of sizergh the second governess as the fourth rocker who had been appointed  you are welcome miss woodford said the lady looking at annes high handsome head and wellbred action in courtesying with a shade of surprise  you are young but i trust you are discreet there is much need thereof  following to a kind of alcove raised by a step or two anne found herself before a halfcircle of ladies and gentlemen round a chair of state in front of which stood a nurse with an infant in her arms holding him to be caressed and inspected by the lady on the throne  her beautiful soft dark eyes and hair and an ivory complexion with her dignified and graceful bearing her long slender throat and exquisite figure were not so much concealed as enhanced by the simple mob cap and nightgown as it was then the fashion to call a morning wrapper which she wore and annes first impression was that no wonder peregrine raved about her  poor peregrine that very thought came like a stab as after courtesying low she stood at the end of the long roomsilent and observing  a few gentlemen waited by the opposite door but not coming far into the apartment and lady oglethorpe was announced by one of them the space was so great that anne could not hear the words and she only saw the gracious smile and greeting as lady oglethorpe knelt and kissed the queens hand  after a long conversation between the mothers during which lady oglethorpe was accommodated with a cushion anne was beckoned forward and was named to the queen who honoured her with an inclination of the head and a few low murmured words  then there was an announcement of his majesty and anne following the general example of standing back with low obeisances beheld the tall active figure and dark heavy countenance of her royal godfather under his great black heavilycurled wig  he returned lady oglethorpes greeting and his face lighted up with a pleasant smile that greatly changed the expression as he took his child into his arms for a few moments but the little one began to cry whereupon he was carried off and the king began to consult lady oglethorpe upon the watergruel on which the poor little prince was being reared and of which she emphatically disapproved  before he left the room however lady oglethorpe took care to present to him his goddaughter mistress anne jacobina woodford and very low was the girls obeisance before him but with far more fright and shyness than before the sweetfaced queen  oh ay he said i remember honest will woodford  he did good service at southwold  i wish he had left a son like him  have you a brother young mistress  no please your majesty i am an only child  mores the pity he said kindly and with a smile brightening his heavy features  tis too good a breed to die out  you are catholic  i am bred in the english church so please your majesty  his majesty was evidently less pleased than before but he only said ha and my godchild  we must amend that and waved her aside  the royal interview over the newcomer was presented to the state governess the countess of powys a fair and gracious matron who was however almost as far removed from her as the queen  then she was called on to take a solemn oath before the master of the household of dutiful loyalty to the prince  mrs labadie was head nurse as well as being wife to the kings french valet  she was a kindly portly englishwoman who seemed wrapped up in her charge and she greeted her new subordinate in a friendly way which however seemed strange in one who at home would have been of an inferior degree expressed hopes of her steadiness and discretion and called to miss dunord to show miss woodford her chamber  the abbreviation miss sounded familiar and unsuitable but it had just come into use for younger spinsters though officially they were still termed mistress  mistress or miss dunord was sallow and grayeyed somewhat older than anne and looking thoroughly french though her english was perfect  she was entirely dressed in blue and white and had a rosary and cross at her girdle  this way she said tripping up a steep wooden stair  we sleep above  tis a huge awkward place her majesty calls it the biggest and most uncomfortable palace she ever was in  opening a heavy door she showed a room of considerable size hung with faded frayed tapestry and containing two huge bedsteads with four heavy posts and canopies of wood as near boxes as could well be  privacy was a luxury not ordinarily coveted and the arrangement did not surprise anne though she could have wished that on that summer day curtains and tapestry had been less fusty  two young women were busy over a dress spread on one of the beds and with french ease and grace the guide said here is our new colleague miss jacobina woodford  let me present miss hester bridgeman and miss jane humphreys  miss woodford is welcome said miss bridgeman a keen brown lively somewhat anxiouslooking person courtesying and holding out her hand and her example was followed by jane humphreys a stout rosy commonplace girl  oh  i am glad this last cried  now i shall have a bedfellow  this anne was the less sorry for as she saw that the bed of the other two was furnished with a holy water stoup and a little shrine with a waxen madonna  there was only one lookingglass among the four and not much apparatus either for washing or the toilet but miss bridgeman believed that they would soon go to richmond where things would be more comfortable  then she turned to consult miss dunord on her endeavour to improve the trimmings of a dress of miss humphreys  yes i know you are always in our ladys colours pauline but you have a pretty taste and can convince jane that rose colour and scarlet cannot go together  my father chose the ribbons said jane as if that were unanswerable  city taste said miss bridgeman  they are pretty very pretty with anything else observed pauline with more tact  see now with your white embroidered petticoat and the gray train they are ravishingand the scarlet coat will enliven the black  there was further a little murmur about what a mr hopkins admired but it was lost in the arrival of miss woodfords mails  they clustered round as eager as a set of schoolgirls over annes dresses  happily even the extreme of fashion had not then become ungraceful  her majesty will not have the loose drapery that folks used to wear said hester bridgeman  no said pauline it was all very well for those who could dispose it with an artless negligence but for some i could name it was as though they had tumbled it on with a hayfork and had their hair tousled by being tickled in the hay  now we have the tight bodice with plenty of muslin and lace the gown open below to show the petticoat said hester and to my mind it is more decorous  decorum was not the vogue then laughed pauline perhaps it will be now  oh what lovely lace real flanders on my word  where did you get it miss woodford  it was my mothers  and this  why tis old french point you should hang it to your sleeves  my lady archfield gave it to me in case i should need it  ah  i see you have good friends and are a person of some condition put in hester bridgeman  i shall be happy to consort with you  let us  anne courtesied and at the moment a bell was heard pauline at once crossed herself and fell on her knees before the small shrine with a figure of the blessed virgin and hester breaking off her words followed her example but jane humphreys stood twisting the corner of her apron  in a very short time almost before anne had recovered from her bewilderment the other two were up and chattering again  you are not a catholic demanded miss bridgeman  i was bred in the church said anne  and you the kings godchild exclaimed pauline  but we shall soon amend that and make a convert of you like miss bridgeman there  anne shook her head but was glad to ask and what means the bell that is ringing now  that is the supper bell  it rings just after the angelus said hester  no it is not ours  the great folks lady powys lady strickland and the rest sup first  we have the dishes after them with nurses labadie and royer and the restno bad ones either they are allowed five dishes and two bottles of wine apiece and they always leave plenty for us and it is served hot too  the preparations for going down to the second table now absorbed the party  as hester said the fare at this second table was not to be despised  it was a formal meal shared with the two nurses and the two pages of the backstairs  not the lads usually associated with the term but men of mature age and of gentle though not noble birth and breeding and there were likewise the attendants of the king and queen of the same grade such as mr labadie the kings valet some english but besides these dusian the queens french page and signer and signora turini who had come with her from modena pere giverlai her confessor and another priest  pere giverlai said grace and the conversation went on briskly between the elders the younger ones being supposed to hold their peace  their dishes went in reversion to the inferior class of servants laundress sempstress chambermaids and the like who had much more liberty than their betters and not such a lack of occupation as anne soon perceived that she should suffer from  there was however a great muster of all the princes establishment who stood round as many as could with little garments in their hands while he was solemnly undressed and laid in his richly inlaid and carved cradleover which pere giverlai pronounced a latin benediction  the nursery establishment was then released except one of the nurses who was to sleep or wake on a couch by his side and one of the rockers  these damsels had two at a time to divide the night between them one being always at hand to keep the food warm touch the rocker at need with her foot or call up the nurse on duty if the child awoke but not presume herself to handle his little royal highness  it was the night when mistresses dunord and bridgeman were due and anne followed jane humphreys to her room asking a little about the duties of the morrow  we must be dressed before seven said the girl  one of us will be left on duty while the others go to mass  i am glad you are a protestant miss woodford for the catholics put everything on me that they can  we must do our best to help and strengthen each other said anne  it is very hard said jane and the priests are always at me  i would change as hester bridgeman has done but that i know it would break my granddames heart  my father might not care so much if i got advancement but i believe it would kill my grandmother  advancement oh but faith comes first exclaimed anne recalling the warning  hester says one religion is as good as another to get to heaven by murmured jane  not if we deny our own for the worlds sake said anne  is the chapel here a popish one  no the queen has an oratory but the popish chapel is at st jamessacross the park  the protestant one is here at whitehall and there are daily prayers at nine oclock and on sunday music with three fiddlers and my grandmother says it might almost as well be popish at once  did your grandmother bring you up  yes  my mother died when i was seven years old and my grandmother bred us all up  you should hear her talk of the good old times before the kings came back and there were no bishops and no book prayersbut my father says we must swim with the stream or he would not have got any custom at his coffeehouse  is that his calling  ay  no one has a better set of guests than in the golden lamb the place is full  the great dr hammond sees his patients there and it is all one buzz of the wits  it was because of that that my lord sunderland made interest and got me here  how did you come  anne briefly explained and jane broke out  then you will be my friend and we will tell each other all our secrets  you are a protestant too  you will be mine and not bridgemans or dunordsi hate them  in point of fact anne did not feel much attracted by the proffer of friendship and she certainly did not intend to tell jane humphreys all her secrets nor to vow enmity to the other colleagues but she gravely answered that she trusted they would be friends and help to maintain one anothers faith  she was relieved that miss bridgeman here came in to take her first turn of rest till she was to be called up at one oclock  as jane humphreys had predicted mrs royer and anne alone were left in charge of the nursling while every one went to morning mass then followed breakfast and the levee of his royal highness lasting as on the previous day till dinnertime and the afternoon was as before except that the day was fine enough for the child to be carried out with all his attendants behind him to take the air in the private gardens  if this was to be the whole course of life at the palace anne began to feel that she had made a great mistake  she was by no means attracted by her companions though miss bridgeman decided that she must know persons of condition and made overtures of friendship to be sealed by calling one another oriana and portia  she did not approve of such common names as princess anne and lady churchill usedmrs morley and mrs freeman  they must have something better than what was used by the cockpit folks and she was sure that her dear portia would soon be of the only true faith    chapter xvii machinations   baby born to woe  f t palgrave  when anne woodford began to wake from the constant thought of the grief and horror she had left at portchester and to feel more alive to her surroundings and less as if they were a kind of dream in which she only mechanically took her part one thing impressed itself on her gradually and that was disappointment  if the previous shock had not blunted all her hopes and aspirations perhaps she would have felt it sooner and more keenly but she could not help realising that she had put herself into an inferior position whence there did not seem to be the promotion she had once anticipated  her companion rockers were of an inferior grade to herself  jane humphreys was a harmless but silly girl not much wiser though less spoilt than poor little madam and full of cockney vulgarities  education was unfashionable just then and though hester bridgeman was bettor born and bred being the daughter of an attorney in the city she was not much better instructed and had no pursuits except that of her own advantage  pauline dunord was by far the best of the three but she seemed to live a life apart taking very little interest in her companions or anything around her except her devotions and the bringing them over to her church  the nursery was quite a separate establishment there was no mingling with the guests of royalty who were only seen in excited peeps from the window or when solemnly introduced to the presence chamber to pay their respects to the prince  as to books the only secular one that anne saw while at whitehall was an odd volume of parthenissa  the late kings summary of the roman controversy was to be had in plenty and nothing was more evident than that the only road to favour or promotion was in being thereby convinced  dont throw it down as if it were a hot chestnut said her oriana thats what they all do at first but they come to it at last  anne made no answer but a pang smote her as she thought of her uncles warnings  yet surely she might hope for other modes of prospering she who was certainly by far the best looking and best educated of all the four not that this served her much in her present company and those of higher rank did not notice her at all princess anne would surely recollect her and then she might be safe in a protestant household where her uncle would be happy about her  the princess had been at bath when first she arrived but at the end of a week preparations were made at the cockpit a sort of appendage to whitehall where the prince and princess of denmark lived and in due time there was a visit to the nursery  standing in full ceremony behind lady powys anne saw the plump face and form she recollected in the florid bloom of a young matron not without a certain royal dignity in the pose of the head though in grace and beauty far surpassed by the tall elegant figure and face of lady churchill whose bright blue eyes seemed to be taking in everything everywhere  annes heart began to beat high at the sight of a once familiar face and with hopes of a really kind word from one who as an elder girl had made much of the pretty little plaything  the princess annes countenance was however less goodnatured than usual her mouth was made up to a sullen expression and when her brother was shown to her she did not hold out her arms to him nor vouchsafe a kiss  the queen looked at her wistfully asking  is he not like the king  humph returned princess anne i see no likeness to any living soul of our family  nay but see his little nails said the queen spreading the tiny hand over her finger  see how like your fathers they are framed my treasure you can clasp me  my brother edgar  he was the beauty said the princess  he was exactly like my father but theres no judging of anything so puny as this  he was very suffering last week the poor little angel said the mother sadly but they say this watergruel is very nourishing and not so heavy as milk  it does not look as if it agreed with him said the princess poor little mammet  did i hear that you had the little woodford here  is that you girl  anne courtesied herself forward  ay i remember you  i never forget a face and you have grown up fair enough  wheres your mother  i lost her last february so please your royal highness  oh  she was a good woman  why did she not send you to me  well well  come to my toilette tomorrow  so princess anne swept away in her rich blue brocade  her behest was obeyed of course though it was evidently displeasing to the nursery authorities and lady strickland gave a warning to be discreet and to avoid gossip with the cockpit folks  anne could not but be excited  perhaps the princess would ask for her and take her into the number of her own attendants where she would no longer be in a romish household and would certainly be in a higher position  why she remembered that very lady churchill as sarah jennings in no better a position than she could justly aspire to  her coming to court would thus be truly justified  the princess sat in a silken wrapper called a nightgown in her chamber which had a richlycurtained bed in the alcove and a toilettable with a splendid venetian mirror and a good deal of silver sparkling on it while a strange mixture of perfumes came from the various boxes and bottles  ladies and tirewomen stood in attendance a little black boy in a turban and goldembroidered dress held a salver with her chocolate cup a cockatoo soliloquised in low whispers in the window a monkey was chained to a pole at a safe distance from him a french friseur was manipulating the princesss profuse brown hair with his tongs and a needylooking pale thin man in a semiclerical suit was halfreading half declaiming a poem in which fair anna seemed mixed up with juno ceres and other classical folk but to which she was evidently paying very little attention  ah there you are little one  thank you masterwhats name that is enough  tis a fine poem but i never can remember which is which of all your gods and goddesses  oh yes i accept the dedication  give him a couple of guineas ellis it will serve him for board and lodging for a fortnight poor wretch then after giving a smooth wellshaped white hand to be kissed and inviting her visitor to a cushion at her feet she began a long series of questions kindly ones at first though of the minute gossiping kind and extending to the archfields for poor young madam had been of the rank about which royalty knew everything in those days  the inquiries were extremely minute and the comments what from any one else anne would have thought vulgar especially in the presence of the hairdresser but her namesake observed her blush and hesitation and said oh never mind a creature like that  he is french besides and does not understand a word we say  anne looking over the princesss head feared that she saw a twinkle in the mans eye and could only look down and try to ignore him through the catechism that ensued on when she came to whitehall on the prince of waless health the management of him and all the circumstances connected with his birth  very glad was anne that she knew nothing and had not picked up any information as to what had happened before she came to the palace as to the present lady stricklands warning and her own sense of honour kept her reticent to a degree that evidently vexed the princess for she dropped her caressing manner and sent her away with a not very kind you may go now you will be turning papist next and what would your poor mother say  and as anne departed in backward fashion she heard lady churchill say you will make nothing of her  she is sharper than she affects and a proud minx  i see it in her carriage  the visit had only dashed a few hopes and done her harm with her immediate surroundings who always disliked and distrusted intercourse with the other establishment  however in another day the nursery was moved to richmond  this was a welcome move to anne who had spent her early childhood near enough to be sometimes taken thither and to know the park well so that there was a home feeling in the sight of the outline of the trees and the scenery of the neighbourhood  the queen intended going to bath so that the establishment was only that of the prince and the life was much quieter on the whole but there was no gratifying any yearning for country walks for it was not safe nor perhaps decorous for one young woman to be out alone in a park open to the public and haunted by soldiers from hounslownor could either of her fellowrockers understand her preference for a secluded path through the woods  miss dunord never went out at all except on duty when the prince was carried along the walks in the garden and the other two infinitely preferred the open spaces where tables were set under the horsechestnut trees for parties who boated down from london to eat curds and whey sometimes bringing a fiddler so as to dance under the trees  jane humphreys especially was always looking out for acquaintances and once with a cry of joy a stout homelylooking young woman started up exclaiming sister jane and flew into her arms  upon which miss woodford was introduced to my sister coles and her husband and had to sit down under a tree and share the festivities while there was an overflow of inquiries and intelligence domestic and otherwise  certainly these were persons whom she would not have treated as equals at home  besides it was all very well to hear of the good old grandmothers rheumatics and of little tommys teething and even to see jane hang her head and be teased about remembering mr hopkins nor was it wonderful to hear lamentations over the extreme dulness of the life where one never saw a creature to speak to who was not as old as the hills but when it came to inquiries as minute as the princesss about the prince of wales anne thought the full details lavishly poured out scarcely consistent with loyalty to their oaths of service and lady stricklands warning and she told jane so  she was answered oh la what harm can it do  you are such a proud peat  granddame and sister like to know all about his royal highness  this was true but anne was far more uncomfortable two or three days later  the prince was ailing so much so that lady powys had sent an express for the queen who had not yet started for bath when anne and jane being relieved from duty by the other pair went out for a stroll  oh la presently exclaimed jane if that is not colonel sands the princesss equerry  i do declare he is coming to speak to us though he is one of the cockpit folks  he was a very fine gentleman indeed all scarlet and gold and no wonder jane was flattered and startled so that she jerked her fan violently up and down as he accosted her with a wave of his cocked hat saying that he was rejoiced to meet these two fair ladies having been sent by the princess of denmark to inquire for the health of the prince  she was very anxious to know more than could be learnt by formal inquiry he said and he was happy to have met the young gentlewomen who could gratify him  the term gentlewoman highly flattered miss humphreys who blushed and bridled and exclaimed oh la sir but anne thought it needful to say gravely  we are in trust sir and have no right to speak of what passes within the royal household  madam i admire your discretion but to theahemsister of theahemprince of wales it is surely uncalled for  miss woodford is so precise said jane humphreys with a giggle i do not know what harm can come of saying that his royal highness peaks and pines just as he did before  he is none the better for country air then  oh no except that he cries louder  such a time as we had last night  mrs royer never slept a wink all the time i was there but walked about with him all night  you had the best of it miss woodford  he slept while i was there said anne briefly not thinking it needful to state that the tired nurse had handed the child over to her and that he had fallen asleep in her arms  she tried to put an end to the conversation by going indoors but she was vexed to find that instead of following her closely miss humphreys was still lingering with the equerry  anne found the household in commotion  pauline met her weeping bitterly and saying the prince had had a fit and all hope was over and in the rockers room she found hester bridgeman exclaiming that her occupation was gone  watergruel she had no doubt had been the death of the prince  the queen was come and wellnigh distracted  she had sent out in quest of a wetnurse but it was too late he was going the way of all her majestys children  going down again together the two girls presently had to stand aside as the poor queen seeing and hearing nothing came towards her own room with her handkerchief over her face  they pressed each others hands awestricken and went on to the nursery  there mrs labadie was kneeling over the cradle her hood hanging over her face crying bitterly over the poor little child who had a blue look about his face and seemed at the last gasp his features contorted by a convulsion  at that moment jane humphreys was seen gently opening the door and letting in colonel sands who moved as quietly as possible to give a furtive look at the dying child  his researches were cut short however  lady strickland usually the gentlest of women darted out and demanded what he was doing in her nursery  he attempted to stammer some excuse about princess anne but lady strickland only answered by standing pointing to the door and he was forced to retreat in a very undignified fashion  who brought him she demanded when the door was shut  those cockpit folk are not to come prying here hap what may  miss humphreys had sped away for fear of questions being asked and attention was diverted by mrs royer arriving with a stout healthy looking young woman in a thick homespun cloth petticoat no stockings and old shoes but with a clean white cap on her heada tilemakers wife who had been captured in the village  no sooner was the suffering halfstarved child delivered over to her than he became serene and contented  the watergruel regime was over and he began to thrive from that time  even when later in the afternoon the king himself brought in colonel sands whom in the joy of his heart he had asked to dine with him the babe lay tranquilly on the cradle waving his little hands and looking happy  the intrusion seemed to have been forgotten but that afternoon anne who had been sent on a message to one of the queens ladies more than suspected that she saw jane in a deep recess of a window in confabulation with the colonel  and when they were alone at bed time the girl said  is it not droll  the colonel cannot believe that tis the same child  he has been joking and teasing me to declare that we have a dead prince hidden somewhere and that the king showed him the brickbat womans child  how can you prattle in that mischievous wayafter what lady strickland said too  you do not know what harm you may do  oh lack it was all a jest  i am not so sure that it was  but you will not tell of me dear friend you will not  i never saw lady strickland like that i did not know she could be in such a rage  no wonder when a fellow like that came peeping and prying like a raven to see whether the poor babe was still breathing cried anne indignantly  how could you bring him in  fellow indeed  why he is a colonel in the lifeguards and the princesss equerry and who has a right to know about the child if not his own sisteror halfsister  she is not a very loving sister replied anne  you know well jane how many would not be sorry to make out that it is as that man would fain have you say  well i told him it was no such thing and laughed the very notion to scorn  it were better not to talk with him at all  but you will not speak of it  if i were turned away my father would beat me  nay i know not what he might not do to me  you will not tell dear darling portia and i will love you for ever  i have no call to tell said anne coldly but she was disgusted and weary and moreover not at all sure that she as the other protestant rocker and having been in the park on that same day was not credited with some of the mischievous gossip that had passed  there portia that is what you get by walking with that stupid humphreys said oriana  she knows no better than to blab to any one who will be at the trouble to seem sweet upon her though she may get nothing by it  would it be better if she did asked anne  oh well we must all look out for ourselves and i am sure there is no knowing what may come next  but i hear we are to move to windsor as soon as the child is strong enough so as to be farther out of reach of the cockpit tongues  this proved to be true but the prince and his suite were not lodged in the castle itself a house in the cloisters being thought more suitable and here the queen visited her child daily for since that last alarm she could not bear to be long absent from him  such emissaries as colonel sands did not again appear but after that precedent lady strickland had become much more unwilling to allow any of those under her authority to go out into any public place and the rockers seldom got any exercise except as swelling the princes train when he was carried out to take the air  anne looked with longing eyes at the park but a ramble there was a forbidden pleasure  she could not always even obtain leave to attend st georges chapel the wish was treated as a sort of weakness or folly and she was always the person selected to stay at home when any religious ceremony called away the rest of the establishment  as the kings goddaughter it was impressed on her that she ought to conform to his church and one of the many priests about the court was appointed to instruct her  in the dearth of all intellectual intercourse and the absolute deficiency of books she could not but become deeply interested in the arguments  her uncle had forearmed her with instruction and she wrote to him on any difficulty which arose and this became the chief occupation of her mind distracting her thoughts from the one great cloud that hung over her memory indeed one of the foremost bulwarks her feelings erected to fortify her conscience against the temptations around was the knowledge that she would have though of course under seal of confession to relate that terrible story to a priest  hester bridgeman could not imagine how her portia could endure to hear the old english prayerbook droned out  for her part she liked one thing or the other either a rousing nonconformist sermon in a meetinghouse or a splendid mass  but after all as anne overheard her observing to miss dunord it may be all the better for us  what with her breeding and her foreign tongues she would be sure to be set over our heads as undergoverness or the like if she were not such an obstinate heretic and keeping that stupid humphreys so  we could have converted her long ago if it were not for that woodford and for her city granddame  portia is the kings godchild too so it is just as well that she does not see what is for her own advantage  i do not care for promotion  i only want to save my own soul and hers said pauline  i wish she would come over to the true church for i could love her  and certainly pauline dunords gentle devotional example and her perfect rest and peace in the practice of her religion were strong influences with anne  she was waiting till circumstances should make it possible to her to enter a convent and in the meantime she lived a strictly devout life abstracted as far as duty and kindness permitted from the little cabals and gossipry around  anne could not help feeling that the girl was as nearly a saint as any one she had ever seenfar beyond herself in goodness moreover the queen inspired strong affection  mary beatrice was not only a very beautiful person full of the grace and dignity of the house of este but she was deeply religious good and gentle kindly and gracious to all who approached her and devoted to her husband and child  a word or look from her was always a delight and anne by her knowledge of italian was able sometimes to obtain a smiling word or remark  the little prince after those first miserable weeks of his life had begun to thrive and by and by manifested a decided preference not only for his beautiful mother but for the fresh face bright smile and shining brown eyes of miss woodford  she could almost always with nods and becks avert a passion of roaring which sometimes went beyond the powers of even his fostermother the tilers wife  the queen watched with delight when he laughed and flourished his arms in response and the king was summoned to see the performance which he requited by taking out a fat gold watch set with pearls and presenting it to anne as his grave gloomy face lighted up with a smile  are you yet one of us he asked as she received his gift on her knee  no sir i cannot  that must be amended  you have read his late majestys paper  i have sir  and seen father giverlai  yes please your majesty  and still you are not convinced  that must not be  i would gladly consider and promote you but i can only have true catholics around my son  i shall desire father crump to see you    chapter xviii hallowmas eve      this more strange than such a murder is  macbeth  bambino mio bambino mio wailed mary beatrice as she pressed her child to her bosom and murmured to him in her native tongue  and did they say he was not his mothers son his poor mother whose dearest treasure he is  oime crudeli crudelissimi  even his sisters hate him and will not own him the little jewel of his mothers heart  anne waiting in the window was grieved to have overheard the words which the poor queen had poured out evidently thinking no one near could understand her  that evening there were orders to prepare for a journey to whitehall the next morning  and said hester bridgeman i can tell you why in all confidence but i have it from a sure hand  the prince of orange is collecting a fleet and army to come and inquire into certain matters especially into the birth of a certain young gentleman we wot of  how can he have the insolence cried anne  tis no great wonder considering the vipers in the cockpit said hester  but what will they do to us asked jane humphreys in terror  nothing to you my dear nor to portia you are good protestants said hester with a sneer  mrs royer told me it was for the christening said jane and then we shall all have new suits  i am glad we are going back to town  it cannot be so mortal dull as tis here with all the leaves fallingenough to give one the vapours  there were auguries on either hand in the palace that if the prince came it would be only another monmouth affair and this made anne shrink for she had partaken of the grief and indignation of winchester at the cruel execution of lady lisle and had heard rumours enough of the progress of the assize to make her start in horror when called to watch the redfaced lord chancellor jeffreys getting out of his coach  it really seemed for the time as if the royal household were confident in this impression though as soon as they were again settled in whitehall there was a very close examination of the witnesses of the princes birth and a report printed of their evidence enough it might be thought to satisfy any one but jane humphreys who went to spend a day at the golden lamb her fathers warehouse reported that people only laughed at it  annes spirit burned at the injustice and warmed the more towards the queen and little prince whose pretty responses to her caresses could not but win her love  moreover paulines example continued to attract her and father crump was a better controversialist or perhaps a better judge of character than pere giverlai and took her on sides where she was more vulnerable so as to make her begin to feel unsettled and wonder whether she were not making a vain sacrifice and holding out after all against the better way  the sense of the possible gain and disgust at the shallow conversions of some around her helped to keep her back  she could not help observing that while pauline persuaded hester had ceased to persuade and seemed rather willing to hinder her  just before the state christening or rather admission into the church lady powys in the name of the king and queen offered her the post of subgoverness which really would mean for the present chief playfellow to the little prince and would place her on an entirely different platform of society from the comparatively menial one she occupied but of course on the condition of conformity to rome  to be above the familiarity of jane and hester was no small temptation but still she hesitated  madam i thank you i thank their majesties she said but i cannot do it thus  i see what you mean miss woodford said lady powys who was a truly noble woman  your motives must be above suspicion even to yourself  i respect you and would not have made you the offer except by express command but i still trust that when your disinterestedness is above suspicion you will still join us  it was sore mortification when hester bridgeman was preferred to the office for which she was far less fitted being no favourite with the babe and being essentially vulgar in tastes and habits and knowing no language save her own and that ungrammatically and with an accent which no one could wish the prince to acquire  yet there she was promoted to the higher grade of the establishment and at the christening standing in the front ranks while miss woodford was left far in the rear among the servants  a report of the dutch fleet having been destroyed by a storm had restored the spirits of the court and in the nursery very little was known of the feelings of the kingdom at large  dr woodford did not venture on writing freely to his niece lest he should compromise her and she only vaguely detected that he was uneasy  so came all saints day eve when there was to be a special service late in the evening at the romanised chapel royal at st jamess with a sermon by a distinguished dominican to which all the elder and graver members of the household were eager to go  and there was another very different attraction at the cockpit where goodnatured princess anne had given permission for a supper to be followed by burning of nuts and all the divinations proper to hallowmas eve to which were invited all the subordinates of the whitehall establishment who could be spared  pauline dunord was as eager for the sermon as jane humphreys was for the supper and hester bridgeman was in an odd mood of uncertainty evidently longing after the sports but not daring to show that she did so and trying to show great desire to hear the holy man preach together with a polite profession of selfdenial in giving up her place in case there should not be room for all  however as it appeared that even the two chief nurses meant to combine sermon and the latter end of the supper she was at ease  the fostermother and one of the protestant rockers were supposed to be enough to watch over the prince but the former who had been much petted and spoilt since she had been at the palace and was a young creature untrained and wilful cried so much at the idea of missing the merrymaking that as it was reckoned important to keep her in good humour and good spirits mrs labadie decided on winking at her absence from the nursery since miss woodford was quite competent to the charge for the short time that both the churchgoers and the suppergoers would all be absent together  but are you not afraid to stay alone asked mrs labadie with a little compunction  what is there to be afraid of asked anne  there are the sentinels at the foot of the stairs and what should reach us here  i would not be alone here said more than one voice  nor i nor i  and on this night of all others said hester  but why  they say he walks whispered jane in a voice of awe  who walks  the old king asked hester  no the last king said jane  no no  it was oliver cromwellold noll himself put in another voice  i tell you no such thing said jane  it was the last king  i heard it from them that saw it at least the ladys cousin  twas in the long gallery in a suit of plain black velvet with white muslin ruffles and cravat quilled very neat  why do you laugh miss woodford  this was too much for anne who managed to say who was his laundress  i tell you i heard it from them that told no lies  the gentleman could swear to it  he took a candle to him and there was nought but the wainscot behind  think of that  and that we should be living here said another voice  i never venture about the big draughty place alone at night said the laundress  no nor i would not for twenty princes added the sempstress  nay i have heard steps said mrs royer and wailingwailing no wonder after all that has happened here  oh yes steps as of the guard being turned out  that is like our squires manorhouse where  every one contributed a story and only the announcement of her majestys approach put an end to these reminiscences  anne held to her purpose  she had looked forward to this time of solitude for she wanted leisure to consider the situation and fairly to revolve the pleas by which father crump had shaken her more in feeling than in her reason and made her question whether her allegiance to her mother and uncle and her disgust at interested conversions were not making her turn aside from what might be the only true church the mother of saints and therewith perversely give up earthly advancement  but oh how to write to her uncle  the very intention made her imagination and memory too powerful for the consideration of controversy  she went back first to a merry hallowmas eve long ago among the archfield party and other winchester friends and how the nuts had bounced in a manner which made the young ones shout in ecstasy of glee but seemed to displease some of the elders and had afterwards been the occasion of her being told that it was all folly and therewith informed of charles archfields contract to poor little alice fitzhubert  then came other scenes  all the various ghostly tales she had heard and as she sat with her knitting in the shaded room with no sound but the soft breathing of her little charge in his cradle no light save from a shaded lamp and the fire on the hearth strange thoughts and dreams floated over her she started at mysterious cracks in the wainscotting from time to time and beheld in the dark corners of the great room forms that seemed grotesque and phantomlike till she went up to them and resolved them into familiar bits of furniture or gowns and caps of mrs labadie  she repeated half aloud numerous psalms and bits of poetry but in the midst would come some disturbing noise a step or a shout from the street though the chamber being at the back of the house looking into the park few of such sounds penetrated thither  she began to think of king charless last walk from st jamess to whitehall and of the fatal window of the banquetinghall which had been pointed out to her and then her thoughts flew back again to that vault in the castle yard and she saw only too vividly in memory that open vault veiled partly by nettles and mulleins which was the unblest unknown grave of the old playfellow who had so loved her mother and herself perhaps she had hitherto more dwelt on and pitied the living than the dead as one whom fears and prayers still concerned but now as she thought of the lively spritelike being who had professed such affection for her and for whom her mother had felt so much and recollected him so soon and suddenly cut down and consigned to that dreary darkness the strange yearning spirit dismissed to the unknown world instead of her old terror and repulsion a great tenderness and compunction came over her and she longed to join those who would in two days more be keeping all souls day in intercessions for their departed so as to atone for her past dislike and there was that sort of feeling about her which can only be described by the word eerie  to relieve it anne walked to the window and undid a small wicket in the shutter so as to look out into the quiet moonlight park where the trees cast their long shadows on the silvery grass and there was a great calm that seemed to reach her heart and spirits  suddenly across the sward towards the palace there came the slight impish almost onesided figure with the peculiar walk swift though suggestive of a limp the elfish set of the plume the foreign adjustment of short cloak  anne gazed with widestretched eyes and beating heart trying to rally her senses and believe it fancy when the figure crossed into a broad streak of light cast by the lamp over the door the face was upturned for a moment  it was deadly pale and the features were beyond all doubt peregrine oakshotts  she sprang back from the window dropped on her knees with her face hidden in her hands and was hardly conscious till sounds of the others returning made her rally her powers so as to prevent all inquiries or surmises  it was mrs labadie and pauline dunord the former to see that all was well with the prince before repairing to the cockpit  how pale you are she exclaimed  have you seen anything  iit may be nothing  he is dead stammered anne  oh then tis naught but a maids fancies said the nurse good humouredly  miss dunord is in no mind for the sports so she will stay with his highness and you had best come with me and drive the cobwebs out of your brain  indeed i thank you maam but i could not said anne  you had best i tell you shake these megrims out of your brain said mrs labadie but she was in too great haste not to lose her share of the amusements to argue the point and the two young women were left together  pauline was in a somewhat exalted state full of the sermon on the connection of the church with the invisible world  you have seen one of your poor dead she said  oh may it not be that he came to implore you to have pity and join the church where you could intercede and offer the holy sacrifice for him  anne started  this seemed to chime in with proclivities of poor peregrines own and when she thought of his corpse in that unhallowed vault it seemed to her as if he must be calling on her to take measures for his rest both of body and of spirit  yet something seemed to seal her tongue  she could not open her lips on what she had seen and while pauline talked on repeating the sermon which had so deeply touched her feelings anne heard without listening to aught besides her own perturbations mentally debating whether she could endure to reveal the story to father crump if she confessed to him or whether she should write to her uncle and she even began to compose the letter in her own mind with the terrible revelation that must commence it but every moment the idea became more formidable  how transfer her own heavy burthen to her uncle who might feel bound to take steps that would cut young archfield off from parents sister child and home  or supposing dr woodford disbelieved the apparition of tonight the whole would be discredited in his eyes and he might suppose the summer mornings duel as much a delusion of her fancy as the autumn evenings phantom and what evidence had she to adduce save charless despair peregrines absence and what there might be in the vault  yet if all that father crump and pauline said was true that dear uncle might be under a fatal delusion and it might be the best hope for herselfnay even for that poor restless spiritto separate herself from them  here was pauline talking of the blessedness of being able to offer prayers on all souls day for all those of whose ultimate salvation there were fears or who might be in a state of suffering  it even startled her as she thought of her mother whom she always gave thanks for as one departed in faith and fear  would father crump speak of her as one in a state of inevitable ignorance to be expiated in the invisible world  it shocked the daughter as almost profane  yet if it were true and prayers and masses could aid her  altogether anne was in a mood on which the voices broke strangely returning from the supper full of news  jane humphreys was voluble on her various experiments  the nuts had burnt quietly together and that was propitious to the lifeguardsman mr shaw who had shared hers but on the other hand the appleparing thrown over her shoulder had formed a p and he whom she had seen in the vista of lookingglasses had a gold chain but neither a uniform nor a p in his name and mrs buss declared that it meant that she should be three times married and the last would be an alderman if not lord mayor and mrs royer was joking miss bridgeman on the i of her appleparing which could stand for nothing but a certain incle among the cockpit folk who was her special detestation  princess anne and her husband had come down to see the nuts flying and had laughed enough to split their sides till lord cornbury came in and whispered something to prince george who said est il possible and spoke to the princess and they all went away together  yes and the bishop of bath and wells who had been laughing before looked very grave and went with them  oh exclaimed anne is the bishop of bath and wells here  yes in spite of his disgrace  i hear he is to preach in your protestant chapel tomorrow  anne had brought a letter of introduction from her uncle in case she should have any opportunity of seeing his old fellow canon who had often been kind to her when she was a little girl at winchester she was in many minds of hope and fear as to the meeting him or speaking to him under the consciousness of the possible defection from his church and the doubt and dread whether to confide her secret and consult him  however the extreme improbability of her being able to do so made the yearning for the sight of a winchester face predominate and her vigil of the night past made the nursery authorities concede that she had fairly earned her turn to go to church in the forenoon since she was obstinate enough to want to run after an old heretic socalled bishop who had so pragmatically withstood his majesty  jane humphreys went too for though she was not fond of weekday services any escape from the nursery was welcome and there was a chance of seeing lady churchills new mantle  in this she was disappointed for none of the grandees were present indeed it was whispered as the two girls made their way to the chapel that there was great excitement over the declaration of the prince of orange which had arrived last night that he had been invited by the lords spiritual and temporal to take up the cause of the liberties of england and inquire into the evidence of the birth of the prince of wales  people shrugged their shoulders but looked volumes though it was no time nor place for saying more and when in the chapel that countenance of bishop ken so beautiful in outward form so expressive of strength sweetness and devotion brought back such a flood of old associations to anne that it was enough to change the whole current of her thoughts and make her her own mothers child again even before he opened his mouth  she caught his sweet voice in the psalms and closing her eyes seemed to be in the cathedral once more among those mighty columns and arches and when he began his sermon on the text let the saints be joyful with glory let them rejoice in their beds she found the communion of saints in paradise and on earth knit together in one fellowship as truly and preciously brought home to her as ever it had been to pauline and moreover when she thought of her mother the lurid mist was dispelled which had so haunted her the night before  the longing to speak to him awoke and as he was quitting the chapel in full procession his kindly eye lit upon her with a look of recognition and before she had moved from her place one of the attendant clergy came back by his desire to conduct her to him  he held out his hand as she courtesied low  mistress woodford he said my old friends niece  he wrote to me of you but i have had no opportunity of seeing you before  oh my lord  i was so much longing to see and speak with you  i am lodging at lambeth said the bishop and it is too far to take you with me thither but perhaps my good brother here turning to the chaplain can help us to a room where we can be private  this was done the chaplains parlour at the cockpit was placed at their disposal and there a few kind words from bishop ken led to the unburthening of her heavy heart  of kens replies to the controversial difficulties there is no need to tell  indeed ambition was far more her temptation than any real difficulties as to doctrine  her dissatisfaction at being unable to answer the questions raised by father crump was exaggerated as the excuse and cover to herself of her craving for escape from her present subordinate post and this the bishop soon saw and tenderly but firmly drew her to own both this and to confess the ambitious spirit which had led her into this scene of temptation  it was true indeed he said that trial by our own error is hardest to encounter but you have repented and by gods grace my child i trust you will be enabled to steer your course aright through the trials of loyalty to our god and to our king that are coming upon us all  ever remember god and the plain duty first his anointed next is there more that you would like to tell me for you still bear a troubled look and i have full time  then anne told him all the strange adventure of portchester castle and even of the apparition of the night before  that gentleness and sympathy seemed to draw out all that was in her heart and to her surprise he did not treat the story of that figure as necessarily a delusion  he had known and heard too much of spiritual manifestations to the outward senses to declare that such things could not be  what she had seen might be explained by one of four hypotheses  it was either a phantom of her brain and her being fully awake although recently dwelling on the recollection rendered that idea less probable or the young man had not been killed and she had seen him in propria persona  she had charles archfields word that the death was certain  he had never been heard of again and if alive the walk before whitehall was the last place where he would be  as to mistaking any one else for him the bishop remembered enough of the queer changeling elf to agree with her that it was not a very probable contingency  and if it were indeed a spirit why should it visit her  there had been one good effect certainly in the revival of home thoughts and turning her mind from the allurements of favour but that did not seem to account for the spirit seeking her out  was it anne faltered a sign that she ought to confess all for the sake of procuring christian burial for him  yet how should she when she had promised silence to young archfield  true it was for his wifes sake and she was dead but there were the rest of his family and himself to be considered  what should she do  the bishop thought a little while then said that he did not believe that she ought to speak without mr archfields consent unless she saw any one else brought into danger by her silence  if it ever became possible he thought that she should ascertain whether the body were in the vault and if so it might be possible to procure burial for it perhaps without identification or at any rate without making known what could only cause hostility and distress between the two families unless the young man himself on his return should make the confession  this the bishop evidently considered the sounder though the harder course but he held that anne had no right to take the initiative  she could only wait and bear her load alone but the extreme kindness and compassion with which he talked to her soothed and comforted her so much that she felt infinitely relieved and strengthened when he dismissed her with his blessing and far happier and more at peace than she had been since that terrible summer morning though greatly humbled and taught to repent of her aspirations after earthly greatness and to accept her present condition as a just retribution and a trial of constancy    chapter xix the daughters secret   thy sisters naught  o regan she hath tied sharptoothd unkindness like a vulture here i can scarce speak to thee  king lear  am ioh am i going home thought anne  my uncle will be at winchester  i am glad of it  i could not yet bear to see portchester again  that shape would be there  yet how shall i deal with what seems laid on me  but oh the joy of escaping from this weary weary court  oh the folly that took me hither  now that the prince is gone lady strickland will surely speak to the queen for my dismissal  there had been seventeen days of alarms reports and counter reports and now the king with the prince of denmark had gone to join the army on salisbury plain and at the same time the little prince of wales had been sent off to his halfbrother the duke of berwick at portsmouth under charge of lady powys there to be embarked for france  anne had been somewhat disappointed at not going with them hoping that when at portsmouth or in passing winchester she might see her uncle and obtain her release for she had no desire to be taken abroad but it was decreed otherwise miss dunord went rejoicing and thankful to be returning to france and the other three rockers remained  there had already been more than one day of alarms and tumults  the bodyguards within were always on duty the lifeguards without were constantly patrolling and on the 5th of november when the prince of orange was known to be near at hand and was in fact actually landing at torbay the mob had with difficulty been restrained from burning in effigy not only guy fawkes but pope cardinals and mitred bishops in front of the palace and actually paraded them all with a figure of poor sir edmondbury godfrey bearing his head in his hand tied on horseback behind a jesuit full before the windows with yells of  the pope the pope up the ladder and down the rope  and clattering of warmingpans  jane humphreys was dreadfully frightened  anne found her crouching close to her bed with the curtains wrapped round her  have they got in she cried  o miss woodford how shall we make them believe we are good protestants  and when this terror had subsided and it was well known that the dutch were at exeter there was another panic for one of the life guardsmen had told her to beware since if the royal troops at hounslow were beaten the papists would surely take their revenge  i am to scream from the windows to mr shaw she said but what good will that do if the priests and the frenchmen have strangled me  and perhaps he wont be on guard  he was only trying to frighten you suggested anne  dear me miss woodford arent you afraid  you have the stomach of a lion  why what would be the good of hurting us  however anne was not at all surprised when on the very evening of the princes departure old mrs humphreys a venerablelooking dame in handsome but puritanicallyfashioned garments came in a hackney coach to request in her sons name that her granddaughter might return with her as her occupation was at an end  jane was transported with joy  ay ay said the grandmother look at you now and think how crazy you were to go to the palace though twas always against my judgment  ah i little knew how mortal dull it would be said jane  yeve found it no better than the husks that the swine did eat eh so much the better and safer for your soul child  nobody wanted to retain jane and while she was hastily putting her things together the grandmother turned to anne  and you mistress woodford from what i hear you have been very good in keeping my silly child stanch to her religion and true to her duty  if ever on a pinch you needed a friend in london my son and i would be proud to serve youmaster joshua humphreys at the golden lamb gracechurch street mind you  no one knows what may hap in these strange and troublesome times and you might be glad of a house to go to till you can send to your own friendsthat is if we are not all murdered by the papists first  though anne did not expect such a catastrophe as this she was really grateful for the offer and thought it possible that she might avail herself of it as she had not been able to communicate with any of her mothers old friends and bishop ken was not to her knowledge still in london  she watched anxiously for the opportunity of asking lady strickland whether she might apply for her dismissal and write to her uncle to fetch her home  child said the lady i think you love the queen  indeed i do madam  it is well that at this juncture all protestants should not leave her  you are a gentlewoman in manner and can speak her native tongue friends are falling from her scarcely ladies are left enough to make a fit appearance around her if you are faithful to her remain i entreat of you  there was no resisting such an appeal and anne remained in the rooms now left bare and empty until a message was brought to her to come to the queen  mary beatrice sat in a chair by her fire looking sad and listless her eyes red with weeping but she gave her sweet smile as the girl entered and held out her hand saying in her sweet italian you are faithful signorina anna you remain that is well but now my son is gone anna you must be mine  i make you my reader instead of his rocker  as anne knelt on one knee to kiss hands with tears in her eyes the queen impulsively threw her arms round her neck and kissed her ah you loved him and he loved you il mio tesorino  promotion had comehow strangely  she had to enter on her duties at once and to read some chapters of an italian version of the imitation  a reader was of a higher grade of importance than a rocker and for the ensuing days when not in attendance on the queen anne was the companion of lady strickland and lady oglethorpe  in the absence of the king and prince the queen received princess anne at her own table and lady churchill and lady fitzhardinge joined that of her ladiesinwaiting  lady churchill with her long neck splendid hair and complexion short chin and sparkling blue eyes was beautiful to look at but not at all disposed to be agreeable to the queens ladies whom she treated with a sort of blunt scorn not at all disguised by the forms of courtesy  however she had to their relief a good deal of leave of absence just then to visit her children as indeed the ladies agreed that she did pretty much as she chose and that the faithful mrs morley was somewhat afraid of the dear mrs freeman  one evening in coming up some steps princess anne entangled her foot in her pink taffetas petticoat nearly fell and tore a large rent besides breaking the thread of the festoons of seed pearls which bordered it and scattering them on the floor  lackaday  lackaday sighed she as after a little screaming she gathered herself up again  that new coat  how shall i ever face danvers again such a figure  shes an excellent tirewoman but she will be neither to have nor to hold when she sees that gown that she set such store by  nay i can hardly step for it  i think i could repair it with her majestys and your royal highnesss permission said anne who was creeping about on her knees picking up the pearls  oh do do  theres a good child and then danvers and dawson need know nothing about it cried the princess in great glee  you remember dawson dont you little woodie as we used to call you and how she used to rate us when we were children if we soiled our frocks  so in the withdrawingroom anne sat on the floor with needle and silk by the light of the wax candles deftly repairing the rent and then threading the scattered pearls and arranging the festoon so as to hide the darn  the princess was delighted and while the poor wife lay back in her chair thankful that behind her fan she could give way to her terrible anxieties about her little son who might be crossing to france and her husband suffering from fearful nosebleeding and wellnigh alone among traitors and deserters the stepdaughter on the other side of the great hearth chattered away complacently to little woodford  do you recollect old dawson and how she used to grumble when i went to sup with the duchessmy own motheryou know because she used to give me chocolate and she said it made me scream at night and be over fat by day  ah that was before you used to come among us  it was after i went to france to my poor aunt of orleans  i remember she never would let us kiss her for fear of spoiling her complexion and mademoiselle and i did so hate living maigre on the fast days  i was glad enough to get home at last and then my sister was jealous because i talked french better than she did  so the princess prattled on without needing much reply until her namesake had finished her work with which she was well pleased and promised to remember her  to anne it was an absolute marvel how she could thus talk when she knew that her husband had deserted her father in his need and that things were in a most critical position  the queen could not refrain from a sigh of relief when her step daughter had retired to the cockpit and after seeking her sleepless bed she begged anne if it did not too much incommode her to read to her from the gospel  the next day was sunday and anne felt almost as if deserting her cause when going to the english service in whitehall chapel royal now almost emptied except of the princesss suite and some of these had the bad taste and profanity to cough and chatter all through the special prayer drawn up by the archbishop for the kings safety  people were not very reverent and as all stood up at the end of the advent sunday service to let the princess sweep by in her glittering green satin petticoat peachcoloured velvet train and feather crowned head she laid a hand on annes arm and whispered follow me to my closet little woodford  there was no choice but to obey as the queen would not require her reader till after dinner and anne followed after the various attendants who did not seem very willing to forward a private interview with a possible rival though as anne supposed the object must be to convey some message to the queen  by the time she arrived and had been admitted to the inner chamber or dressingroom the princess had thrown off her more cumbrous finery and sat at ease in an armchair  she nodded her becurled head and said you can keep a secret little woodie  i can madam but i do not love one said anne thinking of her most burthensome one  well no need to keep this long  you are a good young maiden and my own poor mothers godchild and you are handy and notable  you deserve better preferment than ever you will get in that popish household where your religion is in danger  now i am not going to be in jeopardy here any longer nor let myself be kept hostage for his highness  come to my rooms at bedtime  slip in when i wish the queen goodnight and ill find an excuse  then you shall come with me tono ill not say where and ill make your fortune only mums the word  butyour royal highness is very good but i am sworn to the prince and queen  i could not leave them without permission  prince  prince  pretty sort of a prince  prince of brickbats as churchill says  nay girl dont turn away in that fashion consider  your religion is in danger  nay madam my religion would not be served by breaking my oath  pooh  whats your oath to a mere pretender  besides consider your fortune  rocker to a puling babeeven if he was what they say he is  and dont build on the queens favoureven if she remains what she is now she is too much beset with papists and foreigners to do anything for you  i do not anne began to say but the princess gave her no time  besides pride will have a fall and if you are a good maid and hold your tongue and serve me well in this strait ill make you my maid of honour and marry you so that you shall put lady before your name  ay and get good preferment for your uncle who has had only a poor stall from the king here  anne repressed an inclination to say this was not the way in which her uncle would wish to get promotion and only replied your royal highness is very good but  whereat the princess in a huff exclaimed oh very well if you choose to be torn to pieces by the mob and slaughtered by the priests like poor godfrey and burnt by the papists at last unless you go to mass you may stay for aught i care and joy go with you i thought i was doing you a kindness for my poor mothers sake but it seems you know best  if you like to cast in your lot with the pope i wash my hands of you  accordingly anne courtesied herself off not seriously alarmed as to the various catastrophes foretold by the princess though a little shaken in nerves  here then was another chance of promotion certainly without treason to her profession of faith but so offered that honour could not but revolt against it though in truth poor princess anne was neither so foolish nor so heartless a woman as she appeared in the excitement to which an uneasy conscience the expectation of a great enterprise and a certain amount of terror had worked her up but she had high words again in the evening as was supposed with the queen  certainly anne found her own royal mistress weeping and agitated though she only owned to being very anxious about the health of the king who had had a second violent attack of bleeding at the nose and she did not seem consoled by the assurances of her elder attendants that the relief had probably saved him from a far more dangerous attack  again anne read to her till a late hour but next morning was strangely disturbed  the royal household had not been long dressed and breakfast had just been served to the ladies when loud screams were heard most startling in the unsettled and anxious state of affairs  the queen pale and trembling came out of her chamber with her hair on her shoulders  tell me at once for pitys sake  is it my husband or my son she asked with clasped hands as two or three of the princesss servants rushed forward  the princess the princess was the cry the priests have murdered her  what have you done with her madam rudely demanded mrs buss one of the lost ladys nurses  mary beatrice drew herself up with grave dignity saying i suppose your mistress is where she likes to be  i know nothing of her but i have no doubt that you will soon hear of her  there was something in the queens manner that hushed the outcry in her presence but the women with lady clarendon foremost of them continued to seek up and down the two palaces as if they thought the substantial person of the princess anne could be hidden in a cupboard  anne in the first impulse exclaimed she is gone  in a moment mrs royer turned gone did you say  do you know it  you knew it and kept it secret cried lady strickland  a traitor too said lady oglethorpe in her vehement irish tone i would not have thought it of nanny moores daughter and she turned her eyes in sad reproach on anne  if you know tell me where she is gone cried mrs buss and the cry was reechoed by the other women while annes startled i cannot tell  i do not know was unheeded  only the queen raising her hand gravely said silence  what is this  miss woodford knew  and never told cried the babble of voices  come hither mistress woodford said the queen  tell me do you know where her highness is  no please your majesty said anne trembling from head to foot i do not know where she is  did you know of her purpose  your majesty pardon me  she called me to her closet yesterday and pledged me to secrecy before i knew what she would say  only youthful inexperience will permit that pledge to be implied in matters of state said the queen  continue mistress woodford what did she tell you  she said she feared to be made a hostage for the prince of denmark and meant to escape and she bade me come to her chamber at night to go with her  and wherefore did you not  you are of her religion said the queen bitterly  madam how could i break mine oath to your majesty and his royal highness  and you thought concealing the matter according to that oath  nay nay child i blame you not  it was a hard strait between your honour to her and your duty to the king and to me and i cannot but be thankful to any one who does regard her word  but this desertion will be a sore grief to his majesty  mary beatrice was fairerminded than the women who looked askance at the girl princess annes people resenting that one of the other household should have been chosen as confidante and the queens being displeased that the secret had been kept  but at that moment frightful yells and shouts arose and a hasty glance from the windows showed a mass of men women and children howling for their princess  they would tear down whitehall if she were not delivered up to them  however a line of helmeted lifeguards on their heavy horses was drawn up between with sabres held upright and there seemed no disposition to rush upon these  lord clarendon uncle to the princess had satisfied himself that she had really escaped and he now came out and assured the mob in a stentorian voice that he was perfectly satisfied of his nieces safety waving the letter she had left on her toilettable  the mob shouted bless the princess  hurrah for the protestant faith  no warmingpans but in a goodtempered mood and the poor little garrison breathed more freely but anne did not feel herself forgiven  she was in a manner sent to coventry and treated as if she were on the enemys side  never had her proud nature suffered so much and she shed bitter tears as she said to herself it is very unjust  what could i have done  how could i stop her highness from speaking  could they expect me to run in and accuse her  oh that i were at home again  mother mother you little know  of what use am i now  it was the very question asked by hester bridgeman whom she found packing her clothes in her room  take care that this is sent after me she said when a messenger i shall send calls for it  what you have your dismissal  no i should no more get it than you have done  they cannot afford to let any one go you see or they will have to dress up the chambermaids to stand behind the queens chair  i have settled it with my cousin harry bridgeman i shall mix with the throng that come to ask for news and be off with him before the crowd breaks in as they will some of these days for the guards are but half hearted  my portia why did not you take a good offer and go with the princess  i thought it would be base  and much you gained by it  you are only suspected and accused  i cant be a rat leaving a sinking ship  that is courteous but i forgive it portia as i know you will repent of your folly  but you never did know which side to look for the butter  perhaps seeing how ugly desertion and defection looked in others made constancy easier to anne much as she longed for the close at winchester and she even thought with a hope of the golden lamb gracechurch as an immediate haven sure to give her a welcome  her occupation of reading to the queen was ended by the kings return so physically exhausted by violent nosebleeding so despondent at the universal desertion and so brokenhearted at his daughters defection that his wife was absorbed in attending upon him  anne began to watch for an opportunity to demand a dismissal which she thought would exempt her from all blame but she was surprised and a little dismayed by being summoned to the king in the queens chamber  he was lying on a couch clad in a loose dressinggown instead of his laced coat and a red nightcap replacing his heavy peruke and his face was as white and sallow as if he were recovering from a long illness  little godchild he said holding out his hand as anne made her obeisance the queen tells me you can read well  i have a fancy to hear  immensely relieved at the kindness of his tone anne courtesied and murmured out her willingness  read this he said i would fain hear this my father loved it here  anne felt her task a hard one when the king pointed to the third act of shakespeares richard ii  she steeled herself and strengthened her voice as best she could and struggled on till she came to  ill give my jewels for a set of beads my gay apparel for an almsmans gown my figured goblets for a dish of wood my sceptre for a palmers walkingstaff my subjects for a pair of carved saints and my large kingdom for a little grave a little little grave  there she fairly broke down and sobbed  little one little one said james you are sorry for poor richard eh  oh sir was all she could say  and you are in disgrace they tell me because my daughter chose to try to entice you away said james and you felt bound not to betray her  never mind it was an awkward case of conscience and theres not too much faithfulness to spare in these days  we shall know whom to trust to another time  can you continue now  i would take a lesson how with mine own hands to give away my crown  it was well for anne that fresh tidings were brought in at that moment and she had to retire with the sore feeling turned into an enthusiastic pity and loyalty which needed the relief of sobs and mental vows of fidelity  she felt herself no longer in disgrace with her royal master and mistress but she was not in favour with her few companions leftall who could not get over her secrecy and thought her at least a half traitor as well as a heretic  whitehall was almost in a state of siege the turbulent mob continually coming to shout no popery and the like though they proceeded no farther  the ministers and other gentlemen came and went but the priests and the ladies durst not venture out for fear of being recognised and insulted if not injured  bad news came in from day to day and no tidings of the prince of wales being in safety in france  once anne received a letter from her uncle which cheered her much  dear childso far as i can gather your employment is at an end if it be true as reported that the prince of wales is at portsmouth with the intent that he should be carried to france but the gentlemen of the navy seem strongly disposed to prevent such a transportation of the heir of the realm to a foreign country  i fear me that you are in a state of doubt and anxiety but i need not exhort your good mothers child to be true and loyal to her trust and to the anointed of the lord in all things lawful at all costs  if you are left in any distress or perplexity go either to sir theophilus oglethorpes house or to that of my good old friend the dean of westminster and as soon as i hear from you i will endeavour to ride to town and bring you home to my house which is greatly at a loss without its young mistress  the letter greatly refreshed annes spirits and gave her something to look forward to giving her energy to stitch at a set of lawn cuffs and bands for her uncle and think with the more pleasure of a return that his time of residence at winchester lay between her and that vault in the castle  there were no more attempts made at her conversion  every one was too anxious and occupied and one or more of the chiefly obnoxious priests were sent privately away from day to day  while summer friends departed anne often thought of bishop kens counsel as to loyalty to heaven and man    chapter xx the flight   storms may rush in and crimes and woes    deform that peaceful bower they may not mar the deep repose    of that immortal flower though only broken hearts be found    to watch his cradle by no blight is on his slumbers sound    no touch of harmful eye  keble  the news was even worse and worse in that palace of despondency and terror  notice had arrived that lord dartmouth was withheld from despatching the young prince to france by his own scruples and those of the navy and orders were sent for the childs return  then came a terrible alarm  the escort sent to meet him were reported to have been attacked by the rabble on entering london and dispersed so that each man had to shift for himself  there was a quarter of an hour which seemed many hours of fearful suspense while king and queen both knelt at their altar praying in agony for the child whom they pictured to themselves in the hands of the infuriated mob too much persuaded of his being an imposture to pity his unconscious innocence  no one who saw the blanched cheeks and agonised face of mary beatrice or jamess stern mute misery could have believed for a moment in the cruel delusion that he was no child of theirs  the roman catholic women were with them  to enter the oratory would in those circumstances have been a surrender of principle but none the less did anne pray with fervent passion in her chamber for pity for the child and comfort for his parents  at last there was a stir and hurrying out to the great stair anne saw a man in plain clothes replying in an irish accent to the king who was supporting the queen with his arm  happily the escort had missed the prince of wales  they had been obliged to turn back to london without meeting him and from that danger he had been saved  a burst of tears and a cry of fervent thanksgiving relieved the queens heart and james gave eager thanks instead of the reprimand the colonel had expected for his blundering  a little later another messenger brought word that lord and lady powys had halted at guildford with their charge  a french gentleman monsieur de st victor was understood to have undertaken to bring him to londonunderstoodfor everything was whispered rather than told among the panicstricken women  no one who knew the expectation could go to bed that night except that the king and queen hadin order to disarm suspicionto go through the accustomed ceremonies of the coucher  the ladies sat or lay on their beds intently listening as hour after hour chimed from the clocks  at last at about three in the morning the challenge of the sentinels was heard from point to point  every one started up and hurried almost pellmell towards the postern door  the king and queen were both descending a stair leading from the kings dressing room and as the door was cautiously opened it admitted a figure in a fur cloak which he unfolded and displayed the sleeping face of the infant well wrapped from the december cold  with rapture the queen gathered him into her arms and the father kissed him with a vehemence that made him awake and cry  st victor had thought it safer that his other attendants should come in by degrees in the morning and thus miss woodford was the only actually effective nursery attendant at hand  his food was waiting by the fire in his own sleeping chamber and thither he was carried  there the queen held him on her lap while anne fed him and he smiled at her and held out his arms  the king came and making a sign to anne not to move stood watching  presently he said she has kept one secret we may trust her with another  oh not yet not yet implored the queen  now i have both my treasures again let me rest in peace upon them for a little while  the king turned away with eyes full of tears while anne was lulling the child to sleep  she wondered but durst not ask the queen where was the tilers wife but later she learnt from miss dunord that the woman had been so terrified by the cries of the multitude against the pretender and still more at the sight of the sea that she had gone into transports of fright implored to go home and perhaps half wilfully become useless so that the weaning already commenced had to be expedited and the fretfulness of the poor child had been one of the troubles for some days  however he seemed on his return to have forgotten his troubles and anne had him in her arms nearly all the next day  it was not till late in the evening that anne knew what the king had meant  then while she was walking up and down the room amusing the little prince with showing by turns the window and his face in a large mirror the queen came in evidently fresh from weeping and holding out her arms for him said after looking to see that there was no other audience  child the king would repose a trust in you  he wills that you should accompany me tonight on a voyage to france to put this little angel in safety  as your majesty will returned anne i will do my best  so the king said  he knew his brave sailors daughter was worthy of his trust and you can speak french  it is well for we go under the escort of messieurs de lauzun and st victor  be ready at midnight  lady strickland or the good labadie will explain more to you but do not speak of this to anyone else  you have leave now she added as she herself carried the child towards his fathers rooms  the maidens heart swelled at the trust reposed in her and the kings kind words and she kept back the sense of anxiety and doubt as to so vague a future  she found mrs labadie lying on her bed awake but trying to rest between two busy nights and she was then told that there was to be a flight from the palace of the queen and prince at midnight mrs labadie and anne alone going with them though lord and lady powys and lady strickland with the queens italian ladies would meet them on board the yacht which was waiting at gravesend  the nurse advised anne to put a few necessary equipments into a knapsack bound under a cloak and to leave other garments with her own in charge of mr labadie who would despatch them with those of the suite and would follow in another day with the king  doubt or refusal there could of course be none in such circumstances and a highspirited girl like anne could not but feel a thrill of heart at selection for such confidential and signal service at her age scarcely seventeen  her one wish was to write to her uncle what had become of her  mrs labadie hardly thought it safe but said her husband would take charge of a note and if possible post it when they were safe gone but nothing of the kings plans must be mentioned  the hours passed away anxiously and yet only too fast  so many had quitted the palace that there was nothing remarkable in packing but as anne collected her properties she could not help wondering whether she should ever see them again  sometimes her spirit rose at the thought of serving her lovely queen saving the little prince and fulfilling the kings trust at others she was full of vague depression at the thought of being cut off from all she knew and loved with seas between and with so little notice to her uncle who might never learn where she was but she knew she had his approval in venturing all and making any sacrifice for the king whom all deserted and she really loved her queen and little prince  the night came and she and mrs labadie fully equipped in cloaks and hoods waited together anne moving about restlessly the elder woman advising her to rest while she could  the little prince all unconscious of the dangers of the night or of his loss of a throne lay among his wraps in his cradle fast asleep  by and by the door opened and treading softly in came the king in his dressinggown and nightcap the queen closely muffled lady strickland also dressed for a journey and two gentlemen the one tall and strikinglooking the other slim and dark in their cloaks namely lauzun and st victor  it was one of those supreme moments almost beyond speech or manifestation of feeling  the king took his child in his arms kissed him and solemnly said to lauzun i confide my wife and son to you  both frenchmen threw themselves on their knees kissing his hand with a vow of fidelity  then giving the infant to mrs labadie james folded his wife in his arms in a long mute embrace anne carried the basket containing food for the child and first with a lantern went st victor then lauzun handing the queen mrs labadie with the child and anne following they sped down the stairs along the great gallery with steps as noiseless as they could make them down another stair to a door which st victor opened  a sentry challenged sending a thrill of dismay through the anxious hearts but st victor had the word and on they went into the privy gardens where often anne had paced behind mrs labadie as the prince took his airing  startling lights from the windows fell on them illuminating the drops of rain that plashed round them on that grim december night and their steps sounded on the gravel while still the babe sheltered under the cloak slept safely  another door was reached more sentries challenged and passed here was a street whose stones and silent houses shone for a little space as st victor raised his lantern and exchanged a word with a man on the box of a carriage  one by one they were handed in the queen the child the nurse anne and lauzun st victor taking his place outside  as if in a dream they rattled on through the dark street no one speaking except that lauzun asked the queen if she were wet  it was not far before they stopped at the top of the steps called the horseferry  a few lights twinkled here and there and were reflected trembling in the river otherwise a black awful gulf from which on st victors cautious hail a whistle ascended and a cloaked figure with a lantern came up the steps glistening in the rain  one by one again in deep silence they were assisted down and into the little boat that rocked ominously as they entered it  there the women crouched together over the child unable to see one another anne returning the clasp of a hand on hers believing it mrs labadies till on lauzuns exclaiming est ce que jincommode sa majeste the reply showed her that it was the queens hand that she held and she began a startled pardon your majesty but the sweet reply in italian was ah we are as sisters in this stress  the eager french voice of lauzun went on in undertones certainly but as if he had not the faculty of silence and amid the plash of the oars the rush of the river and the roar of the rain it was not easy to tell what he said his voice was only another of the noises though the queen made little courteous murmurs in reply  it was a hard pull against wind and tide towards a little speck of green light which was shown to guide the rowers and when at last they reached it st victors hail was answered by dusions one of the servants and they drew to the steps where he held a lantern  to the coach at once your majesty  it is at the innreadybut i feared to let it stand  lauzun uttered a french imprecation under his breath and danced on the step with impatience only restrained so far as to hand out the queen and her two attendants  he was hotly ordering off dusions and st victor to bring the coach when the former suggested that they must find a place for the queen to wait in where they could find her  what is that dark building above  lambeth church dusions answered  ah your protestant churches are not open there is no shelter for us there sighed the queen  there is shelter in the angle of the buttress i have been there your majesty said dusions  thither then they turned  what can that be exclaimed the queen starting and shuddering as a fierce light flashed in the windows and played on the wall  it is not within madame lauzun encouraged it is reflected light from a fire somewhere on the other side of the river  a bonfire for our expulsion  ah why should they hate us so sighed the poor queen  tis worse than that only theres no need to tell her majesty so whispered mrs labadie who in the difficulties of the ascent had been fain to hand the stillsleeping child to anne  tis the catholic chapel of st roque  the heretic miscreants  pray heaven no life be lost sighed anne  sinister as the light was it aided the poor fugitives at that dead hour of night to find an angle between the church wall and a buttress where the eaves afforded a little shelter from the rain which slackened a little when they were a little concealed from the road so that the light need not betray them in case any passenger was abroad at such an hour as two chimed from the clock overhead  the women kept together close against the wall to avoid the drip of the eaves  lauzun walked up and down like a sentinel his arms folded and talking all the while though as before his utterances were only an accompaniment to the falling rain and howling wind mary beatrice was murmuring prayers over the sleeping child which she now held in the innermost corner anne with widestretched eyes was gazing into the light cast beyond the buttress by the fire on the opposite side when again there passed across it that form she had seen on all saints evethe unmistakable phantom of peregrine  it was gone into the darkness in another second but a violent start on her part had given a note of alarm and brought back the count whose walk had been in the opposite direction  what was it  any spy  oh nononothing  it was the face of one who is dead gasped anne  the poor childs nerve is failing her said the queen gently as lauzun drawing his sword burst out  if it be a spy it shall be the face of one who is dead and he darted into the road but returned in a few moments saying no one had passed except one of the rowers returning after running up to the inn to hasten the coach how could he have been seen from the church wall  the wheels were heard drawing up at that moment so that the only thought was to enter it as quickly as might be in the same order as before after which the start was made along the road that led through the marshes of lambeth and then came the inquiry an anxious onewhom or what mademoiselle as lauzun called her had seen  o monsieur exclaimed the poor girl in her confusion her best french failing it was nothingno living man  can mademoiselle assure me of that  the dead i fear not the living i would defy  he lives not said she in an undertone with a shudder  but who is he that mademoiselle can be so certain asked the frenchman  oh  i know him well enough said anne unable to control her voice  mademoiselle must explain herself said m de lauzun  if he be spiritor phantomthere is no more to say but if he be in the flesh and a spythen  there was a little rattle of his sword  speak i command interposed the queen you must satisfy m le comte  thus adjured anne said in a low voice of horror  it was a gentleman of our neighbourhood he was killed in a duel last summer  ah  you are certain  i had the misfortune to see the fight sighed anne  that accounts for it said the queen kindly  if mademoiselles nerves were shaken by such a remembrance it is not wonderful that it should recur to her at so strange a watch as we have been keeping  it might account for her seeing this revenant cavalier in any passenger said lauzun not satisfied yet  no one ever was like him said anne  i could not mistake him  may i ask mademoiselle to describe him continued the count  feeling all the time as if this first mention were a sort of betrayal anne faltered the words  small slight almost misshapenwith a strange onesided lookodd unusual features  lauzuns laugh jarred on her  eh it is not a flattering portrait mademoiselle is not haunted by a hero of romance it appears so much as by a demon  and none of those monsieur has employed in our escape answer to that description asked the queen  assuredly not your majesty  crooked person and crooked mind go together and st victor would only have trusted to your big honest rowers of the tamise  i think we may be satisfied that the demoiselles imagination was excited so as to evoke a phantom impressed on her mind by a previous scene of terror  such things have happened in my native gascony  anne was fain to accept the theory in silence though it seemed to her strange that at a moment when she was for once not thinking of peregrine her imagination should conjure him up and there was a strong feeling within her that it was something external that had flitted across the shadow not a mere figment of her brain though the notion was evidently accepted and she could hear a muttering of mrs labadie that this was the consequence of employing young wenches with their whims and megrims  the count de lauzun did his best to entertain the queen with stories of revenants in gascony and elsewhere and with reminiscences of his eleven years captivity at pignerol and his intercourse with fouquet but whenever in aftertimes anne woodford tried to recall her nocturnal drive with this strange personage the chosen and very unkind husband of the poor old grande mademoiselle she never could recollect anything but the fierce glare of his eyes in the light of the lamps as he put her to that terrible interrogation  the talk was chiefly monologue  mrs labadie certainly slept perhaps the queen did so too and anne became conscious that she must have slumbered likewise for she found every one gazing at her in the pale morning dawn and asking why she cried o charles hold  as she hastily entreated pardon lauzun was heard to murmur je parie que le revenant se nomme charles and she collected her senses just in time to check her contradiction recollecting that happily such a name as charles revealed nothing  the little prince who had slumbered so opportunely all night awoke and received infinite praise and what he better appreciated the food that had been provided for him  they were near their journeys end and it was well for people were awakening and going to their work as they passed one of the villages and once the remark was heard there goes a coach full of papists  however no attempt was made to stop the party and as it would be daylight when they reached gravesend the queen arranged her disguise to resemble as she hoped a washerwomantaking off her gloves and hiding her hair while the prince happily again asleep was laid in a basket of linen  anne could not help thinking that she thus looked more remarkable than if she had simply embarked as a lady but she meant to represent the attendant of her italian friend countess almonde whom she was to meet on board  leaving the coach outside a little block of houses the party reached a projecting point of land where three irish officers received them and conducted them to a boat  then wrapped closely in cloaks from the chill morning air they were rowed to the yacht on the deck of which stood lord and lady powys lady strickland pauline dunord and a few more faithful followers who had come more rapidly  there was no open greeting nor recognition for the captain and crew were unaware whom they were carrying and on the discovery either for fear of danger or hope of reward might have captured such a prize  therefore all the others with whispered apologies were hoisted up before her and countess almonde had to devise a special entreaty that the chair might be lowered again for her poor laundress as well as for the other two women  the yacht which had been hired by st victor at once spread her sails mrs labadie conversed with the captain while the countess took the queen below into the stifling crowded little cabin  it was altogether a wretched voyage the wind was high and the pitching and tossing more or less disabled everybody in the suite  the queen was exceedingly ill so were the countess and mrs labadie  nobody could be the least effective but signora turini who waited on her majesty and anne who was so far seasoned by excursions at portsmouth that she was capable of taking sole care of the little prince as the little vessel dashed along on her way with her cargo of alarm and suffering through the dutch fleet of fifty vessels none of which seemed to notice herperhaps by express desire not to be too curious as to english fugitives  between the care of the little one who needed in the tossing of the ship to be constantly in arms though he never cried and when awake was always merry and the giving as much succour as possible to her suffering companions anne could not either rest or think but seemed to live in one heavy dazed dream of weariness and endurance hardly knowing whether it were day or night till the welcome sound was heard that calais was in sight  then as well as they could the poor travellers crawled from the corners and put themselves in such array as they could contrive though the heaving of the waves as the little yacht lay to did not conduce to their recovery  the count de lauzun went ashore as soon as a boat could be lowered to apprise m charot the governor of calais of the guest he was to receive and after an interval of considerable discomfort in full view of the massive fortifications boats came off to bring the queen and her attendants on shore this time as a queen though she refused to receive any honours  lady strickland recovering as soon as she was on dry land resumed her prince who was fondled with enthusiastic praises for his excellent conduct on the voyage  anne could not help feebly thinking some of the credit might be due to her since she had held him by land and water nearly ever since leaving whitehall but she was too much worn out by her nights of unrest and too much battered and beaten by the tossings of her voyage to feel anything except in a languid halfconscious way under a racking headache and when the curious old house where they were to rest was reached and all the rest were eating with ravenous appetites she could taste nothing and being conducted by a compassionate frenchwoman in a snowwhite towering cap to a straw mattress spread on the ground she slept the twentyfour hours round without moving    chapter xxi exile   oh who are ye young man she said what country come ye frae i flew across the sea he said twas but this very day  old ballad  five months had passed away since the midnight flight from england when anne woodford was sitting on a stone bench flanked with statues in the stately gardens of the palace of st germain working away at some delicate point lace destined to cover some of the deficiencies of her dress for her difficulties were great and these months had been far from happy ones  the king was in ireland the queen spent most of the time of his absence in convents either at poissy or chaillot carrying her son with her to be the darling of the nuns who had for the most part never even seen a baby and to whom a bright lively child of a year old was a perfect treasure of delight  not wishing to encumber the good sisters with more attendants than were needful the queen only took with her one lady governess one nurse and one rocker and this last naturally was pauline dunord both a frenchwoman and a roman catholic  this was in itself no loss to anne  her experience of the nunnery at boulogne where had been spent three days in expectation of the king had not been pleasant  the nuns had shrunk from her as a heretic and kept their novices and pensionnaires from the taint of communication with her and all the honour she might have deserved for the queens escape seemed to have been forfeited by that moment of fear which in the telling had become greatly exaggerated  it was true that the queen had never alluded to it but probably through mrs labadie it had become current that miss woodford had been so much alarmed under the churchyard wall that her fancy had conjured up a phantom and she had given a loud scream which but for the mercy of the saints would have betrayed them all  anne was persuaded that she had done nothing worse than give an involuntary start but it was not of the least use to say so and she began to think that perhaps others knew better than she did miss dunord who had never been more than distantly polite to her in england was of course more thrown with her at st germain and examined her closely  who was it  what was it  had she seen it before  it was of no use to deny  pauline knew she had seen something on that all saints eve  was it true that it was a lover of hers and that she had seen him killed in a duel on her account who would have imagined it in cette demoiselle si sage  would she not say who it was  but though truth forced more than one affirmative to be pumped out of anne she clung to that last shred of concealment and kept her own counsel as to the time place and persons of the duel and thus she so far offended pauline as to prevent that damsel from having any scruples in regarding her as an obnoxious and perilous rival with a dark secret in her life  certainly miss dunord did earnestly assure her that to adopt her church invoke the saints and have masses for the dead was the only way to lay such ghosts but anne remained obdurate and thus was isolated for there were very few protestants in the fugitive court and those were of too high a degree to consort with her  perhaps that undefined doubt of her discretion was against her perhaps too her education and knowledge of languages became less useful to the queen when surrounded by french for she was no longer called upon to act as reader and the little prince during his residence in the convent had time to forget her and lose his preference for her  she was not discharged but except for taking her turn as a nurserymaid when the prince was at st germain she was a mere supernumerary nor was there any salary forthcoming  the small amount of money she had with her had dwindled away and when she applied to lady strickland who was kinder to her than any one else she was told that the queen was far too much distressed for money wherewith to aid the king to be able to pay any one and that they must all wait till the king had his own again  her clothes were wearing out and scarcely in condition for attendance on the prince when he was shown in state to the king of france  worse than all she seemed entirely cut off from home she had written several times to her uncle when opportunity seemed to offer but had never heard from him and she did not know whether her letters could reach him or if he were even aware of what had become of her  people came with passports from england to join the exiled court but no one returned thither or she would even have offered herself as a waitingmaid to have a chance of going back lady strickland would have forwarded her but no means or opportunity offered and there was nothing for it but to look to the time that everybody declared to be approaching when the king was to be reinstated and they would all go home in triumph  meanwhile anne woodford felt herself a supernumerary treated with civility and no more as she ate her meals with a very feminine court for almost all the gentlemen were in ireland with the king she had a room in the entresol to herself in paulines absence and here she could in turn sit and dream or mend and furbish up her clothesa serious matter nowor read the least scrap of printed matter in her way for books were scarcer than even at whitehall and though her mail had safely been forwarded by mr labadie some jealous censor had abstracted her bible and prayerbook  probably there was no english service anywhere in france at that time unless among the merchants at bordeauxcertainly neither english nor reformed was within her reachand she had to spend her sundays in recalling all she could and going over it feeling thankful to the mother who had made her store psalms gospels and collects in her memory week by week  she was so far forgotten that active attempts to convert her had been dropped except by pauline  perhaps it was thought that isolation would be effectual but in fact the sight of popular romanism not kept in check by protestant surroundings shocked her and made her far more averse to change than when she saw it at its best at whitehall  in fine the end of her ambition had been neglect and poverty and the real service that she had rendered was unacknowledged and marred by that momentary alarm  no wonder she felt sore  she had never once been to paris and seldom beyond the gardens which happily were free in the absence of the queen and always had secluded corners apart from the noble terraces safe from the intrusion of idle gallants  anne had found a sort of bower of her own shaded by honeysuckles and wild roses where she could sit looking over the slopes and the windings of the seine and indulge her musings and longings  the lonely life brought before her all the anxieties that had been stifled for the time by the agitations of the escape  again and again she lived over the scene in the ruins  again and again she recalled those two strange appearances and shivering at the thought of the anniversary that was approaching in another month still felt sometimes that alive or dead peregrines would be a home face and framed to herself imaginary scenes in which she addressed him and demanded whether he could not rest in his unhallowed grave  what would bishop ken say  sometimes even she recollected the strange theory which had made him crave execution from the late king seven years yes a little more than seven years ago and marvel whether at that critical epoch he had indeed between life and death been snatched away to his native land of faery  imagination might well run riot in the solitary unoccupied condition to which she was reduced and she also brooded much over the fragments of doubtful news which reached her  something was said of all loyal clergy being expelled and persecuted and this of course suggested those sufferings of the clergy during the commonwealth of which she had often heard making her very anxious about her uncle and earnestly long for wings to fly to him  the archfields too  had charles returned and did that secret press upon him as it did upon her  did lucy think herself utterly forgotten and cast aside receiving no word or message from her friend  perhaps thought anne they fancy me sailing about at court in silks and satins jewels and curls and forgetting them all as i remember lucy said i should when she first heard that i was going to whitehall  nay and i even took pleasure in the picture of myself so decked out though i never never meant to forget her  foolish worse than foolish that i was  and to think that i might now be safe and happy with good lady russell near my uncle and all of them  i could almost laugh to think how my fine notions of making my fortune have ended in sitting here neglected forgotten banished almost in rags  i suppose it was all self seeking and that i must take it meekly as no more than i deserve but oh how different how different is this captivity  oh that i had wings like a dove for then would i flee away and be at rest swallow swallow you are sweeping through the air  would that my spirit could fly like you if only for one glimpse to tell me what they are doing  ah theres some one coming down this unfrequented walk where i thought myself safe  a young gentleman  i must rise and go as quietly as i can before he sees me  nay as the action following the impulse she was gathering up her work tis an old abbe with him no fear  abbe  nay tis liker to an english clergyman  can a banished one have strayed hither  the younger man is in mourning  could it be  no graver older more manlyoh  anne  anne  we have found you  mr archfield  you  and as charles archfield in true english fashion kissed her cheek anne fairly choked with tears of joy and she ever after remembered that moment as the most joyful of her life though the joy was almost agony  this is mistress anne woodford sir said charles the next moment  allow me madam to present mr fellowes of magdalen college  anne held out her hand and courtesied in response to the bow and wave of the shovel hat  how did you know that i was here she said  doctor woodford thought it likely and begged us to come and see whether we could do anything for you said charles and you may believe that we were only too happy to do so  a lady to whom we had letters who is half english the vicomtesse de bellaise was so good as to go to the convent at poissy and discover for us from some of the suite where you were  my unclemy dear uncleis he well  quite well when last we heard said charles  that was at florence nearly a month ago  and all at fareham are they well  all just as usual said charles at the last hearing which was at the same time  i hoped to have met letters at paris but no doubt the war prevents the mails from running  ah  i have never had a single letter said anne  did my uncle know anything of me  has he never had one of mine  up to the time when he wrote last march that is to say he had received nothing  he had gone to london to make inquiries  ah my dear good uncle  and had ascertained that you had been chosen to accompany the queen and prince in their escape from whitehall  you have played the heroine miss anne  oh if you knew  and said mr fellowes both he and sir philip archfield requested us if we could make our way home through paris to come and offer our services to mistress woodford in case she should wish to send intelligence to england or if she should wish to make use of our escort to return home  oh sir oh sir how can i thank you enough  you cannot guess the happiness you have brought me cried anne with clasped hands tears welling up again  you will come with us then cried charles  i am sure you ought  they have not used you well anne how pale and thin you have grown  that is only pining  i am quite well only homesick she said with a smile  i am sure the queen will let me go  i am nothing but a burthen now  she has plenty of her own people and they do not like a protestant about the prince  there is madame de bellaise said mr fellowes advancing along the walk with lady powys  let me present you to her  you have succeeded i see a kind voice said as anne found herself making her courtesy to a tall and stately old lady with a mass of hair of the peculiar silvered tint of flaxen mixed with white  i am sincerely glad said lady powys that miss woodford has met her friends  also said madame de bellaise lady powys is good enough to say that if mademoiselle will honour me with a visit she gives permission for her to return with me to paris  this was still greater joy except for that one recollection formidable in the midst of her joy of her dress  did madame de bellaise divine something for she said these times remind me of my youth when we poor cavalier families well knew what sore straits were  if mademoiselle will bring what is most needful the rest can be sent afterwards  making her excuses for the moment anne with light and gladsome foot sped along the stately alley up the stairs to her chamber round which she looked much as if it had been a prison cell fell on her knees in a gush of intense thankfulness and made her rapid preparations her hands trembling with joy and a fear that she might wake to find all again a dream  she felt as if this deliverance were a token of forgiveness for her past wilfulness and as if hope were opened to her once more  lady powys met her as she came down and spoke very kindly thanking her for her services and hoping that she would enjoy the visit she was about to make  does your ladyship think her majesty will require me any longer asked anne timidly  if you wish to return to the country held by the prince of orange said the countess coldly you must apply for dismissal to her majesty herself  anne perceived from the looks of her friends that it was no time for discussing her loyalty and all taking leave she was soon seated beside madame de bellaise while the coach and four rolled down the magnificent avenue and scene after scene disappeared beautiful and stately indeed but which she was as glad to leave behind her as if they had been the fetters and bars of a dungeon and she almost wondered at the words of admiration of her companions  madame de bellaise sat back and begged the others to speak english saying that it was her mother tongue and she loved the sound of it but really trying to efface herself while the eager conversation between the two young people went on about their homes  charles had not been there more recently than anne and his letters were at least two months old but the intelligence in them was as water to her thirsty soul  all was well she heard including the little heir of archfield though the young father coloured a little and shuffled over the answers to the inquiries with a rather sad smile  charles was however greatly improved  he had left behind him the loutish unformed boy and had become a handsome courteous wellmannered gentleman  the very sight of him handing madame de bellaise in and out of her coach was a wonder in itself when anne recollected how he had been wont to hide himself in the shrubbery to prevent being called upon for such services and how uncouthly in the last extremity he would perform them  madame de bellaise was inhabiting her sons great hotel de nidemerle  he was absent in garrison and she was presiding over the family of grandchildren their mother being in bad health  so much anne heard before she was conducted to a pleasant little bedroom far more homelike and comfortable than in any of the palaces she had inhabited  it opened into another whence merry young voices were heard  that is the apartment of my sisters youngest daughter said madame de bellaise noemi darpent  i borrowed her for a little while to teach her french and dancing but now that we are gone to war they want to have her back again and it will be well that she should avail herself of the same escort as yourself  all will then be selon les convenances which had been a difficulty to me she added with a laugh  then opening the door of communication she said here noemi we have found your countrywoman and i put her under your care  ah you two chattering little pies i knew the voices were yours  this is my granddaughter marguerite de nidemerle and my niecea la mode de bretagnececile daubepine all bestowing their chatter on their cousin  noemi darpent was a tall fair gravefaced maiden some years over twenty and so thoroughly english that it warmed annes heart to look at her and the other two were bright little frenchwomen marguerite a pretty blonde cecile pale dark and sallow but full of life  both were at the age at which girls were usually in convents but as anne learnt madame de bellaise was too english at heart to give up the training of her grandchildren and she had an english governess for them daughter to a romanist cavalier ruined by sequestration  she was evidently the absolute head of the family  her daughterin law was a delicate little creature who scarcely seemed able to bear the noise of the family at the long suppertable when all talked with shrill french voices from the two youths and their abbe tutor down to the little fouryearold lolotte in her high chair  but to anne after the tedious formality of the second table at the palace stiff without refinement this free family life was perfectly delightful and refreshing though as yet she was too much cramped as it were by long stiffness silence and treatment as an inferior to join except by the intelligent dancing of her brown eyes and replies when directly addressed  after mrs labadies homeliness paulines exclusive narrowness janes petty frivolity hesters vulgar worldliness and the general want of cultivation in all who treated her on an equality it was like returning to rational society and she could not but observe that mr archfield altogether held his own in conversation with the rest whether in french or english  little more than a year ago he would hardly have opened his mouth and would have worn the true bumpkin look of contemptuous sheepishness  now he laughed and made others laugh as readily and politely asah  with whom was she comparing him  did the thought of poor peregrine dwell on his mind as it did upon hers  but perhaps things were not so terrible to a man as to a woman and he had not seen those apparitions  indeed when not animated she detected a certain thoughtful melancholy on his brow which certainly had not belonged to former times  mr fellowes early made known to anne that her uncle had asked him to be her banker and the first care of her kind hostess was to assist her in supplying the deficiencies of her wardrobe so that she was able to go abroad without shrinking at her own shabby appearance  the next thing was to take her to poissy to request her dismissal from the queen without which it would be hardly decorous to depart though in point of fact in the present state of affairs as noemi said there was nothing to prevent it  no said mr fellowes but for that reason miss woodford would feel bound to show double courtesy to the discrowned queen  and she has often been very kind to mei love her much said anne  noemi is a little whig said madame de bellaise  i shall not take her with us because i know her father would not like it but to me it is only like the days of my youth to visit an exiled queen will these gentlemen think fit to be of the party  thank you madam not i said the magdalen man  i am very sorry for the poor lady but my college has suffered too much at her husbands hands for me to be very anxious to pay her my respects and if my young friend will take my advice neither will he  it might be bringing his father into trouble  to this charles agreed so m labbe undertook to show them the pictures at the louvre and anne and madame de bellaise were the only occupants of the carriage that conveyed them to the great old convent of poissy the girl enjoying by the way the comfort of the kindness of a motherly woman though even to her there could be no confiding of the terrible secret that underlay all her thoughts madame de bellaise however said how glad she was to secure this companionship for her niece  noemi had been more attached than her family realised to claude merrycourt a neighbour who had had the folly contrary to her prudent fathers advice to rush into monmouths rebellion and it had only been by the poor girls agony when he suffered under the summary barbarities of kirke that her mother had known how much her heart was with him  the depression of spirits and loss of health that ensued had been so alarming that when madame de bellaise after some months paid a long visit to her sister in england mrs darpent had consented to send the girl to make acquaintance with her french relations and try the effect of change of scene  she had gone indifferent passive and broken hearted but her aunt had watched over her tenderly and she had gradually revived not indeed into a joyous girl but into a calm and fairly cheerful woman  when she had left home france and england were only too closely connected but now they were at daggers drawn and probably would be so for many years and the revolution had come so suddenly that madame de bellaise had not been able to make arrangements for her nieces return home and noemi was anxiously waiting for an opportunity of rejoining her parents  the present plan was this  madame de bellaises son the marquis de nidemerle was governor of douai where his son the young baron de ribaumont with his cousin the chevalier daubepine were to join him with their tutor the abbe leblanc  the war on the flemish frontier was not just then in an active state and there were often friendly relations between the commandants of neighbouring garrisons so that it might be possible to pass a party on to the spanish territory with a flag of truce and then the way would be easy  this passing however would be impossible for noemi alone since etiquette would not permit of her thus travelling with the two young gentlemen nor could she have proceeded after reaching douai so that the arrival of the two englishmen and the company of miss woodford was a great boon  madame de bellaise had already despatched a courier to ask her son whether he could undertake the transit across the frontier and hoped to apply for passports as soon as his answer was received  she told anne her nieces history to prevent painful allusions on the journey  ah madame said anne we too have a sad day connected with that unfortunate insurrection  we grieved over lady lisle and burnt with indignation  m barillon tells me that her judge the lord chancellor was actually forced to commit himself to the tower to escape being torn to pieces by the populace and it is since reported that he has there died of grief and shame  i should think his prison cell must have been haunted by hundreds of ghosts  i pray you madame do you believe that there are apparitions  i have heard of none that were not explained by some accident or else were the produce of an excited brain and anne said no more on that head though it was a comfort to tell of her own foolish preference for the chances of court preferment above the security of lady russells household and madame de bellaise smiled and said her experience of courts had not been too agreeable  and thus they reached poissy where queen mary beatrice had separate rooms set apart for visitors and thus did not see them from behind the grating but face to face  you wish to leave me signorina she said using the appellation of their more intimate days as anne knelt to kiss her hand  i cannot wonder  a poor exile has nothing wherewith to reward the faithful  ah your majesty that is not the cause if i were of any use to you or to his royal highness  true signorina you have been faithful and aided me to the best of your power in my extremity but while you will not embrace the true faith i cannot keep you about the person of my son as he becomes more intelligent  therefore it may be well that you should leave us until such time as we shall be recalled to our kingdom when i hope to reward you more suitably  you loved my son and he loved youperhaps you would like to bid him farewell  for this anne was very grateful and the prince was sent for by the mother who was too proud of him to miss any opportunity of exhibiting him to an experienced mother and grandmother like the vicomtesse  he was a year old and had become a very beautiful child with large dark eyes like his mothers and when mrs labadie carried him in he held out his arms to anne with a cry of glad recognition that made her feel that if she could have been allowed the charge of him she could hardly have borne to part with him  and when the final leavetaking came the queen made his little hand present her with a little gold locket containing his soft hair with a j in seed pearls outside in memory said mary beatrice of that night beneath the church wall  ah yes you had your moment of fear but we were all in terror and you hushed him well  thus with another kiss to the white hand returned on her own forehead ended anne jacobinas court life  never would she be jacobina againalways anne or sweet nancy  it was refreshing to be so called when charles archfield let the name slip out then blushed and apologised while she begged him to resume it which he was now far too correct to do in public  noemi quite readily adopted it  i am tired of fine french names she said  an english voice is quite refreshing and do you call me naomi not noemi  i did not mind it so much at first because my father sometimes called me so after his good old mother who was bred a huguenot but it is like the first step towards home to hear naomilittle omy as my brothers used to shout over the stairs  that was a happy fortnight  madame de bellaise said it would be a shame to let anne have spent a half year in france and have seen nothing so she took the party to the theatre where they saw the cid with extreme delight  she regretted that the season was so far advanced that the winter representations of esther at st cyr by the young ladies were over but she invited m racine for an evening when mr fellowes took extreme pleasure in his conversation and he was prevailed on to read some of the scenes she also used her entree at court to enable them to see the fountains at versailles which winchester was to have surpassed but for king charless death  just as well otherwise remarked charles to anne  these fine feathers and flowers of spray are beautiful enough in themselves but give me the clear old itchen not tortured into playing tricks with all the trout killed and the open down instead of all these terraces and marble steps where one feels as cramped as if it were a perpetual minuet  and look at the cost  ah you will know what i mean when we travel through the country  another sight was from a gallery whence they beheld the king eat his dinner alone at a silverloaded table and a lengthy ceremony it was  four plates of soup to begin with a whole capon with ham followed by a melon mutton salad garlic pate de foie gras fruit and confitures  charles really grew so indignant that in spite of his newlyacquired politeness anne who knew his countenance was quite glad when she saw him safe out of hearing  the old glutton he said i should like to put him on a diet of buckwheat and sawdust like his poor peasants for a week and then see whether he would go on gormandising with his wars and his buildings starving his poor  it is almost enough to make a whig of a man to see what we might have come to  how can you bear it madame  alas we are powerless said the vicomtesse  a seigneur can do little for his people but in anjou we have some privileges and our peasants are better off than those you have seen though indeed i grieved much for them when first i came among them from england  she was perhaps the less sorry that paris was nearly emptied of fashionable society since her guest had the less chance of uttering dangerous sentiments before those who might have repeated them and much as she liked him she was relieved when letters came from her son undertaking to expedite them on their way provided they made haste to forestall any outbreak of the war in that quarter  meantime naomi and anne had been drawn much nearer together by a common interest  the door between their rooms having some imperfection in the latch swung open as they were preparing for bed and anne was aware of a sound of sobbing and saw one of the white capped shortpetticoated femmes de chambre kneeling at naomis feet ejaculating oh take me take me mademoiselle  madame is an angel of goodness but i cannot go on living a lie  i shall do something dreadful  poor suzanne poor suzanne naomi was answering  i will do what i can i will see if it is possible  they started at the sound of the step suzanne rising to her feet in terror but naomi signing to anne and saying it is only mademoiselle woodford a good protestant suzanne  go now i will see what can be done i know my aunt would like to send a maid with us  then as suzanne went out with her apron to her eyes and anne would have apologised she said never mind i must have told you and asked your help  poor suzanne she is one of the rotrous an old race of huguenot peasants whom my aunt always protected she would protect any one but these people had a special claim because they sheltered our greatgrandmother lady walwyn when she fled after the s barthelemi  when the edict of nantes was revoked the two brothers fled  i believe she helped them and they got on board ship and brought a token to my father but the old mother was feeble and imbecile and could not move and the monks and the dragoons frightened and harassed this poor wench into what they called conforming  when the mother died my aunt took suzanne and taught her and thought she was converted and indeed if all papists were like my aunt it would not be so hard to become one  oh yes  i know others like that  but this poor suzanne knowing that she only was converted out of terror has always had an uneasy conscience and the sight of me has stirred up everything  she says though i do not know if it be true that she was fast drifting into bad habits when finding my bible though it was english and she could not read it seems to have revived everything and recalled the teaching of her good old father and pastor and now she is wild to go to england with us  you will take her exclaimed anne  of course i will  perhaps that is what i was sent here for  i will ask her of my aunt and i think she will let me have her  you will keep her secret anne  indeed i will  madame de bellaise granted suzanne to her niece without difficulty evidently guessing the truth but knowing the peril of the situation too well to make any inquiry  perhaps she was disappointed that her endeavours to win the girl to her church had been ineffectual but to have any connection with one relapsed was so exceedingly perilous that she preferred to ignore the whole subject and merely let it be known that suzanne was to accompany mademoiselle darpent and this was only disclosed to the household on the very last morning after the passports had been procured and the mails packed and she hushed any remark of the two english girls in such a decided manner as quite startled them by the manifest need of caution  we should have come to that if king james were still allowed to have his own way said naomi  oh no we are too english said anne  our generation might not see it said naomi but who can be safe when a popish king can override law  oh i shall breathe more freely when i am on the other side of the channel  my aunt is much too good for this place and they dont approve of her and keep her down    chapter xxii revenants   but soft behold lo where it comes again ill cross it though it blast me  hamlet  floods of tears were shed at the departure of the two young officers of sixteen and seventeen  the sobs of the household made the english party feel very glad when it was over and the cavalcade was in motion  a cavalcade it was for each gentleman rode and so did his bodyservant and each horse had a mounted groom  the two young officers had besides each two chargers requiring a groom and horse boy and each conducted half a dozen fresh troopers to join the army  a coach was the regulation mode of travelling for ladies but both the english girls had remonstrated so strongly that madame de bellaise had consented to their riding though she took them and suzanne the first days journey well beyond the ken of the parisians in her own carriage as far as senlis where there was a fresh parting with the two lads fewer tears and more counsel and encouragement with many fond messages to her son many to her sister in england and with affectionate words to her niece a whisper to her to remember that she would not be in a protestant country till she reached holland or england  the last sight they had of the tall dignified figure of the old lady was under the arch of the cathedral where she was going to pray for their safety  suzanne was to ride on a pillion behind the swiss valet of mr fellowes whom naomi had taken into her confidence and the two young ladies each mounted a stout pony  mr fellowes had made friends with the abbe leblanc who was of the old gallican type by no means virulently set against anglicanism and also a highly cultivated man so that they had many subjects in common besides the question of english catholicity  the two young cousins ribaumont and daubepine were chiefly engaged in looking out for sport setting their horses to race with one another and the like in which charles archfield sometimes took a share but he usually rode with the two young ladies and talked to them very pleasantly of his travels in italy the pictures and antiquities which had made into an interesting reality the studies that he had hated when a boy also the condition of the country he had seen with a mind which seemed to have opened and enlarged with a sudden start beyond the interests of the next foxhunt or game at bowls  all were as he had predicted greatly shocked at the aspect of the country through which they passed  the meagre crops ripening for harvest the hay carts sometimes drawn by an equally lean cow and woman the haggard women bearing heavy burthens and the ragged barefooted children leading a wretched cow or goat to browse by the wayside the gaunt men toiling at roadmending with their poor starved horses or at their seigneurs work alike unpaid even when drawn off from their own harvests  and in the villages the only sound buildings were the church and presbytere by its side the dwellings being miserable hovels almost sunk into the earth an old crone or two marvels of skinniness spinning at the door or younger women making lace and nearly naked children rushing out to beg  sometimes the pepperbox turrets of a chateau could be seen among distant woods or the walls of a cloister with a taper spire in the midst among greener fields and the towns were approached through long handsome avenues and their narrow streets had a greater look of prosperity while their inns being on the way to the place of warfare were almost luxurious with a choice of dainty meats and good wines  everywhere else was misery and naomi said it was the vain endeavour to reform the source of these grievances that had forced her father to become an exile from his native country and that he had much apprehended that the same blight might gradually be brought over his adopted land on which charles stood up for the constitution and for the resolute character of englishmen and anne as in duty bound for the good intentions of her godfather  thus they argued and anne not only felt herself restored to the company of rational beings but greatly admired charless sentiments and the ability with which he put them forward and now and then the thought struck her and with a little twinge of pain of which she was ashamed would naomi darpent be the healer of the wound nearly a year old and find in him consolation for the hero of her girlhood  somehow there would be a sense of disappointment in them both if so it were  at length the spires and towers of douai came in sight fenced in by stern lines of fortification according to the science of vauban smooth slopes of glacis with the terrible muzzles of cannon peeping out on the summits of the ramparts and the line of salient angle and ravelin with the moat around beautiful though formidable  the marquis de nidemerle had sent a young officer and sergeants party to meet the travellers several miles off and bring them unquestioned through the outposts of the frontier town so closely watched in this time of war and at about half a mile from the gates he himself with a few attendants rode out all glittering and clanking in their splendid uniforms and accoutrements  he doffed his hat with the heavy white plume and bowed his greeting to the ladies and clergymen but both the young frenchmen after a military salute hastily dismounted and knelt on one knee while he sprang from his horse and then making the sign of the cross over his son raised him and folding him in his arms pressed him to his breast and kissed him on each cheek not without tears then repeated the same greeting with young daubepine  he then kissed the hand of his belle cousine whom of course he knew already and bowed almost to the ground on being presented to mademoiselle woodford a little less low to monsieur archfield who was glad the embracing was not to be repeated politely received mr fellowes and honoured the domestic abbe with a kindly word and nod  the gradation was amusing and he was a magnificent figure with his noble horse and grand military dress while his fine straight features sunburnt though naturally fair and his tall powerful frame well became his surroundingsa true white ribaumont as naomi said as she looked at the long fair hair drawn back and tied with ribbon  he is just like the portrait of our greatgrandfather who was almost killed on the s barthelemi  however naomi had no more time to talk of him for he rode by her side inquiring for his mother wife and children but carefully doing the honours to the stranger lady and gentleman  moat and drawbridge there were at portsmouth and a sentry at the entrance but here there seemed endless guards moats bridges and gates and there was a continual presenting of arms and acknowledging of salutes as the commandant rode in with the travellers  it was altogether a very new experience in life  they were lodged in the governors quarters in the fortress where the accommodation for ladies was of the slenderest and m de nidemerle made many apologies though he had evidently given up his own sleeping chamber to the two ladies who would have to squeeze into his narrow campbed with suzanne on the floor and the last was to remain there entirely there being no woman with whom she could have her meals  the ladies were invited to sup with the staff and would as m de nidemerle assured them be welcomed with the greatest delight  so naomi declared that they must make their toilette do as much justice as possible to their country and though full dress was not attainable they did their best with ribbons and laces and the arrangement of her fair locks and annes brown ones when suzanne proved herself an adept the ladies meantime finding no small amusement in the varieties of swords pistols spurs and other accoutrements for which the marquis had apologised though naomi told him that they were the fittest ornaments possible  and my cousin gaspard is a really good man she said indicating to her friend the little shrine with holywater stoup ivory crucifix print of the madonna two or three devotional books and the miniatures of mother wife and children hung not far off also of two young cavaliers one of whom naomi explained to be the young father whom gaspard could not recollect the other that of the uncle eustace last baron walwyn and ribaumont of whom her own mother talked with such passionate affection and whose example had always been a guiding star to the young marquis  he came to their door to conduct them down to supper giving his arm to miss woodford as the greatest stranger while miss darpent was conducted by a resplendent ducal colonel  the supperroom was in festal guise hung round with flags and the table adorned with flowers a band was playing and never had either anne or naomi been made so much of  all were eagerly talking charles especially so and anne thought with a thrill did he recollect that this was the very anniversary of that terrible 1st of july  it was a beautiful summer evening and the supper taking place at five oclock there was a considerable time to spare afterwards so that m de nidemerle proposed to show the strangers the place and the view from the ramparts  in my company you can see all well he said but otherwise there might be doubts and jealousies  he took them through the narrow flemish streets of tall houses with projecting upper stories and showed them that seminary which was popularly supposed in england to be the hotbed of truculent plots but where they only saw a quiet academic cloister and an exquisite garden green turf roses and white lilies in full perfection and students flitting about in cassocks and square caps more like an oxford scene as mr fellowes said than anything he had yet seen he was joined by an english priest from his own original neighbourhood  the abbe leblanc found another acquaintance and these two accompanied their friends to the ramparts  the marquis had a great deal to hear from his cousin about his home and thus it happened that charles archfield and anne found themselves more practically alone together than they had yet been  as they looked at the view over the country he told her of a conversation that he had had with an officer now in the french army but who had served in the imperial army against the turks and that he had obtained much useful information  useful asked anne  yes  i have been watching for the moment to tell you anne i have resolved what to do  i intend to make a few campaigns there against the enemy of christendom  o mr archfield was all she could say  see here i have perceived plainly that to sink down into my ladys eldest son is no wholesome life for a man with all his powers about him  i understand now what a set of oafs we were to despise the poor fellow you wot of because he was not such a lubber as ourselves  i have no mind to go through the like  you are so different it could not be the same  not quite but remember there is nothing for me to do  my father is still an active man and i am not old enough to take my part in public affairs even if i loved greatly either the prince of orange or king james  i could not honestly draw my sword for either  i have no estate to manage my childs inheritance is all in money and it would drive me mad or worse to go home to be idle  no i will fight against the common enemy till i have made me a name and won reputation and standing or if i should not come back theres the babe at home to carry on the line  oh sir your father and motherlucyall that love you  what will they say  it would only put them to needless pain to ask them  i shall not i shall write explaining all my motivesall except one and that you alone know anne  she shuddered a little and felt him press her arm tightly  they had fallen a good deal behind the marquis and his cousin and were descending as twilight fell into a narrow dark lonely street with all the houses shut up  no one has guessed have they she faltered  not that i know of  but i cannotno  i cannot go home to have that castle near me and that household at oakwood  i see enough in my dreams without that  see  ah yes  then anne you have suffered then tooguiltless as you are in keeping my terrible secret  i have often thought and marvelled whether it were so with you  she was about to tell him what she had seen when he began there is one thing in this world that would sweeten and renew my lifeand that  her heart was beating violently at what was so suddenly coming on her when at that instant charles broke off short with good heavens  whats that  on the opposite side of the street where one of the many churches stood some way back making an opening there was a figure essentially the same that anne had seen at lambeth but bareheaded clad apparently in something long and white and with a pale bluish light on the ghastly but unmistakable features  she uttered a faint gasping cry scarcely audible charless impulse was to exclaim man or spirit stand and drawing his sword to rush across the street but in that second all had vanished and he only struck against closed doors which he shook but could not open  mr archfield  oh come back  i have seen it before entreated anne and he strode back with a gesture of offering her support and trembling she clung to his arm  it does not hurt she said it comes and goes  you have seen it before  twice  no more could be said for through the gloom the white plume and goldlaced uniform of the marquis were seen  he had missed them and come back to look for them beginning to apologise  i am confounded at having left mademoiselle behindcommentas the sound betrayed that charles was sheathing his sword  i trust that monsieur has met with no unpleasant adventure from my people  oh no monsieur was the answer as he added  one can never be sure as to these fiery spirits towards an englishman in the present state of feeling and i blame myself extremely for having permitted myself to lose sight of monsieur and mademoiselle  indeed sir we have met with no cause of complaint said charles adding as if casually what is that church  tis the jesuits church replied the governor  there is the best preaching in the town they say and jansenists as we are i was struck with the lenten course  anne went at once to her room on returning to the house  naomi who was there already exclaimed at her paleness and insisted on administering a glass of wine from what the english called the rere supper the french an encas the substantial materials for which had been left in the chamber  then anne felt how well it had been for her that her fellows at the palace had been so uncongenial for she could hardly help disclosing to naomi the sight she had seen and the halffinished words she had heard  it was chiefly the feeling that she could not bear naomi to know of the blood on charless hand which withheld her in her tumult of feeling and made her only entreat do not ask me i cannot tell you  and naomi who was some years older and had had her own sad experience guessed perhaps at one cause for her agitation and spared her inquiries though as anne tired out by the long day and forced by their close quarters to keep herself still dropped asleep strange mutterings fell from her lips about the vaultthe bloodcome back  there he is  the secret has risen to forbid  o poor peregrine  between the july heat the narrow bed and the two chamber fellows anne had little time to collect her thoughts except for the general impression that if charles finished what he had begun to say the living and the dead alike must force her to refuse though something within foreboded that this would cost her more than she yet durst perceive and her heart was ready to spring forth and enclose him as it were in an embrace of infinite tenderness above all when she thought of his purpose of going to those fearful hungarian wars  but after the hot night it was a great relief to prepare for an early start  m de nidemerle had decided on sending the travellers to tournay the nearest spanish town on the scheldt since he had some acquaintance with the governor and when no campaign was actually on foot the courtesies of generous enemies passed between them  he had already sent an intimation of his intention of forwarding an english kinswoman of his own with her companions and bespoken the good offices of his neighbour and they were now to set off in very early morning under the escort of a flag of truce a trumpeter and a party of troopers commanded by an experienced old officer with white moustaches and the peaked beard of the last generation contrasting with a face the colour of walnut wood  the marquis himself and his son however rode with the travellers for their first five miles through a country where the rich green of the natural growth showed good soil all enamelled with flowers and corn crops run wild but the villages looked deserted the remains of burnt barns and houses were frequent and all along that frontier it seemed as if no peaceful inhabitants ventured to settle and only brigands often rendered such by misery might prowl about  the english party felt as if they had never understood what war could be  however in a melancholy orchard run wild under the shade of an appletree laden with young fruit backed by a blackened gable half concealed by a luxuriant untrimmed vine the avant couriers of the commandant had cleared a space in the rank grass and spread a morning meal of cold pate fowl and light wines in which the french officers drank to the good journey of their friends and then when the horses had likewise had their refreshment the parting took place with much affection between the cousins  the young ribaumont augured that they should meet again when he had to protect noemi in a grand descent on dorsetshire in behalf of james and she merrily shook her fist at him and defied him and his father allowed that they were a long way from that  m de nidemerle hinted to mr archfield that nobody could tell him more about the war with the turks than m le capitaine delaune who was it appeared a veteran swiss who had served in almost every army in europe and thus could give information by no means to be neglected  so that to annes surprise and somewhat to her mortification since she had no knowledge of the cause she saw charles riding apart with this wooden old veteran who sat as upright as a ramrod on his wirylooking black horse leaving her to the company of naomi and mr fellowes  did he really wish not to pursue the topic which had brought peregrine from his grave  it would of course be all the better but it cost her some terrible pangs to think so  there were far more formalities and delays before the travellers could cross the tournay bridge across the scheldt  they were brought to a standstill a furlong off and had to wait while the trumpeter rode forward with the white flag and the message was referred to the officer on guard while a sentry seemed to be watching over them  then the officer came to the gateway of the bridge and captain delaune rode forward to him but there was still a long weary waiting in the sun before he came back after having shown their credentials to the governor and then he was accompanied by a flemish officer who with much courtesy took them under his charge and conducted them through all the defences over the bridge and to the gate where their baggage had to be closely examined  naomi had her bible in her bosom or it would not have escaped anne heartily wished she had used the same precaution on her flight from england but she had not like her friend been warned beforehand  when within the city there was more freedom and the fleming conducted the party to an inn where unlike english inns they could not have a parlour to themselves but had to take their meals in common with other guests at a sort of table dhote and the ladies had no refuge but their bedroom where the number of beds did not promise privacy  an orderly soon arrived with an invitation to don carlos arcafila to sup with the spanish governor and of course the invitation could not be neglected  the ladies walked about a little in the town with mr fellowes looking without appreciation at the splendid fivetowered cathedral but recollecting with due english pride that the place had been conquered by henry viii thence they were to make for ostend where they were certain of finding a vessel bound for england  it was a much smaller party that set forth from tournay than from paris and soon they fell into pairs mr fellowes and naomi riding together sufficiently out of earshot of the others for charles to begin  i have not been able to speak to you anne since that strange interruptionif indeed it were not a dream  oh sir it was no dream  how could it be  how could it indeed when we both saw it and both of us awake and afoot and yet i cannot believe my senses  oh i can believe it only too truly  i have seen him twice before i thought you said you had  merely in dreams and that is bad enough  are you sure for i was up and awake  are you sure  i might ask again  i was asleep in bed and glad enough to shake myself awake  where were you  once on hallowmas eve looking from the window at whitehall once when waiting with the queen under the wall of lambeth church on the night of our flight  did others see him then  i was alone the first time  the next time when he flitted across the light no one else saw him but they cried out at my start  why should he appear except to us  that is true muttered charles  and oh sir those two times he looked as he did in lifenot ghastly as now  there can be no doubt now that  what sweet anne  sir i must tell you  i could bear it no longer and i did consult the bishop of bath and wells  any more he asked in a somewhat displeased voice  no one not a soul and he is as safe as any of the priests here he regards a confession in the same way  mr archfield forgive me he seemed divinely sent to me on that all saints day  oh forgive me and tears were in her eyes  he is dr keneh  i remember him  i suppose he is as safe as any man and a woman must have some relief  you have borne enough indeed said charles greatly touched by her tears  what did he say  he asked was i certain of thedeath said she bringing out the word with difficulty but then i had only seen it at whitehall and these other appearances in such places too take away all hope that it is otherwise  assuredly said charles i had not the least doubt at the moment i know i ran my sword through his body and felt a jar that i believe was his backbone he said with a shudder and he fell prone and breathless but since i have seen more of fencing and heard more of wounds the dread has crossed me that i acted as an inexperienced lad and that i ought to have tried whether the life was in him or if he could be recovered  if so i slew him twice by launching him into that pit  god forgive me  is it so deep asked anne shuddering  i know there is a sort of step at the top but i always shunned the place and never looked in  there are two or three steps at the top but all is broken away below  sedley and i once threw a ball down and i am sure it dropped to a depth down which no man could fall and live  i believe there once were underground passages leading to the harbour on one hand and out to portsdown hill on the other but that the communication was broken away and the openings destroyed when lord goring was governor of portsmouth to secure the castle  be that as it may he could not have been living after he reached that floor i heard the thud and the jingle of his sword and it will haunt me to my dying day  and yet you never intended it  you did it in defence of me  you did not mean to strike thus hard  it was an accident  would that i could so feel it he sighed  nay of course i had no evil design when my poor little wife drove me out to give you her rag of ribbon or whatever it was but i hated as well as despised the fellow  he had angered me with his scornwell deserved as now i seeof our lubberly ways  she had vexed me with her teasing commendationsout of harmless mischief poor child  i hated him more every time you looked at him and when i had occasion to strike him i was glad of it  there was murder in my heart and i felt as if i were putting a rat or a weasel out of the way when i threw him down that pit  god forgive me  then in my madness i so acted that in a manner i was the death of that poor young thing  no no sir  your mother had never thought she would live  so they say but her face comes before me in reproach  there are times when i feel myself a double murderer  i have been on the point of telling all to mr fellowes or going home to accuse myself  only the thought of my father and mother and of leaving such a blight on that poor baby has withheld me but i cannot go home to face the sight of the castle  no said anne choked with tears  nor is there any suspicion of the poor fellows fate he added  not that i ever heard  his family think him fled as was like enough considering the way in which they treated him said charles  nor do i see what good it would do them to know the truth  it would only be a grief and bitterness to all  i hope i have repented and that god accepts my forgiveness said charles sadly  i am banishing myself from all i love and there is a weight on me for life but unless suspicion falls on others i do not feel bound to make it worse for all by giving myself up  yet those appearancesto you to me to us both  at such a moment too last night  can it be because of his unhallowed grave said anne in a low voice of awe  if it were said charles drawing up his horse for a moment in thought  anne if there be one more appearance the place shall be searched whether it incriminate me or not  it would be adding to all my wrongs towards the poor fellow if that were the case  even if he were found said anne suspicion would not light on you  and at home it will be known if he haunts the place  i will   nay but anne he will not interrupt me now  i have much more to say  i want you to remember that we were sweethearts ere ever i as a child of twelve knew that i was contracted to that poor babe and bidden to think only of her  poor child  i honestly did my best to love her so far as i knew how and mayhap we could have rubbed on through life passably well as things go  butbutit skills not talking of things gone by except to show that it is a whole heart not the reversion of one that is yours for ever mine only love  oh butbuti am no match for you  ive had enough of grand matches  your father would never endure it  my father would soon rejoice  besides if we are wedded heresay at ostendand you make me a home at buda or vienna or some place at our winter quarters as my brave wench will my father will be glad enough to see us both at home again  no it cannot be  it would be plain treachery to your parents mr fellowes would say so  i am sure he would not marry us  there are english chaplains  is that all that holds you back  no sir  if the archbishop of canterbury were here himself it could not make it other than a sin and an act of mean ingratitude for me the princes rocker to take advantage of their goodness in permitting you to come and bring me hometo do what would be pain grief and shame to them  never shame  what is wrong is shame  cannot you see how unworthy it would be in me and how it would grieve my uncle that i should have done such a thing  love would override scruples  not true love  true  then you own to some love for me anne  i donotknow  i have guardedi meancast awayi meannever entertained any such thought ever since i was old enough to know how wicked it would be  anne  anne in an undertone very like rapture you have confessed all  it is no sin now  even you cannot say so  she hung her head and did not answer but silence was enough for him  it is enough he said you will wait  i shall know you are waiting till i return in such sort that nothing can be denied me let me at least have that promise  you need not fear murmured anne  how could i need  the secret would withhold me were there nothing else  and there is something else  eh sweetheart  is that all i am to be satisfied with  oh sirmr archfield i meano charles she stammered  mr fellowes turned round to consult his pupil as to whether the halt should be made at the village whose peaked roofs were seen over the fruit trees  but when anne was lifted down from the steed it was with no grasp of common courtesy and her hand was not relinquished till it had been fervently kissed  charles did not again torment her with entreaties to share his exile  mayhap he recognised though unwillingly that her judgment had been right but there was no small devotion in his whole demeanour as they dined rode and rested on that summers day amid fields of giant haycocks and hostels wreathed with vines with long vistas of sleek cows and plump dappled horses in the sheds behind the ravages of war had lessened as they rode farther from the frontier and the rich smiling landscape lay rejoicing in the summer sunshine the sturdy peasants looked as if they had never heard of marauders as they herded their handsome cattle and responded civilly when a draught of milk was asked for the ladies  there was that strange sense of eden felicity that sometimes comes with the knowledge that the time is short for mutual enjoyment in full peace  charles and anne would part their future was undefined but for the present they reposed in the knowledge of each others hearts and in being together  it was as in their childhood when by tacit consent he had been annes champion from the time she came as a little londoner to be alarmed at rough country ways and to be easily scared by sedley  it had been then that charles had first awakened to the chivalry of the better part of boyhoods nature instead of following his cousins lead and treating girls as creatures meant to be bullied  many a happy reminiscence was shared between the two as they rode together and it was not till the pale breadth of sea filled their horizon broken by the tall spires and peaked gables and manywindowed steep roofs of ostend that the future was permitted to come forward and trouble them  then annes heart began to feel that persistence in her absolute refusal was a much harder thing than at the first when the idea was new and strange to her  and there were strange yearnings that charles should renew the proposal mixed with dread of herself and of her own resolution in case of his doing so  as her affections embraced him more and more she pictured him sick wounded dying out of reach of all among germans hungarians turksno one at hand to comfort him or even to know his fate  there was even disappointment in his acquiescence though her better mind told her that it was in accordance with her prayer against temptation  moreover he was of a reserved nature not apt to discuss what was once fixed and perhaps it showed that he respected her judgment not to try to shake her decision  though for once love had carried him away he might perhaps be grateful to her for sparing him the perplexities of dragging her about with him and of giving additional offence to his parents  the affection born of lifelong knowledge is not apt to be of the vehement character that disregards all obstacles or possible miseries to the object thereof yet enough feeling was betrayed to make naomi whisper at night sweet nan are you not some one elses sweet  and anne now with another secret on her heart only replied with embraces and do not talk of it  i cannot tell how it is to be i cannot tell you all  naomi was discreet enough only to caress  with strict formalities at outworks moat drawbridge and gates and the customary inquisitorial search of the luggage the travellers were allowed to repair to a lofty inn with the lion of flanders for its sign and a wide courtyard the successive outside galleries covered with luxuriant vines  here as usual though the party of females obtained one bedroom together the gentlemen had to share one vast sleeping chamber with a variety of merchants dutch flemish spanish and a few english  meals were at a great table dhote in the public room opening into the court and were shared by sundry spanish belgic and swiss officers of the garrison who made this their messroom  two young english gentlemen like charles archfield making the grand tour whom he had met in italy were delighted to encounter him again and still more so at the company of english ladies  no wonder the forlorn widower has recovered his spirits anne heard one say with a laugh that made her blush and turn away and there was an outcry that after a monopoly of the fair ones all the way from paris the seats next to them must be yielded  anne was disappointed and could not bring herself to be agreeable to the obtrusive cavalier with the rich lace cravat and perfumed hair both assumed in her honour  the discussion was respecting the vessels where a passage might be obtained  the cavaliers were to sail in a couple of days for london but another ship would go out of harbour with the tide on the following day for southampton and this was decided on by acclamation by the hampshire party though no good accommodation was promised them  there was little opportunity for a teteatetes for the young men insisted on escorting the ladies to the picture galleries palaces and gardens and charles did not wish to reawaken the observations that according to the habits of the time might not be of the choicest description  anne watched him under her eyelashes and wondered with beating heart whether after all he intended to return home and there plead his cause for he gave no token of intending to separate from the rest  the hampshire hog was to sail at daybreak so the passengers went on board over night after supper when the summer twilight was sinking down and the faroff west still had a soft golden tint  anne felt charless arm round her in the boat and grasping her hand then pulling off her glove and putting a ring on her fingerall in silence  she still felt that arm on the deck in the confusion of men ropes and bales of goods and the shouts and hails on all sides that nearly deafened her  there was imminent danger of being hurled down if not overboard among the far from sober sailors and mr fellowes urged the ladies to go below at once conducting miss darpent himself as soon as he could ascertain where to go  anne felt herself almost lifted down  then followed a strong embrace a kiss on brow lips and either cheek and a low hoarse whisperso best  mine own  god bless youand as suzanne came tumbling aft into the narrow cabin anne found herself left alone with her two female companions and knew that these blissful days were over    chapter xxiii french leave   when ye gang awa jamie    far across the sea laddie when ye gang to germanie    what will ye send to me laddie  huntingtower  fides was the posy on the ring  that was all anne could discover and indeed only this much with the morning light of the july sun that penetrated the remotest corners  for the cabin was dark and stifling and there was no leaving it for both miss darpent and her attendant were so ill as to engross her entirely  she could hardly leave them when there was a summons to a meal in the captains cabin and there she found herself the only passenger able to appear and the rest of the company though intending civility were so rough that she was glad to retreat again and wretched as the cabin was she thought it preferable to the deck  mr fellowes she heard was specially prostrated and jokes were passing round that it was the less harm since it might be the worse for him if the crew found out that there was a parson on board  thus anne had to forego the first sight of her native land and only by the shouts above and the decreased motion of the vessel knew when she was within lee of the isle of wight and on entering the solent could encourage her companions that their miseries were nearly over and help them to arrange themselves for going upon deck  when at length they emerged as the ship layto in sight of the red roofs and white steeples of southampton and of the green mazes of the new forest mr fellowes was found looking everywhere for the pupil whom he had been too miserable to miss during the voyage neither charles archfield nor his servant was visible but mr fellowess own man coming forward delivered to the bewildered tutor a packet which he said that his comrade had put in his charge for the purpose  in the boat on the way to land mr fellowes read to himself the letter which of course filled him with extreme distress  it contained much of what charles had already explained to anne of his conviction that in the present state of affairs it was better for so young a man as himself without sufficient occupation at home to seek honourable service abroad and that he thought it would spare much pain and perplexity to depart without revisiting home  he added full and wellexpressed thanks for all that mr fellowes had done for him and for kindness for which he hoped to be the better all his life  he enclosed a long letter to his father which he said would he hoped entirely exonerate his kind and muchrespected tutor from any remissness or any participation in the scheme which he had thought it better on all accounts to conceal till the last  and indeed said poor mr fellowes if i had had any inkling of it i should have applied to the english consul to restrain him as a ward under trust  but no one would have thought it of him  he had always been reasonable and docile beyond his years and i trusted him entirely  i should as soon have thought of our president giving me the slip in this way  surely he came on board with us  he handed me into the boat said miss darpent  who saw him last did you miss woodford  anne was forced to own that she had seen him on board and her cheeks were in spite of herself such telltales that mr fellowes could not help saying it is not my part to rebuke you madam but if you were aware of this evasion you will have a heavy reckoning to pay to the young mans parents  sir said anne i knew indeed that he meant to join the imperial army but i knew not how nor when  ah well  i ask no questions  you need not justify yourself to me young lady but sir philip and lady archfield little knew what they did when they asked us to come by way of paris  not that i regret it on all accounts he added with a courteous bow to naomi which set her blushing in her turn  he avoided again addressing miss woodford and she thought with consternation of the prejudice he might excite against her  it had been arranged between the two maidens that naomi should be a guest at portchester rectory till she could communicate with walwyn and her father or brother could come and fetch her  they landed at the little wharf among the colliers and made their way up the street to an inn where after ordering a meal to satisfy the ravenous seaappetite mr fellowes after a few words with naomi left the ladies to their land toilet while he went to hire horses for the journey  then naomi could not help saying o anne  i did not think you would have done this  i am grieved  you do not know all said anne sadly or you would not think so hardly  i saw you had an understanding with him  i see you have a new ring on your finger but how could i suppose you would encourage an only son thus to leave his parents  hush hush naomi cried anne as the uncontrollable tears broke out  dont you believe that it is quite as hard for me as for them that he should have gone off to fight those dreadful bloodthirsty turks  indeed i would have hindered him but thatbut thati know it is best for him  no  i cant tell you why but i know it is and even to the very last when he helped me down the companion ladder i hoped he might be coming home first  but you are trothplight to him and secretly  i am not trothplight i know i am not his equal i told him so but he thrust this ring on me in the boat in the dark and how could i give it back  naomi shook her head but was more than halfdisarmed by her friends bitter weeping  whether she gave any hint to mr fellowes anne did not know but his manner remained drily courteous and as anne had to ride on a pillion behind a servant she was left in a state of isolation as to companionship which made her feel herself in disgrace and almost spoilt the joy of dear familiar recognition of hill field and tree after her long years absence the longest year in her life and substituted the sinking of heart lest she should be returning to hear of misfortune and disaster sickness or death  her original plan had been to go on with naomi to portchester at once if by inquiry at fareham she found that her uncle was at home but she perceived that mr fellowes decidedly wished that miss darpent should go first to the archfields and something within her determined first to turn thither in spite of all there was to encounter so that she might still her misgivings by learning whether her uncle was well  so she bade the man turn his horses head towards the wellknown poplars in front of archfield house  the sound of the trampling horses brought more than one wellknown old bluecoated servingman into the court and among them a woman with a child in her arms  there was the exclamation mistress anne  sure master charles be not far behind and the old groom ran to help her down  oh  ralph thanks  all well  my uncle  he is here with his honour and in scarcely a moment more lucy swift of foot had flown out and had anne in her embrace and crying out  ah charles my brother  i dont see him  anne was glad to have no time to answer before she was in her uncles arms  my child at last  god bless thee  safe in soul and body  sir philip was there too greeting mr fellowes and looking for his son and with the cursory assurance that mr archfield was well and that they would explain a hasty introduction of miss darpent was made and all moved in to where lady archfield more feeble and slow of movement had come into the hall and the nurse stood by with the little heir to be shown to his father and sedley archfield stood in the background  it was a cruel moment for all when the words came from mr fellowes sir i have to tell you mr archfield is not here  this letter he tells me is to explain  there was an outburst of exclamation during which sir philip withdrew into a window with his spectacles to read the letter while all to which the tutor or anne ventured to commit themselves was that mr archfield had only quitted them without notice on board the hampshire hog  the first tones of the father had a certain sound of relief gone to the imperialist army to fight the turks in hungary  poor lady archfield actually shrieked and lucy turned quite pale while anne caught a sort of lurid flush of joy on sedley archfields features and he was the first to exclaim undutiful young dog  tut tut returned sir philip he might as well have come home first and yet i do not know but that it is the best thing he could do  there might have been difficulties in the way of getting out again you see my lady as things stand now  ay ay you are in the right of it my boy  it is just as well to let things settle themselves down here before committing himself to one side or the other  tis easy enough for an old fellow like me who has to let nothing go but his commission of the peace but not the same for a stirring young lad and he is altogether right as to not coming back to idle here as a rich man  it would be the ruin of him  i am glad he has the sense to see it  i was casting about to obtain an estate for him to give him occupation  but the wars moaned the mother if he had only come home we could have persuaded him  the wars my lady  why they will be a feather in his cap and may be if he had come home the dutchman would have claimed him for his and let king james be as misguided as he may i cannot stomach fighting against his fathers son for myself or mine  no no it was the best thing there was for the lad to do  you shall hear his letter it does him honour and you too mr fellowes  he could not have written such a letter when he left home barely a year ago  sir philip proceeded to read the letter aloud  there was a full explanation of the motives political and private only leaving out one and that the most powerful of all of those which led charles archfield to absent himself for the present  he entreated pardon for having made the decision without obtaining permission from his father on returning home but he had done so in view of possible obstacles to his leaving england again and to the belief that a brief sojourn at home would cause more grief and perplexity than his absence  he further explained as before his reasons for secrecy towards his travelling companion and entreated his father not to suppose for a moment that mr fellowes had been in any way culpable for what he could never have suspected warmly affectionate messages to mother and sister followed and an assurance of feeling that the little one needed for no care or affection while with them  lady archfield was greatly disappointed and cried a great deal making sure that the poor dear lads heart was still too sore to brook returning after the loss of his wife who had now become the sweetest creature in the world but sir philips decision that the measure was wise and the secrecy under the circumstances so expedient as to be pardonable prevented all public blame mr fellowes however was drawn apart and asked whether he suspected any other motive than was here declared and which might make his pupil unwilling to face the parental brow and he had declared that nothing could have been more exemplary than the whole demeanour of the youth who had at first gone about as one crushed and though slowly reviving into cheerfulness had always been subdued until quite recently when the meeting with his old companion had certainly much enlivened his spirits  poor mr fellowes had been rejoicing in the excellent character he should have to give when this evasion had so utterly disconcerted him and it was an infinite relief to him to find that all was thought comprehensible and pardonable  anne might be thankful that none of the authorities thought of asking her the question about hidden motives and naomi looking about with her bright eyes thought she had perhaps judged too hardly when she saw the fathers approval and that the mother and sister only mourned at the disappointment at not seeing the beloved one  the archfields would not hear of letting any of the party go on to portchester that evening  dr woodford who had ridden over for consultation with sir philip must remain he would have plenty of time for his niece by and by and she and miss darpent must tell them all about the journey and about charles and anne must tell them hundreds of things about herself that they scarcely knew for not one letter from st germain had ever reached her uncle  how natural it all looked the parlour just as when she saw it last and the hall with the long table being laid for supper and the hot sun streaming in through the heavy casements  she could have fancied it yesterday that she had left it save for the plump rosy little yearling with flaxen curls peeping out under his round white cap who had let her hold him in her arms and fondle him all through that reading of his fathers letter  charless child  he was her prince indeed now  he was taken from her and delivered over to lady archfield to be caressed and pitied because his father would not come home to see his granddames own beauty while lucy took the guests upstairs to prepare for supper naomi and her maid being bestowed in the best guestchamber and lucy taking her friend to her own the scene of many a confabulation of old  oh how i love it cried anne as the door opened on the well known little wainscotted abode  the very same beaupot  one would think they were the same clove gillyflowers as when i went away  o anne dear and you are just the same after all your kings and queens and all you have gone through and the two friends were locked in another embrace  kings and queens indeed  none of them all are worth my lucy  and now tell me all tell me all nancy and first of all about my brother  how does he look and is he well  he looks  o lucy he is grown such a noble cavalier most like the picture of that uncle of yours who was killed and that sir philip always grieves for  my father always hoped charley would be like him said lucy  you must tell him that  but i fear he may be grave and sad  graver but not sad now  and you have seen him and talked to him anne  did you know he was going on this terrible enterprise  he spoke of it but never told me when  ah  i was sure you knew more about it than the old tutor man  you always were his little sweetheart before poor little madam came in the way and he would tell you anything near his heart  could you not have stopped him  i think not lucy he gave his reasons like a man of weight and thought and you see his honour thinks them sound ones  oh yes but somehow i cannot fancy our charley doing anything for grand sound musty reasons such as look well marshalled out in a letter  you dont know how much older he is grown said anne again with the telltale colour in her cheeks  besides he cannot bear to come home  dont tell me that nan  my mother does not see it but though he was fond of poor little madam in a way and tried to think himself more so as in duty bound she really was fretting and wearing the very lifeno perhaps not the life but the temperout of him what i believe it to be the cause is that my father must have been writing to him about that young gentlewoman in the island that he is so set upon because she would bring a landed estate which would give charles something to do  they say that peregrine oakshott ran away to escape wedding his cousin charley will banish himself for the like cause  he said nothing of it said anne  o anne i wish you had a landed estate  you would make him happier than any other and would love his poor little phil  anne is it so  i have guessed and lucy kissed her on each cheek  indeed indeed i have not promised  i know it can never never be and that i am not fit for him  do not speak of it lucy  he spoke of it once as we rode together  and you could not be so false as to tell him you did not love him no you could not and lucy kissed her again  no faltered anne but i would not do as he wished  i have given him no trothplight  i told him it would never be permitted  and he said no more but he put this ring on my finger in the boat without a word  i ought not to wear it i shall not  oh yes you shall  indeed you shall  no one need understand it but myself and it makes us sisters  yes anne charley was right my father will not consent now but he will in due time if he does not hear of it till he wearies to see charles again  trust it to me my sweet sister that is to be  it is a great comfort that you know said anne almost moved to tell her the greater and more perilous secret that lay in the background but withheld by receiving lucys own confidence that she herself was at present tormented by her cousin sedleys courtship he was still mores the pity she said in garrison at portsmouth but there were hopes of his regiment being ere long sent to the low countries since it was believed to be more than half inclined to king james  in the meantime he certainly had designs on lucys portion and as her father never believed half the stories of his debaucheries that were rife and had a kindness for his only brothers orphan she did not feel secure against his yielding so as to provide for sedley without continuance in the dutch service  i could almost follow the example of running away said lucy  i suppose anne ventured to say faltering that nothing has been heard of poor mr oakshott  nothing at all  his uncles people who have come home from muscovy know nothing of him and it is thought he may have gone off to the plantations  the talk is that mistress martha is to be handed on to the third brother but that she is not willing  it was clear that there could have been no spectres here and lucy went on but you have told me nothing yet of yourself and your doings my anne  how well you look and more than ever the court lady even in your old travelling habit  is that the watch the king gave you  in private and in public there was quite enough to tell on that evening for intimate friends who had not met for a year and one of whom had gone through so many vicissitudes  nor were the other two guests by any means left out of the welcome and the evening was a very happy one  mr fellowes intimated his intention of going himself to walwyn with the news of miss darpents arrival and naomi accepted the invitation to remain at portchester till she could be sent for from home  it was not till the next morning that anne woodford could be alone with her uncle  as she came downstairs in the morning she saw him waiting for her he held out his hands and drew her out with him into the walled garden that lay behind the house  child dear child said he you are welcome to my old eyes  may god bless you as he has aided you to be faithful alike to him and to your king through much trial  ah sir  i have sorely repented the folly and ambition that would not heed your counsel  no doubt my maid but the spirit of humility and repentance hath worked well in you  i fear me however that you are come back to further trials since probably portchester may be no longer our home  nor winchester  nor winchester  then is this new king going to persecute as in the old times you talk of  he who was brought over to save the church  he accepts the english church my maid so far as it accepts him all beneficed clergy are required to take the oath of allegiance to him before the first of august now approaching under pain of losing their preferments  many of my brethren even our own bishop and dean think this merely submission to the powers that be and that it may be lawfully done but as i hear neither the archbishop himself nor my good old friends doctors ken and frampton can reconcile it to their conscience any more than my brother stanbury of botley nor i to take this fresh oath while the king to whom we have sworn is living  some hold that he has virtually renounced our allegiance by his flight  i cannot see it while he is fighting for his crown in ireland  what say you anne who have seen him did he treat his case as that of an abdicated prince  no sir certainly not  all the talk was of his enjoying his own again  how can i then consistently with my duty and loyalty swear to this william and mary as my lawful sovereigns  i say not tis incumbent on me to refuse to live under them a peaceful life but make oath to them as my king and queen i cannot so long as king james shall live  true he has not been a friend to the church and has wofully trampled on the rights of englishmen but i cannot hold that this absolves me from my duty to him any more than david was freed from duty to saul  so anne back must we go to the poverty in which i was reared with your own good father  anne might grieve but she felt the gratification of being talked to by her uncle as a woman who could understand as he had talked to her mother  the first of august she repeated as if it were a note of doom  yes i hear whispers of a further time of grace but i know not what difference that should make  a christian mans oath may not be broken sooner or later  well poverty is the state blessed by our lord and it may be that i have lived too much at mine ease but i could wish dear child that you were safely bestowed in a house of your own  so do not i said anne for now i can work for you  he smiled faintly and here mr fellowes joined them a good man likewise but intent on demonstrating the other side of the question and believing that the popish persecuting king had forfeited his rights so that there need be no scruple as to renouncing what he had thrown up by his flight  it was an endless argument in which each man could only act according to his own conscience and endeavour that this conscience should be as little biassed as possible by worldly motives or animosity  mr fellowes started at once with his servant for walwyn and naomi accompanied the two woodfords to portchester  in spite of the cavalier sentiments of her family naomi had too much of the spire of her frondeur father to understand any feeling for duty towards the king who had so decidedly broken his covenant with his people and moreover had so abominably treated the fellows of magdalen college and her pity for anne as a sufferer for her uncles whim quite angered her friend into hot defence of him and his cause  the dear old parsonage garden under the gray walls the honeysuckle and monthly roses trailing over the porch the lakelike creek between it and green portsdown hill the huge massive keep and towers and the masts in the harbour the island hills sleeping in blue summer hazeannes heart clave to them more than ever for the knowledge that the time was short and that the fair spot must be given up for the rights sake  certainly there was some trepidation at the thought of the vault and she had made many vague schemes for ascertaining that which her very flesh trembled at the thought of any one suspecting but these were all frustrated for since the war with france had begun the bailey had been put under repair and garrisoned by a detachment of soldiers the vault had been covered in there was a sentry at the gateway of the castle and the postern door towards the vicarage was fastened up so that though the parish still repaired to church through the wide court solitary wanderings there were no longer possible nor indeed safe for a young woman considering what the soldiery of that period were  the thought came over her with a shudder as she gazed from her window at the creek where she remembered peregrine sending charles and sedley adrift in the boat  the tide was out the mud glistened in the moonlight but nothing was to be seen more than anne had beheld on many a summer night before no phantom was evoked before her eyes no elfinlike form revealed his presence nor did any spirit take shape to upbraid her with his unhallowed grave so close at hand  no but naomi darpent yearning for sympathy came to her side caressed her on that summer night and told her that mr fellowes had gone to ask her of her father and though she could never love again as she had once loved she thought if her parents wished it she could be happy with so good a man    chapter xxiv in the moonlight   i have had a dream this evening while the white and gold were fleeting but i need not need not tell it where would be the good  requiescat in pacejean ingelow  anne woodford sat on a sultry summer night by the open window in archfield house at fareham busily engaged over the tail of a kite while asleep in a cradle in the corner of the room lay a little boy his appleblossom cheeks and long flaxen curls lying prone upon his pillow as he had tossed when falling asleep in the heat  the six years since her return had been eventful  dr woodford had adhered to his view that his oath of allegiance could not be forfeited by jamess flight and he therefore had submitted to be ousted from his preferments resigning his pleasant prebendal house and his seaside home and embracing poverty for his personal oaths sake although he was willing to acquiesce in the government of william and mary and perhaps to rejoice that others had effected what he would not have thought it right to do  things had been softened to him as regarded his flock by the appointment of mr fellowes to portchester which was a crown living though there had been great demur at thus slipping into a friends shoes so that dr woodford had been obliged to asseverate that nothing so much comforted him as leaving the parish in such hands and that he blamed no man for seeing the question of divine right as he did in common with the nonjurors  the appointment opened the way to the marriage with naomi darpent and the pair were happily settled at portchester  dr woodford and his niece found a tiny house at winchester near the wharf with the clear itchen flowing in front and the green hills rising beyond while in the rear were the ruins of wolvesey and the buildings of the cathedral and college  they retained no servant except black hans poor peregrines legacy who was an excellent cook and capable of all that anne could not accomplish in her hours of freedom  it was a fall indeed from her ancient aspirations though there was still that bud of hope within her heart  the united means of uncle and niece were so scanty that she was fain to offer her services daily at mesdames reynauds still flourishing school where the freshness of her continental experiences made her very welcome  dr woodford occasionally assisted some student preparing for the university but this was not regular occupation and it was poorly paid so that it was well that fifty pounds a year went at least three times as far as it would do in the present day  though his gown and cassock lost their richness and lustre he was as much respected as ever  bishop mews often asked him to wolvesey and allowed him to assist the parochial clergy when it was not necessary to utter the royal name the vergers marshalled him to his own stall at daily prayers and he had free access to bishop morleys cathedral library  the archfield family still took a house in the close for the winter months and there a very soberminded and conventional courtship of lucy took place by sir edmund nutley a worthy and welltodo gentleman settled on the borders of parkhurst forest in the isle of wight  anne with the thought of her charles burning within her heart was a little scandalised at the course of affairs  sir edmund was a highly worthy man but not in his first youth and ponderousa whig moreover and an intimate friend of the masterful governor of the island lord cutts called the salamander  he had seen miss archfield before at the winter and spring quarter sessions and though her father was no longer in the commission of the peace the residence at winchester gave him opportunities and the chief obstacle seemed to be the party question  he was more in love than was the lady but she was submissive and believed that he would be a kind husband  she saw too that her parents would be much disappointed and displeased if she made any resistance to so prosperous a settlement and she was positively glad to be out of reach of sedleys addresses  such an entirely unenthusiastic acceptance was the proper thing and it only remained to provide for lady archfields comfort in the loss of her daughter  for this the elders turned at once to anne woodford  sir philip made it his urgent entreaty that the doctor and his niece would take up their abode with him and that anne would share with the grandmother the care of the young philip a spirited little fellow who would soon be running wild with the grooms without the attention that his aunt had bestowed on him  dr woodford himself was much inclined to accept the office of chaplain to his old friend who he knew would be far happier for his company and annes heart bounded at the thought of bringing up charless child but that very start of joy made her blush and hesitate and finally surprise the two old gentlemen by saying with crimson cheeks  sir your honour ought to know what might make you change your mind  there have been passages between mr archfield and me  sir philip laughed  ah the rogue  you were always little sweethearts as children  why anne you should know better than to heed what a young soldier says  no doubt you have other views for your son said dr woodford and i trust that my niece has too much discretion and sense of propriety to think that they can be interfered with on her account  passages repeated sir philip thoughtfully  mistress anne how much do you mean by that  surely there is no promise between you  no sir said anne i would not give any but when we parted in flanders he asked me toto wait for him and i feel that you ought to know it  oh i understand said the baronet  it was only natural to an old friend in a foreign land and you have too much sense to dwell on a young mans folly though it was an honourable scruple that made you tell me my dear maid  but he is not come or coming yet mores the pity so there is no need to think about it at present  annes cheeks did not look as if she had attained that wisdom but her conscience was clear since she had told the fact and the father did not choose to take it seriously  to say how she herself loved charles would have been undignified and nothing to the purpose since her feelings were not what would be regarded and there was no need to mention her full and entire purpose to wed no one else  time enough for that if the proposal were made  so the uncle and niece entered on their new life with some loss of independence and to the doctor a greater loss in the neighbourhood of the cathedral and its library for after the first year or two as lady archfield grew rheumatic and sir philip had his old friend to play backgammon and read the weekly gazette they became unwilling to make the move to winchester and generally stayed at home all the winter  before this however princess anne had been at the kings house at winchester for a short time and lady archfield paid due respects to her with anne in attendance  with the royal faculty of remembering everybody the princess recognised her namesake gave her hand to be kissed and was extremely gracious  she was at the moment in the height of a quarrel with her sister and far from delighted with the present regime  she sent for miss woodford and to annes surprise laughed over her own escape from the cockpit adding you would not come child  you were in the right ont  theres no gratitude among them  had i known how i should be served i would never have stirred a foot  so twas you that carried off the child tell me what he is like  and she extracted by questions all that anne could tell her of the life at st germain and the appearance of her little halfbrother it was impossible to tell whether she asked from affectionate remorse or gossiping interest but she ended by inquiring whether her fathers goddaughter were content with her position or desired oneif there were a vacancyin her own household where she might get a good husband  anne declined courteously and respectfully and was forced to hint at an engagement which she could not divulge  she had heard charless expressions of delight at the arrangement which gave his boy to her tender care warming her heart  lady archfield had fits of talking of finding a good husband for anne woodford among the cathedral clergy but the maiden was so necessary to her and so entirely a mother to little philip that she soon let the idea drop  perhaps it was periodically revived when about three times a year there arrived a letter from charles he wrote in good spirits evidently enjoying his campaigns and with no lack of pleasant companions english scotch and irish jacobites with whom he lived in warm friendship and wholesome emulation  he won promotion and the county member actually came out of his way to tell sir philip what he had heard from the imperial ambassador of young archfields distinguished services at the battle of salankamen only regretting that he was not fighting under king williams colours  little philip pranced about cutting off turks heads in the form of poppies like papa for whose safety anne taught him to pray night and morning  pride in his sons exploits was a compensation to the father who declared them to be better than vegetating over the sheepfolds like robert oakshott or than idling at portsmouth like sedley archfield  that young mans regiment had been ordered to ireland during the campaign that followed the battle of boyne water  he had suddenly returned from thence cashiered  by his own story the victim of the enmity of the dutch general ginkel according to another version on account of brutal excesses towards the natives and insolence to his commanding officer  courtsmartial had only just been introduced and sir philip could believe in a whig invention doing injustice to a member of a loyal family so that his doors were open to his nephew and sedley haunted them whenever he had no other resource but he spent most of his time between newmarket and other sporting centres and contrived to get a sort of maintenance by bets at races cockfights and bullbaitings and by extensive gambling  evil reports of him came from time to time but sir philip was loth to think ill of the son of his brother or to forbode that as his grandson grew older such influence might be dangerous  in his uncles presence sedley was on his good behaviour but if he caught miss woodford without that protection he attempted rude compliments and when repelled by her dignified look and manner sneered at the airs of my ladys waitingwoman and demanded how long she meant to mope after charley who would never look so low she need not be so ungracious to a poor soldier  she might have to put up with worse  moreover he deliberately incited philip to mischief putting foul words into the little mouth and likewise giving forbidden food and drink lauding evil sports and mocking at obedience to any authority especially miss woodfords  philip was very fond of his nana and in general good and obedient but what highspirited boy is proof against the allurements of the only example before him of young manhood assuring him that it was manly not to mind what the women said nor to be tied to the apronstrings of his granddames abigail  the child had this summer thus been actually taken to the outskirts of a bullfight whence he had been brought home in great disgrace by ralph the old servant who had been charged to look after his outdoor amusements and to ride with him  the grandfather was indeed more shocked at the danger and the vulgarity of the sport than its cruelty but philip had received his first flogging and his cousin had been so sharply rebuked thatto the great relief of anne and of lady archfieldhe had not since appeared at fareham house  the morrow would be philips seventh birthday a stage which would take him farther out of annes power  he was no longer to sleep in her chamber but in one of his own with ralph for his protector and he was to begin latin with dr woodford  so great was his delight that he had gone to bed all the sooner in order to bring the great day more quickly and anne was glad of the opportunity of finishing the kite which was to be her present for ralph to help him fly upon portsdown hill  that great anniversary so delightful to him with pony and whip prepared for himwhat a day of confusion distress and wretchedness did it not recall to his elders  anne could not choose but recall the time as she sat alone in the window looking out over the garden the moon beginning to rise and the sunset light still colouring the sky in the northwest just as it had done when she returned home after the bonfire  the events of that sad morning had faded out of the foreground  the oakshott family seemed to have resigned themselves to the mystery of peregrines fate  only his mother had declined from the time of his disappearance  when it was ascertained that his uncle had died in russia and that nothing had been heard of him there it seemed to bring on a fresh stage of her illness and she had expired at last in martha brownings arms her last words being a blessing not only to robert but to peregrine and a broken entreaty to her husband to forgive the boy for he might have been better if they had used him well  martha was then found to hold out against the idea of his being dead  little affection and scant civility as she had received from him her dutiful heart had attached itself to her destined lord and no doubt her imagination had been excited by his curious abilities and her compassion by the persecution he suffered at home  at any rate when after a proper interval the major tried to transfer her to his remaining son she held out against it for a long interval until at last after full three years the desolation and disorganisation of oakwood without a mistress a severe illness of the major and the distress of his son so worked upon her feelings that she consented to the marriage with robert and had ever since been the ruling spirit at oakwood and a very different one from what had been expectedsensible kindly and beneficent and allowing the young husband more liberty and indulgence than he had ever known before  the remembrance of peregrine seemed to have entirely passed away and anne had been troubled with no more apparitions so that though she thought over the strange scene of that terrible morning the rapid combat the hasty concealment the distracted face of the unhappy youth it was with the thought that time had been a healer and that charles might surely now return home  and what then  she raised her eyes to the open window and what did she behold in the moonlight streaming full upon the great tree rose below  it was the same face and figure that had three times startled her before the figure dark and the face very white in the moonlight but like nothing else and with that odd onesided feather as of old  it had flitted ere she could point its placegone in a single flash but she was greatly startled  had it come to protest against the scheme she had begun to indulge in on that very night of all nights or had it merely been her imagination  for nothing was visible though she leant from the window no sound was to be heard though when she tried to complete her work her hands trembled and the paper rustled so that philip showed symptoms of wakening and she had to defer her task till early morning  she said nothing of her strange sight and phil had a happy successful birthday flying the kite with a propitious wind and riding into portsmouth on his new pony with grandpapa  but there was one strange event  the servants had a holiday and some of them went into portsmouth black hans who never returned being one the others had lost sight of him but had not been uneasy knowing him to be perfectly well able to find his way home but as he never appeared the conclusion was that he must have been kidnapped by some ships crew to serve as a cook  he had not been very happy among the servants at fareham who laughed at his black face and dutch english and he would probably have gone willingly with dutchmen but anne and her uncle were grieved and felt as if they had failed in the trust that poor sir peregrine had left them    chapter xxv tidings from the iron gates   he has more cause to be proud  where is he wounded  coriolanus  it was a wet autumn day when the yellow leaves of the poplars in front of the house were floating down amid the misty rain dr woodford had gone two days before to consult a book in the cathedral library and was probably detained at winchester by the weather lady archfield was confined to her bed by a sharp attack of rheumatism  sir philip was taking his afterdinner doze in his arm chair and little philip was standing by anne who was doing her best to keep him from awakening his grandfather as she partly read partly romanced over the highcrowned hatted fishermen in the illustrations to izaak waltons complete angler  he had just caught by the musical sound made her read to him a second time marlowes verses  come live with me and be my love  and informed her that his nana was his love and that she was to watch him fish in the summer rivers when the servant who had been sent to meet his majestys mail and extract the weekly gazette came in bringing not only that but a thick sealed packet the aspect of which made the boy dance and exclaim a packet from my papa oh will he have written an answer to my own letter to him  but sir philip who had started up at the opening of the door had no sooner glanced at the packet than he cried out tis not his hand and when he tried to break the heavy seals and loosen the string his hands shook so much that he pushed it over to anne saying you open it tell me if my boy is dead  annes alarm took the course of speed  she tore off the wrapper and after one glance said no no it cannot be the worst here is something from himself at the end  here sir  i cannot  i cannot said the poor old man as the tears dimmed his spectacles and he could not adjust them  read it my dear wench and let me know what i am to tell his poor mother  and he sank into a chair holding between his knees his little grandson who stood gazing with widelyopened blue eyes  he sends love duty blessing  oh he talks of coming home so do not fear sir cried anne a vivid colour on her cheeks  but what is it asked the father  tell me firstthe rest after  it is in the sidethe left side said anne gathering up in her agitation the sense of the crabbed writing as best she could  they have not extracted the bullet but when they have he will do well  god grant it  who writes  norman graham of glendhucaptain in his k k regiment of volunteer dragoons  thats his great friend  oh sir he has behaved so gallantly  he got his wound in saving the colours from the turks and kept his hands clutched over them as his men carried him out of the battle  philip gave another little spring and his grandfather bade anne read the letter to him in detail  it told how the imperial forces had met a far superior number of turks at lippa and had sustained a terrible defeat with the loss of their general veterani how captain archfield had received a scimitar wound in the cheek while trying to save his commander but had afterwards dashed forward among the enemy recovered the colours of the regiment and by a desperate charge of his fellowsoldiers who were devotedly attached to him had been borne off the field with a severe wound on the left side  retreat had been immediately necessary and he had been taken on an ammunition waggon along rough roads to the fortress called the iron gates of transylvania whence this letter was written and sent by the messenger who was to summon the elector of saxony to the aid of the remnant of the army  it had not yet been possible to probe the wound but charles gave a personal message begging his parents not to despond but to believe him recovering so long as they did not see his servant return without him and he added sundry tender and dutiful messages to his parents and a blessing to his son with thanks for the pretty letter he had not been able to answer but which his friend said was lying spread on his pillow not unstained with blood and he also told his boy always to love and look up to her who had ever been as a mother to him  anne could hardly read this and the scrap in feeble irregular lines she handed to sir philip  it was  with all my heart i entreat pardon for all the errors that have grieved you  i leave you my child to comfort you and mine own true love whom yon will cherish  she will cherish you as a daughter as she will be with your consent if god spares me to come home  the love of all my soul to her my mother sister and you  there was a scrawl for conclusion and signature and captain graham added  writing and dictating have greatly exhausted him  he would have said more but he says the lady can explain much and he repeats his urgent entreaties that you will take her to your heart as a daughter and that his son will love and honour her  there was a final postscript  the surgeon thinks him better for having disburthened his mind  my child said sir philip with a long sigh looking up at anne who had gathered the boy into her arms and was hiding her face against his little awestruck head my child have you read  no faltered anne  read then  and as she would have taken it he suddenly drew her into his embrace and kissed her as the eyes of both overflowed  my poor girl he said this is as hard to you as to us  oh my brave boy and he let her lay her head on his shoulder and held her hand as they wept together while little phil stared for a moment or two at so strange a sight and then burst out with a great cry  you shall not cry you shall not my papa is not dead and he stamped his little foot  no he isnt  he will get well the letter said so and i will go and tell grandmamma  the need of stopping this roused them both sir philip heavily groaning went away to break the tidings to his wife and anne went down on her knees on the hearth to caress the boy and help him to understand his fathers state and realise the valorous deeds that would always be a crown to him and which already made the little fellows eye flash and his fair head go higher  by and by she was sent for to lady archfields room and there she had again to share the grief and the fears and try to dwell on the glory and the hopes  when in a calmer moment the parents interrogated her on what had passed with charles it was not in the spirit of doubt and censure but rather as dwelling on all that was to be told of one whom alike they loved and finally sir philip said i see dear child i would not believe how far it had gone before though you tried to tell me  whatever betide you have won a daughters place  it was true that naturally a far more distinguished match would have been sought for the heir and he could hardly have carried out his purpose without more opposition than under their present feelings his parents supposed themselves likely to make but they really loved anne enough to have yielded at last and lady nutley coming home with a fuller knowledge of her brothers heart prevented any reaction and anne was allowed full sympathies as a betrothed maiden in the wearing anxiety that continued in the absence of all intelligence  on the principle of doing everything to please him she was even encouraged to write to charles in the packet in which he was almost implored to recover though all felt doubts whether he were alive even while the letters were in hand and this doubt lasted long and long  it was all very well to say that as long as the servant did not return his master must be safeperhaps himself on the way home but the journey from transylvania was so long and there were so many difficulties in the way of an englishman that there was little security in this assurance  and so the winter set in while the suspense lasted and still dr woodford spoke charless name in the intercessions in the panelled household chapel and his mother and anne prayed together and separately and his little son morning and evening entreated god to bless papa and make him well and bring him home  thus passed more than six weeks during which sir philips attention was somewhat diverted from domestic anxieties by an uninvited visit to portchester from mr charnock who had once been a college mate of mr fellowes and came professing anxiety after all these years to renew the friendship which had been broken when they took different sides on the election of dr hough to the presidency of magdalen college  from his quarters at the rectory mr charnock had gone over to fareham and sounded sir philip on the practicability of a jacobite rising and whether he and his people would join it the old gentleman was much distressed his age would not permit him to exert himself in either cause and he had been too much disturbed by jamess proceedings to feel desirous of his restoration though his loyal heart would not permit of his opposing it and he had never overtly acknowledged william of orange as his sovereign  he could only reply that in the present state of his family he neither could nor would undertake anything and he urgently pleaded against any insurrection that could occasion a civil war  there was reason to think that sedley had no hesitation in promising to use all his influence over his uncles tenants and considerably magnifying their extremely small regard to himnay probably dwelling on his own expectations  at any rate even when charnock was gone sedley continued to talk big of the coming changes and his own distinguished part in them indeed one very trying effect of the continued alarm about charles was that he took to haunting the place and report declared that he had talked loudly and coarsely of his cousins death and his uncles dotage and of his soon being called in to manage the property for the little heirinsomuch that sir edmund nutley thought it expedient to let him know that charles on going on active service soon after he had come of age had sent home a will making his son who was a young gentleman of very considerable property on his mothers side ward to his grandfather first and then to sir edmund nutley himself and to dr woodford    chapter xxvi the legend of penny grim   o dearest marjorie stay at hame    for darks the gate ye have to go for theres a maike down yonder glen    hath frightened me and many me  hogg  nana said little philip in a meditative voice as he looked into the glowing embers of the hall fire when do fairies leave off stealing little boys  i do not believe they ever steal them phil  oh yes they do and he came and stood by her with his great limpid blue eyes wide open  goody dearlove says they stole a little boy and his name was penny grim  goody dearlove is a silly old body to tell my boy such stories said anne disguising how much she was startled  oh but ralph huntsman says tis true and he knew him  how could he know him when he was stolen  they put another instead said the boy a little puzzled but too young to make his story consistent  and he was an elfa cross spiteful elf that was always vexing folk  and they stole him again every seven years  yesthat was itthey stole him every seven years  whom phil i dont understandthe boy or the elf she said halfdiverted even while shocked at the old story coming up in such a form  the elf i think he said bending his brows he comes back and then they steal him again  yes and at last they stole him quite quite awaybut it is seven years and goody dearlove says he is to be seen again  no exclaimed anne with an irrepressible start of dismay  has any one seen him or fancied so she added though feeling that her chance of maintaining her rational incredulity was gone  goody dearloves jenny did was the answer  she saw him stand out on the beach at night by moonlight and when she screamed out he was gone like the snuff of a candle  saw him  what was he like said anne struggling for the dispassionate tone of the governess and recollecting that jenny dearlove was a maid at portchester rectory  a little bit of a man all twisty on one side and a feather sticking out  ralph said they always were like that and phils imitation with his lithe graceful little figure of ralphs clumsy mimicry was sufficient to show that there was some foundation for this story and she did not answer at once so that he added i am seven nana do you think they will get me  oh no no phil theres no fear at all of that  i dont believe fairies steal anybody but even old women like goody dearlove only say they steal little tiny babies if they are left alone before they are christened  the boy drew a long breath but still asked was penny grim a little baby  so they said returned anne by no means interfering with the name and with a quailing heart as she thought of the childs ever knowing what concern his father had in that disappearance  she was by no means sorry to have the conversation broken off by sir philips appearance booted and buskined prepared for an expedition to visit a flock of sheep and their lambs under the shelter of portsdown hill and in a moment his little namesake was frisking round eager to go with grandpapa  well tis a brisk frost  is it too far for him think you mistress anne  oh no sir he is a strong little man and a walk will only be good for him if he does not stand still too long and get chilled  run phil and ask nurse for your thick coat and stout shoes and leggings  his grandmother only half trusts me with him said sir philip laughing  i tell her she was not nearly so careful of his father i remember him coming in crusted all over with ice so that he could hardly get his clothes off but she fancies the boy may have some of his poor mothers weakliness about him  i see no tokens of it sir  granddames will be anxious specially over one chick  heigho winter travelling must be hard in germany and posts do not come how now my man  are you rolled up like a very russian bear  the poor ewes will think you are come to eat up their lambs  ill growl at them said master philip uttering a sound sufficient to disturb the nerves of any sheep if he were permitted to make it and off went grandfather and grandson together sir philip only pausing at the door to say  my lady wants you anne she is fretting over the delay  i fear though i tell her it bodes well  anne watched for a moment the hale old gentleman briskly walking on the merry child frolicking hither and thither round him and the sturdy bodyservant ralph without whom he never stirred plodding after while keeper the only dog allowed to follow to the sheepfolds marched decorously along proud of the distinction then she went up to lady archfield who could not be perfectly easy as to the precious grandchild being left to his own devices in the cold while sir philip was sure to run into a discussion with the shepherd over the turnips which were too much of a novelty to be approved by the hampshire mind  it was quite true that she could not watch that little adventurous spirit with the same absence of anxiety as she had felt for her own son in her younger days and anne had to devote herself to soothing and diverting her mind till dr woodford knocked at the door to read and converse with her  the one oclock dinner waited for the grandfather and grandson and when they came at last little philip looked somewhat blue with cold and more subdued than usual and his grandfather observed severely that he had been a naughty boy running into dangerous places sliding where he ought not and then muttered under his breath that sedley ought to have known better than to have let him go there  discipline did not permit even a darling like little phil to speak at dinnertime but he fidgeted and the tears came into his eyes and anne hearing a little grunt behind sir philips chair looked up and was aware that old ralph was mumbling what to her ears sounded like  knew too well  but his master being slightly deaf did not hear and went on to talk of his lambs and of how sedley had joined them on the road but had not come back to dinner  phil was certainly quieter than usual that afternoon and sat at annes feet by the fire filling little sacks with bran to be loaded on his toy cart to go to the mill but not chattering as usual  she thought him tired and hearing a sort of sigh took him on her knee when he rested his fair little head on her shoulder and presently said in a low voice  ive seen him  who  not your father  oh my child cried anne in a sudden horror  oh nothe penny grim thing  what  tell me phil dear how or where  by the end of the great big pond and he threw up his arms and made a horrid grin  the boy trembled and hid his face against her  but go on phil  he cant hurt you you know  do tell me  where were you  i was sliding on the ice  grandpapa was ever so long talking to bill shepherd and looking at the men cutting turnips and i got cold and tired and ran about with cousin sedley till we got to the big pond and we began to slide and the ice was so nice and hard you cant think  he showed me how to take a good long slide and said i might go out to the other end of the pond by the copse by the great old tree  and i set off but before i got there out it jumped out of the copse and waved its arms and made that face  he cowered into her bosom again and almost cried  anne knew the place and was ready to start with dismay in her turn  it was such a pool as is frequent in chalk districtsshallow at one end but deep and dangerous with springs at the other  but phil dear she said it was well you were stopped the ice most likely would have broken at that end and then where would nanas little man have been  cousin sedley never told me not said the boy in selfdefence he was whistling to me to go on  but when i tumbled down ralph and grandpapa and all did scold me soand cousin sedley was gone why did they scold me nana  i thought it was brave not to mind dangerlike papa  it is brave when one can do any good by it but not to slide on bad ice when one must be drowned said anne  oh my dear dear little fellow it was a blessed thing you saw that whatever it was  but why do you call it perepenny grim  it was nana  it was a little manrather  and onesided looking with a bit of hair sticking out just like the picture of riquet withatuft in your french fairybook  this last was convincing to anne that the child must have seen the phantom of seven years ago since he was not repeating the popular description he had given her in the morning but one quite as individual  she asked if grandpapa had seen it  oh no he was in the shed and only came out when he heard ralph scolding me  was it a wicked urchin come to steal me nana  no i think not she answered  whatever it was i think it came because god was taking care of his child and warning him from sliding into the deep pool  we will thank him phil  he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways and to that verse she soothed the tired child till he fell asleep and she could lay him on the settle and cover him with a cloak musing the while on the strange story until presently she started up and repaired to the buttery in search of the old servant  ralph what is this master philip tells me she asked  what has he seen  well mistress anne that is what i cant tellno not i but i knows this that the child has had a narrow escape of his precious life and id never trust him again with that there sedleyno not for hundreds of pounds  you really think ralph  what can i think maam  when i finds hes been asetting that there child to slide up to where hed be drownded as sure as hes alive and you see if we gets ill news of master archfield which god forbid theres naught but the boy atween him and this here placeand he over head and ears in debt  be it what it might that the child saw it saved the life of him  did you see it  no mistress anne i cant say as i did  i only heard the little master cry out as he fell  i was in the shed you see taking a pipe to keep me warm  and when i took him up he cried out like one dazed  twas penny grim ralph  keep me  he is come to steal me but sir philip wouldnt hear nothing of it only blamed master phil for being foolhardy and for crying for the fall and me for letting him out of sight  and mr sedleydid he see it  well mayhap he did for i saw him as white as a sheet and his eyes staring out of his head but that might have been his evil conscience  what became of him  to say the truth maam i believe he be at the brocas arms a drowning of his frightif fright it were with master harlings strong waters  but this apparition this shapeor whatever it is  what put it into master philips head  what has been heard of it  ralph looked unwilling  bless you mistress anne theres been some idle talk among the women folk as how that there crooked slip of major oakshotts as they called master perry or penny and said was a changeling has been seen once and again  some says as the fairies have got him and tis the seven year for him to come back again  and some says that he met with foul play and tis the ghost of him but i holds it all mere tales and i be sure twere nothing bad as stopped little master on that there pond  so i be  anne could not but be of the same mind but her confusion alarm and perplexity were great  it seemed strange granting that this were either spirit or elf connected with peregrine oakshott that it should interfere on behalf of charles archfields child and on the sweet hypothesis that a guardian angel had come to save the child it was in a most unaccountable form  and more pressing than any such mysterious idea was the tangible horror of ralphs suggestion too well borne out by the boys own unconscious account of the adventure  it was too dreadful too real a peril to be kept to herself and she carried the story to her uncle on his return but without speaking of the spectral warning not only did she know that he would not attend to it but the hint heard for the first time that peregrine was supposed to have met with foul play sealed her lips just when she still was hoping against hope that charles might be on the way home  but that ralph believed and little philips own account confirmed that his cousin had incited the little heir to the slide that would have been fatal save for his fall she told with detail and entreated that the grandfather might be warned and some means be found of ensuring the safety of her darling the motherless child  to her disappointment dr woodford was not willing to take alarm he did not think so ill of sedley as to believe him capable of such a secret act of murder and he had no great faith in ralphs sagacity besides that he thought his nieces nerves too much strained by the long suspense to be able to judge fairly  he thought it would be cruel to the grandparents and unjust to sedley to make such a frightful suggestion without further grounds during their present state of anxiety and as to the boys safety which anne pleaded with an uncontrollable passion of tears he believed that it was provided for by watchfulness on the part of his two constant guardians as well as himself since even supposing the shocking accusation to be true sedley would not involve himself in danger of suspicion and it was already understood that he was not a fit companion for his little cousin to be trusted with  philip had already brought home words and asked questions that distressed his grandmother and nobody was willing to leave him alone with the ex lieutenant  so again the poor maiden had to hold her peace under an added burthen of anxiety and many a prayer  when the country was ringing with the tidings of sir george barclays conspiracy for the assassination of william iii it was impossible not to hope that sedleys boastful tongue might have brought him sufficiently under suspicion to be kept for a while under lock and key but though he did not appear at fareham there was reason to suppose that he was as usual haunting the taverns and cockpits of portsmouth  no one went much abroad that winter  sir philip perhaps from anxiety and fretting had a fit of the gout and anne kept herself and her charge within the garden or the street of the town  in fact there was a good deal of danger on the roads  the neighbourhood of the seaport was always lawless and had become more so since sir philip had ceased to act as justice of the peace and there were reports of highway robberies of an audacious kind said to be perpetrated by a band calling themselves the black gang under a leader known as piers pigwiggin who were alleged to be half smuggler half jacobite and to have their headquarters somewhere in the back of the isle of wight in spite of the governor the terrible salamander lord cutts who was indeed generally absent with the army    chapter xxvii the vault   heaven awards the vengeance due  cowper  the weary days had begun to lengthen before the door of the hall was flung open and little phil forgetting his bow at the door rushed in heres a big packet from foreign parts  harry had to pay ever so much for it  i have wellnigh left off hoping sighed the poor mother  tell me the worst at once  no fear my lady said her husband  thank god  tis our sons hand  there was the silence for a moment of intense relief and then the little boy was called to cut the silk and break the seals  joy ineffable  there were three lettersfor master philip archfield for mistress anne jacobina woodford and for sir philip himself  the old gentleman glanced over it caught the words better and coming home then failed to read through tears of joy as before through tears of sorrow and was fain to hand the sheet to his old friend to be read aloud while little philip handling as a treasure the first letter he had ever received though as yet he was unable to decipher it stood between his grandfathers knees listening as dr woodford read  dear and honoured siri must ask your pardon for leaving you without tidings so long but while my recovery still hung in doubt i thought it would only distress you to hear of the fluctuations that i went through and the pain to which the surgeons put me for a long time in vain  indeed frequently i had no power either to think or speak until at last with much difficulty and little knowledge or volition of my own my inestimable friend graham brought me to vienna where i have at length been relieved from my troublesome companion and am enjoying the utmost care and kindness from my friends mother a near kinswoman as indeed he is himself of the brave and lamented viscount dundee  my wound is healing finally as i hope and though i have not yet left my bed my friends assure me that i am on the way to full and complete recovery for which i am more thankful to the almighty than i could have been before i knew what suffering and illness meant  as soon as i can ride again which they tell me will be in a fortnight or three weeks i mean to set forth on my way home  i cannot describe to you how i am longing after the sight of you all nor how homesick i have become  i never had time for it before but i have lain for hours bringing all your faces before me my fathers and mothers my sisters and that of her whom i hope to call my own and figuring to myself that of the little one  i have thought much over my past life and become sensible of much that was amiss and while earnestly entreating your forgiveness especially for having absented myself all these years i hope to return so as to be more of a comfort than i was in the days of my rash and inconsiderate youth  i am of course at present invalided but i want to consult you honoured sir before deciding whether it be expedient for me to resign my commission how i thank and bless you for the permission you have given me and the love you bear to my own hearts joy no words can tell it shall be the study of my life to be worthy of her and of you and so no more from your loving and dutiful son charles archfield  having drunk in these words with her ears anne left phil to have his note interpreted by his grandparents and fled away to enjoy her own in her chamber yet it was as short as could be and as sweet  mine own mine own sweet anne sweetheart of good old days your letter gave me strength to go through with it  the doctors could not guess why i was so much better and smiled through all their torments  these are our first i hope our last letters for i shall soon follow them home and mine own darling will be mine thine own c a  she had but short time to dwell on it and kiss it for little philip was upon her waving his letter which he already knew by heart and galloping all over the house to proclaim the good news to the old servants who came crowding into the hall trembling with joy to ask if there were indeed tidings of mr archfields return whereupon the glad father caused his grandson to carry each a full glass of wine to drink to the health of the young master  anne had at first felt only the surpassing rapture of the restoration of charles but there ensued another delight in the security his recovery gave to the life of his son  sedley archfield would not be likely to renew his attempt and if only on that account the good news should be spread as widely as possible  she was the first to suggest the relief it would be to mr fellowes who had never divested himself of the feeling that he ought to have divined his pupils intention  dr woodford offered to ride to portchester with the news and sir philip in the gladness of his heart proposed that anne should go with him and see her friend  shall it be told how on the way annes mind was assailed by feminine misgivings whether three and twenty could be as fair in her soldiers eyes as seventeen had been  old maidenhood came earlier then than in these days and anne knew that she was looked upon as an old waitinggentlewoman or governess by the belles of winchester her glass might tell her that her eyes were as softly brown her hair as abundant her cheek as clear and delicately moulded as ever but there was no one to assure her that the early bloom had not passed away and that she had not rather gained than lost in dignity of bearing and the stately poise of the head which the jealous damsels called court airs  and should he be disappointed i shall see it in his eyes she said to herself and then his promise shall not bind him though it will break my heart and oh how hard to resign my phil to a strange stepmother  still her heart was lighter than for many a long year as she cantered along in the brisk march air while the drops left by the departing frost glistened in the sunshine and the sea lay stretched in a delicate gray haze  the old castle rose before her in its familiar homelike massiveness as they turned towards the rectory where in that sheltered spot the wellknown clusters of crocuses were opening their golden hearts to the sunshine and recalling the days when anne was as sunnyhearted as they and she felt as if she could be as bright again  in mrs fellowess parlour they found an unexpected guest no other than mrs oakshott  gadding about not being the fashion of the archfield household anne had not seen the lady for several years and was agreeably surprised by her appearance  perhaps the marks of smallpox had faded perhaps motherhood had given expression and what had been gaunt ungainliness in the maiden had rounded into a certain importance in the matron nor had her dress though quiet any of the puritan rigid ugliness that had been complained of and though certainly not beautiful she was a person to inspire respect  it was explained that she was waiting for her husband who was gone with mr fellowes to speak to the officer in command of the soldiers at the castle  for said she i am quite convinced that there is something that ought to be brought to light and it may be in that vault  annes heart gave such a throb as almost choked her  dr woodford asked what the lady meant  well sir when spirits and things tis not well to talk of are starting up and about here there and everywhere tis plain there must be cause for it  i do not quite take your meaning madam  ah well you gentlemen reverend ones especially are the last to hear such things  theres the poor old major he wont believe a word of it but you know mistress woodford  i see it in your face have you seen anything  not here not now faltered anne  you have mrs fellowes  i have heard of some foolish fright of the maids said naomi partly their own fancy or perhaps caught from the sentry  there is no keeping those giddy girls from running after the soldiers  perhaps naomi hoped by throwing out this hint to conduct her visitors off into the safer topic of domestic delinquencies but mrs oakshott was far too earnest to be thus diverted and she exclaimed ah they saw him ill warrant  him the doctor asked innocently  him or his likeness said mrs oakshott my poor brotherinlaw peregrine oakshott you remember him sir  he always said poor lad that you and mrs woodford were kinder to him than his own flesh and blood except his uncle sir peregrine  for my part i never did give in to all the nonsense folk talked about his being a changeling or at best a limb of satan  he had more spirit and sense than the rest of them and they led him the life of a dog though they knew no better  if i had had him at emsworth i would have shown them what he was and she sighed heavily  well i did not so much wonder when he disappeared i made sure that he could bear it no longer and had run away  i waited as long as there was any reason till there should be tidings of him and only took his brother at last because i found they could not do without me at home  remarkable frankness but it struck both the doctor and anne that if peregrine could have submitted his life might have been freer and less unhappy than he had expected though mrs martha spoke the broadest hampshire  naomi asked then you no longer think that he ran away  no madam i am certain there was worse than that  you remember the night of the bonfire for the bishops acquittal miss woodford  indeed i do  well he was never seen again after that as you know  the place was full of wild folk  there was brawling right and left  were you there asked anne surprised  yes in my coach with my uncle and aunt that lived with me though except robin none of the young sparks would come near me except some that i knew were after my pockets said martha with a good humoured laugh  properly frightened we were too by the brawling sailors ere we got home  now what could be more likely than that some of them got hold of poor perry  you know he always would go about with the rapier he brought from germany with amber set in the hilt and the mosaic snuffbox he got in italy and what could be looked for but that the poor dear lad should be put out of the way for the sake of these gewgaws  this supposition was gratifying to anne but her uncle must needs ask why mrs oakshott thought so more than before  because she said impressively there is no doubt but that he has been seen and not in the flesh once and again and always about these ruins  by whom madam may i ask  mrs fellowess maids as she knows saw him once on the beach at night just there  the sentry who is tom hart from our parish saw a shape at the opening of the old vault before the keep and challenged him when he vanished out of sight ere there was time to present a musket  there was once more when one moonlight night our sexton looking out of his cottage window saw what he declares was none other than master perry standing among the graves of our family as if poor youth he were asking why he was not among them when i heard that i said to my husband depend upon it says i he met with his death that night and was thrown into some hole and thats the reason he cannot rest  if i pay a hundred pounds for it ill not give up till his poor corpse is found to have christian burial and ill begin with the old vault at portchester  my good father the major would not hear of it at first nor my husband either but tis my money and i know how to tackle robin  it was with strangely mingled feelings that anne listened  that search in the vault inaugurated by faithful martha was what she had always felt ought to be made and she had even promised to attempt it if the apparitions recurred  the notion of the deed being attributed to lawless sailors and smugglers or highwaymen who were known to swarm in the neighbourhood seemed to remove all danger of suspicion  yet she could not divest herself of a vague sense of alarm at this stirring up of what had slept for seven years  neither she nor her uncle deemed it needful to mention the appearance seen by little philip but to her surprise naomi slowly and hesitatingly said it was very remarkable that her husband having occasion to be at the church at dusk one evening just after midsummer had certainly seen a figure close to mrs woodfords grave and lost sight of it before he could speak of it  he thought nothing more of it till these reports began to be spread but he had then recollected that it answered the descriptions given of the phantom  here the ladies were interrupted by the appearance of mr fellowes and robert oakshott now grown into a somewhat heavy but by no means foolishlooking young man  well madam said he in hampshire as broad as his wifes you will have your will  not that captain henslowe believes a word of your ghostsnot he but he took fire when he heard of queer sights about the castle  he sent for the chap who stood sentry and was downright sharp on him for not reporting what he had seen and he is ordering out a sergeants party to open the vault so you may come and see if you have any stomach for it  i could not but come said madam oakshott who certainly did not look squeamish but who was far more in earnest than her husband and perhaps doubted whether without her presence the quest would be thorough  anne was full of dread and almost sick at the thought of what she might see but she was far too anxious to stay away  mrs fellowes made some excuse about the children for not accompanying them  it always thrilled anne to enter that old castle court the familiar and beloved playplace of her childhood full of memories of charles and of lucy and containing in its wide precincts the churchyard where her mother lay  she moved along in a kind of dream glad to be let alone since mr fellowes naturally attended mrs oakshott and robert was fully occupied in explaining to the doctor that he only gave in to this affair for the sake of pacifying madam since women folk would have their little megrims  assuredly that tall solid resolute figure stalking on in front looked as little subject to megrims as any of her sex  her determination had brought her husband thither and her determination further carried the day when the captain after staring at the solidlooking turf stamping on the one stone that was visible and trampling down the bunch of nettles beside it declared that the entrance had been so thoroughly stopped that it was of no use to dig farther  it was madam martha who demanded permission to offer the four soldiers a crown apiece if they opened the vault a guinea each if they found anything  the captain could not choose but grant it though with something of a sneer and the work was begun  he walked up and down with robert joining in hopes that the lady would be satisfied before dinner time  the two clergymen likewise walked together arguing as was their wont on the credibility of apparitions  the two ladies stood in almost breathless watch as the bricks that had covered in the opening were removed and the dark hole brought to light  contrary to expectation when the opening had been enlarged it was found that there were several steps of stone and where they were broken away there was a rude ladder  a lantern was fetched from the guardroom in the bailey and after much shaking and trying of the ladder one of the soldiers descended finding the place less deep than was commonly supposed and soon calling out that he was at the bottom  another followed him and presently there was a shout  something was found  a rusty old chain no doubt grumbled robert but his wife shrieked it was a sword in its sheath the belt rotted the clasp tarnished but of silver  mrs oakshott seized it at once rubbed away the dust from the handle and brought to light a glistening yellow piece of amber which she mutely held up and another touch of her handkerchief disclosed on a silver plate in the scabbard an oak tree the family crest and the twisted cypher p o  her eyes were full of tears and she did not speak  anne white and trembling was forced to sink down on the stone unnoticed by all while robert oakshott convinced indeed hastily went down himself  the sword had been hidden in a sort of hollow under the remains of the broken stair  thence likewise came to light the mouldy remnant of a broad hat and the quill of its plume and what had once been a coat even in its present state showing that it had been soaked through and through with blood the same stains visible on the watch and the mosaic snuffbox  that was all there was no purse and no other garments though considering the condition of the coat they might have been entirely destroyed by the rats and mice  there was indeed a fragment of a handkerchief with the cypher worked on it which mrs oakshott showed to anne with the tears in her eyes  there  i worked that though he never knew it  no  i know he did not like me  but i would have made him do so at last  i would have been so good to him  poor fellow that he should have been lying there all this time  lying there but where then was he  no signs of any corpse were to be found though one after another all the gentlemen descended to look and mrs oakshott was only withheld by her husbands urgent representations and promise to superintend a diligent digging in the ground so as to ascertain whether there had been a hasty burial there  altogether anne was so much astonished and appalled that she could hardly restrain herself and her mind reverted to bishop kens theory that peregrine still lived but this was contradicted by the appearance at douai which did not rest on the evidence of her single perceptions  mrs fellowes sent out an entreaty that they would come to dinner and the gentlemen were actually base enough to wish to comply so that the two ladies had no choice save to come with them especially as the soldiers were unwilling to work on without their meal neither mrs oakshott nor anne felt as if they could swallow and the polite pressure to eat was only preferable in annes eyes to the conversation on the discoveries that had been made especially the conclusion arrived at by all that though the purse and rings had not been found the presence of the watch and snuffbox precluded the idea of robbery  these would be found on the body said mr oakshott  i could swear to the purse  you remember madam your uncle bantering him about french ladies and their finery asking whose token it was and how black my father looked  poor perry if my father could have had a little patience with him he would not have gone roaming about and getting into brawls and we need not be looking for him in yonder black pit  youll never find him there master robert spoke out the old oakwood servant behind mrs oakshotts chair free and easy after the manner of the time  and wherefore not jonadab demanded his mistress by no means surprised at the liberty  why maam twas the seven years you sees and in course when them you wot of had power to carry him off they could not take his sword nor his hat not they couldnt  how about his purse then put in dr woodford  ill be bound you will find it yet sir responded jonadab by no means disconcerted leastways unless some twolegged fairies have got it  at this some of the party found it impossible not to laugh and this so upset poor marthas composure that she was obliged to leave the table and anne was not sorry for the excuse of attending her although there were stings of pain in all her rambling lamentations and conjectures  very tardily according to the feelings of the anxious women was the dinner finished and their companions ready to take them out again  indeed madam oakshott at last repaired to the dining parlour and roused her husband from his glass of spanish wine to renew the search  she would not listen to mrs fellowess advice not to go out again and anne could not abstain either from watching for what could not be other than grievous and mournful to behold  the soldiers were called out again by their captain and reinforced by the rectory servant and jonadab  there was an interval of anxious prowling round the opening  mr oakshott and the captain had gone down again and found what the military man was anxious about that if there were passages to the outer air they had been well blocked up and not reopened  meantime the digging proceeded  it was just at twilight that a voice below uttered an exclamation then came a pause  the old sergeants voice ordered care and a pause somewhere below the opening with sir the spades have hit upon a skull  there was a shuddering pause  all the gentlemen except dr woodford who feared the chill descended again  mrs oakshott and anne held each others hands and trembled  by and by mr fellowes came up first  we have found he said looking pale and grave a skeleton  yes a perfect skeleton but no moreno remains except a fine dust  and robert oakshott following awestruck and sorrowful added yes there he is poor perryall that is left of himonly his bones  no madam we must leave him there for the present we cannot bring it up without preparation  you need not fear meddling curiosity madam said the captain  i will post a sentry here to bar all entrance  thanks sir said robert  that will be well till i can bury the poor fellow with all due respect by my mother and oliver  and then i trust his spirit will have rest said martha oakshott fervently  and now home to your father  how will he bear it sir  i verily believe he will sleep the quieter for knowing for a certainty what has become of poor peregrine said her husband  and anne felt as if half her burthen of secrecy was gone when they all parted starting early because the black gang rendered all the roads unsafe after dark    chapter xxviii the disclosure   he looked about as one betrayed what hath he done what promise made oh weak weak moment to what end can such a vain oblation tend  wordsworth  for the most part anne was able to hold her peace and keep out of sight while dr woodford related the strange revelations of the vault with all the circumstantiality that was desired by two old people living a secluded life and concerned about a neighbour of many years whom they had come to esteem by force of a certain sympathy in honest opposition  the mystery occupied them entirely for though the murder was naturally ascribed to some of the lawless coast population the valuables remaining with the clothes made a strange feature in the case  it was known that there was to be an inquest held on the remains before their removal and dr woodford both from his own interest in the question and as family intelligencer rode to the castle sir philip longed to go but it was a cold wet day and he had threatenings of gout so that he was persuaded to remain by the fireside  inquests were then always held where the body lay and the court of portchester castle was no place for him on such a day  dr woodford came home just before twilight looking grave and troubled and much to annes alarm desired to speak to sir philip privately in the gunroom  lady archfield took alarm and much distressed her by continually asking what could be the meaning of the interview and making all sorts of guesses  when at last they came together into the parlour the poor lady looked so anxious and frightened that her husband went up to her and said do not be alarmed sweetheart  we shall clear him but those foolish fellows have let suspicion fall on poor sedley  nobody looked at anne or her deadly paleness must have been remarked and the trembling which she could hardly control by clasping her hands tightly together keeping her feet hard on the floor and setting her teeth  lady archfield was perhaps less fond of the scapegrace nephew than was her husband and she felt the matter chiefly as it affected him so that she heard with more equanimity than he had done and as they sat round the fire in the halflight for which anne was thankful the doctor gave his narration in order  i found a large company assembled in the castle court waiting for the coroner from portsmouth though the sentry on guard would allow no one to go down in spite of some even ladies i am ashamed to say who offered him bribes for the permission  everything i heard had been replaced as we found it  the poor major himself was there looking sadly broken and much needing the help of his sons arm  to think that i was blaming my poor son as a mere reprobate and praying for his conversion says he when he was lying here cut off without a moment for repentance  there was your nephew suspecting nothing squire brocas mr eyre of botley grange mr biden mr larcom and mr bargus and a good many more besides dr james yonge the naval doctor and the mayor of portsmouth and more than i can tell you  when the coroner came and the jury had been sworn in they went down and viewed the spot and all that was there  the soldiers had put candles round and a huge place it is all built up with large stones  then as it was raining hard they adjourned to the great room in the keep and took the evidence robert oakshott identified the clothes and the watch clearly enough and said he had no doubt that the other remains were peregrines but as to swearing to a brothers bones no one could do that and dr yonge said in my ear that if the deceased were so small a man as folks said the skeleton could scarce be his for he thought it had belonged to a largeframed person  that struck no one else for naturally it is only a chirurgeon who is used to reckon the proportion that the bones bear to the body and i also asked him whether in seven years the other parts would be so entirely consumed to which he answered that so much would depend on the nature of the soil that there was no telling  however jury and coroner seemed to feel no doubt and that old seafaring man tom block declared that poor master peregrine had been hand and glove with a lot of wild chaps and that the vault had been well known to them before the gentlemen had had it blocked up  then it was asked who had seen him last and robert oakshott spoke of having parted with him at the bonfire and never seen him again  there i fancy it would have ended in a verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown but robert oakshott must needs say i would give a hundred pounds to know who the villain was  and then who should get up but george rackstone with please your honour i could tell summat  the coroner bade swear him and he deposed to having seen master peregrine going down towards the castle somewhere about four oclock that morning after the bonfire when he was getting up to go to his mowing  but that was not all  you remember anne that his fathers cottage stands on the road towards portsmouth  well he brought up the story of your running in there frightened the day before the bonfire when i was praying with his sick mother calling on me to stop a fray between peregrine and young sedley and i had to get up and tell of sedleys rudeness to you child  what was that hastily asked lady archfield  the old story my lady  the young officers swaggering attempt to kiss the girl he meets on the road  i doubt even if he knew at the moment that it was my niece  peregrine was coming by at the moment and interfered to protect her and swords were drawn  i could not deny it nor that there was ill blood between the lads and then young brocas who was later on portsdown than we were remembered high words and had thought to himself that there would be a challenge  and next old goody spore recollects seeing master sedley and another soldier officer out on the portsmouth road early that morning  the hay was making in the court then and jenny light remembered that when the haymakers came she raked up something that looked like a bloody spot and showed it to one of the others but they told her that most likely a rabbit or a hare had been killed there and she had best take no heed  probably there was dread of getting into trouble about a smugglers fray  well every one was looking askance at master sedley by this time and the coroner asked him if he had anything to say  he spoke out boldly enough  he owned to the dispute with peregrine oakshott and to having parted with him that night on terms which would only admit of a challenge he wrote a cartel that night and sent it by his friend lieutenant ainslie but doubting whether major oakshott might not prevent its delivery he charged him to try to find peregrine outside the house and arrange with him a meeting on the hill where you know the duellists of the garrison are wont to transact such encounters sedley himself walked out part of the way with his friend but neither of them saw peregrine nor heard anything of him  so he avers but when asked for his witness to corroborate the story he says that ainslie i fear the only person who could have proved an alibiif so it werewas killed at landen but he added certainly with too much of his rough way it was a mere absurdity to charge it upon him  what should a gentleman have to do with private murders and robberies  nor did he believe the bones to be perry oakshotts at all  it was all a bit of whiggish spite  he worked himself into a passion which only added to the impression against him and i own i cannot wonder that the verdict has sent him to winchester to take his trial  why anne child how now  tis a terrible story  take my essences child said lady archfield tottering across and anne just saving herself from fainting by a long gasp at them let herself be led from the room the maids buzzed about her and for some time she was sensible of nothing but a longing to get rid of them and to be left alone to face the grievous state of things which she did not yet understand at last with kind goodnights from lady archfield such as she could hardly return she was left by herself in the darkness to recover from the stunned helpless feeling of the first moment  sedley accused  charles to be sacrificed to save his worthless cousin the wouldbe murderer of his innocent child who morally thus deserved to suffer  never never  she could not do so  it would be treason to her benefactors nay absolute injustice for charles had struck in generous defence of herself but sedley had tried to allure the boy to his death merely for his own advantage should she not be justified in simply keeping silence  yet there was like an arrow in her heart the sense of guilt in so doing guilt towards god and truth guilt towards man and justice  she should die under the load and it would be for charles  might it only be before he came home then he would know that she had perished under his secret to save him  nay but would he be thankful at being saved at the expense of his cousins life  if he came how should she meet him  the sense of the certain indignation of a good and noble human spirit often awakes the full perception of what an action would be in the sight of heaven and anne began to realise the sin more than at first and to feel the compulsion of truth  if only charles were not coming home she could write to him and warn him but the thought that he might be already on the way had turned from joy to agony and to think she said to herself that i was fretting as to whether he would think me pretty  she tossed about in misery every now and then rising on her knees to prayat first for charless safetyfor she shrank from asking for divine protection knowing only too well what that would be gradually however a shudder came over her at the thought that if she would not commit her way unto the lord she might indeed be the undoing of her lover and then once more the higher sense of duty rose on her  she prayed for forgiveness for the thought and that it might not be visited upon him she prayed for strength to do what must be her duty for safety for him and comfort to his parents and so in passing gusts of misery and apprehension of failing heart and recovered resolution of anguish and of prayer the long night at length passed and with the first dawn she arose shaken and weak but resolved to act on her terrible resolution before it again failed her  sir philip was always an early riser and she heard his foot on the stairs before seven oclock  she came out on the staircase which met the flight which he was descending and tried to speak but her lips seemed too dry to part  child child you are ill said the old gentleman as he saw her blanched cheek you should be in bed this chilly morning  go back to your chamber  no no sir i cannot  pray your honour come here i have something to say and she drew him to the open door of his justice room called the gunroom  bless me he muttered the wench does not mean that she has got smitten with that poor rogue my nephew  oh no no said anne almost ready for a hysterical laugh yet letting the old man seat himself and then dropping on her knees before him for she could hardly stand it is worse than that sir i know who it was who did that thing  well who he said hastily why have you kept it back so long and let an innocent man get into trouble  o sir philip  i could not help it  forgive me and with clasped hands she brought out the words it was your son mr archfield and then she almost collapsed again  child child you are ill you do not know what you are saying  we must have you to bed again  i will call your uncle  ah sir it is only too true but she let him fetch her uncle who was sure to be at his devotions in a kind of oratory on the farther side of the hall  she had not gone to him first from the old desire to keep him clear of the knowledge but she longed for such support as he might give her or at least to know whether he were very angry with her  the two old men quickly came back together and dr woodford began how now niece are you telling us dreams but he broke off as he saw the sad earnest of her face  sir it is too true  he charged me to speak out if any one else were brought into danger  come said sir philip testily dont crouch grovelling on the floor there  get up and let us know the meaning of this  good heavens the lad may be here any day  anne had much rather have knelt where she was but her uncle raised her and placed her in a chair saying try to compose yourself and tell us what you mean and why it has been kept back so long  indeed he did not intend it pleaded anne it was almost an accidentto protect meperegrine waspursuing me  upon my word young mistress burst out the father you seem to have been setting all the young fellows together by the ears  i doubt if she could help it said the doctor  she tried to be discreet but it was the reason her mother  well go on interrupted poor sir philip too unhappy to remember manners or listen to the defence what was it when was it  anne was allowed then to proceed  it was the morning i went to london  i went out to gather some mouseear  mouseear mouseear growled he  some one elses ear  it was for lady oglethorpe  it was said her uncle a specific it seems for whoopingcough i saw the letter and knew  umph let us hear said sir philip evidently with the idea of a tryst in his mind  no wonder mischief comes of maidens running about at such hours  what next  the poor girl struggled on  i saw peregrine coming and hoping he would not see me i ran into the keep meaning to get home by the battlements out of his sight but when i looked down he and mr archfield were fighting  i screamed but i dont think they heard me and i ran down but i had fastened all the doors and i was a long time getting out and by that time mr archfield had dragged him to the vault and thrown him in  he was like one distracted and said it must be hidden or it would be the death of his wife and his mother and what could i do  is that all the truth said sir philip sternly  what brought them thereeither of them  mr archfield came to bring me a pattern of sarcenet to match for poor young madam in london  no doubt sir philip recollected the petulant anger that this had been forgotten but he was hardly appeased  and the other fellow why he was brawling with my nephew sedley about you the day before  i do not think she was to blame there said dr woodford  the unhappy youth was set against marrying mistress browning and had talked wildly to my sister and me about wedding my niece  but why should she run away as if he had the plague and set the foolish lads to fight  sir i must tell you anne owned he had beset me and talked so desperately that i was afraid of what he might do in that lonely place and at such an hour in the morning  i hoped he had not seen me  umph said sir philip much as if he thought a silly girls imagination had caused all the mischief  when did he thus speak to you anne asked her uncle not unkindly  at the inn at portsmouth sir said anne  he came while you were with mr stanbury and the rest and wanted me to marry him and flee to france or i know not where or at any rate marry him secretly so as to save him from poor mistress browning  i could not choose but fear and avoid him but oh  i would have faced him ten times over rather than have brought this onus all  and now what shall i do he mr archfield when i saw him in france said as long as no one was suspected it would only give more pain to say what i knew but that if suspicion fell on any one and her voice died away  he could not say otherwise returned sir philip with a groan  and now what shall i do what shall i do sighed the poor girl i must speak truth  i never bade you perjure yourself said sir philip sharply but hiding his face in his hands and groaning out oh my son my son  seeing that his distress so overcame poor anne that she could scarcely contain herself dr woodford thought it best to take her from the room promising to come again to her  she could do nothing but lie on her bed and weep in a quiet heartbroken way  sir philips anger seemed to fill up the measure by throwing the guilt back upon her and rousing a bitter sense of injustice and then she wept again at her cruel selfishness in blaming the brokenhearted old man  she could hardly have come down to breakfast so heavy were her limbs and so sick and faint did every movement render her and she further bethought herself that the poor old father might not brook the sight of her under the circumstances  it was a pang to hear little philip prancing about the house and when he had come to her to say his prayers she sent him down with a message that she was not well enough to come downstairs and that she wanted nothing only to be quiet  the little fellow was very pitiful and made her cry again by wanting to know whether she had gout like grandpapa or rheumatics like grandmamma and then stroking her face calling her his dear nana and telling her of the salad in his garden that his papa was to eat the very first day he came home  by and by dr woodford knocked at her door  he had had a long conversation with poor old sir philip who was calmer now than under the first blow and somewhat less inclined to anger with the girl who might indeed be the cause but surely the innocent cause of all  the doctor had done his best to show that her going out had no connection with any of the youths and he thought sir philip would believe it on quieter reflection  he had remembered too signs of selfreproach mixed with his sons grief for his wife and his extreme relief at the plan for going abroad recollecting likewise that charles had strongly disliked poor peregrine and had much resented the liking which young madam had shown for one whose attentions might have been partly intended to tease the young husband  of course said dr woodford the unhappy deed was no more than an unfortunate accident and if all had been known at first probably it would so have been treated  the concealment was an error but it is impossible to blame either of you for it  oh never mind that dear uncle  only tell me  must hemust charles suffer to save that man  you know what he is real murderer in heart  oh i know  the right must be done  but it is dreadful  the right must be done and the truth spoken at all costs  no one knows that better than our good old patron said the doctor but my dear child you are not called on to denounce this young man as you seem to imagine unless there should be no other means of saving his cousin or unless you are so questioned that you cannot help replying for truths sake  knowing nothing of all this it struck others besides myself at the inquest that the evidence against sedley was utterly insufficient for a conviction and if he should be acquitted matters will only be as they were before  then you think i am not bound to speakthe truth the whole truth nothing but the truth she murmured in exceeding grief yet firmly  you certainly may nay must keep your former silence till the trial at the lent assizes  i trust you may not be called on as a witness to the fray with sedley but that i may be sufficient testimony to that  i could testify to nothing else  remember if you are called you have only to answer what you are asked nor is it likely unless sedley have any suspicion of the truth that you will be asked any question that will implicate mr archfield  if so god give you strength my poor child to be true to him  but the point of the trial is to prove sedley guilty or not guilty and if the latter there is no more to be said  god grant it  but hemr archfield  his father is already taking measures to send to all the ports to stop him on his way till the trial is over  thus there will be no actual danger though it is a sore disappointment and these wicked attempts of charnock and barclay put us in bad odour so that it may be less easy to procure a pardon than it once would have been  so my dear child i do not think you need be in terror for his life even if you are obliged to speak out plainly  and then the good old man knelt with anne to pray for pardon direction and firmness and protection for charles  she made an entreaty after they rose that her uncle would take her awayher presence must be so painful to their kind hosts  he agreed with her and made the proposition but sir philip would not hear of it perhaps he was afraid of any change bringing suspicion of the facts and he might have his fears of anne being questioned into dangerous admissions besides which he hoped to keep his poor old wife in ignorance to the last  so anne was to remain at fareham and after that one days seclusion she gathered strength to be with the family as usual  poor old sir philip treated her with a studied but icy courtesy which cut her to the heart but lady archfields hopes of seeing her son were almost worse together with her regrets at her husbands dejection at the situation of his nephew and the family disgrace  as to little philip his curious inquiries about cousin sedley being in jail for murdering penny grim had to be summarily hushed by the assurance that such things were not to be spoken about  but why did nana cry when he talked of papas coming home  all the neighbourhood was invited to the funeral in havant churchyard the burialplace of the oakshotts  major oakshott himself wrote to dr woodford as having been one of the kindest friends of his poor son adding that he could not ask sir philip archfield although he knew him to be no partner in the guilt of his unhappy nephew who so fully exemplified that divine justice may be slow but is sure  dr woodford decided on accepting the invitation not only for peregrines sake but to see how the land lay  scarcely anything remarkable however occurred except that it was painful to perceive the lightness of the coffin  a funeral sermon was previously preached by a young nonconformist minister in his own chapel on the text whoso sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed and then the burial took place watched by a huge crowd of people  but just as the procession was starting from the chapel for the churchyard over the wall there came a strange peal of wild laughter  oh would not the unquiet spirit be at rest till it was avenged thought anne when she was told of it    chapter xxix the assize court   o terror what hath she perceived  o joy what doth she look on whom hath she perceived  wordsworth  time wore away and the lent assizes at winchester had come  sir philip had procured the best legal assistance for his nephew but in criminal cases though the prisoner was allowed the advice of counsel the onus of defence rested upon himself  to poor annes dismay a subpoena was sent to her as well as to her uncle to attend as a witness at the trial  sir philip was too anxious to endure to remain at a distance from winchester and they travelled in his coach sir edmund nutley escorting them on horseback while lucy was left with her mother both still in blissful ignorance they took rooms at the george inn  that night was a strange and grievous one to anne trying hard to sleep so as to be physically capable of composure and presence of mind yet continually wakened by ghastly dreams and then recollecting that the sense of something terrible was by no means all a dream  very white very silent but very composed she came to the sitting room and was constrained by her uncle and sir philip to eat much as it went against her  on this morning sir philip had dropped his sternness towards her and finding a moment when his soninlaw was absent he said child i know that this is wellnigh nay quite as hard for you as for me  i can only say let no earthly regards hold you back from whatever is your duty to god and man  speak the truth whatever betide and leave the rest to the god of truth  god bless you however it may be and he kissed her brow  the intelligence that the trial was coming on was brought by sedleys counsel mr simon harcourt  they set forth for the county hall up the sharplyrising street thronged with people who growled and murmured at the murderer savagely sir philip under the care of his soninlaw and anne with her uncle  mr harcourt was very hopeful he said the case for the prosecution had not a leg to stand on and that the prisoner himself was so intelligent and had so readily understood the line of defence to take that he ought to have been a lawyer  there would be no fear except that it might be made a party case and no stone was likely to be left unturned against a gentleman of good loyal family  moreover mr william cowper whom robert oakshott or rather his wife had engaged at great expense for the prosecution was one of the most rising of barristers noted for his persuasive eloquence and unfortunately mr harcourt had not the right of reply  the melancholy party were conducted into court sir philip and sir edmund to the seats disposed of by the sheriff beside the judge strangely enough only divided by him from major oakshott  the judge was mr baron hatsel a somewhat weaklooking man in spite of his red robes and flowing wig as he sat under his canopy beneath king arthurs round table  sedley perhaps a little thinner since his imprisonment but with the purple red on his face and his prominent eyes so hard and bold that it was galling to know that this was really the confidence of innocence  mr cowper was with great ability putting the case  here were two families in immediate neighbourhood divided from the first by political opinions of the strongest complexion and he put the oakshott views upon liberty civil and religious in the most popular light  the unfortunate deceased he described as having been a highly promising member of the suite of the distinguished envoy sir peregrine oakshott whose name he bore  on the death of the eldest brother he had been recalled and his accomplishments and foreign air had it appeared excited the spleen of the young gentlemen of the county belonging to the tory party then in the ascendant above all of the prisoner  there was then little or no etiquette as to irrelevant matter so that mr cowper could dwell at length on sedleys antecedents as abusing the bounty of his uncle a known bully expelled for misconduct from winchester college then acting as a suitable instrument in those violences in scotland which had driven the nation finally to extremity noted for his debaucheries when in garrison and finally broken for insubordination in ireland  after this unflattering portrait which sedleys looks certainly did not belie the counsel went back to 1688 proceeded to mention several disputes which had taken place when peregrine had met lieutenant archfield at portsmouth but he added with a smile that no dart of malice was ever thoroughly winged till cupid had added his feather and he went on to describe in strong colours the insult to a young gentlewoman and the interference of the other young man in her behalf so that swords were drawn before the appearance of the reverend gentleman her uncle  still he said there was further venom to be added to the bolt and he showed that the two had parted after the rejoicings on portsdown hill with a challenge all but uttered between them the whig upholding religious liberty the tory hotly defending such honour as the king possessed and both parting in anger  young mr oakshott was never again seen alive though his family long hoped against hope  there was no need to dwell on the strange appearances that had incited them to the search  certain it was that after seven years silence the grave had yielded up its secrets  then came the description of the discovery of the bones and of the garments and sword followed by the mention of the evidence as to the blood on the grass and the prisoner having been seen in the neighbourhood of the castle at that strange hour  he was observed to have an amount of money unusual with him soon after and what was still more suspicious after having gambled this away he had sold to a goldsmith at southampton a ruby ring which both mr and mrs oakshott could swear to have belonged to the deceased in fact when mr cowper marshalled the facts and even described the passionate encounter taking place hastily and without witnesses and the subsequent concealment of guilt in the vault the purse taken and whatever could again be identified hidden while providentially the blocking up of the vault preserved the evidence of the crime so long undetected and unavenged it was hardly possible to believe the prisoner innocent  when the examination of the witnesses began however sedley showed himself equal to his own defence  he made no sign when robert oakshott identified the clothes sword and other things and their condition was described but he demanded of him sharply how he knew the human remains to be those of his brother  of course they were said robert  were there any remains of clothes with them  no  can you swear to them  did you ever before see your brothers bones  at which and at the witnesss hesitating no but the court began to laugh  what was the height of the deceased  he reached about up to my ear said the witness with some hesitation  what was the length of the skeleton  quite small  it looked like a childs  my lord said sedley i have a witness here a surgeon whom i request may be called to certify the proportion of a skeleton to the size of a living man  though this was done the whole matter of size was so vague that there was nothing proved either as to the inches of peregrine or those of the skeleton but still sedley made his point that the identity of the body was unproved at least in some minds  still there remained the other articles about which there was no doubt  mr cowper proceeded with his examination as to the disputes at portsmouth but again the prisoner scored a point by proving that peregrine had staked the ring against him at a cockfight at southampton and had lost it  dr woodford was called and his evidence could not choose but to be most damaging as to the conflict on the road at portsmouth but as he had not seen the beginning mistress anne jacobina woodford was called for  there she stood tall and stately almost majestic in the stiffness of intense selfrestraint in her simple gray dress her black silk hood somewhat back her brown curls round her face a red spot in each cheek her earnest brown eyes fixed on the clerk as he gabbled out the words so awful to her the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth and her soul reechoed the words so help you god  mr cowper was courteous he was a gentleman and he saw she was no lightminded girl  he asked her the few questions needful as to the attack made on her and the defence but something moved him to go on and ask whether she had been on portsdown hill and to obtain from her the account of the high words between the young men  she answered each question in a clear low voice which still was audible to all  was it over or would sedley begin to torture her when so much was in his favour  no  mr cowperoh why would he was asking in an affirmative tone as if to clench the former evidence and did you ever see the deceased again  yes  the answer was at first almost choked then cleared into sharpness and every eye turned in surprise on the face that had become as white as her collar  indeed  and when  the next morning in a voice as if pronouncing her own doom and with hands clinging tight to the front of the witnessbox as though in anguish  where said the counsel like inexorable fate  i will save the gentlewoman from replying to that question sir and a gentleman with long brown hair in a rich white and gold uniform rose from among the spectators  perhaps i may be allowed to answer for her when i say that it was at portchester castle at five in the morning that she saw peregrine oakshott slain by my hand and thrown into the vault  there was a moment of breathless amazement in the court and the judge was the first to speak  very extraordinary sir  what is your name  charles archfield said the clear resolute voice  then came a general movement and sensation and anne still holding fast to the support saw the newcomer start forward with a cry my father and with two or three bounds reach the side of sir philip who had sunk back in his seat for a moment but recovered himself as he felt his sons arm round him  there was a general buzz and a cry of order and in the silence thus produced the judge addressed the witness  is what this gentleman says the truth  and on annes reply yes my lord spoken with the clear ring of anguish the judge added  was the prisoner present  no my lord he had nothing to do with it  then brother cowper do you wish to proceed with the case  mr cowper replied in the negative and the judge then made a brief summingup and the jury without retiring returned a verdict of not guilty  in the meantime anne had been led like one blinded from the witness box and almost dropped into her uncles arms  cheer up cheer up my child he said  you have done your part bravely and after so upright a confession no one can deal hardly with the young man  god will surely protect him  the acquittal had been followed by a few words from baron hatsel congratulating the late prisoner on his deliverance through this gentlemans generous confession  then there was a moments hesitation ended by the sheriff asking charles who stood up by his old father one arm supporting the trembling form and the other hand clasped in the two aged ones then sir do you surrender to take your trial  certainly sir said charles  i ought to have done so long ago but in the first shock  mr harcourt here cautioned him not to say anything that could be used against him adding in a low tone much to sir philips relief it may be brought in manslaughter sir  he should be committed another authority said  is there a hampshire magistrate here to sign a warrant  of these there were plenty and as the clerk asked for his description all eyes turned on the tall and robust form in the prime of manhood with the noble resolute expression on his fine features and steadfast eyes except when as he looked at his father they were full of infinite pity  the brown hair hung over the rich goldlaced white coat faced with black and with a broad goldcoloured sash fringed with black over his shoulder and there was a look of distinction about him that made his answer only natural  charles archfield of archfield house fareham lieutenantcolonel of his imperial majestys light dragoons knight of the holy roman empire  must i give up my sword like a prisoner of war he asked with a smile  sir philip rose to his feet with an earnest trembling entreaty that bail might be taken for him and many voices of gentlemen and men of substance made offers of it  there was a little consultation and it was ruled that bail might be accepted under the circumstances and charles bowed his thanks to the distant and gave his hand to the nearer while mr eyre of botley grange and mr brocas of roche court were accepted as sureties  the gentle old face of mr cromwell of hursley was raised to poor old sir philips with the words spoken with a remnant of the authority of the protector your son has spoken like a brave man sir god bless you and bring you well through it  charles was then asked whether he wished for time to collect witnesses  no my lord he said  i thank you heartily but i have no one to call and the sooner this is over the better for all  after a little consultation it was found that the grand jury had not been dismissed and could find a true bill against him and it was decided that the trial should take place after the rest of the criminal cases were disposed of  this settled the sorrowful party with the strangely welcomed son were free to return to their quarters at the george  mr cromwell pressed forward to beg that they would make use of his coach  it was a kind thought for sir philip hung feebly on his sons arm and to pass through the curious throng would have been distressing after helping him in charles turned and demanded  where is she the young gentlewoman miss woodford  she was just within her uncle waiting to take her out till the crowds attention should be called off  charles lifted her in and sir edmund and dr woodford followed him for there was plenty of room in the capacious vehicle  nobody spoke in the very short interval the four horses took in getting themselves out of the space in front of the county hall and down the hill to the george  only charles had leant forward taken annes hand drawn it to his lips and then kept fast hold of it  they were all in the room at the inn at last they hardly knew how indeed as charles was about to shut the door there was a smack on his back and there stood sedley holding out his hand  so charley old fellow you were the sad dog after all  you got me out of it and i owe you my thanks but you need not have put your neck into the noose  i should have come off with flying colours and made them all make fools of themselves if you had only waited  do you think i could sit still and see her put to the torture said charles  torture  you are thinking of your barbarous countries  no fear of the boot here nor even in scotland nowadays  thats all the torture you understand muttered sir edmund nutley  not but what i am much beholden to you all the same went on sedley  and look here sir turning to his uncle if you wish to get him let off cheap you had better send up another special retainer to harcourt without loss of time as he may be off  sir edmund nutley concurred in the advice and they hurried off together in search of the family attorney through whom the great man had to be approached  the four left together could breathe more freely  indeed dr woodford would have taken his niece away but that charles already had her in his arms in a most fervent embrace as he said my brave my true maid  she could not speak but she lifted up her eyes with infinite relief in all her sorrow as for a moment she rested against him but they had to move apart for a servant came up with some wine and charles putting her into a chair began to wait on her and on his father  i have not quite forgotten my manners he said lightly as if to relieve the tension of feeling though in germany the ladies serve the gentlemen  it was very hard not to burst into tears at these words but anne knew that would be the way to distress her companions and to have to leave the room and lose these precious moments  sir philip after swallowing the wine succeeded in saying have you been at home  charles explained that he had landed at gravesend and had ridden thence sleeping at basingstoke and taking the road through winchester in case his parents should be wintering there and on arriving a couple of hours previously and inquiring for them he had heard the tidings that sir philip archfield was indeed there for his nephew was being tried for his life for the wilful murder of major oakshotts son seven years ago  and you had none of my warnings  i wrote to all the ports said his father to warn you to wait till all this was over  no he had crossed from sluys and had met no letter  i suppose he said that i must not ride home tomorrow  it might make my sureties uneasy but i would fain see them all  it would kill your mother to be here said sir philip  she knows nothing of what anne told me on sedleys arrest  she is grown very feeble and he groaned  but we might send for your sister if she can leave her and the boy  i should like my boy to be fetched said charles  i should wish him to remember his fathernot as a felon convicted  then putting a knee to the ground before sir philip he said sir i ask your blessing and forgiveness  i never before thoroughly understood my errors towards you especially in hiding this miserable matter and leaving all this to come on you while my poor anne there was left to bear all the load  it was a cowardly and selfish act and i ask your pardon  the old man sobbed with his hand on his sons head  my dear boy my poor boy you were distraught  i was then  i did it as i thought for my poor alices sake at first and as it proved it was all in vain but at the years end when i was older it was folly and wrong  i ought to have laid all before you and allowed you to judge and i sincerely repent the not having so done  and anne my sweetest anne has borne the burthen all this time he added going back to her  let no one say a woman cannot keep secrets though i ought never to have laid this on her  ah it might have gone better for you then sighed sir philip no one would have visited a young lads mischance hardly on a loyal house in those days  what is to be done my son  that we will discuss when the lawyer fellow comes  is it old lee meantime let us enjoy our meeting  so that is lucys husband sober and staid eh  and my mother is feeble you say  has she been ill  charles was comporting himself with the cheerfulness that had become habitual to him as a soldier always in possible danger but it was very hard to the others to chime in with his tone and when a message was brought to ask whether his honour would be served in private the cheery greeting and shake of the hand broke down the composure of the old servant who brought it and he cried oh sir to see you thus and such a fine young gentleman  charles the only person who could speak gave the orders but they did not eat alone for sir edmund nutley and sedley arrived with the legal advisers and it was needful perhaps even better to have their company  the chief of the conversation was upon hungarian and transylvanian politics and the turkish war  mr harcourt seeming greatly to appreciate the information that colonel archfield was able to give him and the anecdotes of the war and descriptions of scenes therein actually brightened sir philip into interest and into forgetting for a moment his sons situation in pride in his conduct and at the distinction he had gained  we must save him said mr harcourt to sir edmund  he is far too fine a fellow to be lost for a youthful mischance  the meal was a short one and a consultation was to follow while sedley departed  anne was about to withdraw when mr lee the attorney said we shall need mistress woodfords evidence sir for the defence  i do not see what defence there can be returned charles  i can only plead guilty and throw myself on the kings mercy if he chooses to extend it to one of a tory family  not so fast sir said mr harcourt as far as i have gathered the facts there is every reason to hope you may obtain a verdict of manslaughter and a nominal penalty although that rests with the judge  on this the discussion began in earnest  charles who had never heard the circumstances which led to the trial was greatly astonished to hear what remains had been discovered  he said that he could only declare himself to have thrown in the body full dressed just as it was and how it could have been stripped and buried he could not imagine  what made folks think of looking into the vault he asked  it was mrs oakshott said lee the young mans wife she who was to have married the deceased  she took up some strange notion about stories of phantoms current among the vulgar and insisted on having the vault searched though it had been walled up for many years past  charles and anne looked at each other and the former said again  oh yes said anne indeed there have been enough to make me remember what you bade me do in case they recurred only it was impossible  phantoms said mr harcourt what does this mean  mere vulgar superstitions sir said the attorney  but very visible said charles i have seen one myself of which i am quite sure besides many that may be laid to the account of the fever of my wound  i must beg to hear said the barrister  do i understand that these were apparitions of the deceased  yes said charles  miss woodford saw the first i think  may i beg you to describe it said mr harcourt taking a fresh piece of paper to make notes on  anne narrated the two appearances in london and charles added the story of the figure seen in the street at douai seen by both together asking what more she knew of  once at night last summer at the very anniversary i saw his face in the trees in the garden said anne it was gone in a moment that has been all i have seen but little philip came to me full of stories of people having seen penny grim as he calls it and very strangely once it rose before him at the great pond and his fright saved him from sliding to the dangerous part  what led mrs oakshott to the examination was that it was seen once on the beach once by the sentry at the vault itself once by the sexton at havant churchyard and once by my mothers grave  seven said the counsel reviewing the notes he jotted down colonel archfield i should recommend you pleading not guilty and basing your defence like your cousin on the strong probability that this same youth is a living man  indeed said charles starting i could have hoped it from these recent apparitions but what i myself saw forbids the idea  if any sight were ever that of a spirit it was what we saw at douai besides how should he come thither a born and bred whig and puritan  there is no need to mention that you can call witnesses to his having been seen within these few months  it would rest with the prosecution to disprove his existence in the body especially as the bones in the vault cannot be identified  sir said charles the defence that would have served my innocent cousin cannot serve me who know what i did to oakshott  i am now aware that it is quite possible that the sword might not have killed him but when i threw him into that vault i sealed his fate  how deep is the vault  mr lee and dr woodford both averred that it was not above twenty or twentyfour feet deep greatly to charless surprise for as a lad he had thought it almost unfathomable but then he owned his ideas of winchester high street had been likewise far more magnificent than he found it  the fall need not necessarily have been fatal especially to one insensible and opposing no resistance but even supposing that death had not resulted in those draconian days the intent to murder was equally subject with its full accomplishment to capital punishment  still as colonel archfield could plead with all his heart that he had left home with no evil intentions towards young oakshott the lawyers agreed that to prove that the death of the victim was uncertain would reduce the matter to a mere youthful brawl which could not be heavily visited  mr harcourt further asked whether it were possible to prove that the prisoner had been otherwise employed than in meddling with the body but unfortunately it had been six hours before he came home  i was distracted said charles i rode i knew not whither till i came to my senses on finding that my horse was ready to drop when i led him into a shed at a wayside publichouse bade them feed him took a drink then i wandered out into the copse near and lay on the ground there till i thought him rested for how long i know not i think it must have been near bishops waltham but i cannot recollect  mr lee decided on setting forth at peep of dawn the next morning to endeavour to collect witnesses of peregrines appearances  sir edmund nutley intended to accompany him as far as fareham to fetch little philip and lady nutley if the latter could leave her mother after the tidings had been broken to them and also to try to trace whether charless arrival at any publichouse were remembered  to her dismay anne received another summons from the other party to act as witness  i hoped to have spared you this my sweet said charles but never mind you cannot say anything worse of me than i shall own of myself  the two were left to each other for a little while in the bay window  oh sir can you endure me thus after all murmured anne as she felt his arm round her  can you endure me after all i left you to bear he returned  it was not like what i brought on you she said  but they could not talk much of the future and charles told how he had rested through all his campaigns in the knowledge that his anne was watching and praying for him and how his long illness had brought before him deeper thoughts than he had ever had before and made him especially dwell on the wrong done to his parents by his long absence and the lightness with which he had treated home duties and responsibilities till he had resolved that if his life were then spared he would neglect them no longer  and now he said and paused all i shall have done is to break their hearts  what is that saying be sure your sin will find you out  oh sir they are sure not to deal hardly with you  perhaps the emperors ambassador may claim me  if so would you go into banishment with the felon anne love  it would not be quite so mad as when i asked you before  i would go to the ends of the world with you and we would take little phil  do you know he is growing a salad and learning latin all for papa  and so she told him of little phil till his father was seen looking wistfully at him  with sir philip charles was all cheerfulness and hope taking such interest in all there was to hear about the family estate and neighbourhood that the old gentleman was beguiled into feeling as if there were only a short ceremony to be gone through before he had his son at home saving him ease and trouble  but after sir philip had been persuaded to retire worn out with the days agitations and anne likewise had gone to her chamber to weep and pray charles made his arrangements with mr lee for the future for all connected with him in case of the worst and after the lawyers departure poured out his heart to dr woodford in deep contrition as he said he had longed to do when lying in expectation of death at the iron gates  however it may end he said and i expect as i deserve the utmost i am thankful for this opportunity though unhappily it gives more pain to those about me than if i had died out there  tell them when they need comfort how much better it is for me  my dear boy i cannot believe you will have to suffer  there is much against me sir  my foolish flight the state of parties and the recent conspiracy which has made loyal families suspected and odious  i saw something of that as i came down  the crowd fancied my uniform french and hooted and hissed me unluckily i have no other clothes to wear  nor can i from my heart utterly disclaim all malice or ill will when i remember the thrill of pleasure in driving my sword home  i have had to put an end to a janissary or two more than once in the way of duty but their black eyes never haunted me like those particoloured ones  still i trust as you tell me i may that god forgives me for our blessed lords sake but i should like if i could to take the holy sacrament with my love while i am still thus far a free man  i have not done so since the easter before these troubles  you shall my dear boy you shall  there were churches at which the custom freshly begun at the restoration was not dropped  the next was st matthiass day and anne and her uncle had already purposed to go to the quiet little church of st lawrence at no great distance in the very early morning  they were joined on their way down the stair into the courtyard of the inn by a gentleman in a slouched hat and large dark cloak who drew annes arm within his own  truly there was peace on that morning and strength to the brave man beyond the physical courage that had often before made him bright in the face of danger and anne though weeping had a sense of respite and repose if not of hope  late in the afternoon little philip was lifted down from riding before old ralph into the arms of the splendid officer whose appearance transcended all his visions  he fumbled in his small pocket and held out a handful of something green and limp  heres my salad papa  i brought it all the way for you to eat  and colonel archfield ate every scrap of it for supper though it was much fitter for a rabbit and all the evening he held on his knee the tired child and responded to his prattle about nana and dogs and rabbits nay ministered to his delight and admiration of the sheriffs coach javelin men and even the judge with a strange mixture of wonder delight and with melancholy only in eyes and undertones    chapter xxx sentence   i have hope to live and am prepared to die  measure for measure  ralph was bidden to be ready to take his young master home early the next morning  at eight oclock the boy who had slept with his father came down the stair clinging to his fathers hand and miss woodford coming closely with him  yes said charles as he held the little fair fellow in his arms ere seating him on the horse he knows all ralph  he knows that his father did an evil thing and that what we do in our youth finds us out later and must be paid for  he has promised me to be a comfort to the old people and to look on this lady as a mother nay no more ralph tis not goodbye to any of you yet  there phil dont lug my head off nor catch my hair in your buttons give my dutiful love to your grandmamma and to aunt nutley and be a good boy to them  and when i come to see you again ill bring another salad quoth philip as he rode out of the court and his father by way of excusing a contortion of features smoothed the entangled lock of hair and muttered something about this comes of not wearing a periwig  then he said  and to think that i have wasted the company of such a boy as that all his life except for this mere glimpse  oh you will come back to him was all that could be said  for it was time for charles archfield to surrender himself to take his trial  he had been instructed over and over again as to the line of his defence and cautioned against candour for himself and delicacy towards others till he had more than once to declare that he had no intention of throwing his life away but the lawyers agreed in heartily deploring the rules that thus deprived the accused of the assistance of an advocate in examining witnesses and defending himself  all depended as they knew and told sir edmund nutley on the judge and jury  now mr baron hatsel had shown himself a well meaning but weak and vacillating judge whose summing up was apt rather to confuse than to elucidate the evidence and as to the jury mr lee scanned their stolid countenances somewhat ruefully when they were marshalled before the prisoner to be challenged if desirable  a few words passed into which the judge inquired  i am reminded my lord said colonel archfield bowing that i once incurred mr holts displeasure as a mischievous boy by throwing a stone which injured one of his poultry but i cannot believe such a trifle would bias an honest man in a question of life and death  nevertheless the judge put aside mr holt  i like his spirit whispered mr harcourt  but returned lee i doubt if he has done himself any good with those fellows by calling it a trifle to kill an old hen  i should like him to have challenged two or three more moody old whiggish rascals but he has been too long away from home to know how the land lies  too generous and highspirited for this work sighed sir edmund who sat with them  the indictment was read the first count being that of malice aforethought by the temptation of the devil charles archfield did wilfully kill and slay peregrine oakshott etc  the second indictment was that by misadventure he had killed and slain the said peregrine oakshott  to the first he pleaded not guilty to the second guilty  tall wellmade manly and soldierly he stood with a quiet set face while mr cowper proceeded to open the prosecution with a certain compliment to the prisoner and regret at having to push the case against one who had so generously come forward on behalf of a kinsman but he must unwillingly state the circumstances that made it doubtful nay more than doubtful whether the prisoners plea of mere misadventure could stand  the dislike to the unfortunate deceased existing among the young tory country gentlemen of the county was he should prove intensified in the prisoner on account of not inexcusable jealousies as well as of the youthful squabbles which sometimes lead to fatal results  on the evening of the 30th of june 1688 there had been angry words between the prisoner and the deceased on portsdown hill respecting the prisoners late lady  at four or five oclock on the ensuing morning the 1st of july the one fell by the sword of the other in the then unfrequented court of portchester castle  it was alleged that the stroke was fatal only through the violence of youthful impetuosity but was it consistent with that supposition that the young gentlemans time was unaccounted for afterwards and that the body should have been disposed of in a manner that clearly proved the assistance of an accomplice and with so much skill that no suspicion had arisen for seven years and a half whilst the actual slayer was serving not his own country but a foreign prince and had only returned at a most suspicious crisis  the counsel then proceeded to construct a plausible theory  he reminded the jury that at that very time the summer of 1688 messages and invitations were being despatched to his present gracious majesty to redress the wrongs of the protestant church and protect the liberties of the english people  the father of the deceased was a member of a family of the country party his uncle a distinguished diplomatist to whose suite he had belonged  what was more obvious than that he should be employed in the correspondence and that his movements should be dogged by parties connected with the stewart family  already there was too much experience of how far even the most estimable and conscientious might be blinded by the sentiment that they dignified by the title of loyalty  the deceased had already been engaged in a struggle with one of the archfield family who had been acquitted of his actual slaughter but considering the strangeness of the hour at which the two cousins were avowedly at or near portchester the condition of the clothes stripped of papers but not of valuables and the connection of the principal witness with the pretended prince of wales he could not help thinking that though personal animosity might have added an edge to the weapon yet that there were deeper reasons to prompt the assault and the concealment than had yet been brought to light  he will make nothing of that whispered mr lee  poor master peregrine was no more a whig than old sir philip there  twill prejudice the jury whispered back mr harcourt and discredit the ladys testimony  mr cowper concluded by observing that half truths had come to light in the former trial but whole truths would give a different aspect to the affair and show the unfortunate deceased to have given offence not only as a man of gallantry but as a patriot and to have fallen a victim to the younger bravoes of the socalled tory party  to his the counsels mind it was plain that the prisoner who had hoped that his crime was undiscovered and forgotten had returned to take his share in the rising against government so happily frustrated  he was certain that the traitor charnock had been received at his fathers house and that mr sedley archfield had used seditious language on several occasions so that the cause of the prisoners return at this juncture was manifest and only to the working of providence could it be ascribed that the evidence of the aggravated murder should have at that very period been brought to light  there was an evident sensation and glances were cast at the upright military figure standing like a sentinel as if the audience expected him to murder them all  as before the examination began with robert oakshotts identification of the clothes and sword but mr cowper avoided the subject of the skeleton and went on to inquire about the terms on which the two young men had lived  well said robert they quarrelled but in a neighbourly sort of way  what do you call a neighbourly way  my poor brother used to be baited for being so queer  but then we were as bad to him as the rest said robert candidly  that is when you were boys  yes  and after his return from his travels  it was the same then  he was too fine a gentleman for any ones taste  you speak generally  was there any especial animosity  my brother bought a horse that archfield was after  was there any dispute over it  not that i know of  can you give an instance of displeasure manifested by the prisoner at the deceased  i have seen him look black when my brother held a gate open for his wife  then there were gallant attentions towards mrs archfield  charless face flushed and he made a step forward but robert gruffly answered  no more than civility but he had got frenchified manners and liked to tease archfield  did they ever come to high words before you  no  they knew better  thank you mr oakshott said the prisoner as it was intimated that mr cowper had finished  you bear witness that only the most innocent civility ever passed between your brother and my poor young wife  certainly responded robert  nothing that could cause serious resentment if it excited passing annoyance  nothing  what were your brothers political opinions  wellwith some slow considerationhe admired the queen as was and could not abide the prince of orange  my father was always at him for it  would you think him likely to be an emissary to holland  no one less likely  but mr cowper started up  sir i believe you are the younger brother  yes  how old were you at the time  nigh upon nineteen  oh as if that accounted for his ignorance  the prisoner continued and asked whether search was made when the deceased was missed  hardly any  why not  he was never content at home and we believed he had gone to my uncle in muscovy  what led you to examine the vault  my wife was disquieted by stories of my brothers ghost being seen  did you ever see this ghost  no never  that was all that was made of robert oakshott and then again came anne woodfords turn and mr cowper was more satirical and less considerate than the day before  still it was a less dreadful ordeal than previously though she had to tell the worst for she knew her ground better and then there was throughout wonderful support in charless eyes which told her whenever she glanced towards him that she was doing right and as he wished  as she had not heard the speech for the prosecution it was a shock after identifying herself a niece to a nonswearing clergyman to be asked about the night of the bonfire and to be forced to tell that mrs archfield had insisted on getting out of the carriage and walking about with mr oakshott  was the prisoner present  he came up after a time  did he show any displeasure  he thought it bad for her health  did any words pass between him and the deceased  not that i remember  and now madam will you be good enough to recur to the following morning and continue the testimony in which you were interrupted the day before yesterday  what was the hour  the church clock struck five just after  may i ask what took a young gentlewoman out at such an untimely hour  did you expect to meet any one  no indeed sir said anne hotly  i had been asked to gather some herbs to carry to a friend  ah  and why at that time in the morning  because i was to leave home at seven when the tide served  where were you going  to london sir  and for what reason  i had been appointed to be a rocker in the royal nursery  i see  and your impending departure may explain certain strange coincidences  may i ask what was this same herb in a mocking tone  mouseear sir said anne who would fain have called it by some less absurd title but knew no other  a specific for the whooping cough  oh  not love in a mist  are your sure  my lord here simon harcourt ventured may i ask is this regular  the judge intimated that his learned brother had better keep to the point and mr cowper thus called to order desired the witness to continue and demanded whether she was interrupted in her quest  i saw mr peregrine oakshott enter the castle court and i hurried into the tower hoping he had not seen me  you said before he had protected you  why did you run from him  she had foreseen this and quietly answered he had made me an offer of marriage which i had refused and i did not wish to meet him  did you see any one else  not till i had reached the door opening on the battlements  then i heard a clash and saw mr archfield and mr oakshott fighting  mr archfield  the prisoner  did he come to gather mouseear too  no  his wife had sent him over with a pattern of sarcenet for me to match in london  early rising and prompt obedience  and there ensued the inquiries that brought out the history of what she had seen of the encounter of the throwing the body into the vault full dressed and of her promise of silence and its reason  mr cowper did not molest her further except to make her say that she had been five months at the court and had accompanied the late queen to france  then came the power of crossexamination on the part of the prisoner  he made no attempt to modify what had been said before but asked in a gentle apologetic voice  was that the last time you ever saw or thought you saw peregrine oakshott  no  and here every one in court started and looked curious  when  the 31st of october 1688 in the evening  where  looking from the window in the palace at whitehall i saw him or his likeness walking along in the light of the lantern over the great door  the appearance at lambeth was then described and that in the garden at archfield house  this strange crossexamination was soon over for charles could not endure to subject her to the ordeal while she equally longed to be able to say something that might not damage him and dreaded every word she spoke  moreover mr cowper looked exceedingly contemptuous and made the mention of whitehall and lambeth a handle for impressing on the jury that the witness had been deep in the counsels of the late royal family and that she was escorted from st germain by the prisoner just before he entered on foreign service  one of the servants at fareham was called upon to testify to the hour of his young masters return on the fatal day  it was long past dinnertime he said  it must have been about three oclock  charles put in an inquiry as to the condition of his horse  hard ridden sir as i never knew your honour bring home black bess in such a pickle before  after a couple of young men had been called who could speak to some outbreaks of dislike to poor peregrine in which all had shared the case for the prosecution was completed  cowper in a speech that would be irregular now but was permissible then pointed out that the jealousy dislike and jacobite proclivities of the archfield family had been fully made out that the coincidence of visits to the castle at that untimely hour had been insufficiently explained that the condition of the remains in the vault was quite inconsistent with the evidence of the witness mistress woodford unless there were persons waiting below unknown to her and that the prisoner had been absent from fareham from four or five oclock in the morning till nearly three in the afternoon  as to the strange story she had further told he mr cowper was neither superstitious nor philosophic but the jury would decide whether conscience and the sense of an awful secret were not sufficient to conjure up such phantoms if they were not indeed spiritual occurring as they did in the very places and at the very times when the spirit of the unhappy young man thus summarily dismissed from the world his corpse left in an unblessed den would be most likely to reappear haunting those who felt themselves to be most accountable for his lamentable and untimely end  the words evidently told and it was at a disadvantage that the prisoner rose to speak in his own defence and to call his witnesses  my lord he said and gentlemen of the jury let me first say that i am deeply grieved and hurt that the name of my poor young wife has been brought into this matter  in justice to her who is gone i must begin by saying that though she was flattered and gratified by the polite manners that i was too clownish and awkward to emulate and though i may have sometimes manifested illhumour yet i never for a moment took serious offence nor felt bound to defend her honour or my own  if i showed displeasure it was because she was fatiguing herself against warning  i can say with perfect truth that when i left home on that unhappy morning i bore no serious illwill to any living creature  i had no political purpose and never dreamt of taking the life of any one  i was a heedless youth of nineteen  i shall be able to prove the commission of my wifes on which this learned gentleman has thought fit to cast a doubt  for the rest mistress anne woodford was my sisters friend and playfellow from early childhood  when i entered the castle court i saw her hurrying into the keep pursued by oakshott whom i knew her to dread and dislike  i naturally stepped between angry words passed  he challenged my right to interfere and in a passion drew upon me  though i was the taller and stronger i knew him to be proud of his skill in fencing and perhaps i may therefore have pressed him the harder and the dislike i acknowledge made me drive home my sword  but i was free from all murderous intention up to that moment  in my inexperience i had no doubt but that he was dead and in a terror and confusion which i regret heartily i threw him into the vault and for the sake of my wife and mother bound miss woodford to secrecy  i mounted my horse and scarcely knowing what i did rode till i found it ready to drop  i asked for rest for it in the first wayside publichouse i came to  i lay down meanwhile among some bushes adjoining and there waited till my horse could take me home again  i believe it was at the white horse near bishops waltham but the place has changed hands since that time so that i can only prove my words as you have heard by the state of my horse when i came home  for the condition of the remains in the vault i cannot account i never touched the poor fellow after throwing him there  my wife died a few hours after my return home where i remained for a week nor did i suggest flight though i gladly availed myself of my fathers suggestion of sending me abroad with a tutor  let me add to remove misconception that i visited paris because my tutor the reverend george fellowes one of the fellows of magdalen college expelled by the late king and now rector of portchester had been asked to provide for miss woodfords return to her home and he is here to testify that i never had any concern with politics  i did indeed accompany him to st germain but merely to find the young gentlewoman and in the absence of the late king and queen nor did i hold intercourse with any other person connected with their court  after escorting her to ostend i went to hungary to serve in the army of our ally the emperor against the turks the enemies of all christians  after a severe wound i have come home knowing nothing of conspiracies and i was taken by surprise on arriving here at winchester at finding that my cousin was on his trial for the unfortunate deed into which i was betrayed by haste and passion but entirely without premeditation or intent to do more than to defend the young lady  so that i plead that my crime does not amount to murder from malicious intent and likewise that those who charge me with the actual death of peregrine oakshott should prove him to be dead  charless first witness was mrs lang his late wifes own woman who spared him many questions by garrulously declaring what a work poor little madam had made about the rosecoloured sarcenet causing the pattern to be searched out as soon as she came home from the bonfire and how she had gone on at her husband till he promised to give it to mistress anne and how he had been astir at four oclock in the morning and had called to her mrs lang to look to her mistress who might perhaps get some sleep now that she had her will and hounded him out to go over to portchester about that silk  nothing was asked of this witness by the prosecution except the time of mr archfields return  the question of jealousy was passed over  of the pond apparition nothing was said  anne had told charles of it but no one could have proved its identity but sedley and his share in it was too painful to be brought forward  three other ghost seers were brought forward  mrs fellowess maid the sentry and the sexton but only the sexton had ever seen master perry alive and he would not swear to more than that it was something in his likeness the sentry was already bound to declare it something unsubstantial and the maid was easily persuaded into declaring that she did not know what she had seen or whether she had seen anything  there only remained mr fellowes to bear witness of his pupils entire innocence of political intrigues together with a voluntary testimony addressed to the court that the youth had always appeared to him a welldisposed but hitherto boyish lad suddenly sobered and rendered thoughtful by a shock that had changed the tenor of his mind  mr baron hatsel summed up in his dreary vacillating way  he told the gentlemen of the jury that young men would be young men especially where pretty wenches were concerned and that all knew that there was bitterness where whig and tory were living nigh together  then he went over the evidence at first in a tone favourable to the encounter having been almost accidental and the stroke an act of passion  but he then added it was strange and he did not know what to think of these young sparks and the young gentlewoman all meeting in a lonely place when honest folks were abed and the hiding in the vault and the state of the clothes were strange matters scarce agreeing with what either prisoner or witness said  it looked only too like part of a plot of which some one should make a clean breast  on the other hand the prisoner was a fine young gentleman an only son and had been fighting the turks though it would have been better to have fought the french among his own countrymen  he had come ingenuously forward to deliver his cousin and a deliberate murderer was not wont to be so generous though may be he expected to get off easily on this same plea of misadventure  if it was misadventure why did he not try to do something for the deceased or wait to see whether he breathed before throwing him into this same pit though to be sure a lad might be inexperienced  for the rest as to these same sights of the deceased or his likeness he the judge was no believer in ghosts though he would not say there were no such things and the gentlemen of the jury must decide whether it was more likely the poor youth was playing pranks in the body or whether he were haunting in the spirit those who had most to do with his untimely end  this was the purport or rather the nopurport of the charge  the jury were absent for a very short time and as it leaked out afterwards their intelligence did not rise above the idea that the young gentleman was thick with they frenchies who wanted to bring in murder and popery warmingpans and wooden shoes  he called stoning poultry a trifle so of what was he not capable  of course he spited the poor young chap and how could the fact be denied when the poor ghost had come back to ask for his blood  so the awful suspense ended with guilty my lord  of murder or manslaughter  of murder  the prisoner stood as no doubt he had faced turkish batteries  the judge asked the customary question whether he had any reason to plead why he should not be condemned to death  no my lord  i am guilty of shedding peregrine oakshotts blood and though i declare before god and man that i had no such purpose and it was done in the heat of an undesigned struggle i hated him enough to render the sentence no unjust one  i trust that god will pardon me if man does not  the gentlemen around drew the poor old father out of the court so as not to hear the final sentence and anne half stunned was taken away by her uncle and put into the same carriage with him  the old man held her hands closely and could not speak but she found voice sir sir do not give up hope  god will save him  i know what i can do  i will go to princess anne  she is friendly with the king now  she will bring me to tell him all  hurriedly she spoke her object as it seemed to be that of every one to keep up such hope and encouragement as to drown the terrible sense of the actual upshot of the trial  the room at the george was full in a moment of friends declaring that all would go well in the end and consulting what to do  neither sir philip nor dr woodford could be available as their refusal to take the oaths to king william made them marked men  the former could only write to the imperial ambassador beseeching him to claim the prisoner as an officer of the empire though it was doubtful whether this would be allowed in the case of an englishman born  mr fellowes undertook to be the bearer of the letter and to do his best through archbishop tenison to let the king know the true bearings of the case  almost in pity to spare anne the misery of helpless waiting dr woodford consented to let her go under his escort starting very early the next morning since the king might immediately set off for the army in holland and the space was brief between condemnation and execution  sir edmund proposed to hurry to carisbrooke castle being happily on good terms with that fiery personage lord cutts the governor of the isle of wight as well as a favoured general of the king whose intercession might do more than princess annes  moreover a message came from old mr cromwell begging to see sir edmund  it was on behalf of major oakshott who entreated that sir philip might be assured of his own great regret at the prosecution and the result and his entire belief that the provocation came from his unhappy son  both he and richard cromwell were having a petition for pardon drawn up which sir henry mildmay and almost all the leading gentlemen of hampshire of both parties were sure to sign while the sheriff would defer the execution as long as possible pardons especially in cases of duelling had been marketable articles in the last reigns and there could not but be a sigh for such conveniences  sir philip wanted to go at once to the jail which was very near the inn but consented on strong persuasion to let his soninlaw precede him  anne longed for a few moments to herself but durst not leave the poor old man who sat holding her hand and at each interval of silence saying how this would kill the boys mother or something equally desponding so that she had to talk almost at random of the various gleams of hope and even to describe how the little duke of gloucester might be told of philip and sent to the king who was known to be very fond of him  it was a great comfort when dr woodford came and offered to pray with them  by and by sir edmund returned having been making arrangements for charless comfort  ordinary prisoners were heaped together and miserably treated but money could do something and by application to the high sheriff permission had been secured for charles to occupy a private room on a heavy fee to the jailor and for his friends to have access to him besides other necessaries purchased at more than their weight in gold  sir edmund brought word that charles was in good heart sent love and duty to his father whom he would welcome with all his soul but that as miss woodford wasin her love and braverygoing so soon to london he prayed that she might be his first visitor that evening  there was little more to do than to cross the street and sir edmund hurried her through the flagged and dirty yard and the dim foul hall filled with fumes of smoke and beer where melancholy debtors held out their hands idle scapegraces laughed heavy degraded faces scowled and evil sounds were heard up the stairs to a nailstudded door where anne shuddered to hear the heavy key turned by the coarse rudelooking warder only withheld from insolence by the presence of a magistrate  her escort tarried outside and she saw charles his rushlight candle gleaming on his gold lace as he wrote a letter to the ambassador to be forwarded by his father  he sprang up with outstretched arms and an eager smile  my brave sweetheart how nobly you have done  truth and trust  it did my heart good to hear you  her head was on his shoulder  she wanted to speak but could not without loosing the flood of tears  faith entire he went on and you are still striving for me  princess anne is she began then the choking came  true he said  come do not expect the worst  i have not made up my mind to that  if the ambassador will stir the king will not be disobliging though it will probably not be a free pardon but hungary for some years to comeand you are coming with me  if you will have one who might bemay have beenyour death  oh every word i said seemed to me stabbing you and the tears would come now  no such thing  they only showed how true my love is to god and me and made my heart swell with pride to hear her so cheering me through all  his strength seemed to allow her to break down  she had all along had to bear up the spirits of sir philip and lady archfield and though she had struggled for composure the finding that she had in him a comforter and support set the pentup tears flowing fast as he held her close  oh i did not mean to vex you thus she said  vex no indeed  tis something to be wept for  but cheer up anne mine  i have often been in far worse plights than this when i have ridden up in the face of eight big turkish guns  the balls went over my head then by gods good mercy  why not the same now  ay and i was ready to give all i had to any one who would have put a pistol to my head and got me out of my misery jolting along on the way to the iron gates  yet here i am  maybe the almighty brought me back to save poor sedley and clear my own conscience knowing well that though it does not look so it is better for me to die thus than the other way  no no tis ten to one that you and the rest of you will get me off  i only meant to show you that supposing it fails i shall only feel it my due and much better for me than if i had died out there with it unconfessed  i shall try to get them all to feel it so and after all now the whole is out my heart feels lighter than it has done these seven years  and if i could only believe that poor fellow alive i could almost die content though that sounds strange  it will quiet his poor restless spirit any way  you are too brave  oh  i hoped to come here to comfort you and i have only made you comfort me  the best way sweetest  now i will seal and address this letter and you shall take it to mr fellowes to carry to the ambassador  this gave anne a little time to compose herself and when he had finished he took the candle and saying look here he held it to the wall and they read scratched on the rough bricks alice lisle 1685  this is thankworthy  lady lisles cell  oh this is no good omen  i call it a goodly legacy even to one who cannot claim to suffer wrongfully said charles  there they knockone kiss morewe shall meet again soon  dont linger in town but give me all the days you can  yes take her back sir edmund for she must rest before her journey  cheer up love and do not lie weeping all night but believe that your prayers to god and man must prevail one way or another    chapter xxxi elfland   three ruffians seized me yestermorn    alas a maiden most forlorn they choked my cries with wicked might    and bound me on a palfrey white  s t coleridge  yet after the night it was with more hope than despondency anne in the february morning mounted en croupe behind mr fellowess servant that being decided on as the quickest mode of travelling she saw the sunrise behind st catherines hill and the gray mists filling the valley of the itchen and the towers of the cathedral and college barely peeping beyond them  would her life rise out of the mist  through hoarfrosted hedges deeply crested with white they rode emerging by and by on downs becoming dully green above as the sun touched them but white below  suddenly in passing a hollow overhung by two or three yewtrees they found themselves surrounded by masked horsemen  the servant on her horse was felled she herself snatched off and a kerchief covered her face while she was crying oh sir let me go  i am on business of life and death  the covering was stuffed into her mouth and she was borne along some little way then there was a pause and she freed herself enough to say you shall have everything only let me go and she felt for the money with which sir philip had supplied her and for the watch given her by king james  we want you nothing of yours said a voice  dont be afraid no one will hurt you but we must have you along with us  therewith she was pinioned by two large hands and a bandage was made fast over her eyes and when she shrieked out mr fellowes oh where are you she was answered  no harm has been done to the parson  he will be free as soon as any one comes by  tis you we want  now i give you fair notice for we dont want to choke you theres no one to hear a squall  if there were we should gag you so you had best be quiet and you shall suffer no hurt  now then by your leave madam  she was lifted on horseback again and a belt passed round her and the rider in front of her  again she strove in her natural voice to plead that to stop her would imperil a mans life and to implore for release  we know all that she was told  it was not rudely said  the voice was not that of a clown it was a gentlemans pronunciation and this was in some ways more inexplicable and alarming  the horses were put in rapid motion she heard the trampling of many hoofs and felt that they were on soft turf and she knew that for many miles round winchester it was possible to keep on the downs so as to avoid any inhabited place  she tried to guess from the sense of sunshine that came through her bandage in what direction she was being carried and fancied it must be southerly  onononstill the turf  it seemed absolutely endless  time was not measurable under such circumstances but she fancied noon must have more than passed when the voice that had before spoken said we halt in a moment and shift you to another horse madam but again i forewarn you that our comrades here have no ears for you and that cries and struggles will only make it the worse for you  then came the sound as of harder ground and a stop undertones gruff and manly could be heard the peculiar noise of horses drinking and her captor came up this time on foot saying plaguy little to be had in this accursed hole tis but the choice between stale beer and milk  which will you prefer  she could not help accepting the milk and she was taken down to drink it and a hunch of coarse barley bread was given to her with it the words i would offer you bacon but it tastes as if old nick had smoked it in his private furnace  such expressions were no proof that gentle blood was lacking but whose object could her abduction beher a penniless dependent could she have been seized by mistake for some heiress  in that moments hope she asked sir do you know who i amanne woodford a poor portionless maid not  i know perfectly well madam was the reply  may i trouble you to permit me to mount you again  she was again placed behind one of the riders and again fastened to him and off they went on a rougher horse on harder ground and as she thought occasionally through brushwood  again a space to her illimitable went by and then came turf once more and by and by what seemed to her the sound of the sea  another halt another lifting down but at once to be gathered up again and then a splashing through water  be careful said the voice  a hand a gentlemans hand took hers her feet were on boardson a boat she was drawn down to sit on a low thwart putting her hand over she felt the lapping of the water and tasted that it was salt  oh sir where are you taking me she asked as the boat was pushed off  that you will know in due time he answered  some more refreshment was offered her in a decided but not discourteous manner and she partook of it remembering that exhaustion might add to her perils  she perceived that after pushing off from shore sounds of eating and low gruff voices mingled with the plash of oars  commands seemed to be given in french and there were mutterings of some strange language  darkness was coming on  what were they doing with her  and did charless fate hang upon hers  yet in spite of terrors and anxieties she was so much worn out as to doze long enough to lose count of time till she was awakened by the rocking and tossing of the boat and loud peremptory commands she became for the first time in her life miserable with sea sickness for how long it was impossible to tell and the pitching of the boat became so violent that when she found herself bound to one of the seats she was conscious of little but a longing to be allowed to go to the bottom in peace except that some great cause she could hardly in her bewildered wretchedness recollect what forbade her to die till her mission was over  there were loud peremptory orders oaths sea phrases in french and english sometimes in that unknown tongue  something expressed that a light was directing to a landingplace but reaching it was doubtful  unbind her eyes said a voice let her shift for herself  better not  there followed a fresh upheaval as if the boat were perpendicular a sudden sinking some one fell over and bruised her another frightful rising and falling then smoothness the rope that held her fast undone the keel grating hands apparently dragging up the boat  she was lifted out like a doll carried apparently through water over shingle  light again made itself visible she was in a house set down on a chair in the warmth of fire amid a buzz of voices which lulled as the bandage was untied and removed  her eyes were so dazzled her head so giddy her senses so faint that everything swam round her and there that strange vision recurred peregrine oakshott was before her  she closed her eyes again as she lay back in the chair  take this you will be better  a glass was at her lips and she swallowed some hot drink which revived her so that she opened her eyes again and by the lights in an apparently richly curtained room she again beheld that figure standing by her the glass in his hand  oh she gasped  are you alive  the answer was to raise her still gloved hand with substantial fingers to a pair of lips  thenthenhe is safe  thank god she murmured and shut her eyes again dizzy and overcome unable even to analyse her conviction that all would be well and that in some manner he had come to her rescue  where am i she murmured dreamily  in elfland  yes come to be queen of it  the words blended with her confused fancies  indeed she was hardly fully conscious of anything except that a womans hands were about her and that she was taken into another room where her drenched clothes were removed and she was placed in a warm narrow bed where some more warm nourishment was put into her mouth with a spoon after which she sank into a sleep of utter exhaustion  that sleep lasted long  there was a sensation of the rocking of the boat and of aching limbs through great part of the time also there seemed to be a continual roaring and thundering around her and such strange misty visions that when she finally awoke after a long interval of deeper and sounder slumber she was incapable of separating the fact from the dream more especially as head and limbs were still heavy weary and battered  the strange roaring still sounded and sometimes seemed to shake the bed  twilight was coming in at a curtained window and showed a tiny chamber with rafters overhead and thatch a chest a chair and table  there was a pallet on the floor and anne suspected that she had been wakened by the rising of its occupant  her watch was on the chair by her side but it had not been wound and the dim light did not increase so that there was no guessing the time and as the remembrance of her dreadful adventures made themselves clear she realised with exceeding terror that she must be a prisoner while the evenings apparition relegated itself to the world of dreams  being kidnapped to be sent to the plantations was the dread of those days  but if such were the case what would become of charles  in the alarm of that thought she sat up in bed and prepared to rise but could nowhere see her clothes only the little cloth bag of toilet necessaries that she had taken with her  at that moment however the woman came in with a steaming cup of chocolate in her hand and some of the garments over her arm  she was a stout weatherbeaten kindlylooking woman with a high white cap gold earrings black short petticoat and manycoloured apron monsieur veut savoir si mademoiselle va bien said she in slow careful french and when questions in that language were eagerly poured out she shook her head and said ne comprends pas  she however brought in the rest of the clothes warm water and a light so that anne rose and dressed exceedingly perplexed and wondering whether she could be in a ship for the sounds seemed to say so and there was no corresponding motion  could she be in france  certainly the voyage had seemed interminable but she did not think it could have been long enough for that nor that any person in his senses would try to cross in an open boat in such weather  she looked at the window a tiny slip of glass too thick to show anything but what seemed to be a dark wall rising near at hand  alas she was certainly a prisoner  in whose hands  with what intent  how would it affect that other prisoner at winchester was that vision of last night substantial or the work of her exhausted brain  what could she do  it was well for her that she could believe in the might of prayer  she durst not go beyond her door for she heard mens tones suppressed and gruff but presently there was a knock and wonder of wonders she beheld hans black hans showing all his white teeth in a broad grin and telling her that missee annes breakfast was ready  the curtain that overhung the door was drawn back and she passed into another small room with a fire on the open hearth and a lamp hung from a beam the walls all round covered with carpets or stuffs of thick glowing colours so that it was like the inside of a tent  and in the midst without doubt stood peregrine oakshott in such a dress as was usually worn by gentlemen in the morninga loose wrapping coat though with fine lace cuffs and cravat all like the shoes and silk stockings worn with his peculiar daintiness and as was usual when fullbottomed wigs were the rule in grande tenue its place supplied by a silken cap  this was olive green with a crimson tassel which had assumed exactly the characteristic onesided riquetwithatuft aspect  for the rest these years seemed to have made the slight form slighter and more wiry and the face keener more sallow and more marked  he bowed low with the foreign courtesy which used to be so offensive to his contemporaries and offered a delicate beringed hand to lead the young lady to the little table where grilled fowl and rolls both showing the cookery of hans were prepared for her  i hope you rested well and have an appetite this morning  sir what does it all mean  where am i asked anne drawing herself up with the native dignity that she felt to be her defence  in elfland he said with a smile as he heaped her plate  speak in earnest she entreated  i cannot eat till i understand it is no time for trifling  life and death hang on my reaching london  if you saved me from those men let me go free  no one can move at present he said  see here  he drew back a curtain opened first one door and then another and she saw sheets of driving rain and rising roaring waves with surf which came beating in on the force of such a fearful gust of wind that peregrine hastily shut the door not without difficulty nobody can stir at present he said as they came into the warm bright room again  it is a frightful tempest the worst known here for years they say  the deadlights as they call them have been put in or the windows would be driven in  come and taste hanss work you know it of old  will you drink tea  do you remember how your mother came to teach mine to brew it and how she forgave me for being graceless enough to squirt at her  there was something so gentle and reassuring in the demeanour of this strange being that anne convinced of the utter hopelessness of confronting the storm as well as of the need of gathering strength allowed herself to be placed in a chair and to partake of the food set before her and the tea which was served without milk in an exquisite dragon china cup but with a saucer that did not match it  we dont get our sets perfect said peregrine with a smile who was waiting on her as if she were a princess  i entreat you to tell me where we are said anne  not in france  no not in france  i wish we were  thencan this be the island  yes the island it is said peregrine both speaking as south hants folk this is the strange cave or chasm called black gang chine  black gang  oh the highwaymen the pirates  you have saved me from them  were they going to send me to the plantations  you need have no fears  no one shall touch you or hurt you  you shall see no one save by your own consent my queen  and when this storm is passedoh as a more fearful roar and dash sounded as if the waves were about to sweep away their frail shelteryou will come with me and save mr archfields life  you cannot know  i know he interrupted but why should i be solicitous for his life  that i am here now is no thanks to him and why should i give up mine for the sake of him who meant to make an end of me  you little know how he repented  and your own life  what do you mean  people dont haunt the black gang chine when their lives are secure from dutch bill he answered  dont be terrified my queen though i cannot lay claim like prospero to having raised this storm by my art magic yet it perforce gives me time to make you understand who and what i am and how i have recovered my better angel to give her no mean nor desperate career  it will be better thus than with the suddenness with which i might have had to act  a new alarm seized upon anne as to his possible intentions but she would not forestall what she so much apprehended and sensible that selfcontrol alone could guard her since escape at present was clearly impossible she resigned herself to sit opposite to him by the ample hearth of what she perceived to be a fishermans hut thus fitted up luxuriously with it might be feared the spoils of the sea  the story was a long one and not by any means told consecutively or without interruption and all the time those eyes were upon her one yellow the other green with the effect she knew so well of old in childish days of repulsion yet compulsion of terror yet attraction as if irresistibly binding a reluctant will  several times peregrine was called off to speak to some one outside the door and at noon he begged permission for his friends to dine with them saying that there was no other place where the dinner could be taken to them comfortably in this storm    chapter xxxii seven years   it was between the night and day    when the fairy king has power that i sunk down in a sinful fray and twixt life and death was snatched away    to the joyless elfin bower  scott  this motto was almost the account that the twisted figure with queer contortions of face yet delicate feet and hands and dainty utterance might have been expected to give when anne asked him was it you really  ior my double he asked  when  she told him and he seemed amazed  so you were there  well you shall hear  you know how things stood with meyour mother my good spirit dead my uncle away my father bent on driving me to utter desperation and martha browning laying her great red hands on me  oh sir she really loved you and is far wiser and more tolerant than you thought her  i know he smiled grimly  she buried the huge scot that was killed in the great smuggling fray under the protector with all honours in our family vault and had a longwinded sermon preached on my untimely end  ha ha with his mocking laugh  dont sir  if you had seen your father then  why did no one come forward and explain  mayhap there were none at hand who knew or wished to meddle with the law he said  well things were beyond all bearing at home and you were going away and would not so much as look at me  now one of the few sports my father did not look askance at was fishing and he would endure my being out at night with as he thought poor man old pete perring who was as stern a puritan as himself but i had livelier friends and more adventurous  they had connections with french freetraders for brandy and silks and when they found i was one with them my french tongue was a boon to them till i came to have a good many friends among the norman fishermen and to know the snug hidingplaces about the coast  so at last i made up my mind to be off with them and make my way to my uncle in muscovy  i had raised money enough at play and on the jewels one picks up in an envoys service and there was one good angel whom i meant to take with me if i could secure her and bind her wings  now you know with what hopes i saw you gathering flowers alone that morning  anne clasped her hands charles had truly interfered with good cause  i had all arranged he continued my uncle would have given you a hearty welcome and made our peace with my father or if not he would have left us all his goods and secured my career  what call had that great lout with a wife of his own too to come thrusting between us  i thought i should make short work of him and give him a lesson against meddlinggreat unlicked cub as he was while i had had the best training at berlin and paris in fencing but somehow those big strong fellows from their very clumsiness throw one out and he meant mischiefyes that he did  i saw it in his eyes  i suppose his sulky rustic jealousy was afire at a few little civilities to that poor little wife of his  any way when he bore me down like the swing of a windmill he drove his sword home  talk of his being innocent  why should he never look whether i were dead or alive but fling me headlong into that pit  anne could not but utter her eager defence but it was met with a sinister smile half of scorn half of pity and as she would have gone on hush your pleading only fills up the measure of my loathing  her heart sank but she let him go on listening perhaps less attentively as she considered how to take him  in fact he continued little as the lubber knew it twas the best he could have done for me  for though i never looked for such luck as your being out in the court at that hour i did think the chance not to be lost of visiting the garden or the churchyard and there were waiting in the vault a couple of stout normans who were to come at my whistle  it seems that when i came tumbling down in their midst senseless and bleeding like a calf they did not take it quite so easily as your champion above but began doing what they could for me and were trying to staunch the wound when they heard a trampling and a rumbling overhead and being aware that our undertaking might look ugly in the sight of the law and thinking this might be pursuers they carried me off with all speed not so much as stopping to pick up the things that have made such a commotion  was there any pursuit  oh no it must have been the haymakers  no doubt  the place was in no great favour with our own people they were in awe of the big scot who is in comfortable quarters in my grave and the frenchmen could not have found their way thither so it was let alone till mistress marthas researches  so i came to myself in the boat in which they took me on board the lugger that was waiting for us and instead of making for alderney as i had intended so as to get the knot safely tied to your satisfaction they sailed straight for havre  they had on board a jesuit father whom i had met once or twice among the duke of berwicks people but who had found portsmouth too hot to hold him in the frenzy of protestant zeal on the bishops account  he had been beset and owed his life he says to the fists of the breton and norman sailors who had taken him on board  it was well for me for i doubt if ever i was tough enough to have withstood my good friends treatment  he had me carried to a convent in havre where the fathers nursed me well and before i was on my legs again i had made up my mind to cast in my lot with them or rather with their church  oh  i had been baulked of winning the one being near whom my devil never durst come  and bloodletting had pretty well disposed of him  i was as meek and mild as milk under the good fathers moreover as my good friend at turin had told me and they repeated it such a doubly heretical baptism as mine was probably invalid and accounted for my being as much a vessel of wrath as even my father was pleased to call me  there was the queens rosary drawing me too  everything else was over with me and it seemed to open a new life  so bless me what a soft and pious frame i was in when they chastened me water oil salt and all on what my father raged at folks calling lammas day but which it seems really belongs to st peter in the fetters  so i was named pierre or piers after him thus keeping my own initial  piers oh not piers pigwiggin  pierre de pilpignon if you please  i have a right to that too but we shall come to it by and by  i can laugh now or perhaps weep over the fervid state i was in then as if i had trodden down my snake and by giving up everythingyou estate career i could keep him down  so it was settled that i would devote myself to the priesthooddont laughand i was ordered off to their seminary in london partly i believe for the sake of piloting a couple of fathers who could not speak a word of english  it was as they rightly judged the last place where my father would think of looking for me but they did not as rightly judge that we should long keep possession there  matters grew serious and it was not over safe in the streets  there was a letter of importance from a friend in holland carrying the prince of oranges hypocritical declaration which was to be got to father petre or the king on the nighthallowmas eve it wasand i was told off to put on a secular dress which i could wear more naturally than most of them and convey it  ah that explains  apparition number one  i guessed you were somewhere in those parts and looked up at the windows and though i did not see you i believe it was your eyes that first sent a thrill through me that boded ill for roman orders  after that we lived in a continual state of rumours and alarms secret messages and expeditions until i being strong in the arm and the wind and a featherweight was one of those honoured by rowing the queen and prince across the river  m de st victor accepted me  he told me there would be two nurses but never knew or cared who they were nor did i guess as we sat in the dark how near i was to you  and only for one second did i see your face as you were entering the carriage and i blessed you the more for what you were doing for her majesty  he proceeded to tell how he had accompanied the jesuit fathers on their leaving london to the great english seminary at douai and being for the time convinced by them that his feelings towards anne were a delusion of the enemy he had studied with all his might and as health and monotony of life began to have their accustomed effect in rousing the restlessness and mischievousness of his nature with all the passions of manhood growing upon him he strove to force them down by fasting and scourging  he told in a bitter almost savage way of his endeavours to flog his demon out of himself and of his anger and disappointment at finding piers pilgrim in the seminary of douai quite as subject to his attacks as ever was perry oakshott under a sermon of mr horncastles  then came the information among the students that the governor of the city the marquis de nidemerle had brought some english gentlemen and ladies to visit the gardens  as most of the students were of british families there was curiosity as to who they were and thus peregrine heard that one was young archfield of the hampshire family with his tutor and the lady was mistress darpent daughter to a french lawyer who had settled in england after the fronde  annes name had not transpired for she was viewed merely as an attendant  peregrine had been out on some errand in the town and had a distant view of his enemy as he held him flaunting about with a fine lady on his arm forgetting the poor little pretty wife whom no doubt he had frightened to death  oh you little know how tenderly he speaks of her  tenderlythats the way they speak of me at oakwood eh  human not to say elf nature could not withstand giving the fellow a start  i sped off whipped into the church popped into a surplice i found ready to hand caught up a candle andlittle did i think who it was that was hanging on his arm  so little did i know it that my heart began to be drawn to st germain where i still imagined you  altogether after that prank all broke out again  i entertained the lads with a few more freaks for which i did ample penance but it grew on me that in my case all was a weariness and a sham and that my demon might get a worse hold of me if i got into a course of hypocrisy  they were very good to me those fathers but jesuits as they were i doubt whether they ever fathomed me  any way perhaps they thought i should be a scandal but they agreed with me that their order was not my vocation and that we had better part before my fiend drove me to do so with dishonour  they even gave me recommendations to the french officers that were besieging tournay  i knew the duke of berwick a little at portsmouth and it ended in my becoming undersecretary to the duke of chartres  a man who knows languages has his value among frenchmen who despise all but their own  peregrine did not enter into full details of this stage of his career and anne was not fully informed of the habits that the young duke of chartres the future regent duke of orleans was already developing but she gathered that what the young man called his demon had nearly undisputed sway over him and she had not spent eight months at st germain without knowing by report of the dissolute manners of the substratum of fashionable society at paris even though outward decorum had been restored by madame de maintenon  yet he seemed to have been crossed by fits of vehement penitence and almost the saddest part of the story was the mocking tone in which he alluded to these  he had sought service at the court in the hope of meeting miss woodford there and had been grievously disappointed when he found that she had long since returned to england  the sight of the gracious and lovely countenance of the exiled queen seemed always to have moved and touched him as in some inexplicable manner her eyes and expression recalled to him those of mrs woodford and anne but the thought had apparently only stung him into the sense of being forsaken and abandoned to his own devices or those of his evil spirit  one incident occurring some three years previously he told more fully as it had a considerable effect on his life  i was attending the duke in the gardens at versailles he said when we were aware of a great commotion  all the gentlemen were standing gazing up into the top of a great chestnut tree the king and all and in the midst stood the abbe de fenelon with his little pupils the youngest the duke of anjou sobbing piteously and the duke of burgundy in a furious passion stamping and raging and only withheld from rolling on the ground by the abbes hand grasping his shoulder  i will not have him killed  he is mine he cried  and up in the tree the object of all their gaze was a monkey with a paper fluttering in his hand  some one had made a present of the creature to the kings grandsons he was the reigning favourite and having broken his chain had effected an entrance by the window into the kings cabinet where after giving himself the airs of a minister of state on being interrupted he had made off through the window with an important document which he was affecting to peruse at his leisure only interrupting himself to hurl down leaves or unripe chestnuts at those who attempted to pelt him with stones and this only made him mount higher and higher entirely out of their reach for no one durst climb after him  i believe it was a letter from the king of spain at any rate the whole cabinet was in agony lest the brute should proceed to tear it into fragments and a musqueteer had been sent for to shoot him down  i remembered my success with the monkey on poor little madam archfields backnay perhaps twas the same my familiar taking shape  i threw myself at the kings feet and desired permission to deal with the beast  by good luck it had not been so easy as they supposed to find a musquet fit for immediate use so i had full time  to ascend the tree was no more than i had done many times before and i went high in the branches but cautiously not to give monsieur le singe the idea of being pursued lest he should leap to a bough incapable of supporting me  when i had reached a fork tolerably high and where he could see me i settled myself took out a letter which fortunately was in my pocket read it with the greatest deliberation the monkey watching me all the time and finally i proceeded to fold it neatly in all its creases  the creature imitated me with its black fingers little aware poor thing that the musqueteer had covered him with his weapon and was waiting for the first sign of tearing the letter to pull the trigger but withheld by a sign from the king who did not wish to sacrifice his grandsons pet before his eyes  finally after finishing the folding i doubled it a second time and threw it at the animal  to my great joy he returned the compliment by throwing the other at my head  i was able to catch it and moreover as he was disposed to go in pursuit of his plaything he swung his chain so near me that i got hold of it twisted it round my arm and made the best of my way down the tree amid the bravos started by the royal lips themselves and repeated with ecstasy by all the crowd who waved their hats and made such a hallooing that i had much ado to get the monkey down safely but finally all dishevelled with my best cuffs and cravat torn to ribbons and my wig happily detached unlike absaloms for it remained in the tree i had the honour of presenting on my knee the letter to the king and the monkey to the princes  i kissed his majestys hand the little duke of anjou kissed the monkey and the duke of burgundy kissed me with arms round my neck then threw himself on his knees before his grandfather to ask pardon for his passion  every one said my fortune was made and that my agility deserved at least the cordon bleu  my own duke of chartres who in many points is like his cousin our late king charles gravely assured me that a new office was to be invented for me and that i was to be grand singier du roi  i believe he pushed my cause and so did the little duke of burgundy and finally i got the pension without the office and a good deal of occasional employment besides in the way of translation of documents  there were moments of success at play oh yes quite fairly any one with wits about him can make his profit in the longrun among the court set  and thus i had enough to purchase a pretty little estate and chateau on the coast of normandy the confiscated property of a poor huguenot refugee so that it went cheap  it gives the title of pilpignon which i assumed in kindness to the tongues of my french friends  so you see i have a station and property to which to carry you my fair one won by myself though only by catching an ape  he went on to say that the spot had been chosen advisedly with a view to communication with the opposite coast where his old connection with the smugglers was likely to be useful in the jacobite plots  as you well know he said my father had done his utmost to make whiggery stink in my nostrils to say nothing of the kindness i have enjoyed from our good queen and i was ready to do my utmost in the cause especially after i had stolen a glimpse of you and when charnock poor fellow returning from reconnoitring among the loyal told me that you were still unmarried and living as a dependent in the archfields house  our headquarters were in romney marsh but it was as well to have as it were a back door here and as it has turned out it has been the saving of some of us  oh sir you were not in that wicked plot  nay surely you are not turned whig  but this was assassination  not at all if they would have listened to me  the dutchman is no bigger than i am  i could have dropped on him from one of his trees at hampton court or through a window via presto and we would have had him off by the river given him an interview to beg his uncles pardon and despatched him for the benefit of his asthma to the company of the iron mask at st marguerite then back again the king to enjoy his own again dr woodford archbishop or bishop of whatever you please and a lady here present to be marquise de pilpignon or countess of havant whichever she might prefer  yes truly those were the hopes with which i renewed my communications with the contraband trade on this coast a good deal more numerous since the dutchman and his wars have raised the duties and driven many good men to holes and corners  ever since last spring when the princess royal died and thus extinguished the last spark of forbearance in the kings breast i have been here there and everywhereromney marsh drury lane paris besides this place and pilpignon where i have a snug harbour for the yacht ma belle annik as the breton sailors call her  the crew are chiefly breton it saves gossip but i have a boats crew of our own english folk here stout fellows ready for anything by land or sea  the black gang said anne faintly  dont suppose i have meddled in their exploits on the road he said except where a kings messenger or a royal mail was concerned and that is war you know for the cause  unluckily my personal charms are not easily disguised so that i have had to lurk in the background and only make my private investigations in the guise of my own ghost  then so it was you saved the dear little philip said anne  the archfield boy  i could not see a child sent to his destruction by that villain sedley whoever were his father for he meant mischief if ever man did  twas superhuman scruple not to hold your peace and let him swing  what was it then on his cousins part  peregrine only answered with a shrug  it appeared further that as long as the conspirators had entertained any expectation of success he had merely kept a watch over anne intending to claim her in the hour of the triumph of his party when he looked to enjoy such a position as would leave his brother free to enjoy his paternal inheritance  in the failure of all their schemes through mr pendergrasts denunciation sir george barclay and one or two inferior plotters had succeeded in availing themselves of the assistance of the black gang and had been conducted by peregrine to the hut that he had fitted up for himself  still trusting to the security there although his name of piers pilgrim or de pilpignon had been among those given up to the privy council he had insisted on lingering being resolved that an attempt should be made to carry away the woman he had loved for so many years  captain burford had so disguised himself as to be able to attend the trial loiter about the inn and collect intelligence while the others waited on the downs  peregrine had watched over the capture but being unwilling to disclose himself had ridden on faster and crossed direct traversing the island on horseback while the captive was rounding it in the boat  as should never have been done he said could i have foretold to what stress of weather you would be exposed while i was preparing for your reception  but for this stormit rages louder than everwe would have been married by a little parson whom burford would have fetched from portsmouth and we should have been over the channel and my people hailing my bride with ecstasy  never exclaimed anne  can you suppose i could accept one who would leave an innocent man to suffer  people sometimes are obliged to accept said peregrine  then at her horrified start no no fear no violence but is not something due to one who has loved you through exile all these years and would lay down his life for you you the only being who overcomes his evil angel  this is what you call overcoming it she said  nay indeed mistress anne i would let the authorities know that they are hanging a man for murdering one who is still alive if i could but no one would believe without seeing and i and all who could bear witness to my existence would be rushing to an end even worse than a simple noose  you were ready enough to denounce him to save that worthless fellow  not ready  it tore my heart  but truth is truth  i could not do that wickedness  oh how can you  this is the prompting of the evil spirit indeed to expect me to join in leaving that innocent generous spirit to die in cruel injustice  let me go  i will not betray where you are  you will be safe in france but there will yet be time for me to bear witness to your life  write a letter your father would thankfully swear to your handwriting and i think they would believe me  only let me go  and what then becomes of the hopes of a lifetime demanded peregrine  i who have waited as long as jacob to be defrauded now i have you and for the sake of the fellow who killed me in will if not in deed and then ran away like a poltroon leaving you to bear the brunt  he did not act like a poltroon when he saved the life of his general or when he rescued the colours of his regiment still less when he stood up to save me from the pain of bearing witness against him and to save a guiltless man cried anne with flashing eyes  before she had finished her indignant words hans was coming in from some unknown region to lay the cloth for supper and peregrine with an imprecation under his breath had gone to the door to admit his two comrades who came into the narrow entry on a gust of wind as it were struggling out of their cloaks stamping and swearing  in the middle of the day they had been much more restrained in their behaviour  there had at that time been a slight clearance in the sky though the wind was as furious as ever and they were in haste to despatch the meal and go out again to endeavour to stand on the heights and to watch some vessels that were being tossed by the storm  almost all the conversation had then been on the chances of their weathering the tempest and the probability of its lasting on and they had hurried away as soon as possible  anne had not then known who they were and only saw that they were fairly civil to her and kept under a certain constraint by pilpignon as they called their host  now she fully knew the one who was addressed as sir george to be barclay the prime mover in the wicked scheme of assassination of which all honest tories had been so much ashamed and she could see captain burford to be one of those bravoes who were only too plentiful in those days attending on dissolute and violent nobles  she was the less inclined to admit their attentions and shielded herself with a grave coldness of stately manners but their talk was far more free than at noon suggesting the thought that they had anticipated the meal with some of the nantz or other liquors that seemed to be in plenty  they began by low bows of affected reverence coarser and worse in the ruffian of inferior grade and the knight complimented pilpignon on being a lucky dog and hoped he had made the best use of his time in spite of the airs of his duchess  it was his own fault if he were not enjoying such fair society while they poor devils were buffeting with the winds which had come on more violently than ever  peregrine broke in with a question about the vessels in sight  there was an east indiaman dutch it was supposed layingto that was the cause of much excitement  if she drives ashore our fellows will neither be to have nor to hold said sir george  they will obey me said peregrine quietly  more than the sea will just yet laughed the captain  however as soon as this villainous weather is a bit abated ill be off across the island to do your little errand and only ask a kiss of the bride for my pains but if the parson be at portsmouth there will be no getting him to budge till the water is smooth  never mind madam well have a merry wedding feast whichever side of the water it is  i should recommend the voyage first for my part  all anne could do was to sit as upright and still as she could apparently ignoring the mans meaning  she did not know how dignified she looked and how she was daunting his insolence  when presently sir george barclay proposed as a toast a health to the bride of tomorrow she took her part by raising the glass to her lips as well as the gentlemen and adding may the brides be happy wherever they may be  coy upon my soul laughed sir george  you have not made the best of your opportunities pil  but with an oath it becomes her well  a truce with fooling barclay muttered peregrine  come come remember faint heartno lowering your crest more than enough to bring that devilish sparkle in the eyes and turn of the neck  sir said anne rising monsieur de pilpignon is an old neighbour and understands how to respect his most unwilling guest  i wish you a goodnight gentlemen  guennik venez ici je vous prie  guennik the breton boatswains wife understood french thus far and comprehended the situation enough to follow willingly leaving the remainder of the attendance to hans who was fully equal to it the door was secured by a long knife in the post but anne could hear plainly the rude laugh at her entrenchment within her fortress and much of the banter of peregrine for having proceeded no further it was impossible to shut out all the voices and very alarming they were as well as sometimes so coarse that they made her cheeks glow while she felt thankful that the bretonne could not understand  these three men were all proscribed traitors in haste to be off but peregrine to whom the yacht and her crew belonged had lingered to obtain possession of the lady and they were declaring that now they had caught his game and given him his toy they would brook no longer delay than was absolutely necessitated by the storm and married or not married he and she should both be carried off together let the damselerrant give herself what haughty airs she would  it was a weak concession on their part to the old puritan scruples that he might have got rid of by this time to attempt to bring about the marriage  they jested at him for being afraid of her and then there were jokes about gray mares  the one voice she could not hear was peregrines perhaps because he realised more than they did that she was within earshot and besides he was absolutely sober but she thought he silenced them and then she heard sounds of cardplaying which made an accompaniment to her agonised prayers    chapter xxxiii black gang chine   come lady while heaven lends us grace let us fly this cursed place lest the sorcerer us entice with some other new device not a word or needless sound till we come to holier ground i shall be your faithful guide through this gloomy covert wide  milton  never was maiden in a worse position than that in which anne woodford felt herself when she revolved the matter  the back of the isle of wight all along the undercliff had always had a wild reputation and she was in the midst of the most lawless of men peregrine alone seemed to have any remains of honour or conscience and apparently he was in some degree in the hands of his associates even if the clergyman came there was little hope in an appeal to him  naval chaplains bore no good reputation and portsmouth and cowes were haunted by the scum of the profession  all that seemed possible was to commit herself and charles to divine protection and in that strength to resist to the uttermost  the tempest had returned again and seemed to be raging as much as ever and the delay was in her favour for in such weather there could be no putting to sea  she was unwilling to leave the stronghold of her chamber but hans came to announce breakfast to her telling her that the mynheeren were gone all but massa perry and that gentleman came forward to meet her just as before hoping those fellows had not disturbed her last night  i could not help hearing much she said gravely  brutes he said  i am sick of them and of this life  save for the kings sake i would never have meddled with it  the roar of winds and waves and the beat of spray was still to be heard and in the manifest impossibility of quitting the place and the desire of softening him anne listened while he talked in a different mood from the previous day  the cynical tone was gone as he spoke of those better influences  he talked of mrs woodford and his deep affection for her of the kindness of the good priests at havre and douai and especially of one father seyton who had tried to reason with him in his bitter disappointment and savage penitence on finding that behind the cross lurks the devil as much at douai as at havant  he told how a sermon of the abbe fenelons had moved him and how he had spent half a lent in the severest penance but only to have all swept away again in the wild and wicked revelry with which easter came in  again he described how his heart was ready to burst as he stood by mrs woodfords grave at night and vowed to disentangle himself and lead a new life  and with you i shall he said  no she answered what you win by a crime will never do you good  a crime  tis no crime  you know i mean honourable marriage you owe no duty to any one  it is a crime to leave the innocent to undeserved death she said  do you love the fellow he cried with a voice rising to a shout of rage  yes she said firmly  why did not you say so before  because i hoped to see you act for right and justice sake was annes answer fixing her eyes on him  for gods sake not mine  yours indeed  think what can be his love to mine  he who let them marry him to that child while i struggled and gave up everything  then he runs awayruns awayleaving you all the distress never came near you all these years  oh yes he looks down on you as his childs governess  whats the use of loving him theres another heiress bespoken for him no doubt  no  his parents consent and we have known one anothers love for six years  oh thats the way he bound you to keep his secret  he would sing another song as soon as he was out of this scrape  you little know was all she said  ay continued peregrine pacing up and down the room you know that all that was wanting to fill up the measure of my hatred was that he should have stolen your heart  you cannot say that sir  he was my kind protector and helper from our very childhood  i have loved him with all my heart ever since i durst  ay the great straight comely lubbers have it all their own way with the women said he bitterly  i remember how he rushed headlong at me with the horsewhip when i tripped you up at the slype and you have never forgiven that  oh indeed i forgot that childish nonsense long ago  you never served me so again  no indeed never since you and your mother were the first to treat me like a human being  you will be able to do anything with me sweetest lady the very sense that you are under the same roof makes another man of me  i loathe what i used to enjoy  why the very sight of you sitting at supper like the lady in comus in your sweet grave dignity made me feel what i am and what those men are i heard their jests with your innocent ears  with you by my side the devils power is quelled  you shall have a peaceful beneficent life among the poor folk who will bless you our good and gracious queen will welcome you with joy and gratitude and when the good time comes as it must in a few years you will have honours and dignities lavished on you  can you not see what you will do for me  do you think a brokenhearted victim would be able to do you any good said she looking up with tears in her eyes  i do believe sir that you mean well by me in your own way and i could yes i can be sorry for you for my mother did feel for you and yours has been a sad life but how could i be of any use or comfort to you if you dragged me away as these cruel men propose knowing that he who has all my heart is dying guiltless and thinking i have failed him and here she broke down in an agony of weeping as she felt the old power in his eyes that enforced submission  he marched up and down in a sort of passion  dont let me see you weep for him  it makes me ready to strangle him with my own hands  a shout of pilpignon at the door here carried him off leaving anne to give free course to the tears that she had hitherto been able to restrain feeling the need of selfpossession  she had very little hope since her affection for charles archfield seemed only to give the additional sting of jealousy cruel as the grave to the vindictive temper peregrine already nourished and which certainly came from his evil spirit  she shed many tears and sobbed unrestrainingly till the bretonne came and patted her shoulder and said pauvre pauvre  and even hans looked in saying missee nana no cry massa perry great herrvery goot  she tried to compose herself and think over alternatives to lay before peregrine  he might let her go and carry to sir edmund nutley letters to which his father would willingly swear while he was out of danger in normandy  or if this was far beyond what could be hoped for surely he could despatch a letter to his father and for such a price she must sacrifice herself though it cost her anguish unspeakable to call up the thought of charles of little philip of her uncle and the old people who loved her so well all forsaken and with what a life in store for her  for she had not the slightest confidence in the power of her influence whatever peregrine might say and sincerely believe at present  if there were more palpably than with all other human beings angels of good and evil contending for him swaying him now this way and now that it was plain from his whole history that nothing had yet availed to keep him under the better influence for long together and she believed that if he gained herself by these unjust and cruel means the worse spirit would thereby gain the most absolute advantage  if her heart had been free and she could have loved him she might have hoped though it would have been a wild and forlorn hope but as it was she had never entirely surmounted a repulsion from him as something strange and unnatural a feeling involving fear though here he was her only hope and protector and an utter uncertainty as to what he might do  she could only hope that she might pine away and die quickly and perhaps charles archfield might know at last that it had been for his sake  and would it be in her power to make even such terms as these  how long she wept and prayed and tried to commit her way unto the lord she did not know but light seemed to be making its way far more than previously through the shutters closed against the storm when peregrine returned  you will not be greatly troubled with those fellows today he said theres a vessel come on the rocks at chale and every man and mothers son is gone after it  so saying he unfastened the shutters and let in a flood of sunshine  you would like a little air he said tis all quiet now and the tide is going down  after two days dark captivity anne could not but be relieved by coming out and she was anxious to understand where she was  it was though only in march glowing with warmth as the sun beat against the cliffs behind of a dark red brown in many places absolutely black in especial where a cascade swelled by the rains into imposing size came roaring leaping and sparkling down a sheer precipice  on either side the cove or chine was closely shut in by treeless ironcoloured masses of rock behind one of which the few inhabited hovels were clustered and the boat which had brought her was drawn up  in front was the sea still lashed by a fierce wind which was driving the fantastically shaped remains of the great storm cloud rapidly across an intensely blue sky  the waves although it was the ebb were still tremendous and their roar reechoed as they reared to fearful heights and broke with the reverberations that she had heard all along  peregrine kept quite high up not venturing below the washed line of shingle saying that the back draught of the waves was most perilous and in a high wind could not be reckoned upon  no escape he said as he perceived annes gaze on the inaccessible cliff and the whole scene the wild beauty of which was lost to her in its terrors  wheres your ship she asked  safe in whale chine  no putting to sea yet though it may be fair tomorrow  then she put before him the first scheme she had thought out of letting her escape to sir edmund nutleys house whence she could make her way back taking with her a letter that would prove his existence without involving him or his friends in danger  and eagerly she argued you do not know me really  it is only an imagination that you can be the better for my presence  then unheeding his fervid exclamation it was my dear mother who did you good  what would she think of the way in which you are trying to gain me  that i cannot do without you  and what would you have in me  i could be only wretched and feel all my lifesuch a life as it would bethat you had wrecked my happiness  oh yes  i do believe that you would try to make me happy but dont you see that it would be quite impossible with such a grief as that in my heart and knowing that you had caused it  i know you hate him and he did you the wrong but he has grieved for it and banished himself  but above all of this i am quite sure that to persist in this horrible evil of leaving him to die because of your revenge and stealing me away is truly giving satan such a frightful advantage over you that it is mere folly to think that winning me in such a way could do you any good  it is just a mere delusion of his to ruin us both body and soul  peregrine will you not recollect my mother and what she would think  have pity on me and help me away and i would pledge myself never to utter a word of this place nor that could bring you and yours into danger we would bless and pray for you always  no use he gloomily said  i believe you but the others will never believe a woman  no doubt we are watched even now by desperate men who would rather shoot you than let you escape from our hands  it seemed almost in connection with these words that at that moment from some unknown quarter where probably there was an entrance to the chine sir george barclay appeared with a leathern case under his arm  it had been captured on the wreck and contained papers which he wanted assistance in deciphering since they were in dutch and he believed them to be either despatches or bonds either of which might be turned to profit  these were carried indoors and spread on the table and as anne sat by the window dejected and almost hopeless as she was she could not help perceiving that though peregrine was so much smaller and less robust than his companions he exercised over them the dominion of intellect energy and will as if they too felt the force of his strange eyes and it seemed to her as if supposing he truly desired it whatever he might say he must be able to deliver her and charles but that a being such as she had always known him should sacrifice both his love and his hate seemed beyond all hope and change his heart turn our captivity o lord could only be her cry  only very late did burford come back full of the account of the wreck and of the spoils and the struggles between the wreckers for the flotsam and jetsam  there was much of savage brutality mated with a cool indifference truly horrible to anne and making her realise into what a den of robbers she had fallen especially as these narratives were diversified by consultations over the dutch letters and bills of exchange in the wrecked east indiaman and how to turn them to the best advantage  barclay and burford were so full of these subjects that they took comparatively little notice of the young lady only when she rose to retire burford made a sort of apology that this little business had hindered his going after the parson  he heard that the salamander was at the castle and redcoats all about he said and if the annick could be got out to morrow they must sail any way and if pil was still so squeamish a popish priest could couple them in a leash as tight as a fleet parson could  and then peregrine demanded whether burford thought a fleet parson the english for a naval chaplain and there was some boisterous laughter during which anne shut herself up in her room in something very like despair with that one ray of hope that he who had brought her back from exile before would again save her from that terrible fate  she heard cardplaying and the jingle of glasses far into the night as she believed but it seemed to her as if she had scarcely fallen asleep before to her extreme terror she heard a knock and a low call at her door of guennik  then as the bretonne went to the door through which a light was seen a lantern was handed in and a scrap of paper on which the words were written  on second thoughts my kindred elves at portchester shall not be scared by a worricow  dress quickly and i will bring you out of this  for a moment anne did not perceive the meaning of the missive the ghastly idea never having occurred to her that if charles had suffered the gibbet would have been at portchester  then with an electric flash of joy she saw that it meant relenting on peregrines part deliverance for them both  she put on her clothes with hasty trembling hands thankful to guennik for helping her pressed a coin into the strong toilworn hand and with an earnest thrill of thankful prayer opened the door  the driftwood fire was bright and she saw peregrine looking deadly white and equipped with slouched hat short wrapping cloak pistols and sword at his belt dark lantern lighted on the table and hans also cloaked by his side  he bent his head in salutation and put his finger to his lips giving one hand to anne and showing by example instead of words that she must tread as softly as possible as she perceived that he was in his slippers hans carrying his boots as well as the lantern she had used  yet to her ears the roar of the advancing tide seemed to stifle all other sounds  past the other huts they went in silence then came a precipitous path up the cliff steps cut in the hard sandy grit but very crumbling and in places supplemented by a rude ladder of sticks and rope  peregrine went before anne hans behind  each had hung the lantern from his neck so as to have hands free to draw her support her or lift her as might be needful  how it was done she never could tell in after years  she might jestingly say that her lightened heart bore her up but in her soul and in her deeper moments she thought that truly angels must have had charge over her  up up up  at last they had reached standing ground a tolerably level space with another high cliff seeming to rise behind it  here it was lightera pale streak of dawn was spreading over the horizon both on sky and sea and the waves still leaping glanced in the light of a golden waning moon while venus shone in the brightening sky a daystar of hope  peregrine drew a long breath and gave an order in a very low voice in dutch to hans who placed his boots before him and went off towards a shed  he will bring you a pony said his master  excuse me and he was withdrawing his hand when anne clasped it with both hers and said in a voice of intense feeling  oh how can i thank you and bless you  this is putting the evil angel to flight  tis you that have done it  you see i cannot do the wicked act where you are he answered gloomily as he turned aside to draw on his boots  ah but you have won the victory over him  do not be too sure  we are not out of reach of those rascals yet  he was evidently anxious for silence and anne said no more  hans presently brought from some unknown quarter a little stout pony bridled and saddled of course not with a side saddle but cloaks were arranged so as to make a fairly comfortable seat for anne and peregrine led the animal on the ascent to st catherines down  it was light enough to dispense with the lanterns and as they mounted higher the glorious sight of daybreak over the sea showed itself almost due east the sharp points of the needles showing up in a flood of pale golden light above and below with gulls flashing white as they floated into sunlight all seeming to annes thankful heart to be a new radiance of joy and hope after the dark roaring terrors of the chine  as they came out into the open freedom of the down with crisp silvery grass under their feet the breadth of sea on one side before them fertile fields and hills and farther away dimly seen in gray mist the familiar portsdown outlines not a sound to be heard but the exulting ecstasies of larks far far above in the depths of blue peregrine dared to speak above his breath with a question whether anne were at ease in her extemporary side saddle producing at the same time a slice of bread and meat and a flask of wine  oh how kind  what care you take of me she said  but where are we going  wherever you command he said  i had thought of carisbrooke cutts is there and it would be the speediest way  would it not be the most dangerous for you  i care very little for my life after this  oh no no you must not say so  after what you are doing for me you will be able to make it better than ever it has been  this is what i thought  if you would bring me in some place whence i could reach sir edmund nutleys house at parkhurst his servants would help me to do the rest even if he be not there himself  i would never betray you  you know i would not  and you would have full time to get away to your place in normandy with your friends  you care asked he  of course i do exclaimed she  do i not feel grateful to you and like and honour you better than ever i could have thought  you do in a strange choked tone  of course i do  you are doing a noble thankworthy thing  it is not only that i thank you for his sake but it is a grand and beautiful deed in itself and if my dear mother know she is blessing you for it  i shall remember those words he said if and he passed his hand over his eyes  see here he presently said i have written out a confession of my identity and explanation that it was i who drew first on archfield  it is enough to save him and in case my handwriting has altered as i think it has and there should be further doubt i shall be found at pilpignon if i get away  you had better keep it in case of accidents or if you carry out your generous plan  say whatever you please about me but there is no need to mention barclay or burford and it would not be fair to the honest freetraders here to explain where their chine lies  i should have brought you up blindfold if i could have done so with safety not that i do not trust you but i should be better able to satisfy those fellows if i ever see them again by telling them i have sworn you to secrecy  then he laughed  the gowks  i won all those indian bonds of them last night but left them in a parcel addressed to them as a legacy  anne took the required pledge and ventured to ask shall i say anything for you to your father  my poor old father  let him know that i neither would nor could disturb robert in his inheritance attainted traitor as the laws esteem me  for the rest mayhap i shall write to him if the good angel you talk of will help me  oh do  i am sure he would rejoice to forgive  he is much softened  now we must hush and go warily  i see sheep and if there is a shepherd i want him not to see us or point our way  it is well these isle of wight folk are not early risers    chapter xxxiv life for life   follow light and do the rightfor man can halfcontrol his doom till you find the deathless angel seated in the vacant tomb  forward let the stormy moment fly and mingle with the past i that loathed have come to love him  love will conquer at the last  tennyson  on they had gone in silence for the most part avoiding villages but as the morning advanced and they came into more inhabited places they were not able entirely to avoid meeting labourers going out to work who stared at hanss black face with curiosity  the sun was already high when they reached a crossroad whence the massive towers of carisbrooke were seen above the hedges and another turn led to parkhurst  they paused a moment and anne was beginning to entreat her escort to leave her to proceed alone when the sound of horses feet galloping was heard behind them peregrine looked back  ah he said  ride on as fast as you can towards the castle  you will be all right  i will keep them back  go i say  and as some figures were seen at the end of the road he pricked the pony with the point of his sword so effectually that it bolted forward quite beyond annes power of checking it and in a second or two its speed was quickened by shouts and shots behind  anne felt but scarcely understood at the moment a sharp pang and thrill in her left arm as the steed whirled her round the corner of the lane and full into the midst of a party of gentlemen on horseback coming down from the castle  help help she cried  down there  attacks by highwaymen were not uncommon experiences though scarcely at eight oclock in the morning or so near a garrison but the horsemen having already heard the shots galloped forward  perhaps anne could hardly have turned her pony but it chose to follow the lead of its fellows and in a few seconds they were in the midst of a scene of utter confusion  peregrine was grappling with burford trying to drag him from his horse  both fell together and as the auxiliaries came in sight there was another shot and two more men rode off headlong  follow them said a commanding voice  what have we here  the two struggling figures both lay still for a moment or two but as some of the riders drew them apart peregrine sat up though blood was streaming down his breast and arm  sir he said i am peregrine oakshott on whose account young archfield lies under sentence of death  if a magistrate will take my affidavit while i can make it he will be safe  then anne heard a voice exclaiming  oakshott  naywhy this is mistress woodford  how came she here and she knew sir edmund nutley  still it was peregrine who answered  i captured her in the hope of marrying her but that cannot bei have brought her back in all safety and honour  sir  sir indeed he has been very good to me  pray let him be looked to  let him be carried to the castle said the commander of the party a tall man sunburnt to a fiery red  is the other alive  only stunned my lord i think and not much hurt was the answer of an attendant officer but here is a poor blackamoor dead  poor hans  best so perhaps murmured peregrine as he was lifted then in a voice of alarm look to the lady she is hurt  it is nothing cried she  o mr oakshott that this should have happened  my lord this is the young gentlewoman i told you of betrothed to poor young archfield said sir edmund nutley  lord cutts for it was indeed williams favoured salamander took off his plumed hat in salutation and both gentlemen perceiving that she too was bleeding she was solicitously invited to the castle to be placed under the charge of the lieutenantgovernors wife  she found by this time that she was in a good deal of pain and thankfully accepted the support sir edmund offered her when he dismounted and walked beside her pony while explanations passed between them  the weather had prevented any communication with the mainland so that he was totally ignorant of her capture and did not know what had become of mr fellowes  he himself had been just starting with lord cutts who was going to join the king for his next campaign and they were to represent the case to the king anne told him in return what she dared to say but she was becoming so faint and dazed that she was in great fear of not saying what she ought and indeed she could hardly speak when after passing under the great gateway she was lifted off her horse at the door of the dwellinghouse and helped upstairs to a bedroom where the wife of the lieutenantgovernor mrs dudley was very tender over her with essences and strong waters and a surgeon of the suite almost immediately came to her  oh she exclaimed you should be with mr oakshott  the surgeon explained that mr oakshott would have nothing done for him till he had fully made and signed his deposition in case the power should afterwards be wanting  so anne submitted to the dressing of her hurt which was only a flesh wound the bone being happily untouched  both the surgeon and mrs dudley urged her going to bed immediately but she was unwilling to put herself out of reach and indeed the dressing was scarcely finished before sir edmund nutley knocked at the door to ask whether she could admit him  lord cutts is very desirous of speaking with you if you are able he said  here has this other fellow come round declaring that oakshott is the pilpignon who was in the barclay plot and besides the prime leader of the black gang of whom we have heard so much  the traitor cried anne  poor mr oakshott was resolved not to betray him  how is hemr oakshott i mean  the surgeon has him in his hands  we will send another from portsmouth but it looks like a bad case  he made his confession bravely though evidently in terrible suffering seeming to keep up by force of will till he had totally exonerated archfield and signed the deposition and then he fainted so that i thought him dead but i fear he has more to go through  can you come to the hall or shall i bring lord cutts to you  we must hasten in starting that we may bring the news to winchester tonight  anne much preferred going to the hall though she felt weak enough to be very glad to lean on sir edmunds arm  lord cutts williams highspirited and daring officer received her with the utmost courtesy and kindness inquired after her hurt and lamented having to trouble her but said that though he would not detain her long her testimony was important and he begged to hear what had happened to her  she gave the account of her capture and journey as shortly as she could  whither was she taken  she paused  i promised mr oakshott for the sake of others she said  you need have no scruples on that score said lord cutts burford hopes to get off for the murder by turning kings evidence and has told all  yes added sir edmund and poor oakshott managed to say tell her she need keep nothing back  it is all up  so anne answered all the questions put to her and they were the fewer both out of consideration for her condition and because the governor wanted to take advantage of the tide to embark on the medina  in a very few hours the archfields would have no more fears  anne longed to go with sir edmund but she was in no state for a ride and could not be a drag  sir edmund said that either his wife would come to her at once and take her to parkhurst or else her uncle would be sure to come for her  she would be the guest of major and mrs dudley who lived in the castle the actual lord warden only visiting it from time to time and though major dudley was a stern man both were very kind to her  as a whig major dudley knew the oakshott family and was willing to extend his hospitality even to the longlost peregrine  the lord warden who was evidently very favourably impressed saying that there was no need at present to treat him as a prisoner but that every attention should be paid to him as indeed he was evidently a dying man  burford and another of his associates were to be carried off handcuffed with the escort to winchester jail but before the departure the soldiers who had been sent to the chine returned baffled the place was entirely deserted and barclay had escaped  anne allowed herself to be put to bed being indeed completely exhausted and scarcely able to think of anything but the one blessed certainty that charles was safe and freed from all stigma when after the pain in her arm lulled enough to allow her to sleep she had had a few hours rest she inquired for peregrine she heard that for many hours the surgeon had been trying to extract the balls and that they considered that the second shot had made his case hopeless as it was in the body  he was so much exhausted as to be almost unconscious but the next morning when anne against the persuasions of her hostess had risen and been dressed though still feeling weak and shaken she received a message begging her to do him the great kindness of visiting him  deadly pale almost gray as he looked lying so propped with pillows as to relieve his shattered shoulder his face had a strange look of peace almost of relief and he smiled at her as she entered  he held out the hand he could use and his first word was of inquiry after her hurt  that is nothingit will soon be well i wish it were the same with you  nay i had rather cheat the hangman  i told those doctors yesterday that they were giving themselves and me a great deal of useless trouble  the villains as i told you could not believe we should not betray them and meant to make an end of us all  its best as it is  my poor faithful hans would never have had another happy moment  but you must be better peregrine for his voice though low was steady  theres no living with what i have here he said laying his hand on his side andi dreamt of your mother last night  with the words there was a look of gladness exceeding  ah the evil angel is gone  i want your prayers that he may not come back at the last  then as she clasped her hands and her lips moved he added there were some things i could only say to you  if they dont treat my body as that of an attainted traitor let me lie at your mothers feet dont disturb the big scot for me but let me rest at last near her then tell robin tis not out of want of regard for him that i have not bequeathed pilpignon to him but he could do no good with a french estate full of papists and theres a poor loyal fellow living ruined at parisa catholic toowith a wife and children half starved to whom it will do more good  i meant to askshall a priest be sent for  surely major dudley would consent  i dont know  i have not loved such priests lately  i had rather die as near your mother as may be  miss woodford said a voice at the door and going to it anne found herself clasped in her uncles arms  with very few words she led him to the bedside and the first thing he said was god bless you peregrine for what you have done  again peregrines face lighted up but fell again when he was told of the portsmouth surgeons arrival at the same time saying with one of his strange looks that it was odd sort of mercy to try to cure a man for jack ketch but that he should baffle them yet  do not set your mind on that said dr woodford for lord cutts was so much pleased with you that he would do his utmost on your behalf  much good that would do me said poor peregrine setting his teeth as his tormentor came in  meantime in mrs dudleys parlour while that good lady was assisting the surgeon at the dressing anne and her uncle exchanged information  mr fellowes had arrived on foot at about noon with his servant having only been released after two hours by a traveller and having been deprived both of money and horses so that he could not proceed on his journey besides that he had given the alarm about the abduction and raised the hue and cry at the villages on his way  there had been great distress riding and searching and the knowledge had been kept from poor charles archfield in his prison  mr fellowes had gone on to london as soon as possible and dr woodford had just returned from a fruitless attempt to trace his niece when sir edmund nutley and lord cutts appeared with the joyful tidings which however could be hardly understood  nothing dr woodford said could be more thorough than the vindication of charles archfield  peregrine had fully stated that the young man had merely interposed to prevent the pursuit of anne woodford that it was he himself who had made the first attack and that his opponent had been forced to fight in selfdefence  lord cutts had not only shown his affidavit to sir philip but had paid a visit to the colonel himself in his prison had complimented him highly on his services in the imperial army only regretting that they had not been on behalf of his own country and had assured him of equal if not superior rank in the british army if he would join it on the liberation that he might reckon upon in the course of a very few days  how did you work on the unhappy young man to bring about this blessed change asked the doctor  oh sir i do not think it was myself  it was first the mercy of the almighty and then my blessed mothers holy memory working on him revived by the sight of myself  i cannot describe to you how gentle and courteous and respectful he was to me all along though i am sure those dreadful men mocked at him for it  do you know whether his father has heard  robert oakshott is gone in search of him  he had set off to beat up the country good old man to obtain signatures to the petition in favour of our prisoner and robert expected to find him with mr chute at the vine  it is much to that young mans credit niece he was so eager to see his brother that he longed to come with me himself but he thought that the shock to his father would be so great that he ought to bear the tidings himself  and what do you think his good wife is about  perhaps you did not know that sedley archfield brought away jail fever with him and mrs oakshott feeling that she was the cause by her hasty action has taken lodgings for him in winchester and is nursing him like a sister no  you need not fear for your colonel my dear maid  sedley caught the infection because he neither was nor wished to be secluded from the rest of the prisoners some of whom were i fear only too congenial society to him  but now tell me the story of your own deliverance which seems to me nothing short of miraculous  the visit of the portsmouth surgeon only confirmed peregrines own impression that it was impossible that he should live and he was only surviving by the strong vitality in his little spare wiry frame  dr woodford after hearing annes story thought it well to ask him whether he would prefer the ministrations of a roman catholic priest but whether justly or unjustly peregrine seemed to impute to that church the failure to exorcise the malignant spirit which had led him to far worse aberrations than he had confessed to anne  though by no means deficient in knowledge or controversian theology as dr woodford soon found in conversation with him his real convictions were all as to what personally affected him and his strong protestant ingrain education however he might have disavowed it no doubt had affected his point of view  he had admired and been strongly influenced by the sight of real devotion and holiness though as his temptations and hatred of monotony recurred he had more than once swung back again  then however he had been revolted by the perception of the concessions to popular superstition and the morality of a wicked state of society  his real sense of any religion had been infused by mrs woodford and to her belongings and the faith they involved he was clinging in these last days  dr woodford could not but be glad that thus it was not only on the penitents own account but on that of the father who might have lost the comfort of finding him truly repentant in the shock of finding a popish priest at his bedside  and indeed the contrition seemed to have gathered force in many a past fit of remorse and now was deep but not unhopeful  in the evening the father and brother arrived  the major was now an old man hale indeed and with the beauty that a pure self restrained life often sheds on an aged man  he was much shaken and when he came in with his own white hair on his shoulders and actually tears in his eyes the look that passed between them was like nothing but the spirit of the parable so often but never too often repeated  peregrine who never perhaps had spent a happy or fearless hour with him and had dreaded his coming felt probably for the first time the mysterious sense of home and peace given by the presence of those between whom there is the tie of blood  not many words passed he was hardly in a state for them but from that time he was never so happy as when his father and brother were beside him and they seldom left him the major sitting day and night by his pillow attending to his wants or saying words of prayer  the old man had become much softened by nothing more perhaps than watching the way in which his daughterinlaw dealt with the manifestations of the oakshott imp nature in her eldest child  if i had understood he said to dr woodford  if i had so treated that poor boy never would he have been as he is now  you acted according to your conscience  ah sir a man does not grow old without learning that the conscience may be blinded above all by the spirit of opposition and party  i will not say there were no mistakes said the doctor and yet sir the high standard sound principle and strong faith he learnt from you and your example have prevailed to bear him through  the major answered with a groan but added and yet even now stained as he tells me he is and cut off in the flower of his age i thank my god and his saviour and after him you and yours that i am happier about him than i have been these eight and twenty years  with no scruple major oakshott threw his heart into the ministrations of dr woodford which peregrine declared kept at bay the evil angel who more than once seemed to his consciousness to be striving to make him despair while friend and father brought him back to the one hope  from time to time anne visited him for a short interval always to his joy and gratitude  there was one visit at last which all knew would be the final one when she shared in his first and last english communion  as she was about to leave him he held her hand and signed to her to bend down to hear him better  if you can let good father seyton at douai know that peace is comethe evil one beaten thanks to him who giveth us the victoryand i thank them all thereand ask their prayers  i will i will  some one at the door said may i come in  there was a sunburnt face a head with long brown hair a white coat  archfield asked peregrine  come send me away with pardon  tis yours i need and as charles knelt by the bed the two faces one all health the other gray and deathly were close together you have given your life for mine and given her  how shall i thank you  make her happy  she deserves it  charles clasped her hand with a look that was enough  then with a strange smile half sweetness half the contortion of a mortal pang the dying man said may she kiss me once  and when her lips had touched the cold damp brow  theremy fourth seven  at last  the change is come  old impishevilself left behind  at last  thanks to him who treads down satan under our feet  thanks  take her away now  charles took her away scarce knowing where they wentout into the spring sunshine on the slopes above the turf bowlinggreen where the captive king had beguiled his weary hours  only then would awe and emotion let them speak though his arm was round her her hand in his and his first words were as he looked at the scarf that still bore up her arm and this is what you have borne for me  it is all but healed  dont think of it  i shall all my life  poor fellow he might well bid me deserve you  i never can  tis to you i owe all  i believe indeed the ambassador might have claimed me but he is so tardy that probably i should have been hanged long before the proper form was ready and it would have been to exile and with a tainted name  you have won for me the clearing of name and honourhome parents and child and all besides your sweet self  and it was not me but he whom we so despised and dreaded  had i not been seized i could only have implored for you  i know this that if you had not been what you are my boy would have borne a dishonoured name and we should never have been together as now  it was in truth their first meeting in freedom and security as lovers but it could only be in a grave quiet fashion under the knowledge that he to whom their reunion was chiefly owing was breathing out the life he had sacrificed for them  thus they only gently and in a low voice went over their past doings and feelings as they walked up and down together till dr woodford came in the sunset to tell them that the change so longed for had come in peace and with a smile that told of release from the evil angel        peregrines wish was fulfilled and he was buried in portchester churchyard at mrs woodfords feet  this time it was mr horncastle old as he was who preached the funeral sermon the in memoriam of our forefathers and by special desire of major oakshott took for his text at evening time there shall be light  he spoke sometimes in a voice broken as much by feeling as by age of the childhood blighted by a cruel superstition and perverted as he freely made confession by discipline without comprehension because no confidence had been sought  then ensued a tribute of earnest generous justice to her who had done her best to undo the warp in the boys nature and whose blessed influence the young man had owned to the last through all the temptations errors and frenzies of his life  nor did the good man fail to make this a means of testifying to the entire neighbourhood who had flocked to hear him all that might be desirable to be known respecting the conflict at portchester actually reading peregrines affidavit as indeed was due to colonel archfield so as to prove that this was no mere pardon though technically it had so to stand but actual acquittal nor was the struggle with evil at the end forgotten nor the surrender alike of love and of hatred as well as of his own life which had been the final conquest the decisive passing from darkness to light  it was a strange sermon according to present ideas but not to those who had grown up to the semipolitical preaching of the century then in its last decade and it filled many eyes with tears many hearts with a deeper spirit of that charity which hopeth all things        a month later charles archfield and anne jacobina woodford were married at the little parish church of fareham  sir philip insisted on making it a gay and brilliant wedding in order to demonstrate to the neighbourhood that though the maiden had been his grandsons governess she was a welcomed and honoured acquisition to the family  perhaps too he perceived the error of his middle age when he contrasted that former wedding the work of worldly conventionality with the present  in the first an unformed undeveloped lad unable to understand his own true feelings and affections had been passively linked to a shallow frivolous ill trained creature utterly incapable of growing into a helpmeet for him whereas the love and trust of the statelylooking pair in the fresh bloom of manhood and womanhood had been proved in the furnace of trial so that the troth they plighted had deep foundation for the past and bright hope for the future  nor was anybody more joyous than little philip winning his nana for a better mother to him than his own could ever have been  it was in a blue velvet coat that colonel archfield was married  he had resigned his austrian commission and though the salamander was empowered to offer him an excellent staff appointment in the english army he decided to refuse  sir philip showed signs of having been aged and shaken by the troubles of the winter and required his sons assistance in the care of his property and little philip was growing up to need a fathers hand so that charles came to the conclusion that there was no need to cross the old cavaliers dislike to the new regime nor to make his mother and wife again suffer the anxieties of knowing him on active service while his duties lay at home  sedley archfield after a long illness owed recovery both in body and mind to mrs oakshott and by her arrangement finally obtained a fresh commission in a regiment raised for the defence of the possessions of the east india company  and that the poor changeling was still tenderly remembered might be proved by the fact that when the bells rung for queen annes coronation there was one baby peregrine at fareham and another at oakwood
