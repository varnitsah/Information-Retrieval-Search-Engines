540338	the old curiosity shop  by charles dickens     chapter 1  night is generally my time for walking in the summer i often leave home early in the morning and roam about fields and lanes all day or even escape for days or weeks together but saving in the country i seldom go out until after dark though heaven be thanked i love its light and feel the cheerfulness it sheds upon the earth as much as any creature living  i have fallen insensibly into this habit both because it favours my infirmity and because it affords me greater opportunity of speculating on the characters and occupations of those who fill the streets the glare and hurry of broad noon are not adapted to idle pursuits like mine a glimpse of passing faces caught by the light of a streetlamp or a shop window is often better for my purpose than their full revelation in the daylight and if i must add the truth night is kinder in this respect than day which too often destroys an airbuilt castle at the moment of its completion without the least ceremony or remorse  that constant pacing to and fro that neverending restlessness that incessant tread of feet wearing the rough stones smooth and glossyis it not a wonder how the dwellers in narrows ways can bear to hear it think of a sick man in such a place as saint martins court listening to the footsteps and in the midst of pain and weariness obliged despite himself as though it were a task he must perform to detect the childs step from the mans the slipshod beggar from the booted exquisite the lounging from the busy the dull heel of the sauntering outcast from the quick tread of an expectant pleasureseekerthink of the hum and noise always being present to his sense and of the stream of life that will not stop pouring on on on through all his restless dreams as if he were condemned to lie dead but conscious in a noisy churchyard and had no hope of rest for centuries to come  then the crowds for ever passing and repassing on the bridges on those which are free of toil at last where many stop on fine evenings looking listlessly down upon the water with some vague idea that by and by it runs between green banks which grow wider and wider until at last it joins the broad vast seawhere some halt to rest from heavy loads and think as they look over the parapet that to smoke and lounge away ones life and lie sleeping in the sun upon a hot tarpaulin in a dull slow sluggish barge must be happiness unalloyedand where some and a very different class pause with heavier loads than they remembering to have heard or read in old time that drowning was not a hard death but of all means of suicide the easiest and best  covent garden market at sunrise too in the spring or summer when the fragrance of sweet flowers is in the air overpowering even the unwholesome streams of last nights debauchery and driving the dusky thrush whose cage has hung outside a garret window all night long half mad with joy poor bird the only neighbouring thing at all akin to the other little captives some of whom shrinking from the hot hands of drunken purchasers lie drooping on the path already while others soddened by close contact await the time when they shall be watered and freshened up to please more sober company and make old clerks who pass them on their road to business wonder what has filled their breasts with visions of the country  but my present purpose is not to expatiate upon my walks the story i am about to relate and to which i shall recur at intervals  arose out of one of these rambles and thus i have been led to speak of them by way of preface  one night i had roamed into the city and was walking slowly on in my usual way musing upon a great many things when i was arrested by an inquiry the purport of which did not reach me but which seemed to be addressed to myself and was preferred in a soft sweet voice that struck me very pleasantly i turned hastily round and found at my elbow a pretty little girl who begged to be directed to a certain street at a considerable distance and indeed in quite another quarter of the town  it is a very long way from here said i my child  i know that sir she replied timidly i am afraid it is a very long way for i came from there tonight  alone said i in some surprise  oh yes i dont mind that but i am a little frightened now for i had lost my road  and what made you ask it of me suppose i should tell you wrong  i am sure you will not do that said the little creature you are such a very old gentleman and walk so slow yourself  i cannot describe how much i was impressed by this appeal and the energy with which it was made which brought a tear into the childs clear eye and made her slight figure tremble as she looked up into my face  come said i ill take you there  she put her hand in mine as confidingly as if she had known me from her cradle and we trudged away together the little creature accommodating her pace to mine and rather seeming to lead and take care of me than i to be protecting her i observed that every now and then she stole a curious look at my face as if to make quite sure that i was not deceiving her and that these glances very sharp and keen they were too seemed to increase her confidence at every repetition  for my part my curiosity and interest were at least equal to the childs for child she certainly was although i thought it probably from what i could make out that her very small and delicate frame imparted a peculiar youthfulness to her appearance though more scantily attired than she might have been she was dressed with perfect neatness and betrayed no marks of poverty or neglect  who has sent you so far by yourself said i  someone who is very kind to me sir  and what have you been doing  that i must not tell said the child firmly  there was something in the manner of this reply which caused me to look at the little creature with an involuntary expression of surprise for i wondered what kind of errand it might be that occasioned her to be prepared for questioning her quick eye seemed to read my thoughts for as it met mine she added that there was no harm in what she had been doing but it was a great secreta secret which she did not even know herself  this was said with no appearance of cunning or deceit but with an unsuspicious frankness that bore the impress of truth she walked on as before growing more familiar with me as we proceeded and talking cheerfully by the way but she said no more about her home beyond remarking that we were going quite a new road and asking if it were a short one  while we were thus engaged i revolved in my mind a hundred different explanations of the riddle and rejected them every one i really felt ashamed to take advantage of the ingenuousness or grateful feeling of the child for the purpose of gratifying my curiosity i love these little people and it is not a slight thing when they who are so fresh from god love us as i had felt pleased at first by her confidence i determined to deserve it and to do credit to the nature which had prompted her to repose it in me  there was no reason however why i should refrain from seeing the person who had inconsiderately sent her to so great a distance by night and alone and as it was not improbable that if she found herself near home she might take farewell of me and deprive me of the opportunity i avoided the most frequented ways and took the most intricate and thus it was not until we arrived in the street itself that she knew where we were clapping her hands with pleasure and running on before me for a short distance my little acquaintance stopped at a door and remaining on the step till i came up knocked at it when i joined her  a part of this door was of glass unprotected by any shutter which i did not observe at first for all was very dark and silent within and i was anxious as indeed the child was also for an answer to our summons when she had knocked twice or thrice there was a noise as if some person were moving inside and at length a faint light appeared through the glass which as it approached very slowly the bearer having to make his way through a great many scattered articles enabled me to see both what kind of person it was who advanced and what kind of place it was through which he came  it was an old man with long grey hair whose face and figure as he held the light above his head and looked before him as he approached i could plainly see though much altered by age i fancied i could recognize in his spare and slender form something of that delicate mould which i had noticed in the child their bright blue eyes were certainly alike but his face was so deeply furrowed and so very full of care that here all resemblance ceased  the place through which he made his way at leisure was one of those receptacles for old and curious things which seem to crouch in odd corners of this town and to hide their musty treasures from the public eye in jealousy and distrust there were suits of mail standing like ghosts in armour here and there fantastic carvings brought from monkish cloisters rusty weapons of various kinds distorted figures in china and wood and iron and ivory tapestry and strange furniture that might have been designed in dreams the haggard aspect of the little old man was wonderfully suited to the place he might have groped among old churches and tombs and deserted houses and gathered all the spoils with his own hands there was nothing in the whole collection but was in keeping with himself nothing that looked older or more worn than he  as he turned the key in the lock he surveyed me with some astonishment which was not diminished when he looked from me to my companion the door being opened the child addressed him as grandfather and told him the little story of our companionship  why bless thee child said the old man patting her on the head how couldst thou miss thy way what if i had lost thee nell  i would have found my way back to you grandfather said the child boldly never fear  the old man kissed her then turning to me and begging me to walk in i did so the door was closed and locked preceding me with the light he led me through the place i had already seen from without into a small sittingroom behind in which was another door opening into a kind of closet where i saw a little bed that a fairy might have slept in it looked so very small and was so prettily arranged the child took a candle and tripped into this little room leaving the old man and me together  you must be tired sir said he as he placed a chair near the fire how can i thank you  by taking more care of your grandchild another time my good friend i replied  more care said the old man in a shrill voice more care of nelly why who ever loved a child as i love nell  he said this with such evident surprise that i was perplexed what answer to make and the more so because coupled with something feeble and wandering in his manner there were in his face marks of deep and anxious thought which convinced me that he could not be as i had been at first inclined to suppose in a state of dotage or imbecility  i dont think you consider i began  i dont consider cried the old man interrupting me i dont consider her ah how little you know of the truth little nelly little nelly  it would be impossible for any man i care not what his form of speech might be to express more affection than the dealer in curiosities did in these four words i waited for him to speak again but he rested his chin upon his hand and shaking his head twice or thrice fixed his eyes upon the fire  while we were sitting thus in silence the door of the closet opened and the child returned her light brown hair hanging loose about her neck and her face flushed with the haste she had made to rejoin us she busied herself immediately in preparing supper and while she was thus engaged i remarked that the old man took an opportunity of observing me more closely than he had done yet i was surprised to see that all this time everything was done by the child and that there appeared to be no other persons but ourselves in the house i took advantage of a moment when she was absent to venture a hint on this point to which the old man replied that there were few grown persons as trustworthy or as careful as she  it always grieves me i observed roused by what i took to be his selfishness it always grieves me to contemplate the initiation of children into the ways of life when they are scarcely more than infants it checks their confidence and simplicitytwo of the best qualities that heaven gives themand demands that they share our sorrows before they are capable of entering into our enjoyments  it will never check hers said the old man looking steadily at me the springs are too deep besides the children of the poor know but few pleasures even the cheap delights of childhood must be bought and paid for  butforgive me for saying thisyou are surely not so very poorsaid i  she is not my child sir returned the old man her mother was and she was poor i save nothingnot a pennythough i live as you see buthe laid his hand upon my arm and leant forward to whispershe shall be rich one of these days and a fine lady dont you think ill of me because i use her help she gives it cheerfully as you see and it would break her heart if she knew that i suffered anybody else to do for me what her little hands could undertake i dont considerhe cried with sudden querulousness why god knows that this one child is the thought and object of my life and yet he never prospers meno never  at this juncture the subject of our conversation again returned and the old man motioning to me to approach the table broke off and said no more  we had scarcely begun our repast when there was a knock at the door by which i had entered and nell bursting into a hearty laugh which i was rejoiced to hear for it was childlike and full of hilarity said it was no doubt dear old kit coming back at last  foolish nell said the old man fondling with her hair she always laughs at poor kit  the child laughed again more heartily than before and i could not help smiling from pure sympathy the little old man took up a candle and went to open the door when he came back kit was at his heels  kit was a shockheaded shambling awkward lad with an uncommonly wide mouth very red cheeks a turnedup nose and certainly the most comical expression of face i ever saw he stopped short at the door on seeing a stranger twirled in his hand a perfectly round old hat without any vestige of a brim and resting himself now on one leg and now on the other and changing them constantly stood in the doorway looking into the parlour with the most extraordinary leer i ever beheld i entertained a grateful feeling towards the boy from that minute for i felt that he was the comedy of the childs life  a long way wasnt it kit said the little old man  why then it was a goodish stretch master returned kit  of course you have come back hungry  why then i do consider myself rather so master was the answer  the lad had a remarkable manner of standing sideways as he spoke and thrusting his head forward over his shoulder as if he could not get at his voice without that accompanying action i think he would have amused one anywhere but the childs exquisite enjoyment of his oddity and the relief it was to find that there was something she associated with merriment in a place that appeared so unsuited to her were quite irresistible it was a great point too that kit himself was flattered by the sensation he created and after several efforts to preserve his gravity burst into a loud roar and so stood with his mouth wide open and his eyes nearly shut laughing violently  the old man had again relapsed into his former abstraction and took no notice of what passed but i remarked that when her laugh was over the childs bright eyes were dimmed with tears called forth by the fullness of heart with which she welcomed her uncouth favourite after the little anxiety of the night as for kit himself whose laugh had been all the time one of that sort which very little would change into a cry he carried a large slice of bread and meat and a mug of beer into a corner and applied himself to disposing of them with great voracity  ah said the old man turning to me with a sigh as if i had spoken to him but that moment you dont know what you say when you tell me that i dont consider her  you must not attach too great weight to a remark founded on first appearances my friend said i  no returned the old man thoughtfully no come hither nell  the little girl hastened from her seat and put her arm about his neck  do i love thee nell said he saydo i love thee nell or no  the child only answered by her caresses and laid her head upon his breast  why dost thou sob said the grandfather pressing her closer to him and glancing towards me is it because thou knowst i love thee and dost not like that i should seem to doubt it by my question well wellthen let us say i love thee dearly  indeed indeed you do replied the child with great earnestness kit knows you do  kit who in despatching his bread and meat had been swallowing twothirds of his knife at every mouthful with the coolness of a juggler stopped short in his operations on being thus appealed to and bawled nobody isnt such a fool as to say he doosnt after which he incapacitated himself for further conversation by taking a most prodigious sandwich at one bite  she is poor nowsaid the old man patting the childs cheek but i say again that the time is coming when she shall be rich it has been a long time coming but it must come at last a very long time but it surely must come it has come to other men who do nothing but waste and riot when will it come to me  i am very happy as i am grandfather said the child  tush tush returned the old man thou dost not knowhow shouldst thou then he muttered again between his teeth the time must come i am very sure it must it will be all the better for coming late and then he sighed and fell into his former musing state and still holding the child between his knees appeared to be insensible to everything around him by this time it wanted but a few minutes of midnight and i rose to go which recalled him to himself  one moment sir he said now kitnear midnight boy and you still here get home get home and be true to your time in the morning for theres work to do good night there bid him good night nell and let him be gone  good night kit said the child her eyes lighting up with merriment and kindness  good night miss nell returned the boy  and thank this gentleman interposed the old man but for whose care i might have lost my little girl tonight  no no master said kit that wont do that wont  what do you mean cried the old man  id have found her master said kit id have found her ill bet that id find her if she was above ground i would as quick as anybody master ha ha ha  once more opening his mouth and shutting his eyes and laughing like a stentor kit gradually backed to the door and roared himself out  free of the room the boy was not slow in taking his departure when he had gone and the child was occupied in clearing the table the old man said  i havent seemed to thank you sir for what you have done tonight but i do thank you humbly and heartily and so does she and her thanks are better worth than mine i should be sorry that you went away and thought i was unmindful of your goodness or careless of heri am not indeed  i was sure of that i said from what i had seen but i added may i ask you a question  ay sir replied the old man what is it  this delicate child said i with so much beauty and intelligencehas she nobody to care for her but you has she no other companion or advisor  no he returned looking anxiously in my face no and she wants no other  but are you not fearful said i that you may misunderstand a charge so tender i am sure you mean well but are you quite certain that you know how to execute such a trust as this i am an old man like you and i am actuated by an old mans concern in all that is young and promising do you not think that what i have seen of you and this little creature tonight must have an interest not wholly free from pain  sir rejoined the old man after a moments silence i have no right to feel hurt at what you say it is true that in many respects i am the child and she the grown personthat you have seen already but waking or sleeping by night or day in sickness or health she is the one object of my care and if you knew of how much care you would look on me with different eyes you would indeed ah its a weary life for an old mana weary weary lifebut there is a great end to gain and that i keep before me  seeing that he was in a state of excitement and impatience i turned to put on an outer coat which i had thrown off on entering the room purposing to say no more i was surprised to see the child standing patiently by with a cloak upon her arm and in her hand a hat and stick  those are not mine my dear said i  no returned the child they are grandfathers  but he is not going out tonight  oh yes he is said the child with a smile  and what becomes of you my pretty one  me i stay here of course i always do  i looked in astonishment towards the old man but he was or feigned to be busied in the arrangement of his dress from him i looked back to the slight gentle figure of the child alone in that gloomy place all the long dreary night  she evinced no consciousness of my surprise but cheerfully helped the old man with his cloak and when he was ready took a candle to light us out finding that we did not follow as she expected she looked back with a smile and waited for us  the old man showed by his face that he plainly understood the cause of my hesitation but he merely signed to me with an inclination of the head to pass out of the room before him and remained silent i had no resource but to comply  when we reached the door the child setting down the candle turned to say good night and raised her face to kiss me then she ran to the old man who folded her in his arms and bade god bless her  sleep soundly nell he said in a low voice and angels guard thy bed do not forget thy prayers my sweet  no indeed answered the child fervently they make me feel so happy  thats well i know they do they should said the old man bless thee a hundred times early in the morning i shall be home  youll not ring twice returned the child the bell wakes me even in the middle of a dream  with this they separated the child opened the door now guarded by a shutter which i had heard the boy put up before he left the house and with another farewell whose clear and tender note i have recalled a thousand times held it until we had passed out the old man paused a moment while it was gently closed and fastened on the inside and satisfied that this was done walked on at a slow pace at the streetcorner he stopped and regarding me with a troubled countenance said that our ways were widely different and that he must take his leave i would have spoken but summoning up more alacrity than might have been expected in one of his appearance he hurried away i could see that twice or thrice he looked back as if to ascertain if i were still watching him or perhaps to assure himself that i was not following at a distance the obscurity of the night favoured his disappearance and his figure was soon beyond my sight  i remained standing on the spot where he had left me unwilling to depart and yet unknowing why i should loiter there i looked wistfully into the street we had lately quitted and after a time directed my steps that way i passed and repassed the house and stopped and listened at the door all was dark and silent as the grave  yet i lingered about and could not tear myself away thinking of all possible harm that might happen to the childof fires and robberies and even murderand feeling as if some evil must ensue if i turned my back upon the place the closing of a door or window in the street brought me before the curiositydealers once more i crossed the road and looked up at the house to assure myself that the noise had not come from there no it was black cold and lifeless as before  there were few passengers astir the street was sad and dismal and pretty well my own a few stragglers from the theatres hurried by and now and then i turned aside to avoid some noisy drunkard as he reeled homewards but these interruptions were not frequent and soon ceased the clocks struck one still i paced up and down promising myself that every time should be the last and breaking faith with myself on some new plea as often as i did so  the more i thought of what the old man had said and of his looks and bearing the less i could account for what i had seen and heard i had a strong misgiving that his nightly absence was for no good purpose i had only come to know the fact through the innocence of the child and though the old man was by at the time and saw my undisguised surprise he had preserved a strange mystery upon the subject and offered no word of explanation these reflections naturally recalled again more strongly than before his haggard face his wandering manner his restless anxious looks his affection for the child might not be inconsistent with villany of the worst kind even that very affection was in itself an extraordinary contradiction or how could he leave her thus disposed as i was to think badly of him i never doubted that his love for her was real i could not admit the thought remembering what had passed between us and the tone of voice in which he had called her by her name  stay here of course the child had said in answer to my question i always do what could take him from home by night and every night i called up all the strange tales i had ever heard of dark and secret deeds committed in great towns and escaping detection for a long series of years wild as many of these stories were i could not find one adapted to this mystery which only became the more impenetrable in proportion as i sought to solve it  occupied with such thoughts as these and a crowd of others all tending to the same point i continued to pace the street for two long hours at length the rain began to descend heavily and then overpowered by fatigue though no less interested than i had been at first i engaged the nearest coach and so got home a cheerful fire was blazing on the hearth the lamp burnt brightly my clock received me with its old familiar welcome everything was quiet warm and cheering and in happy contrast to the gloom and darkness i had quitted  but all that night waking or in my sleep the same thoughts recurred and the same images retained possession of my brain i had ever before me the old dark murky roomsthe gaunt suits of mail with their ghostly silent airthe faces all awry grinning from wood and stonethe dust and rust and worm that lives in woodand alone in the midst of all this lumber and decay and ugly age the beautiful child in her gentle slumber smiling through her light and sunny dreams     chapter 2  after combating for nearly a week the feeling which impelled me to revisit the place i had quitted under the circumstances already detailed i yielded to it at length and determining that this time i would present myself by the light of day bent my steps thither early in the morning  i walked past the house and took several turns in the street with that kind of hesitation which is natural to a man who is conscious that the visit he is about to pay is unexpected and may not be very acceptable however as the door of the shop was shut and it did not appear likely that i should be recognized by those within if i continued merely to pass up and down before it i soon conquered this irresolution and found myself in the curiosity dealers warehouse  the old man and another person were together in the back part and there seemed to have been high words between them for their voices which were raised to a very high pitch suddenly stopped on my entering and the old man advancing hastily towards me said in a tremulous tone that he was very glad i had come  you interrupted us at a critical moment said he pointing to the man whom i had found in company with him this fellow will murder me one of these days he would have done so long ago if he had dared  bah you would swear away my life if you could returned the other after bestowing a stare and a frown on me we all know that  i almost think i could cried the old man turning feebly upon him if oaths or prayers or words could rid me of you they should i would be quit of you and would be relieved if you were dead  i know it returned the other i said so didnt i but neither oaths or prayers nor words will kill me and therefore i live and mean to live  and his mother died cried the old man passionately clasping his hands and looking upward and this is heavens justice  the other stood lunging with his foot upon a chair and regarded him with a contemptuous sneer he was a young man of oneandtwenty or thereabouts well made and certainly handsome though the expression of his face was far from prepossessing having in common with his manner and even his dress a dissipated insolent air which repelled one  justice or no justice said the young fellow here i am and here i shall stop till such time as i think fit to go unless you send for assistance to put me outwhich you wont do i know i tell you again that i want to see my sister  your sister said the old man bitterly  ah you cant change the relationship returned the other if you could youd have done it long ago i want to see my sister that you keep cooped up here poisoning her mind with your sly secrets and pretending an affection for her that you may work her to death and add a few scraped shillings every week to the money you can hardly count i want to see her and i will  heres a moralist to talk of poisoned minds heres a generous spirit to scorn scrapedup shillings cried the old man turning from him to me a profligate sir who has forfeited every claim not only upon those who have the misfortune to be of his blood but upon society which knows nothing of him but his misdeeds a liar too he added in a lower voice as he drew closer to me who knows how dear she is to me and seeks to wound me even there because there is a stranger nearby  strangers are nothing to me grandfather said the young fellow catching at the word nor i to them i hope the best they can do is to keep an eye to their business and leave me to mind theres a friend of mine waiting outside and as it seems that i may have to wait some time ill call him in with your leave  saying this he stepped to the door and looking down the street beckoned several times to some unseen person who to judge from the air of impatience with which these signals were accompanied required a great quantity of persuasion to induce him to advance at length there sauntered up on the opposite side of the waywith a bad pretense of passing by accidenta figure conspicuous for its dirty smartness which after a great many frowns and jerks of the head in resistance of the invitation ultimately crossed the road and was brought into the shop  there its dick swiveller said the young fellow pushing him in sit down swiveller  but is the old min agreeable said mr swiveller in an undertone  mr swiveller complied and looking about him with a propitiatory smile observed that last week was a fine week for the ducks and this week was a fine week for the dust he also observed that whilst standing by the post at the streetcorner he had observed a pig with a straw in his mouth issuing out of the tobaccoshop from which appearance he augured that another fine week for the ducks was approaching and that rain would certainly ensue he furthermore took occasion to apologize for any negligence that might be perceptible in his dress on the ground that last night he had had the sun very strong in his eyes by which expression he was understood to convey to his hearers in the most delicate manner possible the information that he had been extremely drunk  but what said mr swiveller with a sigh what is the odds so long as the fire of soul is kindled at the taper of conwiviality and the wing of friendship never moults a feather what is the odds so long as the spirit is expanded by means of rosy wine and the present moment is the least happiest of our existence  you neednt act the chairman here said his friend half aside  fred cried mr swiveller tapping his nose a word to the wise is sufficient for themwe may be good and happy without riches fred say not another syllable i know my cue smart is the word only one little whisper fredis the old min friendly  never you mind replied his friend  right again quite right said mr swiveller caution is the word and caution is the act with that he winked as if in preservation of some deep secret and folding his arms and leaning back in his chair looked up at the ceiling with profound gravity  it was perhaps not very unreasonable to suspect from what had already passed that mr swiveller was not quite recovered from the effects of the powerful sunlight to which he had made allusion but if no such suspicion had been awakened by his speech his wiry hair dull eyes and sallow face would still have been strong witnesses against him his attire was not as he had himself hinted remarkable for the  nicest arrangement but was in a state of disorder which strongly induced the idea that he had gone to bed in it it consisted of a brown bodycoat with a great many brass buttons up the front and only one behind a bright check neckerchief a plaid waistcoat soiled white trousers and a very limp hat worn with the wrong side foremost to hide a hole in the brim the breast of his coat was ornamented with an outside pocket from which there peeped forth the cleanest end of a very large and very illfavoured handkerchief his dirty wristbands were pulled on as far as possible and ostentatiously folded back over his cuffs he displayed no gloves and carried a yellow cane having at the top a bone hand with the semblance of a ring on its little finger and a black ball in its grasp with all these personal advantages to which may be added a strong savour of tobaccosmoke and a prevailing greasiness of appearance mr swiveller leant back in his chair with his eyes fixed on the ceiling and occasionally pitching his voice to the needful key obliged the company with a few bars of an intensely dismal air and then in the middle of a note relapsed into his former silence  the old man sat himself down in a chair and with folded hands looked sometimes at his grandson and sometimes at his strange companion as if he were utterly powerless and had no resource but to leave them to do as they pleased the young man reclined against a table at no great distance from his friend in apparent indifference to everything that had passed and iwho felt the difficulty of any interference notwithstanding that the old man had appealed to me both by words and looksmade the best feint i could of being occupied in examining some of the goods that were disposed for sale and paying very little attention to a person before me  the silence was not of long duration for mr swiveller after favouring us with several melodious assurances that his heart was in the highlands and that he wanted but his arab steed as a preliminary to the achievement of great feats of valour and loyalty removed his eyes from the ceiling and subsided into prose again  fred said mr swiveller stopping short as if the idea had suddenly occurred to him and speaking in the same audible whisper as before is the old min friendly  what does it matter returned his friend peevishly  no but is he said dick  yes of course what do i care whether he is or not  emboldened as it seemed by this reply to enter into a more general conversation mr swiveller plainly laid himself out to captivate our attention  he began by remarking that sodawater though a good thing in the abstract was apt to lie cold upon the stomach unless qualified with ginger or a small infusion of brandy which latter article he held to be preferable in all cases saving for the one consideration of expense nobody venturing to dispute these positions he proceeded to observe that the human hair was a great retainer of tobaccosmoke and that the young gentlemen of westminster and eton after eating vast quantities of apples to conceal any scent of cigars from their anxious friends were usually detected in consequence of their heads possessing this remarkable property when he concluded that if the royal society would turn their attention to the circumstance and endeavour to find in the resources of science a means of preventing such untoward revelations they might indeed be looked upon as benefactors to mankind these opinions being equally incontrovertible with those he had already pronounced he went on to inform us that jamaica rum though unquestionably an agreeable spirit of great richness and flavour had the drawback of remaining constantly present to the taste next day and nobody being venturous enough to argue this point either he increased in confidence and became yet more companionable and communicative  its a devil of a thing gentlemen said mr swiveller when relations fall out and disagree if the wing of friendship should never moult a feather the wing of relationship should never be clipped but be always expanded and serene why should a grandson and grandfather peg away at each other with mutual wiolence when all might be bliss and concord why not jine hands and forgit it  hold your tongue said his friend  sir replied mr swiveller dont you interrupt the chair gentlemen how does the case stand upon the present occasion  here is a jolly old grandfatheri say it with the utmost respectand here is a wild young grandson the jolly old grandfather says to the wild young grandson i have brought you up and educated you fred i have put you in the way of getting on in life you have bolted a little out of course as young fellows often do and you shall never have another chance nor the ghost of half a one  the wild young grandson makes answer to this and says youre as rich as rich can be you have been at no uncommon expense on my account youre saving up piles of money for my little sister that lives with you in a secret stealthy huggermuggering kind of way and with no manner of enjoymentwhy cant you stand a trifle for your grownup relation the jolly old grandfather unto this retorts not only that he declines to fork out with that cheerful readiness which is always so agreeable and pleasant in a gentleman of his time of life but that he will bow up and call names and make reflections whenever they meet then the plain question is ant it a pity that this state of things should continue and how much better would it be for the gentleman to hand over a reasonable amount of tin and make it all right and comfortable  having delivered this oration with a great many waves and flourishes of the hand mr swiveller abruptly thrust the head of his cane into his mouth as if to prevent himself from impairing the effect of his speech by adding one other word  why do you hunt and persecute me god help me said the old man turning to his grandson why do you bring your prolifigate companions here how often am i to tell you that my life is one of care and selfdenial and that i am poor  how often am i to tell you returned the other looking coldly at him that i know better  you have chosen your own path said the old man follow it  leave nell and me to toil and work  nell will be a woman soon returned the other and bred in your faith shell forget her brother unless he shows himself sometimes  take care said the old man with sparkling eyes that she does not forget you when you would have her memory keenest take care that the day dont come when you walk barefoot in the streets and she rides by in a gay carriage of her own  you mean when she has your money retorted the other how like a poor man he talks  and yet said the old man dropping his voice and speaking like one who thinks aloud how poor we are and what a life it is the cause is a young childs guiltless of all harm or wrong but nothing goes well with it hope and patience hope and patience  these words were uttered in too low a tone to reach the ears of the young men  mr swiveller appeared to think the they implied some mental struggle consequent upon the powerful effect of his address for he poked his friend with his cane and whispered his conviction that he had administered a clincher and that he expected a commission on the profits discovering his mistake after a while he appeared to grow rather sleepy and discontented and had more than once suggested the propriety of an immediate departure when the door opened and the child herself appeared     chapter 3  the child was closely followed by an elderly man of remarkably hard features and forbidding aspect and so low in stature as to be quite a dwarf though his head and face were large enough for the body of a giant his black eyes were restless sly and cunning his mouth and chin bristly with the stubble of a coarse hard beard and his complexion was one of that kind which never looks clean or wholesome but what added most to the grotesque expression of his face was a ghastly smile which appearing to be the mere result of habit and to have no connection with any mirthful or complacent feeling constantly revealed the few discoloured fangs that were yet scattered in his mouth and gave him the aspect of a panting dog his dress consisted of a large highcrowned hat a worn dark suit a pair of capacious shoes and a dirty white neckerchief sufficiently limp and crumpled to disclose the greater portion of his wiry throat such hair as he had was of a grizzled black cut short and straight upon his temples and hanging in a frowzy fringe about his ears his hands which were of a rough coarse grain were very dirty his fingernails were crooked long and yellow  there was ample time to note these particulars for besides that they were sufficiently obvious without very close observation some moments elapsed before any one broke silence the child advanced timidly towards her brother and put her hand in his the dwarf if we may call him so glanced keenly at all present and the curiositydealer who plainly had not expected his uncouth visitor seemed disconcerted and embarrassed  ah said the dwarf who with his hand stretched out above his eyes had been surveying the young man attentively that should be your grandson neighbour  say rather that he should not be replied the old man but he is  and that said the dwarf pointing to dick swiveller  some friend of his as welcome here as he said the old man  and that inquired the dwarf wheeling round and pointing straight at me  a gentleman who was so good as to bring nell home the other night when she lost her way coming from your house  the little man turned to the child as if to chide her or express his wonder but as she was talking to the young man held his peace and bent his head to listen  well nelly said the young fellow aloud do they teach you to hate me eh  no no for shame oh no cried the child  to love me perhaps pursued her brother with a sneer  to do neither she returned they never speak to me about you indeed they never do  i dare be bound for that he said darting a bitter look at the grandfather i dare be bound for that nell oh i believe you there  but i love you dearly fred said the child  no doubt  i do indeed and always will the child repeated with great emotion but oh if you would leave off vexing him and making him unhappy then i could love you more  i see said the young man as he stooped carelessly over the child and having kissed her pushed her from him thereget you away now you have said your lesson you neednt whimper we part good friends enough if thats the matter  he remained silent following her with his eyes until she had gained her little room and closed the door and then turning to the dwarf said abruptly  harkee mr  meaning me returned the dwarf quilp is my name you might remember its not a long onedaniel quilp  harkee mr quilp then pursued the other you have some influence with my grandfather there  some said mr quilp emphatically  and are in a few of his mysteries and secrets  a few replied quilp with equal dryness  then let me tell him once for all through you that i will come into and go out of this place as often as i like so long as he keeps nell here and that if he wants to be quit of me he must first be quit of her what have i done to be made a bugbear of and to be shunned and dreaded as if i brought the plague hell tell you that i have no natural affection and that i care no more for nell for her own sake than i do for him let him say so i care for the whim then of coming to and fro and reminding her of my existence i will see her when i please thats my point i came here today to maintain it and ill come here again fifty times with the same object and always with the same success i said i would stop till i had gained it  i have done so and now my visits ended come dick  stop cried mr swiveller as his companion turned toward the door sir  sir i am your humble servant said mr quilp to whom the monosyllable was addressed  before i leave the gay and festive scene and halls of dazzling light sir said mr swiveller i will with your permission attempt a slight remark i came here sir this day under the impression that the old min was friendly  proceed sir said daniel quilp for the orator had made a sudden stop  inspired by this idea and the sentiments it awakened sir and feeling as a mutual friend that badgering baiting and bullying was not the sort of thing calculated to expand the souls and promote the social harmony of the contending parties i took upon myself to suggest a course which is the course to be adopted to the present occasion  will you allow me to whisper half a syllable sir  without waiting for the permission he sought mr swiveller stepped up to the dwarf and leaning on his shoulder and stooping down to get at his ear said in a voice which was perfectly audible to all present  the watchword to the old min isfork  is what demanded quilp  is fork sir fork replied mr swiveller slapping his picket you are awake sir  the dwarf nodded mr swiveller drew back and nodded likewise then drew a little further back and nodded again and so on by these means he in time reached the door where he gave a great cough to attract the dwarfs attention and gain an opportunity of expressing in dumb show the closest confidence and most inviolable secrecy  having performed the serious pantomime that was necessary for the due conveyance of these idea he cast himself upon his friends track and vanished  humph said the dwarf with a sour look and a shrug of his shoulders so much for dear relations thank god i acknowledge none nor need you either he added turning to the old man if you were not as weak as a reed and nearly as senseless  what would you have me do he retorted in a kind of helpless desperation it is easy to talk and sneer what would you have me do  what would i do if i was in your case said the dwarf  something violent no doubt  youre right there returned the little man highly gratified by the compliment for such he evidently considered it and grinning like a devil as he rubbed his dirty hands together ask mrs quilp pretty mrs quilp obedient timid loving mrs quilp but that reminds mei have left her all alone and she will be anxious and know not a moments peace till i return i know shes always in that condition when im away thought she doesnt dare to say so unless i lead her on and tell her she may speak freely and i wont be angry with her  oh welltrained mrs quilp  the creature appeared quite horrible with his monstrous head and little body as he rubbed his hands slowly round and round and round againwith something fantastic even in his manner of performing this slight actionand dropping his shaggy brows and cocking his chin in the air glanced upward with a stealthy look of exultation that an imp might have copied and appropriated to himself  here he said putting his hand into his breast and sidling up to the old man as he spoke i brought it myself for fear of accidents as being in gold it was something large and heavy for nell to carry in her bag she need be accustomed to such loads betimes thought neighbor for she will carry weight when you are dead  heaven send she may i hope so said the old man with something like a groan  hope so echoed the dwarf approaching close to his ear neighbour i would i knew in what good investment all these supplies are sunk but you are a deep man and keep your secret close  my secret said the other with a haggard look yes youre rightiikeep it closevery close  he said no more but taking the money turned away with a slow uncertain step and pressed his hand upon his head like a weary and dejected man the dwarf watched him sharply while he passed into the little sittingroom and locked it in an iron safe above the chimneypiece and after musing for a short space prepared to take his leave observing that unless he made good haste mrs quilp would certainly be in fits on his return  and so neighbour he added ill turn my face homewards leaving my love for nelly and hoping she may never lose her way again though her doing so has procured me an honour i didnt expect with that he bowed and leered at me and with a keen glance around which seemed to comprehend every object within his range of vision however small or trivial went his way  i had several times essayed to go myself but the old man had always opposed it and entreated me to remain as he renewed his entreaties on our being left along and adverted with many thanks to the former occasion of our being together i willingly yielded to his persuasions and sat down pretending to examine some curious miniatures and a few old medals which he placed before me it needed no great pressing to induce me to stay for if my curiosity has been excited on the occasion of my first visit it certainly was not diminished now  nell joined us before long and bringing some needlework to the table sat by the old mans side it was pleasant to observe the fresh flowers in the room the pet bird with a green bough shading his little cage the breath of freshness and youth which seemed to rustle through the old dull house and hover round the child it was curious but not so pleasant to turn from the beauty and grace of the girl to the stooping figure careworn face and jaded aspect of the old man  as he grew weaker and more feeble what would become of this lonely little creature poor protector as he was say that he diedwhat we be her fate then  the old man almost answered my thoughts as he laid his hand on hers and spoke aloud  ill be of better cheer nell he said there must be good fortune in store for theei do not ask it for myself but thee such miseries must fall on thy innocent head without it that i cannot believe but that being tempted it will come at last  she looked cheerfully into his face but made no answer  when i think said he of the many yearsmany in thy short lifethat thou has lived with me of my monotonous existence knowing no companions of thy own age nor any childish pleasures of the solitude in which thou has grown to be what thou art and in which thou hast lived apart from nearly all thy kind but one old man i sometimes fear i have dealt hardly by thee nell  grandfather cried the child in unfeigned surprise  not in intentionno no said he i have ever looked forward to the time that should enable thee to mix among the gayest and prettiest and take thy station with the best but i still look forward nell i still look forward and if i should be forced to leave thee meanwhile how have i fitted thee for struggles with the world the poor bird yonder is as well qualified to encounter it and be turned adrift upon its mercieshark i hear kit outside go to him nell go to him  she rose and hurrying away stopped turned back and put her arms about the old mans neck then left him and hurried away againbut faster this time to hide her falling tears  a word in your ear sir said the old man in a hurried whisper i have been rendered uneasy by what you said the other night and can only plead that i have done all for the bestthat it is too late to retract if i could though i cannotand that i hope to triumph yet all is for her sake i have borne great poverty myself and would spare her the sufferings that poverty carries with it i would spare her the miseries that brought her mother my own dear child to an early grave i would leave hernot with resources which could be easily spent or squandered away but with what would place her beyond the reach of want for ever you mark me sir she shall have no pittance but a fortunehush i can say no more than that now or at any other time and she is here again  the eagerness with which all this was poured into my ear the trembling of the hand with which he clasped my arm the strained and starting eyes he fixed upon me the wild vehemence and agitation of his manner filled me with amazement all that i had heard and seen and a great part of what he had said himself led me to suppose that he was a wealthy man i could form no comprehension of his character unless he were one of those miserable wretches who having made gain the sole end and object of their lives and having succeeded in amassing great riches are constantly tortured by the dread of poverty and best by fears of loss and ruin many things he had said which i had been at a loss to understand were quite reconcilable with the idea thus presented to me and at length i concluded that beyond all doubt he was one of this unhappy race  the opinion was not the result of hasty consideration for which indeed there was no opportunity at that time as the child came directly and soon occupied herself in preparations for giving kit a writing lesson of which it seemed he had a couple every week and one regularly on that evening to the great mirth and enjoyment both of himself and his instructress to relate how it was a long time before his modesty could be so far prevailed upon as it admit of his sitting down in the parlour in the presence of an unknown gentlemanhow when he did set down he tucked up his sleeves and squared his elbows and put his face close to the copybook and squinted horribly at the lineshow from the very first moment of having the pen in his hand he began to wallow in blots and to daub himself with ink up to the very roots of his hairhow if he did by accident form a letter properly he immediately smeared it out again with his arm in his preparations to make anotherhow at every fresh mistake there was a fresh burst of merriment from the child and louder and not less hearty laugh from poor kit himselfand how there was all the way through notwithstanding a gentle wish on her part to teach and an anxious desire on his to learnto relate all these particulars would no doubt occupy more space and time than they deserve it will be sufficient to say that the lesson was giventhat evening passed and night came onthat the old man again grew restless and impatientthat he quitted the house secretly at the same hour as beforeand that the child was once more left alone within its gloomy walls  and now that i have carried this history so far in my own character and introduced these personages to the reader i shall for the convenience of the narrative detach myself from its further course and leave those who have prominent and necessary parts in it to speak and act for themselves     chapter 4  mr and mrs quilp resided on tower hill and in her bower on tower hill mrs quilp was left to pine the absence of her lord when he quitted her on the business which he had already seen to transact  mr quilp could scarcely be said to be of any particular trade or calling though his pursuits were diversified and his occupations numerous he collected the rents of whole colonies of filthy streets and alleys by the waterside advanced money to the seamen and petty officers of merchant vessels had a share in the ventures of divers mates of east indiamen smoked his smuggled cigars under the very nose of the custom house and made appointments on change with men in glazed hats and round jackets pretty well every day on the surrey side of the river was a small ratinfested dreary yard called quilps wharf in which were a little wooden countinghouse burrowing all awry in the dust as if it had fallen from the clouds and ploughed into the ground a few fragments of rusty anchors several large iron rings some piles of rotten wood and two or three heaps of old sheet copper crumpled cracked and battered on quilps wharf daniel quilp was a shipbreaker yet to judge from these appearances he must either have been a shipbreaker on a very small scale or have broken his ships up very small indeed neither did the place present any extraordinary aspect of life or activity as its only human occupant was an amphibious boy in a canvas suit whose sole change of occupation was from sitting on the head of a pile and throwing stones into the mud when the tide was out to standing with his hands in his pockets gazing listlessly on the motion and on the bustle of the river at highwater  the dwarfs lodging on tower hill comprised besides the needful accommodation for himself and mrs quilp a small sleepingcloset for that ladys mother who resided with the couple and waged perpetual war with daniel of whom notwithstanding she stood in no slight dread indeed the ugly creature contrived by some means or otherwhether by his ugliness or his ferocity or his natural cunning is no great matterto impress with a wholesome fear of his anger most of those with whom he was brought into daily contact and communication over nobody had he such complete ascendance as mrs quilp herselfa pretty little mildspoken blueeyed woman who having allied herself in wedlock to the dwarf in one of those strange infatuations of which examples are by no means scarce performed a sound practical penance for her folly every day of her life  it has been said that mrs quilp was pining in her bower in her bower she was but not alone for besides the old lady her mother of whom mention has recently been made there were present some halfdozen ladies of the neighborhood who had happened by a strange accident and also by a little understanding among themselves to drop in one after another just about teatime this being a season favourable to conversation and the room being a cool shady lazy kind of place with some plants at the open window shutting out the dust and interposing pleasantly enough between the tea table within and the old tower without it is no wonder that the ladies felt an inclination to talk and linger especially when there are taken into account the additional inducements of fresh butter new bread shrimps and watercresses  now the ladies being together under these circumstances it was extremely natural that the discourse should turn upon the propensity of mankind to tyrannize over the weaker sex and the duty that developed upon the weaker sex to resist that tyranny and assert their rights and dignity it was natural for four reasons firstly because mrs quilp being a young woman and notoriously under the dominion of her husband ought to be excited to rebel secondly because mrs quilps parent was known to be laudably shrewish in her disposition and inclined to resist male authority thirdly because each visitor wished to show for herself how superior she was in this respect to the generality of her sex and fourthly because the company being accustomed to scandalise each other in pairs were deprived of their usual subject of conversation now that they were all assembled in close friendship and had consequently no better employment than to attack the common enemy  moved by these considerations a stout lady opened the proceedings by inquiring with an air of great concern and sympathy how mr quilp was whereunto mr quilps wifes mother replied sharply oh he was well enoughnothing much was every the matter with himand ill weeds were sure to thrive all the ladies then sighed in concert shook their heads gravely and looked at mrs quilp as a martyr  ah said the spokeswoman i wish youd give her a little of your advice mrs jiniwinmrs quilp had been a miss jiniwin it should be observednobody knows better than you maam what us women owe to ourselves  owe indeed maam replied mrs jiniwin when my poor husband her dear father was alive if he had ever ventured a cross word to me id have the good old lady did not finish the sentence but she twisted off the head of a shrimp with a vindictiveness which seemed to imply that the action was in some degree a substitute for words in this light it was clearly understood by the other party who immediately replied with great approbation you quite enter into my feelings maam and its jist what id do myself  but you have no call to do it said mrs jiniwin luckily for you you have no more occasion to do it than i had  no woman need have if she was true to herself rejoined the stout lady  do you hear that betsy said mrs jiniwin in a warning voice  how often have i said the same words to you and almost gone down my knees when i spoke em  poor mrs quilp who had looked in a state of helplessness from one face of condolence to another coloured smiled and shook her head doubtfully this was the signal for a general clamour which beginning in a low murmur gradually swelled into a great noise in which everybody spoke at once and all said that she being a young woman had no right to set up her opinions against the experiences of those who knew so much better that it was very wrong of her not to take the advice of people who had nothing at heart but her good that it was next door to being downright ungrateful to conduct herself in that manner that if she had no respect for herself she ought to have some for other women all of whom she compromised by her meekness and that if she had no respect for other women the time would come when other women would have no respect for her and she would be very sorry for that they could tell her having dealt out these admonitions the ladies fell to a more powerful assault than they had yet made upon the  mixed tea new bread fresh butter shrimps and watercresses and said that their vexation was so great to see her going on like that that they could hardly bring themselves to eat a single morsel  its all very fine to talk said mrs quilp with much simplicity but i know that if i was to die tomorrow quilp could marry anybody he pleasednow that he could i know  there was quite a scream of indignation at this idea marry whom he pleased they would like to see him dare to think of marrying any of them they would like to see the faintest approach to such a thing one lady a widow was quite certain she should stab him if he hinted at it  very well said mrs quilp nodding her head as i said just now its very easy to talk but i say again that i knowthat im surequilp has such a way with him when he likes that the best looking woman here couldnt refuse him if i was dead and she was free and he chose to make love to him come  everybody bridled up at this remark as much as to say i know you mean me let him trythats all and yet for some hidden reason they were all angry with the widow and each lady whispered in her neighbours ear that it was very plain that said widow thought herself the person referred to and what a puss she was  mother knows said mrs quilp that what i say is quite correct for she often said so before we were married didnt you say so mother  this inquiry involved the respected lady in rather a delicate position for she certainly had been an active party in making her daughter mrs quilp and besides it was not supporting the family credit to encourage the idea that she had married a man whom nobody else would have on the other hand to exaggerate the captivating qualities of her soninlaw would be to weaken the cause of revolt in which all her energies were deeply engaged beset by these opposing considerations mrs jiniwin admitted the powers of insinuation but denied the right to govern and with a timely compliment to the stout lady brought back the discussion to the point from which it had strayed  oh its a sensible and proper thing indeed what mrs george has said exclaimed the old lady if women are only true to themselvesbut betsy isnt and mores the shame and pity  before id let a man order me about as quilp orders her said mrs george before id consent to stand in awe of a man as she does of him idid kill myself and write a letter first to say he did it  this remark being loudly commended and approved of another lady from the minories put in her word  mr quilp may be a very nice man said this lady and i supposed theres no doubt he is because mrs quilp says he is and mrs jiniwin says he is and they ought to know or nobody does but still he is not quite awhat one calls a handsome man nor quite a young man neither which might be a little excuse for him if anything could be whereas his wife is young and is goodlooking and is a womanwhich is the greatest thing after all  this last clause being delivered with extraordinary pathos elicited a corresponding murmer from the hearers stimulated by which the lady went on to remark that if such a husband was cross and unreasonable with such a wife then  if he is interposed the mother putting down her teacup and brushing the crumbs out of her lap preparatory to making a solemn declaration if he is he is the greatest tyrant that every lived she darent call her soul her own he makes her tremble with a word and even with a look he frightens her to death and she hasnt the spirit to give him a word back no not a single word  notwithstanding that the fact had been notorious beforehand to all the teadrinkers and had been discussed and expatiated on at every teadrinking in the neighbourhood for the last twelve months this official communication was no sooner made than they all began to talk at once and to vie with each other in vehemence and volubility  mrs george remarked that people would talk that people had often said this to her before that mrs simmons then and there present had told her so twenty times that she had always said no henrietta simmons unless i see it with my own eyes and hear it with my own ears i never will believe it mrs simmons corroborated this testimony and added strong evidence of her own the lady from the minories recounted a successful course of treatment under which she had placed her own husband who from manifesting one month after marriage unequivocal symptoms of the tiger had by this means become subdued into a perfect lamb another lady recounted her own personal struggle and final triumph in the course whereof she had found it necessary to call in her mother and two aunts and to weep incessantly night and day for six weeks a third who in the general confusion could secure no other listener fastened herself upon a young woman still unmarried who happened to be amongst them and conjured her as she valued her own peace of mind and happiness to profit by this solemn occasion to take example from the weakness of mrs quilp and from that time forth to direct her whole thoughts to taming and subduing the rebellious spirit of man the noise was at its height and half the company had elevated their voices into a perfect shriek in order to drown the voices of the other half when mrs jiniwin was seen to change colour and shake her forefinger stealthily as if exhorting them to silence then and not until then daniel quilp himself the cause and occasion of all this clamour was observed to be in the room looking on and listening with profound attention  go on ladies go on said daniel mrs quilp pray ask the ladies to stop to supper and have a couple of lobsters and something light and palatable  iididnt ask them to tea quilp stammered his wife its quite an accident  so much the better mrs quilp these accidental parties are always the pleasantest said the dwarf rubbing his hands so hard that he seemed to be engaged in manufacturing of the dirt with which they were encrusted little charges for popguns what not going ladies you are not going surely  his fair enemies tossed their heads slightly as they sought their respective bonnets and shawls but left all verbal contention to mrs jiniwin who finding herself in the position of champion made a faint struggle to sustain the character  and why not stop to supper quilp said the old lady if my daughter had a mind  to be sure rejoined daniel why not  theres nothing dishonest or wrong in a supper i hope said mrs jiniwin  surely not returned the dwarf why should there be nor anything unwholesome either unless theres lobstersalad or prawns which im told are not good for digestion  and you wouldnt like your wife to be attacked with that or anything else that would make her uneasy would you said mrs jiniwin  not for a score of worlds replied the dwarf with a grin not even to have a score of mothersinlaw at the same timeand what a blessing that would be  my daughters your wife mr quilp certainly said the old lady with a giggle meant for satirical and to imply that he needed to be reminded of the fact your wedded wife  so she is certainly so she is observed the dwarf  and she has has a right to do as she likes i hope quilp said the old lady trembling partly with anger and partly with a secret fear of her impish soninlaw  hope she has he replied oh dont you know she has dont you know she has mrs jiniwin  i know she ought to have quilp and would have if she was of my way of thinking  why ant you of your mothers way of thinking my dear said the dwarf turing round and addressing his wife why dont you always imitate your mother my dear shes the ornament of her sexyour father said so every day of his life i am sure he did  her father was a blessed creetur quilp and worthy twenty thousand of some people said mrs jiniwin twenty hundred million thousand  i should like to have known him remarked the dwarf i dare say he was a blessed creature then but im sure he is now it was a happy release i believe he had suffered a long time  the old lady gave a gasp but nothing came of it quilp resumed with the same malice in his eye and the same sarcastic politeness on his tongue  you look ill mrs jiniwin i know you have been exciting yourself too muchtalking perhaps for it is your weakness go to bed do go to bed  i shall go when i please quilp and not before  but please to do now do please to go now said the dwarf  the old woman looked angrily at him but retreated as he advanced and falling back before him suffered him to shut the door upon her and bolt her out among the guests who were by this time crowding downstairs being left along with his wife who sat trembling in a corner with her eyes fixed upon the ground the little man planted himself before her and folding his arms looked steadily at her for a long time without speaking  mrs quilp he said at last  yes quilp she replead meekly  instead of pursing the theme he had in his mind quilp folded his arms again and looked at her more sternly than before while she averted her eyes and kept them on the ground  mrs quilp  yes quilp  if ever you listen to these beldames again ill bite you  with this laconic threat which he accompanied with a snarl that gave him the appearance of being particularly in earnest mr quilp bade her clear the teaboard away and bring the rum the spirit being set before him in a huge casebottle which had originally come out of some ships locker he settled himself in an armchair with his large head and face squeezed up against the back and his little legs planted on the table  now mrs quilp he said i feel in a smoking humour and shall probably blaze away all night but sit where you are if you please in case i want you  his wife returned no other reply than the necessary yes quilp and the small lord of the creation took his first cigar and mixed his first glass of grog the sun went down and the stars peeped out the tower turned from its own proper colours to grey and from grey to black the room became perfectly dark and the end of the cigar a deep fiery red but still mr quilp went on smoking and drinking in the same position and staring listlessly out of window with the doglike smile always on his face save when mrs quilp made some involuntary movement of restlessness or fatigue and then it expanded into a grin of delight     chapter 5  whether mr quilp took any sleep by snatches of a few winks at a time or whether he sat with his eyes wide open all night long certain it is that he kept his cigar alight and kindled every fresh one from the ashes of that which was nearly consumed without requiring the assistance of a candle nor did the striking of the clocks hour after hour appear to inspire him with any sense of drowsiness or any natural desire to go to rest but rather to increase his wakefulness which he showed at every such indication of the progress of the night by a suppressed cackling in his throat and a motion of his shoulders like one who laughs heartily but the same time slyly and by stealth  at length the day broke and poor mrs quilp shivering with cold of early morning and harassed by fatigue and want of sleep was discovered sitting patiently on her chair raising her eyes at intervals in mute appeal to the compassion and clemency of her lord and gently reminding him by an occasion cough that she was still unpardoned and that her penance had been of long duration but her dwarfish spouse still smoked his cigar and drank his rum without heeding her and it was not until the sun had some time risen and the activity and noise of city day were rife in the street that he deigned to recognize her presence by any word or sign he might not have done so even then but for certain impatient tapping at the door he seemed to denote that some pretty hard knuckles were actively engaged upon the other side  why dear me he said looking round with a malicious grin its day open the door sweet mrs quilp  his obedient wife withdrew the bolt and her lady mother entered  now mrs jiniwin bounced into the room with great impetuosity for supposing her soninlaw to be still abed she had come to relieve her feelings by pronouncing a strong opinion upon his general conduct and character seeing that he was up and dressed and that the room appeared to have been occupied ever since she quitted it on the previous evening she stopped short in some embarrassment  nothing escaped the hawks eye of the ugly little man who perfectly understanding what passed in the old ladys mind turned uglier still in the fulness of his satisfaction and bade her good morning with a leer or triumph  why betsy said the old woman you havent beenyou dont mean to say youve been a  sitting up all night said quilp supplying the conclusion of the sentence yes she has  all night cried mrs jiniwin  ay all night is the dear old lady deaf said quilp with a smile of which a frown was part who says man and wife are bad company  ha ha the time has flown  youre a brute exclaimed mrs jiniwin  come come said quilp wilfully misunderstanding her of course you mustnt call her names shes married now you know and though she did beguile the time and keep me from my bed you must not be so tenderly careful of me as to be out of humour with her  bless you for a dear old lady heres to your health  i am much obliged to you returned the old woman testifying by a certain restlessness in her hands a vehement desire to shake her matronly fist at her soninlaw oh im very much obliged to you  grateful soul cried the dwarf mrs quilp  yes quilp said the timid sufferer  help your mother to get breakfast mrs quilp i am going to the wharf this morningthe earlier the better so be quick  mrs jiniwin made a faint demonstration of rebellion by sitting down in a chair near the door and folding her arms as if in a resolute determination to do nothing but a few whispered words from her daughter and a kind inquiry from her soninlaw whether she felt faint with a hint that there was abundance of cold water in the next apartment routed these symptoms effectually and she applied herself to the prescribed preparations with sullen diligence  while they were in progress mr quilp withdrew to the adjoining room and turning back his coatcollar proceeded to smear his countenance with a damp towel of very unwholesome appearance which made his complexion rather more cloudy than it was before  but while he was thus engaged his caution and inquisitiveness did not forsake him for with a face as sharp and cunning as ever he often stopped even in this short process and stood listening for any conversation in the next room of which he might be the theme  ah he said after a short effort of attention it was not the towel over my ears i thought it wasnt im a little hunchy villain and a monster am i mrs jiniwin oh  the pleasure of this discovery called up the old doglike smile in full force when he had quite done with it he shook himself in a very doglike manner and rejoined the ladies  mr quilp now walked up to front of a lookingglass and was standing there putting on his neckerchief when mrs jiniwin happening to be behind him could not resist the inclination she felt to shake her fist at her tyrant soninlaw it was the gesture of an instant but as she did so and accompanied the action with a menacing look she met his eye in the glass catching her in the very act the same glance at the mirror conveyed to her the reflection of a horribly grotesque and distorted face with the tongue lolling out and the next instant the dwarf turning about with a perfectly bland and placid look inquired in a tone of great affection  how are you now my dear old darling  slight and ridiculous as the incident was it made him appear such a little fiend and withal such a keen and knowing one that the old woman felt too much afraid of him to utter a single word and suffered herself to be led with extraordinary politeness to the breakfasttable here he by no means diminished the impression he had just produced for he ate hard eggs shell and all devoured gigantic prawns with the heads and tails on chewed tobacco and watercresses at the same time and with extraordinary greediness drank boiling tea without winking bit his fork and spoon till they bent again and in short performed so many horrifying and uncommon acts that the women were nearly frightened out of their wits and began to doubt if he were really a human creature at last having gone through these proceedings and many others which were equally a part of his system mr quilp left them reduced to a very obedient and humbled state and betook himself to the riverside where he took boat for the wharf on which he had bestowed his name  it was flood tide when daniel quilp sat himself down in the ferry to cross to the opposite shore a fleet of barges were coming lazily on some sideways some head first some stern first all in a wrongheaded dogged obstinate way bumping up against the larger craft running under the bows of steamboats getting into every kind of nook and corner where they had no business and being crunched on all sides like so many walnutshells while each with its pair of long sweeps struggling and splashing in the water looked like some lumbering fish in pain in some of the vessels at anchor all hands were busily engaged in coiling ropes spreading out sails to dry taking in or discharging their cargoes in others no life was visible but two or three tarry boys and perhaps a barking dog running to and fro upon the deck or scrambling up to look over the side and bark the louder for the view coming slowly on through the forests of masts was a great steamship beating the water in short impatient strokes with her heavy paddles as though she wanted room to breathe and advancing in her huge bulk like a sea monster among the minnows of the thames on either hand were long black tiers of colliers between them vessels slowly working out of harbour with sails glistening in the sun and creaking noise on board reechoed from a hundred quarters the water and all upon it was in active motion dancing and buoyant and bubbling up while the old grey tower and piles of building on the shore with many a churchspire shooting up between looked coldly on and seemed to disdain their chafing restless neighbour  daniel quilp who was not much affected by a bright morning save in so far as it spared him the trouble of carrying an umbrella caused himself to be put ashore hard by the wharf and proceeded thither through a narrow lane which partaking of the amphibious character of its frequenters had as much water as mud in its composition and a very liberal supply of both arrived at his destination the first object that presented itself to his view was a pair of very imperfectly shod feet elevated in the air with the soles upwards which remarkable appearance was referable to the boy who being of an eccentric spirit and having a natural taste for tumbling was now standing on his head and contemplating the aspect of the river under these uncommon circumstances he was speedily brought on his heels by the sound of his masters voice and as soon as his head was in its right position mr quilp to speak expressively in the absence of a better verb punched it for him  come you let me alone said the boy parrying quilps hand with both his elbows alternatively youll get something you wont like if you dont and so i tell you  you dog snarled quilp ill beat you with an iron rod ill scratch you with a rusty nail ill pinch your eyes if you talk to mei will  with these threats he clenched his hand again and dexterously diving in between the elbows and catching the boys head as it dodged from side to side gave it three or four good hard knocks having now carried his point and insisted on it he left off  you wont do it agin said the boy nodding his head and drawing back with the elbows ready in case of the worst now  stand still you dog said quilp i wont do it again because ive done it as often as i want here take the key  why dont you hit one of your size said the boy approaching very slowly  where is there one of my size you dog returned quilp take the key or ill brain you with itindeed he gave him a smart tap with the handle as he spoke now open the countinghouse  the boy sulkily complied muttering at first but desisting when he looked round and saw that quilp was following him with a steady look and here it may be remarked that between this boy and the dwarf that existed a strange kind of mutual liking how born or bred and or nourished upon blows and threats on one side and retorts and defiances on the other is not to the purpose quilp would certainly suffer nobody to contract him but the boy and the boy would assuredly not have submitted to be so knocked about by anybody but quilp when he had the power to run away at any time he chose  now said quilp passing into the wooden countinghouse you mind the wharf stand upon your head agin and ill cut one of your feet off  the boy made no answer but directly quilp had shut himself in stood on his head before the door then walked on his hands to the back and stood on his head there and then to the opposite side and repeated the performance there were indeed four sides to the countinghouse but he avoided that one where the window was deeming it probable that quilp would be looking out of it this was prudent for in point of fact the dwarf knowing his disposition was lying in wait at a little distance from the sash armed with a large piece of wood which being rough and jagged and studded in many parts with broken nails might possibly have hurt him  it was a dirty little box this countinghouse with nothing in it but an old ricketty desk and two stools a hatpeg an ancient almanack an inkstand with no ink and the stump of one pen and an eightday clock which hadnt gone for eighteen years at least and of which the minutehand had been twisted off for a toothpick daniel quilp pulled his hat over his brows climbed on to the desk which had a flat top and stretching his short length upon it went to sleep with ease of an old practitioner intending no doubt to compensate himself for the deprivation of last nights rest by a long and sound nap  sound it might have been but long it was not for he had not been asleep a quarter of an hour when the boy opened the door and thrust in his head which was like a bundle of badlypicked oakum quilp was a light sleeper and started up directly  heres somebody for you said the boy  who  i dont know  ask said quilp seizing the trifle of wood before mentioned and throwing it at him with such dexterity that it was well the boy disappeared before it reached the spot on which he had stood ask you dog  not caring to venture within range of such missles again the boy discreetly sent in his stead the first cause of the interruption who now presented herself at the door  what nelly cried quilp  yes said the child hesitating whether to enter or retreat for the dwarf just roused with his dishevelled hair hanging all about him and a yellow handkerchief over his head was something fearful to behold its only me sir  come in said quilp without getting off the desk come in stay just look out into the yard and see whether theres a boy standing on his head  no sir replied nell hes on his feet  youre sure he is said quilp well now come in and shut the door whats your message nelly  the child handed him a letter mr quilp without changing his position further than to turn over a little more on his side and rest his chin on his hand proceeded to make himself acquainted with its contents     chapter 6  little nell stood timidly by with her eyes raised to the countenance of mr quilp as he read the letter plainly showing by her looks that while she entertained some fear and distrust of the little man she was much inclined to laugh at his uncouth appearance and grotesque attitude and yet there was visible on the part of the child a painful anxiety for his reply and consciousness of his power to render it disagreeable or distressing which was strongly at variance with this impulse and restrained it more effectually than she could possibly have done by any efforts of her own  that mr quilp was himself perplexed and that in no small degree by the contents of the letter was sufficiently obvious before he had got through the first two or three lines he began to open his eyes very wide and to frown most horribly the next two or three caused him to scratch his head in an uncommonly vicious manner and when he came to the conclusion he gave a long dismal whistle indicative of surprise and dismay after folding and laying it down beside him he bit the nails of all of his ten fingers with extreme voracity and taking it up sharply read it again the second perusal was to all appearance as unsatisfactory as the first and plunged him into a profound reverie from which he awakened to another assault upon his nails and a long stare at the child who with her eyes turned towards the ground awaited his further pleasure  halloa here he said at length in a voice and with a suddenness which made the child start as though a gun had been fired off at her ear nelly  yes sir  do you know whats inside this letter nell  no sir  are you sure quite sure quite certain upon your soul  quite sure sir  do you wish you may die if you do know hey said the dwarf  indeed i dont know returned the child  well muttered quilp as he marked her earnest look i believe you humph gone already gone in fourandtwenty hours what the devil has he done with it thats the mystery  this reflection set him scratching his head and biting his nails once more while he was thus employed his features gradually relaxed into what was with him a cheerful smile but which in any other man would have been a ghastly grin of pain and when the child looked up again she found that he was regarding her with extraordinary favour and complacency  you look very pretty today nelly charmingly pretty are you tired nelly  no sir im in a hurry to get back for he will be anxious while i am away  theres no hurry little nell no hurry at all said quilp how should you like to be my number two nelly  to be what sir  my number two nelly my second my mrs quilp said the dwarf  the child looked frightened but seemed not to understand him which mr quilp observing hastened to make his meaning more distinctly  to be mrs quilp the second when mrs quilp the first is dead sweet nell said quilp wrinkling up his eyes and luring her towards him with his bent forefinger to be my wife my little cherrycheeked redlipped wife say that mrs quilp lives five year or only four youll be just the proper age for me ha ha be a good girl nelly a very good girl and see if one of these days you dont come to be mrs quilp of tower hill  so far from being sustained and stimulated by this delightful prospect the child shrank from him in great agitation and trembled violently mr quilp either because frightening anybody afforded him a constitutional delight or because it was pleasant to contemplate the death of mrs quilp number one and the elevation of mrs quilp number two to her post and title or because he was determined from purposes of his own to be agreeable and goodhumoured at that particular time only laughed and feigned to take no heed of her alarm  you shall home with me to tower hill and see mrs quilp that is directly said the dwarf shes very fond of you nell though not so fond as i am you shall come home with me  i must go back indeed said the child he told me to return directly i had the answer  but you havent it nelly retorted the dwarf and wont have it and cant have it until i have been home so you see that to do your errand you must go with me reach me yonder hat my dear and well go directly with that mr quilp suffered himself to roll gradually off the desk until his short legs touched the ground when he got upon them and led the way from the countinghouse to the wharf outside when the first objects that presented themselves were the boy who had stood on his head and another young gentleman of about his own stature rolling in the mud together locked in a tight embrace and cuffing each other with mutual heartiness  its kit cried nelly clasping her hand poor kit who came with me oh pray stop them mr quilp  ill stop em cried quilp diving into the little countinghouse and returning with a thick stick ill stop em now my boys fight away ill fight you both ill take bot of you both together both together  with which defiances the dwarf flourished his cudgel and dancing round the combatants and treading upon them and skipping over them in a kind of frenzy laid about him now on one and now on the other in a most desperate manner always aiming at their heads and dealing such blows as none but the veriest little savage would have inflicted this being warmer work than they had calculated upon speedily cooled the courage of the belligerents who scrambled to their feet and called for quarter  ill beat you to a pulp you dogs said quilp vainly endeavoring to get near either of them for a parting blow ill bruise you until youre coppercoloured ill break your faces till you havent a profile between you i will  come you drop that stick or itll be worse for you said his boy dodging round him and watching an opportunity to rush in you drop that stick  come a little nearer and ill drop it on your skull you dog said quilp with gleaming eyes a little nearernearer yet  but the boy declined the invitation until his master was apparently a little off his guard when he darted in and seizing the weapon tried to wrest it from his grasp quilp who was as strong as a lion easily kept his hold until the boy was tugging at it with his utmost power when he suddenly let it go and sent him reeling backwards so that he fell violently upon his head the success of this manoeuvre tickled mr quilp beyond description and he laughed and stamped upon the ground as at a most irresistible jest  never mind said the boy nodding his head and rubbing it at the same time you see if ever i offer to strike anybody again because they say youre an uglier dwarf than can be seen anywheres for a penny thats all  do you mean to say im not you dog returned quilp  no retorted the boy  then what do you fight on my wharf for you villain said quilp  because he said so replied to boy pointing to kit not because you ant  then why did he say bawled kit that miss nelly was ugly and that she and my master was obliged to do whatever his master liked  why did he say that  he said what he did because hes a fool and you said what you did because youre very wise and cleveralmost too clever to live unless youre very careful of yourself kit said quilp with great suavity in his manner but still more of quiet malice about his eyes and mouth heres sixpence for you kit always speak the truth  at all times kit speak the truth lock the countinghouse you dog and bring me the key  the other boy to whom this order was addressed did as he was told and was rewarded for his partizanship in behalf of his master by a dexterous rap on the nose with the key which brought the water into his eyes then mr quilp departed with the child and kit in a boat and the boy revenged himself by dancing on his head at intervals on the extreme verge of the wharf during the whole time they crossed the river  there was only mrs quilp at home and she little expecting the return of her lord was just composing herself for a refreshing slumber when the sound of his footsteps roused her she had barely time to seem to be occupied in some needlework when he entered accompanied by the child having left kit downstairs  heres nelly trent dear mrs quilp said her husband a glass of wine my dear and a biscuit for she has had a long walk shell sit with you my soul while i write a letter  mrs quilp looked tremblingly in her spouses face to know what this unusual courtesy might portend and obedient to the summons she saw in his gesture followed him into the next room  mind what i say to you whispered quilp see if you can get out of her anything about her grandfather or what they do or how they live or what he tells her ive my reasons for knowing if i can you women talk more freely to one another than you do to us and you have a soft mild way with you thatll win upon her do you hear  yes quilp  go then whats the matter now  dear quilp faltered his wife i love the childif you could do without making me deceive her  the dwarf muttering a terrible oath looked round as if for some weapon with which to inflict condign punishment upon his disobedient wife the submissive little woman hurriedly entreated him not to be angry and promised to do as he bade her  do you hear me whispered quilp nipping and pinching her arm worm yourself into her secrets i know you can im listening recollect if youre not sharp enough ill creak the door and woe betide you if i have to creak it much go  mrs quilp departed according to order and her amiable husband ensconcing himself behind the partly opened door and applying his ear close to it began to listen with a face of great craftiness and attention  poor mrs quilp was thinking however in what manner to begin or what kind of inquiries she could make and it was not until the door creaking in a very urgent manner warned her to proceed without further consideration that the sound of her voice was heard  how very often you have come backwards and forwards lately to mr quilp my dear  i have said so to grandfather a hundred times returned nell innocently  and what has he said to that  only sighed and dropped his head and seemed so sad and wretched that if you could have seen him i am sure you must have cried you could not have helped it more than i i know how that door creaks  it often does returned mrs quilp with an uneasy glance towards it but your grandfatherhe used not to be so wretched  oh no said the child eagerly so different we were once so happy and he so cheerful and contented you cannot think what a sad change has fallen on us since  i am very very sorry to hear you speak like this my dear said mrs quilp and she spoke the truth  thank you returned the child kissing her cheek you are always kind to me and it is a pleasure to talk to you i can speak to no one else about him but poor kit i am very happy still i ought to feel happier perhaps than i do but you cannot think how it grieves me sometimes to see him alter so  hell alter again nelly said mrs quilp and be what he was before  oh if god would only let that come about said the child with streaming eyes but it is a long time now since he first began toi thought i saw that door moving  its the wind said mrs quilp faintly began to  to be so thoughtful and dejected and to forget our old way of spending the time in the long evenings said the child i used to read to him by the fireside and he sat listening and when i stopped and we began to talk he told me about my mother and how she once looked and spoke just like me when she was a little child then he used to take me on his knee and try to make me understand that she was not lying in her grave but had flown to a beautiful country beyond the sky where nothing died or ever grew oldwe were very happy once  nelly nelly said the poor woman i cant bear to see one as young as you so sorrowful pray dont cry  i do so very seldom said nell but i have kept this to myself a long time and i am not quite well i think for the tears come into my eyes and i cannot keep them back i dont mind telling you my grief for i know you will not tell it to any one again  mrs quilp turned away her head and made no answer  then said the child we often walked in the fields and among the green trees and when we came home at night we liked it better for being tired and said what a happy place it was and if it was dark and rather dull we used to say what did it matter to us for it only made us remember our last walk with greater pleasure and look forward to our next one but now we never have these walks and though it is the same house it is darker and much more gloomy than it used to be indeed  she paused here but though the door creaked more than once mrs quilp said nothing  mind you dont suppose said the child earnestly that grandfather is less kind to me than he was i think he loves me better every day and is kinder and more affectionate than he was the day before you do not know how fond he is of me  i am sure he loves you dearly said mrs quilp  indeed indeed he does cried nell as dearly as i love him but i have not told you the greatest change of all and this you must never breathe again to any one he has no sleep or rest but that which he takes by day in his easy chair for every night and nearly all night long he is away from home  nelly  hush said the child laying her finger on her lip and looking round when he comes home in the morning which is generally just before day i let him in last night he was very late and it was quite light i saw that his face was deadly pale that his eyes were bloodshot and that his legs trembled as he walked when i had gone to bed again i heard him groan i got up and ran back to him and heard him say before he knew that i was there that he could not bear his life much longer and if it was not for the child would wish to die what shall i do oh what shall i do  the fountains of her heart were opened the child overpowered by the weight of her sorrows and anxieties by the first confidence she had ever shown and the sympathy with which her little tale had been received hid her face in the arms of her helpless friend and burst into a passion of tears  in a few minutes mr quilp returned and expressed the utmost surprise to find her in this condition which he did very naturally and with admirable effect for that kind of acting had been rendered familiar to him by long practice and he was quite at home in it  shes tired you see mrs quilp said the dwarf squinting in a hideous manner to imply that his wife was to follow his lead its a long way from her home to the wharf and then she was alarmed to see a couple of young scoundrels fighting and was timorous on the water besides all this together has been too much for her poor nell  mr quilp unintentionally adopted the very best means he could have devised for the recovery of his young visitor by patting her on the head such an application from any other hand might not have produced a remarkable effect but the child shrank so quickly from his touch and felt such an instinctive desire to get out of his reach that she rose directly and declared herself ready to return  but youd better wait and dine with mrs quilp and me said the dwarf  i have been away too long sir already returned nell drying her eyes  well said mr quilp if you will go you will nelly heres the note its only to say that i shall see him tomorrow or maybe next day and that i couldnt do that little business for him this morning goodbye nelly here you sir take care of her dye hear  kit who appeared at the summons deigned to make no reply to so needless an injunction and after staring at quilp in a threatening manner as if he doubted whether he might not have been the cause of nelly shedding tears and felt more than half disposed to revenge the fact upon him on the mere suspicion turned about and followed his young mistress who had by this time taken her leave of mrs quilp and departed  youre a keen questioner ant you mrs quilp said the dwarf turning upon her as soon as they were left alone  what more could i do returned his wife mildly  what more could you do sneered quilp couldnt you have done something less couldnt you have done what you had to do without appearing in your favourite part of the crocodile you minx  i am very sorry for the child quilp said his wife surely ive done enough ive led her on to tell her secret she supposed we were alone and you were by god forgive me  you led her on you did a great deal truly said quilp what did i tell you about making me creak the door its lucky for you that from what she let fall ive got the clue i want for if i hadnt id have visited the failure upon you i can tell you  mrs quilp being fully persuaded of this made no reply her husband added with some exultation  but you may thank your fortunate starsthe same stars that made you mrs quilpyou may thank them that im upon the old gentlemans track and have got a new light so let me hear no more about this matter now or at any other time and dont get anything too nice for dinner for i shant be home to it  so saying mr quilp put his hat on and took himself off and mrs quilp who was afflicted beyond measure by the recollection of the part she had just acted shut herself up in her chamber and smothering her head in the bedclothes bemoaned her fault more bitterly than many less tenderhearted persons would have mourned a much greater offence for in the majority of cases conscience is an elastic and very flexible article which will bear a deal of stretching and adapt itself to a great variety of circumstances some people by prudent management and leaving it off piece by piece like a flannel waistcoat in warm weather even contrive in time to dispense with it altogether but there be others who can assume the garment and throw it off at pleasure and this being the greatest and most convenient improvement is the one most in vogue     chapter 7  fred said mr swiveller remember the once popular melody of begone dull care fan the sinking flame of hilarity with the wing of friendship and pass the rosy wine  mr richard swivellers apartments were in the neighbourhood of drury lane and in addition to this convenience of situation had the advantage of being over a tobacconists shop so that he was enabled to procure a refreshing sneeze at any time by merely stepping out upon the staircase and was saved the trouble and expense of maintaining a snuffbox it was in these apartments that mr swiveller made use of the expressions above recorded for the consolation and encouragement of his desponding friend and it may not be uninteresting or improper to remark that even these brief observations partook in a double sense of the figurative and poetical character of mr swivellers mind as the rosy wine was in fact represented by one glass of cold ginandwater which was replenished as occasion required from a bottle and jug upon the table and was passed from one to another in a scarcity of tumblers which as mr swivellers was a bachelors establishment may be acknowledged without a blush by a like pleasant fiction his single chamber was always mentioned in a plural number in its disengaged times the tobacconist had announced it in his window as apartments for a single gentleman and mr swiveller following up the hint never failed to speak of it as his rooms his lodgings or his chambers conveying to his hearers a notion of indefinite space and leaving their imaginations to wander through long suites of lofty halls at pleasure  in this flight of fancy mr swiveller was assisted by a deceptive piece of furniture in reality a bedstead but in semblance a bookcase which occupied a prominent situation in his chamber and seemed to defy suspicion and challenge inquiry there is no doubt that by day mr swiveller firmly believed this secret convenience to be a bookcase and nothing more that he closed his eyes to the bed resolutely denied the existence of the blankets and spurned the bolster from his thoughts no word of its real use no hint of its nightly service no allusion to its peculiar properties had ever passed between him and his most intimate friends implicit faith in the deception was the first article of his creed to be the friend of swiveller you must reject all circumstantial evidence all reason observation and experience and repose a blind belief in the bookcase it was his pet weakness and he cherished it  fred said mr swiveller finding that his former adjuration had been productive of no effect pass the rosy  young trent with an impatient gesture pushed the glass towards him and fell again in the the moody attitude from which he had been unwillingly roused  ill give you fred said his friend stirring the mixture a little sentiment appropriate to the occasion heres may the  pshaw interposed the other you worry me to death with your chattering you can be merry under any circumstances  why mr trent returned dick there is a proverb which talks about being merry and wise there are some people who can be merry and cant be wise and some who can be wise or think they can and cant be merry im one of the first sort if the proverbs a good un i suppose its better to keep to half of it than none at all events id rather be merry and not wise than like you neither one nor tother  bah muttered his friend peevishly  with all my heart said mr swiveller in the polite circles i believe this sort of thing isnt usually said to a gentleman in his own apartments but never mind that make yourself at home adding to this retort an observation to the effect that his friend appeared to be rather cranky in point of temper richards swiveller finished the rosy and applied himself to the composition of another glassful in which after tasting it with great relish he proposed a toast to an imaginary company  gentlemen ill give you if you please success to the ancient family of the swivellers and good luck to mr richard in particularmr richard gentlemen said dick with great emphasis who spends all his money on his friends and is bahd for his pains hear hear  dick said the other returning to his seat after having paced the room twice or thrice will you talk seriously for two minutes if i show you a way to make your fortune with very little trouble  youve shown me so many returned dick and nothing has come of any one of em but empty pockets  youll tell a different story of this one before a very long time is over said his companion drawing his chair to the table you saw my sister nell  what about her returned dick  she has a pretty face has she not  why certainly replied dick i must say for her that theres not any very strong family likeness between her and you  has she a pretty face repeated his friend impatiently  yes said dick she has a pretty face a very pretty face what of that  ill tell you returned his friend its very plain that the old man and i will remain at daggers drawn to the end of our lives and that i have nothing to expect from him you see that i suppose  a bat might see that with the sun shining said dick  its equally plain that the money which the old flintrot himfirst taught me to expect that i should share with her at his death will all be hers is it not  i should said it was replied dick unless the way in which i put the case to him made an impression it may have done so it was powerful fred here is a jolly old grandfatherthat was strong i thoughtvery friendly and natural did it strike you in that way  it didnt strike him returned the other so we neednt discuss it now look here nell is nearly fourteen  fine girl of her age but small observed richard swiveller parenthetically  if i am to go on be quiet for one minute returned trent fretting at the slight interest the other appeared to take in the conversation now im coming to the point  thats right said dick  the girl has strong affections and brought up as she has been may at her age be easily influenced and persuaded if i take her in hand i will be bound by a very little coaxing and threatening to bend her to my will not to beat about the bush for the advantages of the scheme would take a week to tell whats to prevent your marrying her  richard swiveller who had been looking over the rim of the tumbler while his companion addressed the foregoing remarks to him with great energy and earnestness of manner no sooner heard these words than he evinced the utmost consternation and with difficulty ejaculated the monosyllable  what  i say whats to prevent repeated the other with a steadiness of manner of the effect of which upon his companion he was well assured by long experience whats to prevent your marrying her  and she nearly fourteen cried dick  i dont mean marrying her nowreturned the brother angrily say in two years time in three in four does the old man look like a longliver  he dont look like it said dick shaking his head but these old peopletheres no trusting them fred theres an aunt of mind down in dorsetshire that was going to die when i was eight years old and hasnt kept her word yet theyre so aggravating so unprincipled so spitefulunless theres apoplexy in the family fred you cant calculate upon em and even then they deceive you just as often as not  look at the worst side of the question then said trent as steadily as before and keeping his eyes upon his friend suppose he lives  to be sure said dick theres the rub  i say resumed his friend suppose he lives and i persuaded or if the word sounds more feasible forced nell to a secret marriage with you what do you think would come of that  a family and an annual income of nothing to keep em on said richard swiveller after some reflection  i tell you returned the other with an increased earnestness which whether it were real or assumed had the same effect on his companion that he lives for her that his whole energies and thoughts are bound up in her that he would no more disinherit her for an act of disobedience than he would take me into his favour again for any act of obedience or virtue that i could possibly be guilty of he could not do it you or any other man with eyes in his head may see that if he chooses  it seems improbable certainly said dick musing  it seems improbable because it is improbable his friend returned if you would furnish him with an additional inducement to forgive you let there be an irreconcilable breach a most deadly quarrel between you and melet there be a pretense of such a thing i mean of courseand hell do fast enough as to nell constant dropping will wear away a stone you know you may trust to me as far as she is concerned so whether he lives or dies what does it come to  that you become the sole inheritor of the wealth of this rich old hunks that you and i spend it together and that you get into the bargain a beautiful young wife  i suppose theres no doubt about his being richsaid dick  doubt did you hear what he left fall the other day when we were there doubt what will you doubt next dick  it would be tedious to pursue the conversation through all its artful windings or to develope the gradual approaches by which the heart of richard swiveller was gained it is sufficient to know that vanity interest poverty and every spendthrift consideration urged him to look upon the proposal with favour and that where all other inducements were wanting the habitual carelessness of his disposition stepped in and still weighed down the scale on the same side to these impulses must be added the complete ascendancy which his friend had long been accustomed to exercise over himan ascendancy exerted in the beginning sorely at the expense of his friends vices and was in nine cases out of ten looked upon as his designing tempter when he was indeed nothing but his thoughtless lightheaded tool  the motives on the other side were something deeper than any which richard swiveller entertained or understood but these being left to their own development require no present elucidation the negotiation was concluded very pleasantly and mr swiveller was in the act of stating in flowery terms that he had no insurmountable objection to marrying anybody plentifully endowed with money or moveables who could be induced to take him when he was interrupted in his observations by a knock at the door and the consequent necessity of crying come in  the door was opened but nothing came in except a soapy arm and a strong gush of tobacco the gush of tobacco came from the shop downstairs and the soapy arm proceeded from the body of a servantgirl who being then and there engaged in cleaning the stars had just drawn it out of a warm pail to take in a letter which letter she now held in her hand proclaiming aloud with that quick perception of surnames peculiar to her class that it was for mister snivelling  dick looked rather pale and foolish when he glanced at the direction and still more so when he came to look at the inside observing that it was one of the inconveniences of being a ladys man and that it was very easy to talk as they had been talking but he had quite forgotten her  her who demanded trent  sophy wackles said dick  whos she  shes all my fancy painted her sir thats what she is said mr swiveller taking a long pull at the rosy and looking gravely at his friend shes lovely shes divine you know her  i remember said his companion carelessly what of her  why sir returned dick between miss sophia wackles and the humble individual who has now the honor to address you warm and tender sentiments have been engendered sentiments of the most honourable and inspiring kind the goddess diana sir that calls aloud for the chase is not more particular in her behavior than sophia wackles i can tell you that  am i to believe theres anything real in what you say demanded his friend you dont mean to say that any lovemaking has been going on  lovemaking yes promising no said dick there can be no action for breach thats one comfort ive never committed myself in writing fred  and whats in the letter pray  a reminder fred for tonighta small party of twenty making two hundred light fantastic toes in all supposing every lady and gentleman to have the proper complement it must go if its only to begin breaking off the affairill do it dont you be afraid i should like to know whether she left this herself if she did unconscious of any bar to her happiness its affecting fred  to solve this question mr swiveller summoned the handmaid and ascertained that miss sophy wackles had indeed left the letter with her own hands and that she had come accompanied for decorums sake no doubt by a younger miss wackles and that on learning that mr swiveller was at home and being requested to walk upstairs she was extremely shocked and professed that she would rather die mr swiveller heard this account with a degree of admiration not altogether consistent with the project in which he had just concurred but his friend attached very little importance to his behavior in this respect probably because he knew that he had influence sufficient to control richard swivellers proceedings in this or any other matter whenever he deemed it necessary for the advancement of his own purposes to exert it     chapter 8  business disposed of mr swiveller was inwardly reminded of its being nigh dinnertime and to the intent that his health might not be endangered by longer abstinence dispatched a message to the nearest eatinghouse requiring an immediate supply of boiled beef and greens for two with this demand however the eatinghouse having experience of its customer declined to comply churlishly sending back for answer that if mr swiveller stood in need of beef perhaps he would be so obliging as to come there and eat it bringing with him as grace before meat the amount of a certain small account which had long been outstanding not at all intimidated by this rebuff but rather sharpened in wits and appetite mr swiveller forwarded the same message to another and more distant eatinghouse adding to it by way of rider that the gentleman was induced to send so far not only by the great fame and popularity its beef had acquired but in consequence of the extreme toughness of the beef retailed at the obdurant cooks shop which rendered it quite unfit not merely for gentlemanly food but for any human consumption the good effect of this politic course was demonstrated by the speedy arrive of a small pewter pyramid curiously constructed of platters and covers whereof the boiledbeefplates formed the base and a foaming quartpot the apex the structure being resolved into its component parts afforded all things requisite and necessary for a hearty meal to which mr swiveller and his friend applied themselves with great keenness and enjoyment  may the present moment said dick sticking his fork into a large carbuncular potato be the worst of our lives i like the plan of sending em with the peel on theres a charm in drawing a potato from its native element if i may so express it to which the rich and powerful are strangers ah man wants but little here below nor wants that little long how true that itafter dinner  i hope the eatinghouse keeper will want but little and that he may not want that little long returned his companion but i suspect youve no means of paying for this  i shall be passing present and ill call said dick winking his eye significantly the waiters quite helpless the goods are gone fred and theres an end of it  in point of fact it would seem that the waiter felt this wholesome truth for when he returned for the empty plates and dishes and was informed by mr swiveller with dignified carelessness that he would call and settle when he should be passing presently he displayed some perturbation of spirit and muttered a few remarks about payment on delivery and no trust and other unpleasant subjects but was fain to content himself with inquiring at what hour it was likely that the gentleman would call in order that being presently responsible for the beef greens and sundries he might take to be in the way at the time mr swiveller after mentally calculating his engagements to a nicety replied that he should look in at from two minutes before six and seven minutes past and the man disappearing with this feeble consolation richards swiveller took a greasy memorandumbook from his pocket and made an entry therein  is that a reminder in case you should forget to call said trent with a sneer  not exactly fred replied the imperturbable richard continuing to write with a businesslike air i enter in this little book the names of the streets that i cant go down while the shops are open this dinner today closes long acre i bought a pair of boots in great queen street last week and made that no throughfare too theres only one avenue to the strand left often now and i shall have to stop up that tonight with a pair of gloves the roads are closing so fast in every direction that in a months time unless my aunt sends me a remittance i shall have to go three or four miles out of town to get over the way  theres no fear of failing in the end said trent  why i hope not returned mr swiveller but the average number of letters it take to soften her is six and this time we have got as far as eight without any effect at all ill write another tommorrow morning i mean to blot it a good deal and shake some water over it out of the peppercastor to make it look penitent im in such a state of mind that i hardly know what i writeblot if you could see me at this minute shedding tears for my past misconductpeppercastormy hand trembles when i thinkblot againif that dont produce the effect its all over  by this time mr swiveller had finished his entry and he now replaced his pencil in its little sheath and closed the book in a perfectly grave and serious frame of mind his friend discovered that it was time for him to fulfil some other engagement and richard swiveller was accordingly left alone in company with the rosy wine and his own meditations touching miss sophy wackles  its rather sudden said dick shaking his head with a look of infinite wisdom and running on as he was accustomed to do with scraps of verse as if they were only prose in a hurry when the heart of a man is depressed with fears the mist is dispelled when miss wackles appears shes a very nice girl shes like the red red rose thats newly sprung in junetheres no denying thatshes also like a melody thats sweetly played in tune its really very sudden not that theres any need on account of freds little sister to turn cool directly but its better not to go too far if i begin to cool at all i must begin at once i see that theres the chance of an action for breach thats another theres the chance ofno theres no chance of that but its as well to be on the safe side  this undeveloped was the possibility which richard swiveller sought to conceal even from himself of his not being proof against the charms of miss wackles and in some unguarded moment by linking his fortunes to hers forever of putting it out of his own power to further their notable scheme to which he had so readily become a party for all these reasons he decided to pick a quarrel with miss wackles without delay and casting about for a pretext determined in favour of groundless jealousy  having made up his mind on this important point he circulated the glass from his right hand to left and back again pretty freely to enable him to act his part with the greater discretion and then after making some slight improvements in his toilet bent his steps towards the spot hallowed by the fair object of his meditations  the spot was at chelsea for there miss sophia wackles resided with her widowed mother and two sisters in conjunction with whom she maintained a very small dayschool for young ladies of proportionate dimensions a circumstance which was made known to the neighbourhood by an oval board over the front firstfloor windows whereupon appeared in circumambient flourishes the words ladies seminary and which was further published and proclaimed at intervals between the hours of halfpast nine and ten in the morning by a straggling and solitary young lady of tender years standing on the scraper on the tips of her toes and making futile attempts to reach the knocker with spellingbook the several duties of instruction in this establishment were this discharged english grammar composition geography and the use of the dumbbells by miss melissa wackles writing arithmetic dancing music and general fascination by miss sophia wackles the art of needlework marking and samplery by miss jane wackles corporal punishment fasting and other tortures and terrors by mrs wackles miss melissa wackles was the eldest daughter miss sophy the next and miss jane the youngest miss melissa might have seen fiveandthirty summers or thereabouts and verged on the autumnal miss sophy was a fresh good humoured buxom girl of twenty and miss jane numbered scarcely sixteen years mrs wackles was an excellent but rather venomous old lady of threescore  to this ladies seminary then richard swiveller hied with designs obnoxious to the peace of the fair sophia who arrayed in virgin white embellished by no ornament but one blushing rose received him on his arrival in the midst of very elegant not to say brilliant preparations such as the embellishment of the room with the little flowerpots which always stood on the windowsill outside save in windy weather when they blew into the area the choice attire of the dayscholars who were allowed to grace the festival the unwonted curls of miss jane wackles who had kept her head during the whole of the preceding day screwed up tight in a yellow playbill and the solemn gentility and stately bearing of the old lady and her eldest daughter which struck mr swiveller as being uncommon but made no further impression upon him  the truth isand as there is no accounting for tastes even a taste so strange as this may be recorded without being looked upon as a wilful and malicious inventionthe truth is that neither mrs wackles nor her eldest daughter had at any time greatly favoured the pretensions of mr swiveller being accustomed to make slight mention of him as a gay young man and to sigh and shake their heads ominously whenever his name was mentioned mr swivellers conduct in respect to miss sophy having been of that vague and dilatory kind which is usually looked upon as betokening no fixed matrimonial intentions the young lady herself began in course of time to deem it highly desirable that it should be brought to an issue one way or other hence she had at last consented to play off against richard swiveller a stricken marketgardner known to be ready with his offer on the smallest encouragement and henceas this occasion had been specially assigned for the purposethat great anxiety on her part for richard swivellers presence which had occasioned her to leave the note he has ben seen to receive if he has any expectations at all or any means of keeping a wife well said mrs wackles to her eldest daughter hell state em to us now or neverif he really cares about me thought miss sophy he must tell me so tonight  but all these sayings and doings and thinkings being unknown to mr swiveller affected him not in the least he was debating in his mind how he could best turn jealous and wishing that sophy were for that occasion only far less pretty than she was or that she were her own sister which would have served his turn as well when the company came and among them the marketgardener whose name was cheggs but mr cheggs came not alone or unsupported for he prudently brought along with him his sister miss cheggs who making straight to miss sophy and taking her by both hands and kissing her on both cheeks hoped in an audible whisper that they had not come too early  too early no replied miss sophy  oh my dear rejoined miss cheggs in the same whisper as before ive been so tormented so worried that its a mercy we were not here at four oclock in the afternoon alick has been in such a state of impatience to come youd hardly believe that he was dressed before dinnertime and has been looking at the clock and teasing me ever since its all your fault you naughty thing  hereupon miss sophy blushed and mr cheggs who was bashful before ladies blushed too and miss sophys mother and sisters to prevent mr cheggs from blushing more lavished civilities and attentions upon him and left richard swiveller to take care of himself here was the very thing he wanted here was good cause reason and foundation for pretending to be angry but having this cause reason and foundation which he had come expressly to seek not expecting to find richard swiveller was angry in sound earnest and wondered what the devil cheggs meant by his impudence  however mr swiveller had miss sophys hand for the first quadrille countrydances being low were utterly proscribed and so gained an advantage over his rival who sat despondingly in a corner and contemplated the glorious figure of the young lady as she moved through the mazy dance nor was this the only start mr swiveller had of the marketgardener for determining to show the family what quality of man they trifled with and influenced perhaps by his late libations he performed such feats of agility and such spins and twirls as filled the company with astonishment and in particular caused a very long gentleman who was dancing with a very short scholar to stand quite transfixed by wonder and admiration even mrs wackles forgot for the moment to snub three small young ladies who were inclined to be happy and could not repress a rising thought that to have such a dancer as that in the family would be a pride indeed  at this momentous crisis miss cheggs proved herself a vigourous and useful ally for not confining herself to expressing by scornful smiles a contempt for mr swivellers accomplishments she took every opportunity of whispering into miss sophys ear expressions of condolence and sympathy on her being worried by such a ridiculous creature declaring that she was frightened to death lest alick should fall upon and beat him in the fulness of his wrath and entreating miss sophy to observe how the eyes of the said alick gleamed with love and fury passions it may be observed which being too much for his eyes rushed into his nose also and suffused it with a crimson glow  you must dance with miss chegs said miss sophy to dick swiviller after she had herself danced twice with mr cheggs and made great show of encouraging his advances shes a nice girland her brothers quite delightful  quite delightful is he muttered dick quite delighted too i should say from the manner in which hes looking this way  here miss jane previously instructed for the purpose interposed her many curls and whispered her sister to observe how jealous mr cheggs was  jealous like his impudence said richard swiviller  his impudence mr swiviller said miss jane tossing her head  take care he dont hear you sir or you may be sorry for it  oh pray jane said miss sophy  nonsense replied her sister why shouldnt mr cheggs be jealous if he likes i like that certainly mr cheggs has a good a right to be jealous as anyone else has and perhaps he may have a better right soon if he hasnt already you know best about that sophy  though this was a concerted plot between miss sophy and her sister originating in humane intentions and having for its object the inducing mr swiviller to declare himself in time it failed in its effect for miss jane being one of those young ladies who are prematurely shrill and shrewish gave such undue importance to her part that mr swiviller retired in dudgeon resigning his mistress to mr cheggs and conveying a defiance into his looks which that gentleman indignantly returned  did you speak to me sir said mr cheggs following him into a corner have the kindness to smile sir in order that we may not be suspected did you speak to me sir  mr swiviller looked with a supercilious smile at mr cheggs toes then raised his eyes from them to his ankles from that to his shin from that to his knee and so on very gradually keeping up his right leg until he reached his waistcoat when he raised his eyes from button to button until he reached his chin and travelling straight up the middle of his nose came at last to his eyes when he said abruptly  no sir i didnt  hem said mr cheggs glancing over his shoulder have the goodness to smile again sir perhaps you wished to speak to me sir  no sir i didnt do that either  perhaps you may have nothing to say to me now sir said mr cheggs fiercely  at these words richard swiviller withdrew his eyes from mr cheggs face and travelling down the middle of his nose and down his waistcoat and down his right leg reached his toes again and carefully surveyed him this done he crossed over and coming up the other leg and thence approaching by the waistcoat as before said when had got to his eyes no sir i havent  oh indeed sir said mr cheggs im glad to hear it you know where im to be found i suppose sir in case you should have anything to say to me  i can easily inquire sir when i want to know  theres nothing more we need say i believe sir  nothing more sirwith that they closed the tremendous dialog by frowning mutually mr cheggs hastened to tender his hand to miss sophy and mr swiviller sat himself down in a corner in a very moody state  hard by this corner mrs wackles and miss wackles were seated looking on at the dance and unto mrs and miss wackles miss cheggs occasionally darted when her partner was occupied with his share of the figure and made some remark or other which was gall and wormwood to richard swivillers soul looking into the eyes of mrs and miss wackles for encouragement and sitting very upright and uncomfortable on a couple of hard stools were two of the dayscholars and when miss wackles smiled and mrs wackles smiled the two little girls on the stools sought to curry favour by smiling likewise in gracious acknowledgement of which attention the old lady frowned them down instantly and said that if they dared to be guilty of such an impertinence again they should be sent under convoy to their respective homes this threat caused one of the young ladies she being of a weak and trembling temperament to shed tears and for this offense they were both filed off immediately with a dreadful promptitude that struck terror into the souls of all the pupils  ive got such news for you said miss cheggs approaching once more alick has been saying such things to sophy upon my word you know its quite serious and in earnest thats clear  whats he been saying my dear demanded mrs wackles  all manner of things replied miss cheggs you cant think how out he has been speaking  richard swiviller considered it advisable to hear no more but taking advantage of a pause in the dancing and the approach of mr cheggs to pay his court to the old lady swaggered with an extremely careful assumption of extreme carelessness toward the door passing on the way miss jane wackles who in all the glory of her curls was holding a flirtation as good practice when no better was to be had with a feeble old gentleman who lodged in the parlour near the door sat miss sophy still fluttered and confused by the attentions of mr cheggs and by her side richard swiveller lingered for a moment to exchange a few parting words  my boat is on the shore and my bark is on the sea but before i pass this door i will say farewell to thee murmured dick looking gloomily upon her  are you going said miss sophy whose heart sank within her at the result of her stratagem but who affected a light indifference notwithstanding  am i going echoed dick bitterly yes i am what then  nothing except that its very early said miss sophy but you are your own master of course  i would that i had been my own mistress too said dick before i had ever entertained a thought of you miss wackles i believed you true and i was blest in so believing but now i mourn that eer i knew a girl so fair yet so deceiving  miss sophy bit her lip and affected to look with great interest after mr cheggs who was quaffing lemonade in the distance  i came here said dick rather oblivious of the purpose with which he had really come with my bosom expanded my heart dilated and my sentiments of a corresponding description i go away with feelings that may be conceived but cannot be described feeling within myself that desolating truth that my best affections have experienced this night a stifler  i am sure i dont know what you mean mr swiviller said miss sophy with downcast eyes im very sorry if  sorry maam said dick sorry in the possession of a cheegs but i wish you a very good night concluding with this slight remark that there is a young lady growing up at this present moment for me who has not only great personal attractions but great wealth and who has requested her next of kin to propose for my hand which having a regard for some members of her family i have consented to promise its a gratifying circumstance which youll be glad to hear that a young and lovely girl is growing into a woman expressly on my account and is now saving up for me i thought id mention it i have now merely to apologize for trespassing so long upon your attention good night  theres one good thing springs out of all this said richard swiviller to himself when he had reached home and was hanging over the candle with the extinguisher in his hand which is that i now go heart and soul neck and heels with fred in all his scheme about little nelly and right glad hell be to find me so strong upon it he shall know all about that tomorrow and in the mean time as its rather late ill try and get a wink of the balmy  the balmy came almost as soon as it was courted in a very few minutes mr swiviller was fast asleep dreaming that he had married nelly trent and come into the property and that his first act of power was to lay waste the marketgarden of mr cheggs and turn it into a brickfield     chapter 9  the child in her confidence with mrs quilp had but feebly described the sadness and sorrow of her thoughts or the heaviness of the cloud which overhung her home and cast dark shadows on its hearth  besides that it was very difficult to impart to any person not intimately acquainted with the life she led an adequate sense of its gloom and loneliness a constant fear of in some way committing or injuring the old man to whom she was so tenderly attached had restrained her even in the midst of her hearts overflowing and made her timid of allusion to the main cause of her anxiety and distress  for it was not the monotonous days unchequered by variety and uncheered by pleasant companionship it was not the dark dreary evenings or the long solitary nights it was not the absence of every slight and easy pleasure for which young hearts beat high or the knowing nothing of childhood but its weakness and its easily wounded spirit that had wrung such tears from nell  to see the old man struck down beneath the pressure of some hidden grief to mark his wavering and unsettled state to be agitated at times with a dreadful fear that his mind was wandering and to trace in his words and looks the dawning of despondent madness to watch and wait and listen for confirmation of these things day after day and to feel and know that come what might they were alone in the world with no one to help or advise or care about themthese were causes of depression and anxiety that might have sat heavily on an older breast with many influences at work to cheer and gladden it but how heavily on the mind of a young child to whom they were ever present and who was constantly surrounded by all that could keep such thoughts in restless action  and yet to the old mans vision nell was still the same  when he could for a moment disengage his mind from the phantom that haunted and brooded on it always there was his young companion with the same smile for him the same earnest words the same merry laugh the same love and care that sinking deep into his soul seemed to have been present to him through his whole life  and so he went on content to read the book of her heart from the page first presented to him little dreaming of the story that lay hidden in its other leaves and murmuring within himself that at least the child was happy  she had been once  she had gone singing through the dim rooms and moving with gay and lightsome step among their dusty treasures making them older by her young life and sterner and more grim by her gay and cheerful presence  but now the chambers were cold and gloomy and when she left her own little room to while away the tedious hours and sat in one of them she was still and motionless as their inanimate occupants and had no heart to startle the echoeshoarse from their long silencewith her voice  in one of these rooms was a window looking into the street where the child sat many and many a long evening and often far into the night alone and thoughtful  none are so anxious as those who watch and wait at these times mournful fancies came flocking on her mind in crowds  she would take her station here at dusk and watch the people as they passed up and down the street or appeared at the windows of the opposite houses wondering whether those rooms were as lonesome as that in which she sat and whether those people felt it company to see her sitting there as she did only to see them look out and draw in their heads again  there was a crooked stack of chimneys on one of the roofs in which by often looking at them she had fancied ugly faces that were frowning over at her and trying to peer into the room and she felt glad when it grew too dark to make them out though she was sorry too when the man came to light the lamps in the streetfor it made it late and very dull inside  then she would draw in her head to look round the room and see that everything was in its place and hadnt moved and looking out into the street again would perhaps see a man passing with a coffin on his back and two or three others silently following him to a house where somebody lay dead which made her shudder and think of such things until they suggested afresh the old mans altered face and manner and a new train of fears and speculations  if he were to dieif sudden illness had happened to him and he were never to come home again aliveif one night he should come home and kiss and bless her as usual and after she had gone to bed and had fallen asleep and was perhaps dreaming pleasantly and smiling in her sleep he should kill himself and his blood come creeping creeping on the ground to her own bedroom door  these thoughts were too terrible to dwell upon and again she would have recourse to the street now trodden by fewer feet and darker and more silent than before  the shops were closing fast and lights began to shine from the upper windows as the neighbours went to bed  by degrees these dwindled away and disappeared or were replaced here and there by a feeble rushcandle which was to burn all night  still there was one late shop at no great distance which sent forth a ruddy glare upon the pavement even yet and looked bright and companionable but in a little time this closed the light was extinguished and all was gloomy and quiet except when some stray footsteps sounded on the pavement or a neighbour out later than his wont knocked lustily at his housedoor to rouse the sleeping inmates  when the night had worn away thus far and seldom now until it had the child would close the window and steal softly down stairs thinking as she went that if one of those hideous faces below which often mingled with her dreams were to meet her by the way rendering itself visible by some strange light of its own how terrified she would be  but these fears vanished before a welltrimmed lamp and the familiar aspect of her own room  after praying fervently and with many bursting tears for the old man and the restoration of his peace of mind and the happiness they had once enjoyed she would lay her head upon the pillow and sob herself to sleep often starting up again before the daylight came to listen for the bell and respond to the imaginary summons which had roused her from her slumber  one night the third after nellys interview with mrs quilp the old man who had been weak and ill all day said he should not leave home the childs eyes sparkled at the intelligence but her joy subsided when they reverted to his worn and sickly face  two days he said two whole clear days have passed and there is no reply  what did he tell thee nell  exactly what i told you dear grandfather indeed  true said the old man faintly  yes  but tell me again nell  my head fails me  what was it that he told thee  nothing more than that he would see me tomorrow or next day  that was in the note  nothing more said the child  shall i go to him again tomorrow dear grandfather  very early  i will be there and back before breakfast  the old man shook his head and sighing mournfully drew her towards him  twould be of no use my dear no earthly use  but if he deserts me nell at this momentif he deserts me now when i should with his assistance be recompensed for all the time and money i have lost and all the agony of mind i have undergone which makes me what you see i am ruined andworse far worse than thathave ruined thee for whom i ventured all  if we are beggars  what if we are said the child boldly  let us be beggars and be happy  beggarsand happy said the old man  poor child  dear grandfather cried the girl with an energy which shone in her flushed face trembling voice and impassioned gesture i am not a child in that i think but even if i am oh hear me pray that we may beg or work in open roads or fields to earn a scanty living rather than live as we do now  nelly said the old man  yes yes rather than live as we do now the child repeated more earnestly than before  if you are sorrowful let me know why and be sorrowful too if you waste away and are paler and weaker every day let me be your nurse and try to comfort you  if you are poor let us be poor together but let me be with you do let me be with you do not let me see such change and not know why or i shall break my heart and die  dear grandfather let us leave this sad place tomorrow and beg our way from door to door  the old man covered his face with his hands and hid it in the pillow of the couch on which he lay  let us be beggars said the child passing an arm round his neck i have no fear but we shall have enough i am sure we shall  let us walk through country places and sleep in fields and under trees and never think of money again or anything that can make you sad but rest at nights and have the sun and wind upon our faces in the day and thank god together  let us never set foot in dark rooms or melancholy houses any more but wander up and down wherever we like to go and when you are tired you shall stop to rest in the pleasantest place that we can find and i will go and beg for both  the childs voice was lost in sobs as she dropped upon the old mans neck nor did she weep alone  these were not words for other ears nor was it a scene for other eyes and yet other ears and eyes were there and greedily taking in all that passed and moreover they were the ears and eyes of no less a person than mr daniel quilp who having entered unseen when the child first placed herself at the old mans side refrainedactuated no doubt by motives of the purest delicacyfrom interrupting the conversation and stood looking on with his accustomed grin  standing however being a tiresome attitude to a gentleman already fatigued with walking and the dwarf being one of that kind of persons who usually make themselves at home he soon cast his eyes upon a chair into which he skipped with uncommon agility and perching himself on the back with his feet upon the seat was thus enabled to look on and listen with greater comfort to himself besides gratifying at the same time that taste for doing something fantastic and monkeylike which on all occasions had strong possession of him  here then he sat one leg cocked carelessly over the other his chin resting on the palm of his hand his head turned a little on one side and his ugly features twisted into a complacent grimace  and in this position the old man happening in course of time to look that way at length chanced to see him to his unbounded astonishment  the child uttered a suppressed shriek on beholding this agreeable figure in their first surprise both she and the old man not knowing what to say and half doubting its reality looked shrinkingly at it not at all disconcerted by this reception daniel quilp preserved the same attitude merely nodding twice or thrice with great condescension at length the old man pronounced his name and inquired how he came there  through the door said quilp pointing over his shoulder with his thumb  im not quite small enough to get through keyholes  i wish i was  i want to have some talk with you particularly and in private with nobody present neighbour  goodbye little nelly  nell looked at the old man who nodded to her to retire and kissed her cheek  ah said the dwarf smacking his lips what a nice kiss that wasjust upon the rosy part  what a capital kiss  nell was none the slower in going away for this remark  quilp looked after her with an admiring leer and when she had closed the door fell to complimenting the old man upon her charms  such a fresh blooming modest little bud neighbour said quilp nursing his short leg and making his eyes twinkle very much such a chubby rosy cosy little nell  the old man answered by a forced smile and was plainly struggling with a feeling of the keenest and most exquisite impatience  it was not lost upon quilp who delighted in torturing him or indeed anybody else when he could  shes so said quilp speaking very slowly and feigning to be quite absorbed in the subject so small so compact so beautifully modelled so fair with such blue veins and such a transparent skin and such little feet and such winning waysbut bless me youre nervous  why neighbour whats the matter  i swear to you continued the dwarf dismounting from the chair and sitting down in it with a careful slowness of gesture very different from the rapidity with which he had sprung up unheard i swear to you that i had no idea old blood ran so fast or kept so warm  i thought it was sluggish in its course and cool quite cool  i am pretty sure it ought to be  yours must be out of order neighbour  i believe it is groaned the old man clasping his head with both hands  theres burning fever here and something now and then to which i fear to give a name  the dwarf said never a word but watched his companion as he paced restlessly up and down the room and presently returned to his seat here he remained with his head bowed upon his breast for some time and then suddenly raising it said  once and once for all have you brought me any money  no returned quilp  then said the old man clenching his hands desperately and looking upwards the child and i are lost  neighbour said quilp glancing sternly at him and beating his hand twice or thrice upon the table to attract his wandering attention let me be plain with you and play a fairer game than when you held all the cards and i saw but the backs and nothing more  you have no secret from me now  the old man looked up trembling  you are surprised said quilp  well perhaps thats natural  you have no secret from me now i say no not one  for now i know that all those sums of money that all those loans advances and supplies that you have had from me have found their way toshall i say the word  aye replied the old man say it if you will  to the gamingtable rejoined quilp your nightly haunt  this was the precious scheme to make your fortune was it this was the secret certain source of wealth in which i was to have sunk my money if i had been the fool you took me for this was your inexhaustible mine of gold your el dorado eh  yes cried the old man turning upon him with gleaming eyes it was it is  it will be till i die  that i should have been blinded said quilp looking contemptuously at him by a mere shallow gambler  i am no gambler cried the old man fiercely  i call heaven to witness that i never played for gain of mine or love of play that at every piece i staked i whispered to myself that orphans name and called on heaven to bless the venturewhich it never did  whom did it prosper  who were those with whom i played  men who lived by plunder profligacy and riot squandering their gold in doing ill and propagating vice and evil  my winnings would have been from them my winnings would have been bestowed to the last farthing on a young sinless child whose life they would have sweetened and made happy what would they have contracted  the means of corruption wretchedness and misery  who would not have hoped in such a cause tell me that  who would not have hoped as i did  when did you first begin this mad career asked quilp his taunting inclination subdued for a moment by the old mans grief and wildness  when did i first begin he rejoined passing his hand across his brow  when was it that i first began  when should it be but when i began to think how little i had saved how long a time it took to save at all how short a time i might have at my age to live and how she would be left to the rough mercies of the world with barely enough to keep her from the sorrows that wait on poverty then it was that i began to think about it  after you first came to me to get your precious grandson packed off to sea said quilp  shortly after that replied the old man  i thought of it a long time and had it in my sleep for months  then i began  i found no pleasure in it i expected none  what has it ever brought me but anxious days and sleepless nights but loss of health and peace of mind and gain of feebleness and sorrow  you lost what money you had laid by first and then came to me while i thought you were making your fortune as you said you were you were making yourself a beggar eh  dear me  and so it comes to pass that i hold every security you could scrape together and a bill of sale upon theupon the stock and property said quilp standing up and looking about him as if to assure himself that none of it had been taken away  but did you never win  never groaned the old man  never won back my loss  i thought sneered the dwarf that if a man played long enough he was sure to win at last or at the worst not to come off a loser  and so he is cried the old man suddenly rousing himself from his state of despondency and lashed into the most violent excitement so he is i have felt that from the first i have always known it ive seen it i never felt it half so strongly as i feel it now  quilp i have dreamed three nights of winning the same large sum i never could dream that dream before though i have often tried  do not desert me now i have this chance  i have no resource but you give me some help let me try this one last hope  the dwarf shrugged his shoulders and shook his head  see quilp good tenderhearted quilp said the old man drawing some scraps of paper from his pocket with a trembling hand and clasping the dwarfs arm only see here  look at these figures the result of long calculation and painful and hard experience  i must win  i only want a little help once more a few pounds but two score pounds dear quilp  the last advance was seventy said the dwarf and it went in one night  i know it did answered the old man but that was the very worst fortune of all and the time had not come then  quilp consider consider the old man cried trembling so much the while that the papers in his hand fluttered as if they were shaken by the wind that orphan child  if i were alone i could die with gladnessperhaps even anticipate that doom which is dealt out so unequally coming as it does on the proud and happy in their strength and shunning the needy and afflicted and all who court it in their despairbut what i have done has been for her  help me for her sake i implore you not for mine for hers  im sorry ive got an appointment in the city said quilp looking at his watch with perfect selfpossession or i should have been very glad to have spent half an hour with you while you composed yourself very glad  nay quilp good quilp gasped the old man catching at his skirts you and i have talked together more than once of her poor mothers story  the fear of her coming to poverty has perhaps been bred in me by that  do not be hard upon me but take that into account  you are a great gainer by me  oh spare me the money for this one last hope  i couldnt do it really said quilp with unusual politeness though i tell you whatand this is a circumstance worth bearing in mind as showing how the sharpest among us may be taken in sometimesi was so deceived by the penurious way in which you lived alone with nelly  all done to save money for tempting fortune and to make her triumph greater cried the old man  yes yes i understand that now said quilp but i was going to say i was so deceived by that your miserly way the reputation you had among those who knew you of being rich and your repeated assurances that you would make of my advances treble and quadruple the interest you paid me that id have advanced you even now what you want on your simple note of hand if i hadnt unexpectedly become acquainted with your secret way of life  who is it retorted the old man desperately that notwithstanding all my caution told you  come  let me know the namethe person  the crafty dwarf bethinking himself that his giving up the child would lead to the disclosure of the artifice he had employed which as nothing was to be gained by it it was well to conceal stopped short in his answer and said now who do you think  it was kit it must have been the boy he played the spy and you tampered with him said the old man  how came you to think of him said the dwarf in a tone of great commiseration  yes it was kit  poor kit  so saying he nodded in a friendly manner and took his leave stopping when he had passed the outer door a little distance and grinning with extraordinary delight  poor kit muttered quilp  i think it was kit who said i was an uglier dwarf than could be seen anywhere for a penny wasnt it  ha ha ha  poor kit  and with that he went his way still chuckling as he went     chapter 10  daniel quilp neither entered nor left the old mans house unobserved in the shadow of an archway nearly opposite leading to one of the many passages which diverged from the main street there lingered one who having taken up his position when the twilight first came on still maintained it with undiminished patience and leaning against the wall with the manner of a person who had a long time to wait and being well used to it was quite resigned scarcely changed his attitude for the hour together  this patient lounger attracted little attention from any of those who passed and bestowed as little upon them  his eyes were constantly directed towards one object the window at which the child was accustomed to sit  if he withdrew them for a moment it was only to glance at a clock in some neighbouring shop and then to strain his sight once more in the old quarter with increased earnestness and attention  it had been remarked that this personage evinced no weariness in his place of concealment nor did he long as his waiting was  but as the time went on he manifested some anxiety and surprise glancing at the clock more frequently and at the window less hopefully than before  at length the clock was hidden from his sight by some envious shutters then the church steeples proclaimed eleven at night then the quarter past and then the conviction seemed to obtrude itself on his mind that it was no use tarrying there any longer  that the conviction was an unwelcome one and that he was by no means willing to yield to it was apparent from his reluctance to quit the spot from the tardy steps with which he often left it still looking over his shoulder at the same window and from the precipitation with which he as often returned when a fancied noise or the changing and imperfect light induced him to suppose it had been softly raised  at length he gave the matter up as hopeless for that night and suddenly breaking into a run as though to force himself away scampered off at his utmost speed nor once ventured to look behind him lest he should be tempted back again  without relaxing his pace or stopping to take breath this mysterious individual dashed on through a great many alleys and narrow ways until he at length arrived in a square paved court when he subsided into a walk and making for a small house from the window of which a light was shining lifted the latch of the door and passed in  bless us cried a woman turning sharply round whos that  oh its you kit  yes mother its me  why how tired you look my dear  old master ant gone out tonight said kit and so she hasnt been at the window at all  with which words he sat down by the fire and looked very mournful and discontented  the room in which kit sat himself down in this condition was an extremely poor and homely place but with that air of comfort about it nevertheless whichor the spot must be a wretched one indeedcleanliness and order can always impart in some degree  late as the dutch clock showed it to be the poor woman was still hard at work at an ironingtable a young child lay sleeping in a cradle near the fire and another a sturdy boy of two or three years old very wide awake with a very tight nightcap on his head and a nightgown very much too small for him on his body was sitting bolt upright in a clothesbasket staring over the rim with his great round eyes and looking as if he had thoroughly made up his mind never to go to sleep any more which as he had already declined to take his natural rest and had been brought out of bed in consequence opened a cheerful prospect for his relations and friends  it was rather a queerlooking family kit his mother and the children being all strongly alike  kit was disposed to be out of temper as the best of us are too oftenbut he looked at the youngest child who was sleeping soundly and from him to his other brother in the clothesbasket and from him to their mother who had been at work without complaint since morning and thought it would be a better and kinder thing to be goodhumoured so he rocked the cradle with his foot made a face at the rebel in the clothesbasket which put him in high goodhumour directly and stoutly determined to be talkative and make himself agreeable  ah mother said kit taking out his claspknife and falling upon a great piece of bread and meat which she had had ready for him hours before what a one you are  there ant many such as you i know  i hope there are many a great deal better kit said mrs nubbles and that there are or ought to be accordin to what the parson at chapel says  much he knows about it returned kit contemptuously  wait till hes a widder and works like you do and gets as little and does as much and keeps his spirit up the same and then ill ask him whats oclock and trust him for being right to half a second  well said mrs nubbles evading the point your beers down there by the fender kit  i see replied her son taking up the porter pot my love to you mother  and the parsons health too if you like  i dont bear him any malice not i  did you tell me just now that your master hadnt gone out tonight inquired mrs nubbles  yes said kit worse luck  you should say better luck i think returned his mother because miss nelly wont have been left alone  ah said kit i forgot that  i said worse luck because ive been watching ever since eight oclock and seen nothing of her  i wonder what shed say cried his mother stopping in her work and looking round if she knew that every night when shepoor thingis sitting alone at that window you are watching in the open street for fear any harm should come to her and that you never leave the place or come home to your bed though youre ever so tired till such time as you think shes safe in hers  never mind what shed say replied kit with something like a blush on his uncouth face shell never know nothing and consequently shell never say nothing  mrs nubbles ironed away in silence for a minute or two and coming to the fireplace for another iron glanced stealthily at kit while she rubbed it on a board and dusted it with a duster but said nothing until she had returned to her table again when holding the iron at an alarmingly short distance from her cheek to test its temperature and looking round with a smile she observed  i know what some people would say kit  nonsense interposed kit with a perfect apprehension of what was to follow  no but they would indeed  some people would say that youd fallen in love with her i know they would  to this kit only replied by bashfully bidding his mother get out and forming sundry strange figures with his legs and arms accompanied by sympathetic contortions of his face  not deriving from these means the relief which he sought he bit off an immense mouthful from the bread and meat and took a quick drink of the porter by which artificial aids he choked himself and effected a diversion of the subject  speaking seriously though kit said his mother taking up the theme afresh after a time for of course i was only in joke just now its very good and thoughtful and like you to do this and never let anybody know it though some day i hope she may come to know it for im sure she would be very grateful to you and feel it very much  its a cruel thing to keep the dear child shut up there  i dont wonder that the old gentleman wants to keep it from you  he dont think its cruel bless you said kit and dont mean it to be so or he wouldnt do iti do consider mother that he wouldnt do it for all the gold and silver in the world  no no that he wouldnt i know him better than that  then what does he do it for and why does he keep it so close from you said mrs nubbles  that i dont know returned her son  if he hadnt tried to keep it so close though i should never have found it out for it was his getting me away at night and sending me off so much earlier than he used to that first made me curious to know what was going on  hark whats that  its only somebody outside  its somebody crossing over here said kit standing up to listen and coming very fast too  he cant have gone out after i left and the house caught fire mother  the boy stood for a moment really bereft by the apprehension he had conjured up of the power to move  the footsteps drew nearer the door was opened with a hasty hand and the child herself pale and breathless and hastily wrapped in a few disordered garments hurried into the room  miss nelly  what is the matter cried mother and son together  i must not stay a moment she returned grandfather has been taken very ill  i found him in a fit upon the floor  ill run for a doctorsaid kit seizing his brimless hat  ill be there directly ill  no no cried nell there is one there youre not wanted youyoumust never come near us any more  what roared kit  never again said the child  dont ask me why for i dont know pray dont ask me why pray dont be sorry pray dont be vexed with me  i have nothing to do with it indeed  kit looked at her with his eyes stretched wide and opened and shut his mouth a great many times but couldnt get out one word  he complains and raves of you said the child i dont know what you have done but i hope its nothing very bad  i done roared kit  he cries that youre the cause of all his misery returned the child with tearful eyes he screamed and called for you they say you must not come near him or he will die  you must not return to us any more i came to tell you  i thought it would be better that i should come than somebody quite strange  oh kit what have you done  you in whom i trusted so much and who were almost the only friend i had  the unfortunate kit looked at his young mistress harder and harder and with eyes growing wider and wider but was perfectly motionless and silent  i have brought his money for the week said the child looking to the woman and laying it on the tableandanda little more for he was always good and kind to me  i hope he will be sorry and do well somewhere else and not take this to heart too much  it grieves me very much to part with him like this but there is no help  it must be done  good night  with the tears streaming down her face and her slight figure trembling with the agitation of the scene she had left the shock she had received the errand she had just discharged and a thousand painful and affectionate feelings the child hastened to the door and disappeared as rapidly as she had come  the poor woman who had no cause to doubt her son but every reason for relying on his honesty and truth was staggered notwithstanding by his not having advanced one word in his defence  visions of gallantry knavery robbery and of the nightly absences from home for which he had accounted so strangely having been occasioned by some unlawful pursuit flocked into her brain and rendered her afraid to question him  she rocked herself upon a chair wringing her hands and weeping bitterly but kit made no attempt to comfort her and remained quite bewildered  the baby in the cradle woke up and cried the boy in the clothesbasket fell over on his back with the basket upon him and was seen no more the mother wept louder yet and rocked faster but kit insensible to all the din and tumult remained in a state of utter stupefaction     chapter 11  quiet and solitude were destined to hold uninterrupted rule no longer beneath the roof that sheltered the child  next morning the old man was in a raging fever accompanied with delirium and sinking under the influence of this disorder he lay for many weeks in imminent peril of his life  there was watching enough now but it was the watching of strangers who made a greedy trade of it and who in the intervals in their attendance upon the sick man huddled together with a ghastly goodfellowship and ate and drank and made merry for disease and death were their ordinary household gods  yet in all the hurry and crowding of such a time the child was more alone than she had ever been before alone in spirit alone in her devotion to him who was wasting away upon his burning bed alone in her unfeigned sorrow and her unpurchased sympathy  day after day and night after night found her still by the pillow of the unconscious sufferer still anticipating his every want still listening to those repetitions of her name and those anxieties and cares for her which were ever uppermost among his feverish wanderings  the house was no longer theirs  even the sick chamber seemed to be retained on the uncertain tenure of mr quilps favour  the old mans illness had not lasted many days when he took formal possession of the premises and all upon them in virtue of certain legal powers to that effect which few understood and none presumed to call in question this important step secured with the assistance of a man of law whom he brought with him for the purpose the dwarf proceeded to establish himself and his coadjutor in the house as an assertion of his claim against all comers and then set about making his quarters comfortable after his own fashion  to this end mr quilp encamped in the back parlour having first put an effectual stop to any further business by shutting up the shop  having looked out from among the old furniture the handsomest and most commodious chair he could possibly find which he reserved for his own use and an especially hideous and uncomfortable one which he considerately appropriated to the accommodation of his friend he caused them to be carried into this room and took up his position in great state  the apartment was very far removed from the old mans chamber but mr quilp deemed it prudent as a precaution against infection from fever and a means of wholesome fumigation not only to smoke himself without cessation but to insist upon it that his legal friend did the like  moreover he sent an express to the wharf for the tumbling boy who arriving with all despatch was enjoined to sit himself down in another chair just inside the door continually to smoke a great pipe which the dwarf had provided for the purpose and to take it from his lips under any pretence whatever were it only for one minute at a time if he dared  these arrangements completed mr quilp looked round him with chuckling satisfaction and remarked that he called that comfort  the legal gentleman whose melodious name was brass might have called it comfort also but for two drawbacks one was that he could by no exertion sit easy in his chair the seat of which was very hard angular slippery and sloping the other that tobaccosmoke always caused him great internal discomposure and annoyance  but as he was quite a creature of mr quilps and had a thousand reasons for conciliating his good opinion he tried to smile and nodded his acquiescence with the best grace he could assume  this brass was an attorney of no very good repute from bevis marks in the city of london he was a tall meagre man with a nose like a wen a protruding forehead retreating eyes and hair of a deep red  he wore a long black surtout reaching nearly to his ankles short black trousers high shoes and cotton stockings of a bluish grey  he had a cringing manner but a very harsh voice and his blandest smiles were so extremely forbidding that to have had his company under the least repulsive circumstances one would have wished him to be out of temper that he might only scowl  quilp looked at his legal adviser and seeing that he was winking very much in the anguish of his pipe that he sometimes shuddered when he happened to inhale its full flavour and that he constantly fanned the smoke from him was quite overjoyed and rubbed his hands with glee  smoke away you dog said quilp turning to the boy fill your pipe again and smoke it fast down to the last whiff or ill put the sealingwaxed end of it in the fire and rub it red hot upon your tongue  luckily the boy was casehardened and would have smoked a small limekiln if anybody had treated him with it  wherefore he only muttered a brief defiance of his master and did as he was ordered  is it good brass is it nice is it fragrant do you feel like the grand turk said quilp  mr brass thought that if he did the grand turks feelings were by no means to be envied but he said it was famous and he had no doubt he felt very like that potentate  this is the way to keep off fever said quilp this is the way to keep off every calamity of life  well never leave off all the time we stop heresmoke away you dog or you shall swallow the pipe  shall we stop here long mr quilp inquired his legal friend when the dwarf had given his boy this gentle admonition  we must stop i suppose till the old gentleman up stairs is dead returned quilp  he he he laughed mr brass oh very good  smoke away cried quilp  never stop  you can talk as you smoke dont lose time  he he he cried brass faintly as he again applied himself to the odious pipe  but if he should get better mr quilp  then we shall stop till he does and no longer returned the dwarf  how kind it is of you sir to wait till then said brass  some people sir would have sold or removed the goodsoh dear the very instant the law allowed em  some people sir would have been all flintiness and granite  some people sir would have  some people would have spared themselves the jabbering of such a parrot as you interposed the dwarf  he he he cried brass  you have such spirits  the smoking sentinel at the door interposed in this place and without taking his pipe from his lips growled  heres the gal a comin down  the what you dog said quilp  the gal returned the boy  are you deaf  oh said quilp drawing in his breath with great relish as if he were taking soup you and i will have such a settling presently theres such a scratching and bruising in store for you my dear young friend aha nelly  how is he now my duck of diamonds  hes very bad replied the weeping child  what a pretty little nell cried quilp  oh beautiful sir beautiful indeed said brass  quite charming  has she come to sit upon quilps knee said the dwarf in what he meant to be a soothing tone or is she going to bed in her own little room inside here  which is poor nelly going to do  what a remarkable pleasant way he has with children muttered brass as if in confidence between himself and the ceiling upon my word its quite a treat to hear him  im not going to stay at all faltered nell  i want a few things out of that room and then iiwont come down here any more  and a very nice little room it is said the dwarf looking into it as the child entered  quite a bower  youre sure youre not going to use it youre sure youre not coming back nelly  no replied the child hurrying away with the few articles of dress she had come to remove never again  never again  shes very sensitive said quilp looking after her  very sensitive thats a pity  the bedstead is much about my size  i think i shall make it my little room  mr brass encouraging this idea as he would have encouraged any other emanating from the same source the dwarf walked in to try the effect this he did by throwing himself on his back upon the bed with his pipe in his mouth and then kicking up his legs and smoking violently  mr brass applauding this picture very much and the bed being soft and comfortable mr quilp determined to use it both as a sleeping place by night and as a kind of divan by day and in order that it might be converted to the latter purpose at once remained where he was and smoked his pipe out  the legal gentleman being by this time rather giddy and perplexed in his ideas for this was one of the operations of the tobacco on his nervous system took the opportunity of slinking away into the open air where in course of time he recovered sufficiently to return with a countenance of tolerable composure  he was soon led on by the malicious dwarf to smoke himself into a relapse and in that state stumbled upon a settee where he slept till morning  such were mr quilps first proceedings on entering upon his new property  he was for some days restrained by business from performing any particular pranks as his time was pretty well occupied between taking with the assistance of mr brass a minute inventory of all the goods in the place and going abroad upon his other concerns which happily engaged him for several hours at a time  his avarice and caution being now thoroughly awakened however he was never absent from the house one night and his eagerness for some termination good or bad to the old mans disorder increasing rapidly as the time passed by soon began to vent itself in open murmurs and exclamations of impatience  nell shrank timidly from all the dwarfs advances towards conversation and fled from the very sound of his voice nor were the lawyers smiles less terrible to her than quilps grimaces  she lived in such continual dread and apprehension of meeting one or other of them on the stairs or in the passages if she stirred from her grandfathers chamber that she seldom left it for a moment until late at night when the silence encouraged her to venture forth and breathe the purer air of some empty room  one night she had stolen to her usual window and was sitting there very sorrowfullyfor the old man had been worse that daywhen she thought she heard her name pronounced by a voice in the street looking down she recognised kit whose endeavours to attract her attention had roused her from her sad reflections  miss nell said the boy in a low voice  yes replied the child doubtful whether she ought to hold any communication with the supposed culprit but inclining to her old favourite still what do you want  i have wanted to say a word to you for a long time the boy replied but the people below have driven me away and wouldnt let me see you you dont believei hope you dont really believethat i deserve to be cast off as i have been do you miss  i must believe it returned the child  or why would grandfather have been so angry with you  i dont know replied kit  im sure i never deserved it from him no nor from you  i can say that with a true and honest heart any way  and then to be driven from the door when i only came to ask how old master was  they never told me that said the child  i didnt know it indeed i wouldnt have had them do it for the world  thankee miss returned kit its comfortable to hear you say that i said i never would believe that it was your doing that was right said the child eagerly  miss nell cried the boy coming under the window and speaking in a lower tone there are new masters down stairs  its a change for you  it is indeed replied the child  and so it will be for him when he gets better said the boy pointing towards the sick room  if he ever does added the child unable to restrain her tears  oh hell do that hell do that said kit  im sure he will  you mustnt be cast down miss nell  now dont be pray  these words of encouragement and consolation were few and roughly said but they affected the child and made her for the moment weep the more  hell be sure to get better now said the boy anxiously if you dont give way to low spirits and turn ill yourself which would make him worse and throw him back just as he was recovering  when he does say a good wordsay a kind word for me miss nell  they tell me i must not even mention your name to him for a long long time rejoined the child i dare not and even if i might what good would a kind word do you kit  we shall be very poor  we shall scarcely have bread to eat  its not that i may be taken back said the boy that i ask the favour of you  it isnt for the sake of food and wages that ive been waiting about so long in hopes to see you  dont think that id come in a time of trouble to talk of such things as them  the child looked gratefully and kindly at him but waited that he might speak again  no its not that said kit hesitating its something very different from that  i havent got much sense i know but if he could be brought to believe that id been a faithful servant to him doing the best i could and never meaning harm perhaps he mightnt  here kit faltered so long that the child entreated him to speak out and quickly for it was very late and time to shut the window  perhaps he mightnt think it over venturesome of me to saywell then to say this cried kit with sudden boldness  this home is gone from you and him  mother and i have got a poor one but thats better than this with all these people here and why not come there till hes had time to look about and find a better  the child did not speak  kit in the relief of having made his proposition found his tongue loosened and spoke out in its favour with his utmost eloquence  you think said the boy that its very small and inconvenient  so it is but its very clean  perhaps you think it would be noisy but theres not a quieter court than ours in all the town  dont be afraid of the children the baby hardly ever cries and the other one is very goodbesides id mind em  they wouldnt vex you much im sure  do try miss nell do try  the little front room up stairs is very pleasant  you can see a piece of the churchclock through the chimneys and almost tell the time mother says it would be just the thing for you and so it would and youd have her to wait upon you both and me to run of errands  we dont mean money bless you youre not to think of that  will you try him miss nell  only say youll try him  do try to make old master come and ask him first what i have done  will you only promise that miss nell  before the child could reply to this earnest solicitation the streetdoor opened and mr brass thrusting out his nightcapped head called in a surly voice whos there  kit immediately glided away and nell closing the window softly drew back into the room  before mr brass had repeated his inquiry many times mr quilp also embellished with a nightcap emerged from the same door and looked carefully up and down the street and up at all the windows of the house from the opposite side  finding that there was nobody in sight he presently returned into the house with his legal friend protesting as the child heard from the staircase that there was a league and plot against him that he was in danger of being robbed and plundered by a band of conspirators who prowled about the house at all seasons and that he would delay no longer but take immediate steps for disposing of the property and returning to his own peaceful roof having growled forth these and a great many other threats of the same nature he coiled himself once more in the childs little bed and nell crept softly up the stairs  it was natural enough that her short and unfinished dialogue with kit should leave a strong impression on her mind and influence her dreams that night and her recollections for a long long time  surrounded by unfeeling creditors and mercenary attendants upon the sick and meeting in the height of her anxiety and sorrow with little regard or sympathy even from the women about her it is not surprising that the affectionate heart of the child should have been touched to the quick by one kind and generous spirit however uncouth the temple in which it dwelt  thank heaven that the temples of such spirits are not made with hands and that they may be even more worthily hung with poor patchwork than with purple and fine linen     chapter 12  at length the crisis of the old mans disorder was past and he began to mend  by very slow and feeble degrees his consciousness came back but the mind was weakened and its functions were impaired  he was patient and quiet often sat brooding but not despondently for a long space was easily amused even by a sunbeam on the wall or ceiling made no complaint that the days were long or the nights tedious and appeared indeed to have lost all count of time and every sense of care or weariness  he would sit for hours together with nells small hand in his playing with the fingers and stopping sometimes to smooth her hair or kiss her brow and when he saw that tears were glistening in her eyes would look amazed about him for the cause and forget his wonder even while he looked  the child and he rode out the old man propped up with pillows and the child beside him  they were hand in hand as usual  the noise and motion in the streets fatigued his brain at first but he was not surprised or curious or pleased or irritated  he was asked if he remembered this or that  o yes he said quite wellwhy not sometimes he turned his head and looked with earnest gaze and outstretched neck after some stranger in the crowd until he disappeared from sight but to the question why he did this he answered not a word  he was sitting in his easy chair one day and nell upon a stool beside him when a man outside the door inquired if he might enter  yes he said without emotion it was quilp he knew  quilp was master there of course he might come in  and so he did  im glad to see you well again at last neighbour said the dwarf sitting down opposite him  youre quite strong now  yes said the old man feebly yes  i dont want to hurry you you know neighbour said the dwarf raising his voice for the old mans senses were duller than they had been but as soon as you can arrange your future proceedings the better  surely said the old man  the better for all parties  you see pursued quilp after a short pause the goods being once removed this house would be uncomfortable uninhabitable in fact  you say true returned the old man  poor nell too what would she do  exactly bawled the dwarf nodding his head thats very well observed  then will you consider about it neighbour  i will certainly replied the old man  we shall not stop here  so i supposed said the dwarf  i have sold the things  they have not yielded quite as much as they might have done but pretty wellpretty well  todays tuesday  when shall they be moved theres no hurryshall we say this afternoon  say friday morning returned the old man  very good said the dwarf  so be itwith the understanding that i cant go beyond that day neighbour on any account  good returned the old man  i shall remember it  mr quilp seemed rather puzzled by the strange even spiritless way in which all this was said but as the old man nodded his head and repeated on friday morning  i shall remember it he had no excuse for dwelling on the subject any further and so took a friendly leave with many expressions of goodwill and many compliments to his friend on his looking so remarkably well and went below stairs to report progress to mr brass  all that day and all the next the old man remained in this state  he wandered up and down the house and into and out of the various rooms as if with some vague intent of bidding them adieu but he referred neither by direct allusions nor in any other manner to the interview of the morning or the necessity of finding some other shelter  an indistinct idea he had that the child was desolate and in want of help for he often drew her to his bosom and bade her be of good cheer saying that they would not desert each other but he seemed unable to contemplate their real position more distinctly and was still the listless passionless creature that suffering of mind and body had left him  we call this a state of childishness but it is the same poor hollow mockery of it that death is of sleep  where in the dull eyes of doating men are the laughing light and life of childhood the gaiety that has known no check the frankness that has felt no chill the hope that has never withered the joys that fade in blossoming  where in the sharp lineaments of rigid and unsightly death is the calm beauty of slumber telling of rest for the waking hours that are past and gentle hopes and loves for those which are to come  lay death and sleep down side by side and say who shall find the two akin  send forth the child and childish man together and blush for the pride that libels our own old happy state and gives its title to an ugly and distorted image  thursday arrived and there was no alteration in the old man  but a change came upon him that evening as he and the child sat silently together  in a small dull yard below his window there was a treegreen and flourishing enough for such a placeand as the air stirred among its leaves it threw a rippling shadow on the white wall  the old man sat watching the shadows as they trembled in this patch of light until the sun went down and when it was night and the moon was slowly rising he still sat in the same spot  to one who had been tossing on a restless bed so long even these few green leaves and this tranquil light although it languished among chimneys and housetops were pleasant things  they suggested quiet places afar off and rest and peace  the child thought more than once that he was moved and had forborne to speak  but now he shed tearstears that it lightened her aching heart to seeand making as though he would fall upon his knees besought her to forgive him  forgive youwhat said nell interposing to prevent his purpose oh grandfather what should i forgive  all that is past all that has come upon thee nell all that was done in that uneasy dream returned the old man  do not talk so said the child  pray do not  let us speak of something else  yes yes we will he rejoined  and it shall be of what we talked of long agomany monthsmonths is it or weeks or days  which is it nell  i do not understand you said the child  it has come back upon me today it has all come back since we have been sitting here  i bless thee for it nell  for what dear grandfather  for what you said when we were first made beggars nell  let us speak softly  hush  for if they knew our purpose down stairs they would cry that i was mad and take thee from me  we will not stop here another day  we will go far away from here  yes let us go said the child earnestly  let us begone from this place and never turn back or think of it again  let us wander barefoot through the world rather than linger here  we will answered the old man we will travel afoot through the fields and woods and by the side of rivers and trust ourselves to god in the places where he dwells  it is far better to lie down at night beneath an open sky like that yondersee how bright it isthan to rest in close rooms which are always full of care and weary dreams thou and i together nell may be cheerful and happy yet and learn to forget this time as if it had never been  we will be happy cried the child  we never can be here  no we never can againnever againthats truly said rejoined the old man  let us steal away tomorrow morningearly and softly that we may not be seen or heardand leave no trace or track for them to follow by  poor nell  thy cheek is pale and thy eyes are heavy with watching and weeping for mei knowfor me but thou wilt be well again and merry too when we are far away  tomorrow morning dear well turn our faces from this scene of sorrow and be as free and happy as the birds  and then the old man clasped his hands above her head and said in a few broken words that from that time forth they would wander up and down together and never part more until death took one or other of the twain  the childs heart beat high with hope and confidence  she had no thought of hunger or cold or thirst or suffering  she saw in this but a return of the simple pleasures they had once enjoyed a relief from the gloomy solitude in which she had lived an escape from the heartless people by whom she had been surrounded in her late time of trial the restoration of the old mans health and peace and a life of tranquil happiness  sun and stream and meadow and summer days shone brightly in her view and there was no dark tint in all the sparkling picture  the old man had slept for some hours soundly in his bed and she was yet busily engaged in preparing for their flight  there were a few articles of clothing for herself to carry and a few for him old garments such as became their fallen fortunes laid out to wear and a staff to support his feeble steps put ready for his use  but this was not all her task for now she must visit the old rooms for the last time  and how different the parting with them was from any she had expected and most of all from that which she had oftenest pictured to herself how could she ever have thought of bidding them farewell in triumph when the recollection of the many hours she had passed among them rose to her swelling heart and made her feel the wish a cruelty lonely and sad though many of those hours had been  she sat down at the window where she had spent so many eveningsdarker far than thisand every thought of hope or cheerfulness that had occurred to her in that place came vividly upon her mind and blotted out all its dull and mournful associations in an instant  her own little room too where she had so often knelt down and prayed at nightprayed for the time which she hoped was dawning nowthe little room where she had slept so peacefully and dreamed such pleasant dreams  it was hard not to be able to glance round it once more and to be forced to leave it without one kind look or grateful tear  there were some trifles therepoor useless thingsthat she would have liked to take away but that was impossible  this brought to mind her bird her poor bird who hung there yet  she wept bitterly for the loss of this little creatureuntil the idea occurred to hershe did not know how or why it came into her headthat it might by some means fall into the hands of kit who would keep it for her sake and think perhaps that she had left it behind in the hope that he might have it and as an assurance that she was grateful to him  she was calmed and comforted by the thought and went to rest with a lighter heart  from many dreams of rambling through light and sunny places but with some vague object unattained which ran indistinctly through them all she awoke to find that it was yet night and that the stars were shining brightly in the sky  at length the day began to glimmer and the stars to grow pale and dim  as soon as she was sure of this she arose and dressed herself for the journey  the old man was yet asleep and as she was unwilling to disturb him she left him to slumber on until the sun rose  he was anxious that they should leave the house without a minutes loss of time and was soon ready  the child then took him by the hand and they trod lightly and cautiously down the stairs trembling whenever a board creaked and often stopping to listen  the old man had forgotten a kind of wallet which contained the light burden he had to carry and the going back a few steps to fetch it seemed an interminable delay  at last they reached the passage on the ground floor where the snoring of mr quilp and his legal friend sounded more terrible in their ears than the roars of lions  the bolts of the door were rusty and difficult to unfasten without noise  when they were all drawn back it was found to be locked and worst of all the key was gone  then the child remembered for the first time one of the nurses having told her that quilp always locked both the housedoors at night and kept the keys on the table in his bedroom  it was not without great fear and trepidation that little nell slipped off her shoes and gliding through the storeroom of old curiosities where mr brassthe ugliest piece of goods in all the stocklay sleeping on a mattress passed into her own little chamber  here she stood for a few moments quite transfixed with terror at the sight of mr quilp who was hanging so far out of bed that he almost seemed to be standing on his head and who either from the uneasiness of this posture or in one of his agreeable habits was gasping and growling with his mouth wide open and the whites or rather the dirty yellows of his eyes distinctly visible  it was no time however to ask whether anything ailed him so possessing herself of the key after one hasty glance about the room and repassing the prostrate mr brass she rejoined the old man in safety  they got the door open without noise and passing into the street stood still  which way said the child  the old man looked irresolutely and helplessly first at her then to the right and left then at her again and shook his head  it was plain that she was thenceforth his guide and leader  the child felt it but had no doubts or misgiving and putting her hand in his led him gently away  it was the beginning of a day in june the deep blue sky unsullied by a cloud and teeming with brilliant light  the streets were as yet nearly free from passengers the houses and shops were closed and the healthy air of morning fell like breath from angels on the sleeping town  the old man and the child passed on through the glad silence elate with hope and pleasure  they were alone together once again every object was bright and fresh nothing reminded them otherwise than by contrast of the monotony and constraint they had left behind church towers and steeples frowning and dark at other times now shone in the sun each humble nook and corner rejoiced in light and the sky dimmed only by excessive distance shed its placid smile on everything beneath  forth from the city while it yet slumbered went the two poor adventurers wandering they knew not whither     chapter 13  daniel quilp of tower hill and sampson brass of bevis marks in the city of london gentleman one of her majestys attornies of the courts of the kings bench and common pleas at westminster and a solicitor of the high court of chancery slumbered on unconscious and unsuspicious of any mischance until a knocking on the street door often repeated and gradually mounting up from a modest single rap to a perfect battery of knocks fired in long discharges with a very short interval between caused the said daniel quilp to struggle into a horizontal position and to stare at the ceiling with a drowsy indifference betokening that he heard the noise and rather wondered at the same and couldnt be at the trouble of bestowing any further thought upon the subject  as the knocking however instead of accommodating itself to his lazy state increased in vigour and became more importunate as if in earnest remonstrance against his falling asleep again now that he had once opened his eyes daniel quilp began by degrees to comprehend the possibility of there being somebody at the door and thus he gradually came to recollect that it was friday morning and he had ordered mrs quilp to be in waiting upon him at an early hour  mr brass after writhing about in a great many strange attitudes and often twisting his face and eyes into an expression like that which is usually produced by eating gooseberries very early in the season was by this time awake also  seeing that mr quilp invested himself in his everyday garments he hastened to do the like putting on his shoes before his stockings and thrusting his legs into his coat sleeves and making such other small mistakes in his toilet as are not uncommon to those who dress in a hurry and labour under the agitation of having been suddenly roused  while the attorney was thus engaged the dwarf was groping under the table muttering desperate imprecations on himself and mankind in general and all inanimate objects to boot which suggested to mr brass the question whats the matter  the key said the dwarf looking viciously about him the doorkeythats the matter  dye know anything of it  how should i know anything of it sir returned mr brass  how should you repeated quilp with a sneer  youre a nice lawyer ant you  ugh you idiot  not caring to represent to the dwarf in his present humour that the loss of a key by another person could scarcely be said to affect his brasss legal knowledge in any material degree mr brass humbly suggested that it must have been forgotten over night and was doubtless at that moment in its native keyhole  notwithstanding that mr quilp had a strong conviction to the contrary founded on his recollection of having carefully taken it out he was fain to admit that this was possible and therefore went grumbling to the door where sure enough he found it  now just as mr quilp laid his hand upon the lock and saw with great astonishment that the fastenings were undone the knocking came again with the most irritating violence and the daylight which had been shining through the keyhole was intercepted on the outside by a human eye  the dwarf was very much exasperated and wanting somebody to wreak his illhumour upon determined to dart out suddenly and favour mrs quilp with a gentle acknowledgment of her attention in making that hideous uproar  with this view he drew back the lock very silently and softly and opening the door all at once pounced out upon the person on the other side who had at that moment raised the knocker for another application and at whom the dwarf ran head first throwing out his hands and feet together and biting the air in the fulness of his malice  so far however from rushing upon somebody who offered no resistance and implored his mercy mr quilp was no sooner in the arms of the individual whom he had taken for his wife than he found himself complimented with two staggering blows on the head and two more of the same quality in the chest and closing with his assailant such a shower of buffets rained down upon his person as sufficed to convince him that he was in skilful and experienced hands  nothing daunted by this reception he clung tight to his opponent and bit and hammered away with such goodwill and heartiness that it was at least a couple of minutes before he was dislodged  then and not until then daniel quilp found himself all flushed and dishevelled in the middle of the street with mr richard swiveller performing a kind of dance round him and requiring to know whether he wanted any more  theres plenty more of it at the same shop said mr swiveller by turns advancing and retreating in a threatening attitude a large and extensive assortment always on handcountry orders executed with promptitude and despatchwill you have a little more sirdont say no if youd rather not  i thought it was somebody else said quilp rubbing his shoulders why didnt you say who you were  why didnt you say who you were returned dick instead of flying out of the house like a bedlamite  it was you thatthat knocked said the dwarf getting up with a short groan was it  yes i am the man replied dick  that lady had begun when i came but she knocked too soft so i relieved her  as he said this he pointed towards mrs quilp who stood trembling at a little distance  humph muttered the dwarf darting an angry look at his wife i thought it was your fault  and you sirdont you know there has been somebody ill here that you knock as if youd beat the door down  damme answered dick thats why i did it  i thought there was somebody dead here  you came for some purpose i suppose said quilp  what is it you want  i want to know how the old gentleman is rejoined mr swiveller and to hear from nell herself with whom i should like to have a little talk  im a friend of the family sirat least im the friend of one of the family and thats the same thing  youd better walk in then said the dwarf  go on sir go on  now mrs quilpafter you maam  mrs quilp hesitated but mr quilp insisted  and it was not a contest of politeness or by any means a matter of form for she knew very well that her husband wished to enter the house in this order that he might have a favourable opportunity of inflicting a few pinches on her arms which were seldom free from impressions of his fingers in black and blue colours  mr swiveller who was not in the secret was a little surprised to hear a suppressed scream and looking round to see mrs quilp following him with a sudden jerk but he did not remark on these appearances and soon forgot them  now mrs quilp said the dwarf when they had entered the shop go you up stairs if you please to nellys room and tell her that shes wanted  you seem to make yourself at home here said dick who was unacquainted with mr quilps authority  i am at home young gentleman returned the dwarf  dick was pondering what these words might mean and still more what the presence of mr brass might mean when mrs quilp came hurrying down stairs declaring that the rooms above were empty  empty you fool said the dwarf  i give you my word quilp answered his trembling wife that i have been into every room and theres not a soul in any of them  and that said mr brass clapping his hands once with an emphasis explains the mystery of the key  quilp looked frowningly at him and frowningly at his wife and frowningly at richard swiveller but receiving no enlightenment from any of them hurried up stairs whence he soon hurried down again confirming the report which had already been made  its a strange way of going he said glancing at swiveller very strange not to communicate with me who am such a close and intimate friend of his  ah hell write to me no doubt or hell bid nelly writeyes yes thats what hell do  nellys very fond of me pretty nell  mr swiveller looked as he was all openmouthed astonishment  still glancing furtively at him quilp turned to mr brass and observed with assumed carelessness that this need not interfere with the removal of the goods  for indeed he added we knew that theyd go away today but not that theyd go so early or so quietly  but they have their reasons they have their reasons  where in the devils name are they gone said the wondering dick  quilp shook his head and pursed up his lips in a manner which implied that he knew very well but was not at liberty to say  and what said dick looking at the confusion about him what do you mean by moving the goods  that i have bought em sir rejoined quilp  eh  what then  has the sly old fox made his fortune then and gone to live in a tranquil cot in a pleasant spot with a distant view of the changing sea said dick in great bewilderment  keeping his place of retirement very close that he may not be visited too often by affectionate grandsons and their devoted friends eh added the dwarf rubbing his hands hard i say nothing but is that your meaning  richard swiveller was utterly aghast at this unexpected alteration of circumstances which threatened the complete overthrow of the project in which he bore so conspicuous a part and seemed to nip his prospects in the bud  having only received from frederick trent late on the previous night information of the old mans illness he had come upon a visit of condolence and inquiry to nell prepared with the first instalment of that long train of fascinations which was to fire her heart at last  and here when he had been thinking of all kinds of graceful and insinuating approaches and meditating on the fearful retaliation which was slowly working against sophy wackleshere were nell the old man and all the money gone melted away decamped he knew not whither as if with a foreknowledge of the scheme and a resolution to defeat it in the very outset before a step was taken  in his secret heart daniel quilp was both surprised and troubled by the flight which had been made  it had not escaped his keen eye that some indispensable articles of clothing were gone with the fugitives and knowing the old mans weak state of mind he marvelled what that course of proceeding might be in which he had so readily procured the concurrence of the child  it must not be supposed or it would be a gross injustice to mr quilp that he was tortured by any disinterested anxiety on behalf of either  his uneasiness arose from a misgiving that the old man had some secret store of money which he had not suspected and the idea of its escaping his clutches overwhelmed him with mortification and selfreproach  in this frame of mind it was some consolation to him to find that richard swiveller was for different reasons evidently irritated and disappointed by the same cause  it was plain thought the dwarf that he had come there on behalf of his friend to cajole or frighten the old man out of some small fraction of that wealth of which they supposed him to have an abundance  therefore it was a relief to vex his heart with a picture of the riches the old man hoarded and to expatiate on his cunning in removing himself even beyond the reach of importunity  well said dick with a blank look i suppose its of no use my staying here  not the least in the world rejoined the dwarf  youll mention that i called perhaps said dick  mr quilp nodded and said he certainly would the very first time he saw them  and say added mr swiveller say sir that i was wafted here upon the pinions of concord that i came to remove with the rake of friendship the seeds of mutual violence and heartburning and to sow in their place the germs of social harmony  will you have the goodness to charge yourself with that commission sir  certainly rejoined quilp  will you be kind enough to add to it sir said dick producing a very small limp card that that is my address and that i am to be found at home every morning  two distinct knocks sir will produce the slavey at any time  my particular friends sir are accustomed to sneeze when the door is opened to give her to understand that they are my friends and have no interested motives in asking if im at home  i beg your pardon will you allow me to look at that card again  oh by all means rejoined quilp  by a slight and not unnatural mistake sir said dick substituting another in its stead i had handed you the passticket of a select convivial circle called the glorious apollers of which i have the honour to be perpetual grand  that is the proper document sir  good morning  quilp bade him good day the perpetual grand master of the glorious apollers elevating his hat in honour of mrs quilp dropped it carelessly on the side of his head again and disappeared with a flourish  by this time certain vans had arrived for the conveyance of the goods and divers strong men in caps were balancing chests of drawers and other trifles of that nature upon their heads and performing muscular feats which heightened their complexions considerably  not to be behindhand in the bustle mr quilp went to work with surprising vigour hustling and driving the people about like an evil spirit setting mrs quilp upon all kinds of arduous and impracticable tasks carrying great weights up and down with no apparent effort kicking the boy from the wharf whenever he could get near him and inflicting with his loads a great many sly bumps and blows on the shoulders of mr brass as he stood upon the doorsteps to answer all the inquiries of curious neighbours which was his department  his presence and example diffused such alacrity among the persons employed that in a few hours the house was emptied of everything but pieces of matting empty porterpots and scattered fragments of straw  seated like an african chief on one of these pieces of matting the dwarf was regaling himself in the parlour with bread and cheese and beer when he observed without appearing to do so that a boy was prying in at the outer door  assured that it was kit though he saw little more than his nose mr quilp hailed him by his name whereupon kit came in and demanded what he wanted  come here you sir said the dwarf  well so your old master and young mistress have gone  where rejoined kit looking round  do you mean to say you dont know where answered quilp sharply where have they gone eh  i dont know said kit  come retorted quilp lets have no more of this  do you mean to say that you dont know they went away by stealth as soon as it was light this morning  no said the boy in evident surprise  you dont know that cried quilp  dont i know that you were hanging about the house the other night like a thief eh  werent you told then  no replied the boy  you were not said quilp  what were you told then what were you talking about  kit who knew no particular reason why he should keep the matter secret now related the purpose for which he had come on that occasion and the proposal he had made  oh said the dwarf after a little consideration  then i think theyll come to you yet  do you think they will cried kit eagerly  aye i think they will returned the dwarf  now when they do let me know dye hear  let me know and ill give you something  i want to do em a kindness and i cant do em a kindness unless i know where they are  you hear what i say  kit might have returned some answer which would not have been agreeable to his irascible questioner if the boy from the wharf who had been skulking about the room in search of anything that might have been left about by accident had not happened to cry heres a bird  whats to be done with this  wring its neck rejoined quilp  oh no dont do that said kit stepping forward  give it to me  oh yes i dare say cried the other boy  come  you let the cage alone and let me wring its neck will you  he said i was to do it you let the cage alone will you  give it here give it to me you dogs roared quilp  fight for it you dogs or ill wring its neck myself  without further persuasion the two boys fell upon each other tooth and nail while quilp holding up the cage in one hand and chopping the ground with his knife in an ecstasy urged them on by his taunts and cries to fight more fiercely  they were a pretty equal match and rolled about together exchanging blows which were by no means childs play until at length kit planting a welldirected hit in his adversarys chest disengaged himself sprung nimbly up and snatching the cage from quilps hands made off with his prize  he did not stop once until he reached home where his bleeding face occasioned great consternation and caused the elder child to howl dreadfully  goodness gracious kit what is the matter what have you been doing cried mrs nubbles  never you mind mother answered her son wiping his face on the jacktowel behind the door  im not hurt dont you be afraid for me ive been a fightin for a bird and won him thats all  hold your noise little jacob  i never see such a naughty boy in all my days  you have been fighting for a bird exclaimed his mother  ah  fightin for a bird replied kit and here he ismiss nellys bird mother that they was agoin to wring the neck of  i stopped that thoughha ha ha  they wouldnt wring his neck and me by no no it wouldnt do mother it wouldnt do at all  ha ha ha  kit laughing so heartily with his swoln and bruised face looking out of the towel made little jacob laugh and then his mother laughed and then the baby crowed and kicked with great glee and then they all laughed in concert partly because of kits triumph and partly because they were very fond of each other  when this fit was over kit exhibited the bird to both children as a great and precious rarityit was only a poor linnetand looking about the wall for an old nail made a scaffolding of a chair and table and twisted it out with great exultation  let me see said the boy i think ill hang him in the winder because its more light and cheerful and he can see the sky there if he looks up very much  hes such a one to sing i can tell you  so the scaffolding was made again and kit climbing up with the poker for a hammer knocked in the nail and hung up the cage to the immeasurable delight of the whole family  when it had been adjusted and straightened a great many times and he had walked backwards into the fireplace in his admiration of it the arrangement was pronounced to be perfect  and now mother said the boy before i rest any more ill go out and see if i can find a horse to hold and then i can buy some birdseed and a bit of something nice for you into the bargain     chapter 14  as it was very easy for kit to persuade himself that the old house was in his way his way being anywhere he tried to look upon his passing it once more as a matter of imperative and disagreeable necessity quite apart from any desire of his own to which he could not choose but yield  it is not uncommon for people who are much better fed and taught than christopher nubbles had ever been to make duties of their inclinations in matters of more doubtful propriety and to take great credit for the selfdenial with which they gratify themselves  there was no need of any caution this time and no fear of being detained by having to play out a return match with daniel quilps boy the place was entirely deserted and looked as dusty and dingy as if it had been so for months  a rusty padlock was fastened on the door ends of discoloured blinds and curtains flapped drearily against the halfopened upper windows and the crooked holes cut in the closed shutters below were black with the darkness of the inside  some of the glass in the window he had so often watched had been broken in the rough hurry of the morning and that room looked more deserted and dull than any  a group of idle urchins had taken possession of the doorsteps some were plying the knocker and listening with delighted dread to the hollow sounds it spread through the dismantled house others were clustered about the keyhole watching half in jest and half in earnest for the ghost which an hours gloom added to the mystery that hung about the late inhabitants had already raised  standing all alone in the midst of the business and bustle of the street the house looked a picture of cold desolation and kit who remembered the cheerful fire that used to burn there on a winters night and the no less cheerful laugh that made the small room ring turned quite mournfully away  it must be especially observed in justice to poor kit that he was by no means of a sentimental turn and perhaps had never heard that adjective in all his life  he was only a softhearted grateful fellow and had nothing genteel or polite about him consequently instead of going home again in his grief to kick the children and abuse his mother for when your finely strung people are out of sorts they must have everybody else unhappy likewise he turned his thoughts to the vulgar expedient of making them more comfortable if he could  bless us what a number of gentlemen on horseback there were riding up and down and how few of them wanted their horses held  a good city speculator or a parliamentary commissioner could have told to a fraction from the crowds that were cantering about what sum of money was realised in london in the course of a year by holding horses alone  and undoubtedly it would have been a very large one if only a twentieth part of the gentlemen without grooms had had occasion to alight but they had not and it is often an illnatured circumstance like this which spoils the most ingenious estimate in the world  kit walked about now with quick steps and now with slow now lingering as some rider slackened his horses pace and looked about him and now darting at full speed up a byestreet as he caught a glimpse of some distant horseman going lazily up the shady side of the road and promising to stop at every door  but on they all went one after another and there was not a penny stirring  i wonder thought the boy if one of these gentlemen knew there was nothing in the cupboard at home whether hed stop on purpose and make believe that he wanted to call somewhere that i might earn a trifle  he was quite tired out with pacing the streets to say nothing of repeated disappointments and was sitting down upon a step to rest when there approached towards him a little clattering jingling fourwheeled chaise drawn by a little obstinatelooking roughcoated pony and driven by a little fat placidfaced old gentleman  beside the little old gentleman sat a little old lady plump and placid like himself and the pony was coming along at his own pace and doing exactly as he pleased with the whole concern  if the old gentleman remonstrated by shaking the reins the pony replied by shaking his head  it was plain that the utmost the pony would consent to do was to go in his own way up any street that the old gentleman particularly wished to traverse but that it was an understanding between them that he must do this after his own fashion or not at all  as they passed where he sat kit looked so wistfully at the little turnout that the old gentleman looked at him  kit rising and putting his hand to his hat the old gentleman intimated to the pony that he wished to stop to which proposal the pony who seldom objected to that part of his duty graciously acceded  i beg your pardon sir said kit  im sorry you stopped sir  i only meant did you want your horse minded  im going to get down in the next street returned the old gentleman if you like to come on after us you may have the job  kit thanked him and joyfully obeyed  the pony ran off at a sharp angle to inspect a lamppost on the opposite side of the way and then went off at a tangent to another lamppost on the other side  having satisfied himself that they were of the same pattern and materials he came to a stop apparently absorbed in meditation  will you go on sir said the old gentleman gravely or are we to wait here for you till its too late for our appointment  the pony remained immoveable  oh you naughty whisker said the old lady  fie upon you  im ashamed of such conduct  the pony appeared to be touched by this appeal to his feelings for he trotted on directly though in a sulky manner and stopped no more until he came to a door whereon was a brass plate with the words witherdennotary  here the old gentleman got out and helped out the old lady and then took from under the seat a nosegay resembling in shape and dimensions a fullsized warmingpan with the handle cut short off  this the old lady carried into the house with a staid and stately air and the old gentleman who had a clubfoot followed close upon her  they went as it was easy to tell from the sound of their voices into the front parlour which seemed to be a kind of office  the day being very warm and the street a quiet one the windows were wide open and it was easy to hear through the venetian blinds all that passed inside  at first there was a great shaking of hands and shuffling of feet succeeded by the presentation of the nosegay for a voice supposed by the listener to be that of mr witherden the notary was heard to exclaim a great many times oh delicious oh fragrant indeed and a nose also supposed to be the property of that gentleman was heard to inhale the scent with a snuffle of exceeding pleasure  i brought it in honour of the occasion sir said the old lady  ah an occasion indeed maam an occasion which does honour to me maam honour to me rejoined mr witherden the notary  i have had many a gentleman articled to me maam many a one  some of them are now rolling in riches unmindful of their old companion and friend maam others are in the habit of calling upon me to this day and saying mr witherden some of the pleasantest hours i ever spent in my life were spent in this officewere spent sir upon this very stool but there was never one among the number maam attached as i have been to many of them of whom i augured such bright things as i do of your only son  oh dear said the old lady  how happy you do make us when you tell us that to be sure  i tell you maam said mr witherden what i think as an honest man which as the poet observes is the noblest work of god  i agree with the poet in every particular maam  the mountainous alps on the one hand or a hummingbird on the other is nothing in point of workmanship to an honest manor womanor woman  anything that mr witherden can say of me observed a small quiet voice i can say with interest of him i am sure  its a happy circumstance a truly happy circumstance said the notary to happen too upon his eightandtwentieth birthday and i hope i know how to appreciate it  i trust mr garland my dear sir that we may mutually congratulate each other upon this auspicious occasion  to this the old gentleman replied that he felt assured they might there appeared to be another shaking of hands in consequence and when it was over the old gentleman said that though he said it who should not he believed no son had ever been a greater comfort to his parents than abel garland had been to his  marrying as his mother and i did late in life sir after waiting for a great many years until we were well enough offcoming together when we were no longer young and then being blessed with one child who has always been dutiful and affectionatewhy its a source of great happiness to us both sir  of course it is i have no doubt of it returned the notary in a sympathising voice  its the contemplation of this sort of thing that makes me deplore my fate in being a bachelor  there was a young lady once sir the daughter of an outfitting warehouse of the first respectabilitybut thats a weakness  chuckster bring in mr abels articles  you see mr witherden said the old lady that abel has not been brought up like the run of young men  he has always had a pleasure in our society and always been with us  abel has never been absent from us for a day has he my dear  never my dear returned the old gentleman except when he went to margate one saturday with mr tomkinley that had been a teacher at that school he went to and came back upon the monday but he was very ill after that you remember my dear it was quite a dissipation  he was not used to it you know said the old lady and he couldnt bear it thats the truth  besides he had no comfort in being there without us and had nobody to talk to or enjoy himself with  that was it you know interposed the same small quiet voice that had spoken once before  i was quite abroad mother quite desolate and to think that the sea was between usoh i never shall forget what i felt when i first thought that the sea was between us  very natural under the circumstances observed the notary  mr abels feelings did credit to his nature and credit to your nature maam and his fathers nature and human nature  i trace the same current now flowing through all his quiet and unobtrusive proceedingsi am about to sign my name you observe at the foot of the articles which mr chuckster will witness and placing my finger upon this blue wafer with the vandyked corners i am constrained to remark in a distinct tone of voicedont be alarmed maam it is merely a form of lawthat i deliver this as my act and deed  mr abel will place his name against the other wafer repeating the same cabalistic words and the business is over  ha ha ha  you see how easily these things are done  there was a short silence apparently while mr abel went through the prescribed form and then the shaking of hands and shuffling of feet were renewed and shortly afterwards there was a clinking of wineglasses and a great talkativeness on the part of everybody  in about a quarter of an hour mr chuckster with a pen behind his ear and his face inflamed with wine appeared at the door and condescending to address kit by the jocose appellation of young snob informed him that the visitors were coming out  out they came forthwith mr witherden who was short chubby freshcoloured brisk and pompous leading the old lady with extreme politeness and the father and son following them arm in arm  mr abel who had a quaint oldfashioned air about him looked nearly of the same age as his father and bore a wonderful resemblance to him in face and figure though wanting something of his full round cheerfulness and substituting in its place a timid reserve  in all other respects in the neatness of the dress and even in the clubfoot he and the old gentleman were precisely alike  having seen the old lady safely in her seat and assisted in the arrangement of her cloak and a small basket which formed an indispensable portion of her equipage mr abel got into a little box behind which had evidently been made for his express accommodation and smiled at everybody present by turns beginning with his mother and ending with the pony  there was then a great todo to make the pony hold up his head that the bearingrein might be fastened at last even this was effected and the old gentleman taking his seat and the reins put his hand in his pocket to find a sixpence for kit  he had no sixpence neither had the old lady nor mr abel nor the notary nor mr chuckster  the old gentleman thought a shilling too much but there was no shop in the street to get change at so he gave it to the boy  there he said jokingly im coming here again next monday at the same time and mind youre here my lad to work it out  thank you sir said kit  ill be sure to be here  he was quite serious but they all laughed heartily at his saying so especially mr chuckster who roared outright and appeared to relish the joke amazingly  as the pony with a presentiment that he was going home or a determination that he would not go anywhere else which was the same thing trotted away pretty nimbly kit had no time to justify himself and went his way also  having expended his treasure in such purchases as he knew would be most acceptable at home not forgetting some seed for the wonderful bird he hastened back as fast as he could so elated with his success and great good fortune that he more than half expected nell and the old man would have arrived before him     chapter 15  often while they were yet pacing the silent streets of the town on the morning of their departure the child trembled with a mingled sensation of hope and fear as in some faroff figure imperfectly seen in the clear distance her fancy traced a likeness to honest kit  but although she would gladly have given him her hand and thanked him for what he had said at their last meeting it was always a relief to find when they came nearer to each other that the person who approached was not he but a stranger for even if she had not dreaded the effect which the sight of him might have wrought upon her fellowtraveller she felt that to bid farewell to anybody now and most of all to him who had been so faithful and so true was more than she could bear  it was enough to leave dumb things behind and objects that were insensible both to her love and sorrow  to have parted from her only other friend upon the threshold of that wild journey would have wrung her heart indeed  why is it that we can better bear to part in spirit than in body and while we have the fortitude to act farewell have not the nerve to say it  on the eve of long voyages or an absence of many years friends who are tenderly attached will separate with the usual look the usual pressure of the hand planning one final interview for the morrow while each well knows that it is but a poor feint to save the pain of uttering that one word and that the meeting will never be  should possibilities be worse to bear than certainties  we do not shun our dying friends the not having distinctly taken leave of one among them whom we left in all kindness and affection will often embitter the whole remainder of a life  the town was glad with morning light places that had shown ugly and distrustful all night long now wore a smile and sparkling sunbeams dancing on chamber windows and twinkling through blind and curtain before sleepers eyes shed light even into dreams and chased away the shadows of the night  birds in hot rooms covered up close and dark felt it was morning and chafed and grew restless in their little cells brighteyed mice crept back to their tiny homes and nestled timidly together the sleek housecat forgetful of her prey sat winking at the rays of sun starting through keyhole and cranny in the door and longed for her stealthy run and warm sleek bask outside  the nobler beasts confined in dens stood motionless behind their bars and gazed on fluttering boughs and sunshine peeping through some little window with eyes in which old forests gleamedthen trod impatiently the track their prisoned feet had wornand stopped and gazed again men in their dungeons stretched their cramp cold limbs and cursed the stone that no bright sky could warm  the flowers that sleep by night opened their gentle eyes and turned them to the day  the light creations mind was everywhere and all things owned its power  the two pilgrims often pressing each others hands or exchanging a smile or cheerful look pursued their way in silence  bright and happy as it was there was something solemn in the long deserted streets from which like bodies without souls all habitual character and expression had departed leaving but one dead uniform repose that made them all alike  all was so still at that early hour that the few pale people whom they met seemed as much unsuited to the scene as the sickly lamp which had been here and there left burning was powerless and faint in the full glory of the sun  before they had penetrated very far into the labyrinth of mens abodes which yet lay between them and the outskirts this aspect began to melt away and noise and bustle to usurp its place  some straggling carts and coaches rumbling by first broke the charm then others came then others yet more active then a crowd  the wonder was at first to see a tradesmans window open but it was a rare thing soon to see one closed then smoke rose slowly from the chimneys and sashes were thrown up to let in air and doors were opened and servant girls looking lazily in all directions but their brooms scattered brown clouds of dust into the eyes of shrinking passengers or listened disconsolately to milkmen who spoke of country fairs and told of waggons in the mews with awnings and all things complete and gallant swains to boot which another hour would see upon their journey  this quarter passed they came upon the haunts of commerce and great traffic where many people were resorting and business was already rife  the old man looked about him with a startled and bewildered gaze for these were places that he hoped to shun  he pressed his finger on his lip and drew the child along by narrow courts and winding ways nor did he seem at ease until they had left it far behind often casting a backward look towards it murmuring that ruin and selfmurder were crouching in every street and would follow if they scented them and that they could not fly too fast  again this quarter passed they came upon a straggling neighbourhood where the mean houses parcelled off in rooms and windows patched with rags and paper told of the populous poverty that sheltered there  the shops sold goods that only poverty could buy and sellers and buyers were pinched and griped alike  here were poor streets where faded gentility essayed with scanty space and shipwrecked means to make its last feeble stand but taxgatherer and creditor came there as elsewhere and the poverty that yet faintly struggled was hardly less squalid and manifest than that which had long ago submitted and given up the game  this was a wide wide trackfor the humble followers of the camp of wealth pitch their tents round about it for many a milebut its character was still the same  damp rotten houses many to let many yet building many halfbuilt and mouldering awaylodgings where it would be hard to tell which needed pity most those who let or those who came to takechildren scantily fed and clothed spread over every street and sprawling in the dustscolding mothers stamping their slipshod feet with noisy threats upon the pavementshabby fathers hurrying with dispirited looks to the occupation which brought them daily bread and little moremanglingwomen washerwomen cobblers tailors chandlers driving their trades in parlours and kitchens and back room and garrets and sometimes all of them under the same roofbrickfields skirting gardens paled with staves of old casks or timber pillaged from houses burnt down and blackened and blistered by the flamesmounds of dockweed nettles coarse grass and oystershells heaped in rank confusionsmall dissenting chapels to teach with no lack of illustration the miseries of earth and plenty of new churches erected with a little superfluous wealth to show the way to heaven  at length these streets becoming more straggling yet dwindled and dwindled away until there were only small garden patches bordering the road with many a summer house innocent of paint and built of old timber or some fragments of a boat green as the tough cabbagestalks that grew about it and grottoed at the seams with toadstools and tightsticking snails  to these succeeded pert cottages two and two with plots of ground in front laid out in angular beds with stiff box borders and narrow paths between where footstep never strayed to make the gravel rough  then came the publichouse freshly painted in green and white with teagardens and a bowling green spurning its old neighbour with the horsetrough where the waggons stopped then fields and then some houses one by one of goodly size with lawns some even with a lodge where dwelt a porter and his wife  then came a turnpike then fields again with trees and haystacks then a hill and on the top of that the traveller might stop andlooking back at old saint pauls looming through the smoke its cross peeping above the cloud if the day were clear and glittering in the sun and casting his eyes upon the babel out of which it grew until he traced it down to the furthest outposts of the invading army of bricks and mortar whose station lay for the present nearly at his feetmight feel at last that he was clear of london  near such a spot as this and in a pleasant field the old man and his little guide if guide she were who knew not whither they were bound sat down to rest  she had had the precaution to furnish her basket with some slices of bread and meat and here they made their frugal breakfast  the freshness of the day the singing of the birds the beauty of the waving grass the deep green leaves the wild flowers and the thousand exquisite scents and sounds that floated in the airdeep joys to most of us but most of all to those whose life is in a crowd or who live solitarily in great cities as in the bucket of a human wellsunk into their breasts and made them very glad  the child had repeated her artless prayers once that morning more earnestly perhaps than she had ever done in all her life but as she felt all this they rose to her lips again  the old man took off his hathe had no memory for the wordsbut he said amen and that they were very good  there had been an old copy of the pilgrims progress with strange plates upon a shelf at home over which she had often pored whole evenings wondering whether it was true in every word and where those distant countries with the curious names might be  as she looked back upon the place they had left one part of it came strongly on her mind  dear grandfather she said only that this place is prettier and a great deal better than the real one if that in the book is like it i feel as if we were both christian and laid down on this grass all the cares and troubles we brought with us never to take them up again  nonever to returnnever to returnreplied the old man waving his hand towards the city  thou and i are free of it now nell  they shall never lure us back  are you tired said the child are you sure you dont feel ill from this long walk  i shall never feel ill again now that we are once away was his reply  let us be stirring nell  we must be further awaya long long way further  we are too near to stop and be at rest  come  there was a pool of clear water in the field in which the child laved her hands and face and cooled her feet before setting forth to walk again  she would have the old man refresh himself in this way too and making him sit down upon the grass cast the water on him with her hands and dried it with her simple dress  i can do nothing for myself my darling said the grandfather i dont know how it is i could once but the times gone  dont leave me nell say that thoult not leave me  i loved thee all the while indeed i did  if i lose thee too my dear i must die  he laid his head upon her shoulder and moaned piteously  the time had been and a very few days before when the child could not have restrained her tears and must have wept with him  but now she soothed him with gentle and tender words smiled at his thinking they could ever part and rallied him cheerfully upon the jest  he was soon calmed and fell asleep singing to himself in a low voice like a little child  he awoke refreshed and they continued their journey  the road was pleasant lying between beautiful pastures and fields of corn about which poised high in the clear blue sky the lark trilled out her happy song  the air came laden with the fragrance it caught upon its way and the bees upborne upon its scented breath hummed forth their drowsy satisfaction as they floated by  they were now in the open country the houses were very few and scattered at long intervals often miles apart  occasionally they came upon a cluster of poor cottages some with a chair or low board put across the open door to keep the scrambling children from the road others shut up close while all the family were working in the fields these were often the commencement of a little village and after an interval came a wheelwrights shed or perhaps a blacksmiths forge then a thriving farm with sleepy cows lying about the yard and horses peering over the low wall and scampering away when harnessed horses passed upon the road as though in triumph at their freedom  there were dull pigs too turning up the ground in search of dainty food and grunting their monotonous grumblings as they prowled about or crossed each other in their quest plump pigeons skimming round the roof or strutting on the eaves and ducks and geese far more graceful in their own conceit waddling awkwardly about the edges of the pond or sailing glibly on its surface  the farmyard passed then came the little inn the humbler beershop and the village tradesmans then the lawyers and the parsons at whose dread names the beershop trembled the church then peeped out modestly from a clump of trees then there were a few more cottages then the cage and pound and not unfrequently on a bank by the wayside a deep old dusty well  then came the trimhedged fields on either hand and the open road again  they walked all day and slept that night at a small cottage where beds were let to travellers  next morning they were afoot again and though jaded at first and very tired recovered before long and proceeded briskly forward  they often stopped to rest but only for a short space at a time and still kept on having had but slight refreshment since the morning  it was nearly five oclock in the afternoon when drawing near another cluster of labourers huts the child looked wistfully in each doubtful at which to ask for permission to rest awhile and buy a draught of milk  it was not easy to determine for she was timid and fearful of being repulsed  here was a crying child and there a noisy wife  in this the people seemed too poor in that too many  at length she stopped at one where the family were seated round the tablechiefly because there was an old man sitting in a cushioned chair beside the hearth and she thought he was a grandfather and would feel for hers  there were besides the cottager and his wife and three young sturdy children brown as berries  the request was no sooner preferred than granted  the eldest boy ran out to fetch some milk the second dragged two stools towards the door and the youngest crept to his mothers gown and looked at the strangers from beneath his sunburnt hand  god save you master said the old cottager in a thin piping voice are you travelling far  yes sir a long wayreplied the child for her grandfather appealed to her  from london inquired the old man  the child said yes  ah  he had been in london many a timeused to go there often once with waggons  it was nigh twoandthirty year since he had been there last and he did hear say there were great changes  like enough  he had changed himself since then  twoandthirty year was a long time and eightyfour a great age though there was some he had known that had lived to very hard upon a hundredand not so hearty as he neitherno nothing like it  sit thee down master in the elbow chair said the old man knocking his stick upon the brick floor and trying to do so sharply  take a pinch out o that box i dont take much myself for it comes dear but i find it wakes me up sometimes and yere but a boy to me  i should have a son pretty nigh as old as you if hed lived but they listed him for a sogerhe come back home though for all he had but one poor leg  he always said hed be buried near the sundial he used to climb upon when he was a baby did my poor boy and his words come trueyou can see the place with your own eyes weve kept the turf up ever since  he shook his head and looking at his daughter with watery eyes said she neednt be afraid that he was going to talk about that any more he didnt wish to trouble nobody and if he had troubled anybody by what he said he asked pardon that was all  the milk arrived and the child producing her little basket and selecting its best fragments for her grandfather they made a hearty meal  the furniture of the room was very homely of coursea few rough chairs and a table a corner cupboard with their little stock of crockery and delf a gaudy teatray representing a lady in bright red walking out with a very blue parasol a few common coloured scripture subjects in frames upon the wall and chimney an old dwarf clothespress and an eightday clock with a few bright saucepans and a kettle comprised the whole  but everything was clean and neat and as the child glanced round she felt a tranquil air of comfort and content to which she had long been unaccustomed  how far is it to any town or village she asked of the husband  a matter of good five mile my dear was the reply but youre not going on tonight  yes yes nell said the old man hastily urging her too by signs further on further on darling further away if we walk till midnight  theres a good barn hard by master said the man or theres travellers lodging i know at the plow an harrer  excuse me but you do seem a little tired and unless youre very anxious to get on  yes yes we are returned the old man fretfully  further away dear nell pray further away  we must go on indeed said the child yielding to his restless wish we thank you very much but we cannot stop so soon  im quite ready grandfather  but the woman had observed from the young wanderers gait that one of her little feet was blistered and sore and being a woman and a mother too she would not suffer her to go until she had washed the place and applied some simple remedy which she did so carefully and with such a gentle handroughgrained and hard though it was with workthat the childs heart was too full to admit of her saying more than a fervent god bless you nor could she look back nor trust herself to speak until they had left the cottage some distance behind  when she turned her head she saw that the whole family even the old grandfather were standing in the road watching them as they went and so with many waves of the hand and cheering nods and on one side at least not without tears they parted company  they trudged forward more slowly and painfully than they had done yet for another mile or thereabouts when they heard the sound of wheels behind them and looking round observed an empty cart approaching pretty briskly  the driver on coming up to them stopped his horse and looked earnestly at nell  didnt you stop to rest at a cottage yonder he said  yes sir replied the child  ah  they asked me to look out for you said the man  im going your way  give me your handjump up master  this was a great relief for they were very much fatigued and could scarcely crawl along  to them the jolting cart was a luxurious carriage and the ride the most delicious in the world  nell had scarcely settled herself on a little heap of straw in one corner when she fell asleep for the first time that day  she was awakened by the stopping of the cart which was about to turn up a byelane  the driver kindly got down to help her out and pointing to some trees at a very short distance before them said that the town lay there and that they had better take the path which they would see leading through the churchyard  accordingly towards this spot they directed their weary steps     chapter 16  the sun was setting when they reached the wicketgate at which the path began and as the rain falls upon the just and unjust alike it shed its warm tint even upon the restingplaces of the dead and bade them be of good hope for its rising on the morrow  the church was old and grey with ivy clinging to the walls and round the porch  shunning the tombs it crept about the mounds beneath which slept poor humble men twining for them the first wreaths they had ever won but wreaths less liable to wither and far more lasting in their kind than some which were graven deep in stone and marble and told in pompous terms of virtues meekly hidden for many a year and only revealed at last to executors and mourning legatees  the clergymans horse stumbling with a dull blunt sound among the graves was cropping the grass at once deriving orthodox consolation from the dead parishioners and enforcing last sundays text that this was what all flesh came to a lean ass who had sought to expound it also without being qualified and ordained was pricking his ears in an empty pound hard by and looking with hungry eyes upon his priestly neighbour  the old man and the child quitted the gravel path and strayed among the tombs for there the ground was soft and easy to their tired feet as they passed behind the church they heard voices near at hand and presently came on those who had spoken  they were two men who were seated in easy attitudes upon the grass and so busily engaged as to be at first unconscious of intruders  it was not difficult to divine that they were of a class of itinerant showmenexhibitors of the freaks of punchfor perched crosslegged upon a tombstone behind them was a figure of that hero himself his nose and chin as hooked and his face as beaming as usual  perhaps his imperturbable character was never more strikingly developed for he preserved his usual equable smile notwithstanding that his body was dangling in a most uncomfortable position all loose and limp and shapeless while his long peaked cap unequally balanced against his exceedingly slight legs threatened every instant to bring him toppling down  in part scattered upon the ground at the feet of the two men and in part jumbled together in a long flat box were the other persons of the drama  the heros wife and one child the hobbyhorse the doctor the foreign gentleman who not being familiar with the language is unable in the representation to express his ideas otherwise than by the utterance of the word shallabalah three distinct times the radical neighbour who will by no means admit that a tin bell is an organ the executioner and the devil were all here  their owners had evidently come to that spot to make some needful repairs in the stage arrangements for one of them was engaged in binding together a small gallows with thread while the other was intent upon fixing a new black wig with the aid of a small hammer and some tacks upon the head of the radical neighbour who had been beaten bald  they raised their eyes when the old man and his young companion were close upon them and pausing in their work returned their looks of curiosity  one of them the actual exhibitor no doubt was a little merryfaced man with a twinkling eye and a red nose who seemed to have unconsciously imbibed something of his heros character  the otherthat was he who took the moneyhad rather a careful and cautious look which was perhaps inseparable from his occupation also  the merry man was the first to greet the strangers with a nod and following the old mans eyes he observed that perhaps that was the first time he had ever seen a punch off the stage  punch it may be remarked seemed to be pointing with the tip of his cap to a most flourishing epitaph and to be chuckling over it with all his heart  why do you come here to do this said the old man sitting down beside them and looking at the figures with extreme delight  why you see rejoined the little man were putting up for tonight at the publichouse yonder and it wouldnt do to let em see the present company undergoing repair  no cried the old man making signs to nell to listen why not eh why not  because it would destroy all the delusion and take away all the interest wouldnt it replied the little man  would you care a hapenny for the lord chancellor if you knowd him in private and without his wigcertainly not  good said the old man venturing to touch one of the puppets and drawing away his hand with a shrill laugh  are you going to show em tonight  are you  that is the intention governor replied the other and unless im much mistaken tommy codlin is a calculating at this minute what weve lost through your coming upon us  cheer up tommy it cant be much  the little man accompanied these latter words with a wink expressive of the estimate he had formed of the travellers finances  to this mr codlin who had a surly grumbling manner replied as he twitched punch off the tombstone and flung him into the box i dont care if we havent lost a farden but youre too free  if you stood in front of the curtain and see the publics faces as i do youd know human natur better  ah its been the spoiling of you tommy your taking to that branch rejoined his companion  when you played the ghost in the reglar drama in the fairs you believed in everythingexcept ghosts  but now youre a universal mistruster  i never see a man so changed  never mind said mr codlin with the air of a discontented philosopher  i know better now and praps im sorry for it  turning over the figures in the box like one who knew and despised them mr codlin drew one forth and held it up for the inspection of his friend  look here heres all this judys clothes falling to pieces again you havent got a needle and thread i suppose  the little man shook his head and scratched it ruefully as he contemplated this severe indisposition of a principal performer seeing that they were at a loss the child said timidly  i have a needle sir in my basket and thread too  will you let me try to mend it for you  i think i could do it neater than you could  even mr codlin had nothing to urge against a proposal so seasonable nelly kneeling down beside the box was soon busily engaged in her task and accomplishing it to a miracle  while she was thus engaged the merry little man looked at her with an interest which did not appear to be diminished when he glanced at her helpless companion  when she had finished her work he thanked her and inquired whither they were travelling  nno further tonight i think said the child looking towards her grandfather  if youre wanting a place to stop at the man remarked i should advise you to take up at the same house with us  thats it  the long low white house there  its very cheap  the old man notwithstanding his fatigue would have remained in the churchyard all night if his new acquaintances had remained there too as he yielded to this suggestion a ready and rapturous assent they all rose and walked away together he keeping close to the box of puppets in which he was quite absorbed the merry little man carrying it slung over his arm by a strap attached to it for the purpose nelly having hold of her grandfathers hand and mr codlin sauntering slowly behind casting up at the church tower and neighbouring trees such looks as he was accustomed in townpractice to direct to drawingroom and nursery windows when seeking for a profitable spot on which to plant the show  the publichouse was kept by a fat old landlord and landlady who made no objection to receiving their new guests but praised nellys beauty and were at once prepossessed in her behalf  there was no other company in the kitchen but the two showmen and the child felt very thankful that they had fallen upon such good quarters  the landlady was very much astonished to learn that they had come all the way from london and appeared to have no little curiosity touching their farther destination  the child parried her inquiries as well as she could and with no great trouble for finding that they appeared to give her pain the old lady desisted  these two gentlemen have ordered supper in an hours time she said taking her into the bar and your best plan will be to sup with them meanwhile you shall have a little taste of something thatll do you good for im sure you must want it after all youve gone through today  now dont look after the old gentleman because when youve drank that he shall have some too  as nothing could induce the child to leave him alone however or to touch anything in which he was not the first and greatest sharer the old lady was obliged to help him first  when they had been thus refreshed the whole house hurried away into an empty stable where the show stood and where by the light of a few flaring candles stuck round a hoop which hung by a line from the ceiling it was to be forthwith exhibited  and now mr thomas codlin the misanthrope after blowing away at the pans pipes until he was intensely wretched took his station on one side of the checked drapery which concealed the mover of the figures and putting his hands in his pockets prepared to reply to all questions and remarks of punch and to make a dismal feint of being his most intimate private friend of believing in him to the fullest and most unlimited extent of knowing that he enjoyed day and night a merry and glorious existence in that temple and that he was at all times and under every circumstance the same intelligent and joyful person that the spectators then beheld him  all this mr codlin did with the air of a man who had made up his mind for the worst and was quite resigned his eye slowly wandering about during the briskest repartee to observe the effect upon the audience and particularly the impression made upon the landlord and landlady which might be productive of very important results in connexion with the supper  upon this head however he had no cause for any anxiety for the whole performance was applauded to the echo and voluntary contributions were showered in with a liberality which testified yet more strongly to the general delight  among the laughter none was more loud and frequent than the old mans  nells was unheard for she poor child with her head drooping on his shoulder had fallen asleep and slept too soundly to be roused by any of his efforts to awaken her to a participation in his glee  the supper was very good but she was too tired to eat and yet would not leave the old man until she had kissed him in his bed  he happily insensible to every care and anxiety sat listening with a vacant smile and admiring face to all that his new friend said and it was not until they retired yawning to their room that he followed the child up stairs  it was but a loft partitioned into two compartments where they were to rest but they were well pleased with their lodging and had hoped for none so good  the old man was uneasy when he had lain down and begged that nell would come and sit at his bedside as she had done for so many nights  she hastened to him and sat there till he slept  there was a little window hardly more than a chink in the wall in her room and when she left him she opened it quite wondering at the silence  the sight of the old church and the graves about it in the moonlight and the dark trees whispering among themselves made her more thoughtful than before  she closed the window again and sitting down upon the bed thought of the life that was before them  she had a little money but it was very little and when that was gone they must begin to beg  there was one piece of gold among it and an emergency might come when its worth to them would be increased a hundred fold  it would be best to hide this coin and never produce it unless their case was absolutely desperate and no other resource was left them  her resolution taken she sewed the piece of gold into her dress and going to bed with a lighter heart sunk into a deep slumber     chapter 17  another bright day shining in through the small casement and claiming fellowship with the kindred eyes of the child awoke her  at sight of the strange room and its unaccustomed objects she started up in alarm wondering how she had been moved from the familiar chamber in which she seemed to have fallen asleep last night and whither she had been conveyed  but another glance around called to her mind all that had lately passed and she sprung from her bed hoping and trustful  it was yet early and the old man being still asleep she walked out into the churchyard brushing the dew from the long grass with her feet and often turning aside into places where it grew longer than in others that she might not tread upon the graves  she felt a curious kind of pleasure in lingering among these houses of the dead and read the inscriptions on the tombs of the good people a great number of good people were buried there passing on from one to another with increasing interest  it was a very quiet place as such a place should be save for the cawing of the rooks who had built their nests among the branches of some tall old trees and were calling to one another high up in the air  first one sleek bird hovering near his ragged house as it swung and dangled in the wind uttered his hoarse cry quite by chance as it would seem and in a sober tone as though he were but talking to himself  another answered and he called again but louder than before then another spoke and then another and each time the first aggravated by contradiction insisted on his case more strongly  other voices silent till now struck in from boughs lower down and higher up and midway and to the right and left and from the treetops and others arriving hastily from the grey church turrets and old belfry window joined the clamour which rose and fell and swelled and dropped again and still went on and all this noisy contention amidst a skimming to and fro and lighting on fresh branches and frequent change of place which satirised the old restlessness of those who lay so still beneath the moss and turf below and the strife in which they had worn away their lives  frequently raising her eyes to the trees whence these sounds came down and feeling as though they made the place more quiet than perfect silence would have done the child loitered from grave to grave now stopping to replace with careful hands the bramble which had started from some green mound it helped to keep in shape and now peeping through one of the low latticed windows into the church with its wormeaten books upon the desks and baize of whitenedgreen mouldering from the pew sides and leaving the naked wood to view  there were the seats where the poor old people sat worn spare and yellow like themselves the rugged font where children had their names the homely altar where they knelt in after life the plain black tressels that bore their weight on their last visit to the cool old shady church everything told of long use and quiet slow decay the very bellrope in the porch was frayed into a fringe and hoary with old age  she was looking at a humble stone which told of a young man who had died at twentythree years old fiftyfive years ago when she heard a faltering step approaching and looking round saw a feeble woman bent with the weight of years who tottered to the foot of that same grave and asked her to read the writing on the stone  the old woman thanked her when she had done saying that she had had the words by heart for many a long long year but could not see them now  were you his mother said the child  i was his wife my dear  she the wife of a young man of threeandtwenty  ah true  it was fiftyfive years ago  you wonder to hear me say that remarked the old woman shaking her head  youre not the first  older folk than you have wondered at the same thing before now  yes i was his wife  death doesnt change us more than life my dear  do you come here often asked the child  i sit here very often in the summer time she answered i used to come here once to cry and mourn but that was a weary while ago bless god  i pluck the daisies as they grow and take them home said the old woman after a short silence  i like no flowers so well as these and havent for fiveandfifty years  its a long time and im getting very old  then growing garrulous upon a theme which was new to one listener though it were but a child she told her how she had wept and moaned and prayed to die herself when this happened and how when she first came to that place a young creature strong in love and grief she had hoped that her heart was breaking as it seemed to be  but that time passed by and although she continued to be sad when she came there still she could bear to come and so went on until it was pain no longer but a solemn pleasure and a duty she had learned to like  and now that fiveandfifty years were gone she spoke of the dead man as if he had been her son or grandson with a kind of pity for his youth growing out of her own old age and an exalting of his strength and manly beauty as compared with her own weakness and decay and yet she spoke about him as her husband too and thinking of herself in connexion with him as she used to be and not as she was now talked of their meeting in another world as if he were dead but yesterday and she separated from her former self were thinking of the happiness of that comely girl who seemed to have died with him  the child left her gathering the flowers that grew upon the grave and thoughtfully retraced her steps  the old man was by this time up and dressed  mr codlin still doomed to contemplate the harsh realities of existence was packing among his linen the candleends which had been saved from the previous nights performance while his companion received the compliments of all the loungers in the stableyard who unable to separate him from the mastermind of punch set him down as next in importance to that merry outlaw and loved him scarcely less  when he had sufficiently acknowledged his popularity he came in to breakfast at which meal they all sat down together  and where are you going today said the little man addressing himself to nell  indeed i hardly knowwe have not determined yet replied the child  were going on to the races said the little man  if thats your way and you like to have us for company let us travel together  if you prefer going alone only say the word and youll find that we shant trouble you  well go with you said the old man  nellwith them with them  the child considered for a moment and reflecting that she must shortly beg and could scarcely hope to do so at a better place than where crowds of rich ladies and gentlemen were assembled together for purposes of enjoyment and festivity determined to accompany these men so far  she therefore thanked the little man for his offer and said glancing timidly towards his friend that if there was no objection to their accompanying them as far as the race town  objection said the little man  now be gracious for once tommy and say that youd rather they went with us  i know you would  be gracious tommy  trotters said mr codlin who talked very slowly and ate very greedily as is not uncommon with philosophers and misanthropes youre too free  why what harm can it do urged the other  no harm at all in this particular case perhaps replied mr codlin but the principles a dangerous one and youre too free i tell you  well are they to go with us or not  yes they are said mr codlin but you might have made a favour of it mightnt you  the real name of the little man was harris but it had gradually merged into the less euphonious one of trotters which with the prefatory adjective short had been conferred upon him by reason of the small size of his legs  short trotters however being a compound name inconvenient of use in friendly dialogue the gentleman on whom it had been bestowed was known among his intimates either as short or trotters and was seldom accosted at full length as short trotters except in formal conversations and on occasions of ceremony  short then or trotters as the reader pleases returned unto the remonstrance of his friend mr thomas codlin a jocose answer calculated to turn aside his discontent and applying himself with great relish to the cold boiled beef the tea and bread and butter strongly impressed upon his companions that they should do the like  mr codlin indeed required no such persuasion as he had already eaten as much as he could possibly carry and was now moistening his clay with strong ale whereof he took deep draughts with a silent relish and invited nobody to partakethus again strongly indicating his misanthropical turn of mind  breakfast being at length over mr codlin called the bill and charging the ale to the company generally a practice also savouring of misanthropy divided the sumtotal into two fair and equal parts assigning one moiety to himself and friend and the other to nelly and her grandfather  these being duly discharged and all things ready for their departure they took farewell of the landlord and landlady and resumed their journey  and here mr codlins false position in society and the effect it wrought upon his wounded spirit were strongly illustrated for whereas he had been last night accosted by mr punch as master and had by inference left the audience to understand that he maintained that individual for his own luxurious entertainment and delight here he was now painfully walking beneath the burden of that same punchs temple and bearing it bodily upon his shoulders on a sultry day and along a dusty road  in place of enlivening his patron with a constant fire of wit or the cheerful rattle of his quarterstaff on the heads of his relations and acquaintance here was that beaming punch utterly devoid of spine all slack and drooping in a dark box with his legs doubled up round his neck and not one of his social qualities remaining  mr codlin trudged heavily on exchanging a word or two at intervals with short and stopping to rest and growl occasionally  short led the way with the flat box the private luggage which was not extensive tied up in a bundle and a brazen trumpet slung from his shoulderblade  nell and her grandfather walked next him on either hand and thomas codlin brought up the rear  when they came to any town or village or even to a detached house of good appearance short blew a blast upon the brazen trumpet and carolled a fragment of a song in that hilarious tone common to punches and their consorts  if people hurried to the windows mr codlin pitched the temple and hastily unfurling the drapery and concealing short therewith flourished hysterically on the pipes and performed an air  then the entertainment began as soon as might be mr codlin having the responsibility of deciding on its length and of protracting or expediting the time for the heros final triumph over the enemy of mankind according as he judged that the aftercrop of halfpence would be plentiful or scant  when it had been gathered in to the last farthing he resumed his load and on they went again  sometimes they played out the toll across a bridge or ferry and once exhibited by particular desire at a turnpike where the collector being drunk in his solitude paid down a shilling to have it to himself  there was one small place of rich promise in which their hopes were blighted for a favourite character in the play having goldlace upon his coat and being a meddling woodenheaded fellow was held to be a libel on the beadle for which reason the authorities enforced a quick retreat but they were generally well received and seldom left a town without a troop of ragged children shouting at their heels  they made a long days journey despite these interruptions and were yet upon the road when the moon was shining in the sky  short beguiled the time with songs and jests and made the best of everything that happened  mr codlin on the other hand cursed his fate and all the hollow things of earth but punch especially and limped along with the theatre on his back a prey to the bitterest chagrin  they had stopped to rest beneath a fingerpost where four roads met and mr codlin in his deep misanthropy had let down the drapery and seated himself in the bottom of the show invisible to mortal eyes and disdainful of the company of his fellow creatures when two monstrous shadows were seen stalking towards them from a turning in the road by which they had come  the child was at first quite terrified by the sight of these gaunt giantsfor such they looked as they advanced with lofty strides beneath the shadow of the treesbut short telling her there was nothing to fear blew a blast upon the trumpet which was answered by a cheerful shout  its grinders lot ant it cried mr short in a loud key  yes replied a couple of shrill voices  come on then said short  lets have a look at you  i thought it was you  thus invited grinders lot approached with redoubled speed and soon came up with the little party  mr grinders company familiarly termed a lot consisted of a young gentleman and a young lady on stilts and mr grinder himself who used his natural legs for pedestrian purposes and carried at his back a drum  the public costume of the young people was of the highland kind but the night being damp and cold the young gentleman wore over his kilt a mans pea jacket reaching to his ankles and a glazed hat the young lady too was muffled in an old cloth pelisse and had a handkerchief tied about her head  their scotch bonnets ornamented with plumes of jet black feathers mr grinder carried on his instrument  bound for the races i see said mr grinder coming up out of breath so are we  how are you short  with that they shook hands in a very friendly manner  the young people being too high up for the ordinary salutations saluted short after their own fashion  the young gentleman twisted up his right stilt and patted him on the shoulder and the young lady rattled her tambourine  practice said short pointing to the stilts  no returned grinder  it comes either to walkin in em or carryin of em and they like walkin in em best  its wery pleasant for the prospects  which road are you takin  we go the nighest  why the fact is said short that we are going the longest way because then we could stop for the night a mile and a half on  but three or four mile gained tonight is so many saved tomorrow and if you keep on i think our best way is to do the same  wheres your partner inquired grinder  here he is cried mr thomas codlin presenting his head and face in the proscenium of the stage and exhibiting an expression of countenance not often seen there and hell see his partner boiled alive before hell go on tonight  thats what he says  well dont say such things as them in a spear which is dewoted to something pleasanter urged short  respect associations tommy even if you do cut up rough  rough or smooth said mr codlin beating his hand on the little footboard where punch when suddenly struck with the symmetry of his legs and their capacity for silk stockings is accustomed to exhibit them to popular admiration rough or smooth i wont go further than the mile and a half tonight  i put up at the jolly sandboys and nowhere else  if you like to come there come there  if you like to go on by yourself go on by yourself and do without me if you can  so saying mr codlin disappeared from the scene and immediately presented himself outside the theatre took it on his shoulders at a jerk and made off with most remarkable agility  any further controversy being now out of the question short was fain to part with mr grinder and his pupils and to follow his morose companion  after lingering at the fingerpost for a few minutes to see the stilts frisking away in the moonlight and the bearer of the drum toiling slowly after them he blew a few notes upon the trumpet as a parting salute and hastened with all speed to follow mr codlin  with this view he gave his unoccupied hand to nell and bidding her be of good cheer as they would soon be at the end of their journey for that night and stimulating the old man with a similar assurance led them at a pretty swift pace towards their destination which he was the less unwilling to make for as the moon was now overcast and the clouds were threatening rain     chapter 18  the jolly sandboys was a small roadside inn of pretty ancient date with a sign representing three sandboys increasing their jollity with as many jugs of ale and bags of gold creaking and swinging on its post on the opposite side of the road  as the travellers had observed that day many indications of their drawing nearer and nearer to the race town such as gipsy camps carts laden with gambling booths and their appurtenances itinerant showmen of various kinds and beggars and trampers of every degree all wending their way in the same direction mr codlin was fearful of finding the accommodations forestalled this fear increasing as he diminished the distance between himself and the hostelry he quickened his pace and notwithstanding the burden he had to carry maintained a round trot until he reached the threshold  here he had the gratification of finding that his fears were without foundation for the landlord was leaning against the doorpost looking lazily at the rain which had by this time begun to descend heavily and no tinkling of cracked bell nor boisterous shout nor noisy chorus gave note of company within  all alone said mr codlin putting down his burden and wiping his forehead  all alone as yet rejoined the landlord glancing at the sky but we shall have more company tonight i expect  here one of you boys carry that show into the barn  make haste in out of the wet tom when it came on to rain i told em to make the fire up and theres a glorious blaze in the kitchen i can tell you  mr codlin followed with a willing mind and soon found that the landlord had not commended his preparations without good reason  a mighty fire was blazing on the hearth and roaring up the wide chimney with a cheerful sound which a large iron cauldron bubbling and simmering in the heat lent its pleasant aid to swell  there was a deep red ruddy blush upon the room and when the landlord stirred the fire sending the flames skipping and leaping upwhen he took off the lid of the iron pot and there rushed out a savoury smell while the bubbling sound grew deeper and more rich and an unctuous steam came floating out hanging in a delicious mist above their headswhen he did this mr codlins heart was touched  he sat down in the chimneycorner and smiled  mr codlin sat smiling in the chimneycorner eyeing the landlord as with a roguish look he held the cover in his hand and feigning that his doing so was needful to the welfare of the cookery suffered the delightful steam to tickle the nostrils of his guest  the glow of the fire was upon the landlords bald head and upon his twinkling eye and upon his watering mouth and upon his pimpled face and upon his round fat figure  mr codlin drew his sleeve across his lips and said in a murmuring voice what is it  its a stew of tripe said the landlord smacking his lips and cowheel smacking them again and bacon smacking them once more and steak smacking them for the fourth time and peas cauliflowers new potatoes and sparrowgrass all working up together in one delicious gravy  having come to the climax he smacked his lips a great many times and taking a long hearty sniff of the fragrance that was hovering about put on the cover again with the air of one whose toils on earth were over  at what time will it be ready asked mr codlin faintly  itll be done to a turn said the landlord looking up to the clockand the very clock had a colour in its fat white face and looked a clock for jolly sandboys to consultitll be done to a turn at twentytwo minutes before eleven  then said mr codlin fetch me a pint of warm ale and dont let nobody bring into the room even so much as a biscuit till the time arrives  nodding his approval of this decisive and manly course of procedure the landlord retired to draw the beer and presently returning with it applied himself to warm the same in a small tin vessel shaped funnelwise for the convenience of sticking it far down in the fire and getting at the bright places  this was soon done and he handed it over to mr codlin with that creamy froth upon the surface which is one of the happy circumstances attendant on mulled malt  greatly softened by this soothing beverage mr codlin now bethought him of his companions and acquainted mine host of the sandboys that their arrival might be shortly looked for  the rain was rattling against the windows and pouring down in torrents and such was mr codlins extreme amiability of mind that he more than once expressed his earnest hope that they would not be so foolish as to get wet  at length they arrived drenched with the rain and presenting a most miserable appearance notwithstanding that short had sheltered the child as well as he could under the skirts of his own coat and they were nearly breathless from the haste they had made  but their steps were no sooner heard upon the road than the landlord who had been at the outer door anxiously watching for their coming rushed into the kitchen and took the cover off  the effect was electrical  they all came in with smiling faces though the wet was dripping from their clothes upon the floor and shorts first remark was what a delicious smell  it is not very difficult to forget rain and mud by the side of a cheerful fire and in a bright room  they were furnished with slippers and such dry garments as the house or their own bundles afforded and ensconcing themselves as mr codlin had already done in the warm chimneycorner soon forgot their late troubles or only remembered them as enhancing the delights of the present time  overpowered by the warmth and comfort and the fatigue they had undergone nelly and the old man had not long taken their seats here when they fell asleep  who are they whispered the landlord  short shook his head and wished he knew himself  dont you know asked the host turning to mr codlin  not i he replied  theyre no good i suppose  theyre no harm said short  depend upon that  i tell you whatits plain that the old man ant in his right mind  if you havent got anything newer than that to say growled mr codlin glancing at the clock youd better let us fix our minds upon the supper and not disturb us  here me out wont you retorted his friend  its very plain to me besides that theyre not used to this way of life  dont tell me that that handsome child has been in the habit of prowling about as shes done these last two or three days  i know better  well who does tell you she has growled mr codlin again glancing at the clock and from it to the cauldron cant you think of anything more suitable to present circumstances than saying things and then contradicting em  i wish somebody would give you your supper returned short for therell be no peace till youve got it  have you seen how anxious the old man is to get onalways wanting to be furder awayfurder away have you seen that  ah what then muttered thomas codlin  this then said short  he has given his friends the slip  mind what i sayhe has given his friends the slip and persuaded this delicate young creetur all along of her fondness for him to be his guide and travelling companionwhere to he knows no more than the man in the moon  now im not a going to stand that  youre not a going to stand that cried mr codlin glancing at the clock again and pulling his hair with both hands in a kind of frenzy but whether occasioned by his companions observation or the tardy pace of time it was difficult to determine  heres a world to live in  i repeated short emphatically and slowly am not agoing to stand it  i am not agoing to see this fair young child a falling into bad hands and getting among people that shes no more fit for than they are to get among angels as their ordinary chums  therefore when they dewelope an intention of parting company from us i shall take measures for detaining of em and restoring em to their friends who i dare say have had their disconsolation pasted up on every wall in london by this time  short said mr codlin who with his head upon his hands and his elbows on his knees had been shaking himself impatiently from side to side up to this point and occasionally stamping on the ground but who now looked up with eager eyes its possible that there may be uncommon good sense in what youve said  if there is and there should be a reward short remember that were partners in everything  his companion had only time to nod a brief assent to this position for the child awoke at the instant  they had drawn close together during the previous whispering and now hastily separated and were rather awkwardly endeavouring to exchange some casual remarks in their usual tone when strange footsteps were heard without and fresh company entered  these were no other than four very dismal dogs who came pattering in one after the other headed by an old bandy dog of particularly mournful aspect who stopping when the last of his followers had got as far as the door erected himself upon his hind legs and looked round at his companions who immediately stood upon their hind legs in a grave and melancholy row  nor was this the only remarkable circumstance about these dogs for each of them wore a kind of little coat of some gaudy colour trimmed with tarnished spangles and one of them had a cap upon his head tied very carefully under his chin which had fallen down upon his nose and completely obscured one eye add to this that the gaudy coats were all wet through and discoloured with rain and that the wearers were splashed and dirty and some idea may be formed of the unusual appearance of these new visitors to the jolly sandboys  neither short nor the landlord nor thomas codlin however was in the least surprised merely remarking that these were jerrys dogs and that jerry could not be far behind  so there the dogs stood patiently winking and gaping and looking extremely hard at the boiling pot until jerry himself appeared when they all dropped down at once and walked about the room in their natural manner  this posture it must be confessed did not much improve their appearance as their own personal tails and their coat tailsboth capital things in their waydid not agree together  jerry the manager of these dancing dogs was a tall blackwhiskered man in a velveteen coat who seemed well known to the landlord and his guests and accosted them with great cordiality  disencumbering himself of a barrel organ which he placed upon a chair and retaining in his hand a small whip wherewith to awe his company of comedians he came up to the fire to dry himself and entered into conversation  your people dont usually travel in character do they said short pointing to the dresses of the dogs  it must come expensive if they do  no replied jerry no its not the custom with us  but weve been playing a little on the road today and we come out with a new wardrobe at the races so i didnt think it worth while to stop to undress  down pedro  this was addressed to the dog with the cap on who being a new member of the company and not quite certain of his duty kept his unobscured eye anxiously on his master and was perpetually starting upon his hind legs when there was no occasion and falling down again  ive got a animal here said jerry putting his hand into the capacious pocket of his coat and diving into one corner as if he were feeling for a small orange or an apple or some such article a animal here wot i think you know something of short  ah cried short lets have a look at him  here he is said jerry producing a little terrier from his pocket he was once a toby of yours warnt he  in some versions of the great drama of punch there is a small doga modern innovationsupposed to be the private property of that gentleman whose name is always toby  this toby has been stolen in youth from another gentleman and fraudulently sold to the confiding hero who having no guile himself has no suspicion that it lurks in others but toby entertaining a grateful recollection of his old master and scorning to attach himself to any new patrons not only refuses to smoke a pipe at the bidding of punch but to mark his old fidelity more strongly seizes him by the nose and wrings the same with violence at which instance of canine attachment the spectators are deeply affected  this was the character which the little terrier in question had once sustained if there had been any doubt upon the subject he would speedily have resolved it by his conduct for not only did he on seeing short give the strongest tokens of recognition but catching sight of the flat box he barked so furiously at the pasteboard nose which he knew was inside that his master was obliged to gather him up and put him into his pocket again to the great relief of the whole company  the landlord now busied himself in laying the cloth in which process mr codlin obligingly assisted by setting forth his own knife and fork in the most convenient place and establishing himself behind them when everything was ready the landlord took off the cover for the last time and then indeed there burst forth such a goodly promise of supper that if he had offered to put it on again or had hinted at postponement he would certainly have been sacrificed on his own hearth  however he did nothing of the kind but instead thereof assisted a stout servant girl in turning the contents of the cauldron into a large tureen a proceeding which the dogs proof against various hot splashes which fell upon their noses watched with terrible eagerness  at length the dish was lifted on the table and mugs of ale having been previously set round little nell ventured to say grace and supper began  at this juncture the poor dogs were standing on their hind legs quite surprisingly the child having pity on them was about to cast some morsels of food to them before she tasted it herself hungry though she was when their master interposed  no my dear no not an atom from anybodys hand but mine if you please  that dog said jerry pointing out the old leader of the troop and speaking in a terrible voice lost a halfpenny today  he goes without his supper  the unfortunate creature dropped upon his forelegs directly wagged his tail and looked imploringly at his master  you must be more careful sir said jerry walking coolly to the chair where he had placed the organ and setting the stop  come here now sir you play away at that while we have supper and leave off if you dare  the dog immediately began to grind most mournful music  his master having shown him the whip resumed his seat and called up the others who at his directions formed in a row standing upright as a file of soldiers  now gentlemen said jerry looking at them attentively  the dog whose names called eats  the dogs whose names ant called keep quiet  carlo  the lucky individual whose name was called snapped up the morsel thrown towards him but none of the others moved a muscle  in this manner they were fed at the discretion of their master  meanwhile the dog in disgrace ground hard at the organ sometimes in quick time sometimes in slow but never leaving off for an instant  when the knives and forks rattled very much or any of his fellows got an unusually large piece of fat he accompanied the music with a short howl but he immediately checked it on his master looking round and applied himself with increased diligence to the old hundredth     chapter 19  supper was not yet over when there arrived at the jolly sandboys two more travellers bound for the same haven as the rest who had been walking in the rain for some hours and came in shining and heavy with water  one of these was the proprietor of a giant and a little lady without legs or arms who had jogged forward in a van the other a silent gentleman who earned his living by showing tricks upon the cards and who had rather deranged the natural expression of his countenance by putting small leaden lozenges into his eyes and bringing them out at his mouth which was one of his professional accomplishments  the name of the first of these newcomers was vuffin the other probably as a pleasant satire upon his ugliness was called sweet william  to render them as comfortable as he could the landlord bestirred himself nimbly and in a very short time both gentlemen were perfectly at their ease  hows the giant said short when they all sat smoking round the fire  rather weak upon his legs returned mr vuffin  i begin to be afraid hes going at the knees  thats a bad lookout said short  aye  bad indeed replied mr vuffin contemplating the fire with a sigh  once get a giant shaky on his legs and the public care no more about him than they do for a dead cabbage stalk  what becomes of old giants said short turning to him again after a little reflection  theyre usually kept in carawans to wait upon the dwarfs said mr vuffin  the maintaining of em must come expensive when they cant be shown eh remarked short eyeing him doubtfully  its better that than letting em go upon the parish or about the streets said mr vuffin  once make a giant common and giants will never draw again  look at wooden legs  if there was only one man with a wooden leg what a property hed be  so he would observed the landlord and short both together  thats very true  instead of which pursued mr vuffin if you was to advertise shakspeare played entirely by wooden legs its my belief you wouldnt draw a sixpence  i dont suppose you would said short  and the landlord said so too  this shows you see said mr vuffin waving his pipe with an argumentative air this shows the policy of keeping the usedup giants still in the carawans where they get food and lodging for nothing all their lives and in general very glad they are to stop there  there was one gianta black unas left his carawan some year ago and took to carrying coachbills about london making himself as cheap as crossingsweepers  he died  i make no insinuation against anybody in particular said mr vuffin looking solemnly round but he was ruining the tradeand he died  the landlord drew his breath hard and looked at the owner of the dogs who nodded and said gruffly that he remembered  i know you do jerry said mr vuffin with profound meaning  i know you remember it jerry and the universal opinion was that it served him right  why i remember the time when old maunders as had threeandtwenty wansi remember the time when old maunders had in his cottage in spa fields in the winter time when the season was over eight male and female dwarfs setting down to dinner every day who was waited on by eight old giants in green coats red smalls blue cotton stockings and highlows and there was one dwarf as had grown elderly and wicious who whenever his giant wasnt quick enough to please him used to stick pins in his legs not being able to reach up any higher i know thats a fact for maunders told it me himself  what about the dwarfs when they get old inquired the landlord  the older a dwarf is the better worth he is returned mr vuffin a greyheaded dwarf well wrinkled is beyond all suspicion  but a giant weak in the legs and not standing uprightkeep him in the carawan but never show him never show him for any persuasion that can be offered  while mr vuffin and his two friends smoked their pipes and beguiled the time with such conversation as this the silent gentleman sat in a warm corner swallowing or seeming to swallow sixpennyworth of halfpence for practice balancing a feather upon his nose and rehearsing other feats of dexterity of that kind without paying any regard whatever to the company who in their turn left him utterly unnoticed  at length the weary child prevailed upon her grandfather to retire and they withdrew leaving the company yet seated round the fire and the dogs fast asleep at a humble distance  after bidding the old man good night nell retired to her poor garret but had scarcely closed the door when it was gently tapped at  she opened it directly and was a little startled by the sight of mr thomas codlin whom she had left to all appearance fast asleep down stairs  what is the matter said the child  nothings the matter my dear returned her visitor  im your friend  perhaps you havent thought so but its me thats your friendnot him  not who the child inquired  short my dear  i tell you what said codlin for all his having a kind of way with him that youd be very apt to like im the real openhearted man  i maynt look it but i am indeed  the child began to be alarmed considering that the ale had taken effect upon mr codlin and that this commendation of himself was the consequence  shorts very well and seems kind resumed the misanthrope but he overdoes it  now i dont  certainly if there were any fault in mr codlins usual deportment it was that he rather underdid his kindness to those about him than overdid it  but the child was puzzled and could not tell what to say  take my advice said codlin dont ask me why but take it  as long as you travel with us keep as near me as you can  dont offer to leave usnot on any accountbut always stick to me and say that im your friend  will you bear that in mind my dear and always say that it was me that was your friend  say so whereand when inquired the child innocently  o nowhere in particular replied codlin a little put out as it seemed by the question im only anxious that you should think me so and do me justice  you cant think what an interest i have in you why didnt you tell me your little historythat about you and the poor old gentleman  im the best adviser that ever was and so interested in youso much more interested than short  i think theyre breaking up down stairs you neednt tell short you know that weve had this little talk together  god bless you  recollect the friend  codlins the friend not short  shorts very well as far as he goes but the real friend is codlinnot short  eking out these professions with a number of benevolent and protecting looks and great fervour of manner thomas codlin stole away on tiptoe leaving the child in a state of extreme surprise  she was still ruminating upon his curious behaviour when the floor of the crazy stairs and landing cracked beneath the tread of the other travellers who were passing to their beds  when they had all passed and the sound of their footsteps had died away one of them returned and after a little hesitation and rustling in the passage as if he were doubtful what door to knock at knocked at hers  yes said the child from within  its meshorta voice called through the keyhole  i only wanted to say that we must be off early tomorrow morning my dear because unless we get the start of the dogs and the conjuror the villages wont be worth a penny  youll be sure to be stirring early and go with us  ill call you  the child answered in the affirmative and returning his good night heard him creep away  she felt some uneasiness at the anxiety of these men increased by the recollection of their whispering together down stairs and their slight confusion when she awoke nor was she quite free from a misgiving that they were not the fittest companions she could have stumbled on  her uneasiness however was nothing weighed against her fatigue and she soon forgot it in sleep  very early next morning short fulfilled his promise and knocking softly at her door entreated that she would get up directly as the proprietor of the dogs was still snoring and if they lost no time they might get a good deal in advance both of him and the conjuror who was talking in his sleep and from what he could be heard to say appeared to be balancing a donkey in his dreams  she started from her bed without delay and roused the old man with so much expedition that they were both ready as soon as short himself to that gentlemans unspeakable gratification and relief  after a very unceremonious and scrambling breakfast of which the staple commodities were bacon and bread and beer they took leave of the landlord and issued from the door of the jolly sandboys  the morning was fine and warm the ground cool to the feet after the late rain the hedges gayer and more green the air clear and everything fresh and healthful  surrounded by these influences they walked on pleasantly enough  they had not gone very far when the child was again struck by the altered behaviour of mr thomas codlin who instead of plodding on sulkily by himself as he had heretofore done kept close to her and when he had an opportunity of looking at her unseen by his companion warned her by certain wry faces and jerks of the head not to put any trust in short but to reserve all confidences for codlin  neither did he confine himself to looks and gestures for when she and her grandfather were walking on beside the aforesaid short and that little man was talking with his accustomed cheerfulness on a variety of indifferent subjects thomas codlin testified his jealousy and distrust by following close at her heels and occasionally admonishing her ankles with the legs of the theatre in a very abrupt and painful manner  all these proceedings naturally made the child more watchful and suspicious and she soon observed that whenever they halted to perform outside a village alehouse or other place mr codlin while he went through his share of the entertainments kept his eye steadily upon her and the old man or with a show of great friendship and consideration invited the latter to lean upon his arm and so held him tight until the representation was over and they again went forward  even short seemed to change in this respect and to mingle with his goodnature something of a desire to keep them in safe custody  this increased the childs misgivings and made her yet more anxious and uneasy  meanwhile they were drawing near the town where the races were to begin next day for from passing numerous groups of gipsies and trampers on the road wending their way towards it and straggling out from every byway and crosscountry lane they gradually fell into a stream of people some walking by the side of covered carts others with horses others with donkeys others toiling on with heavy loads upon their backs but all tending to the same point  the publichouses by the wayside from being empty and noiseless as those in the remoter parts had been now sent out boisterous shouts and clouds of smoke and from the misty windows clusters of broad red faces looked down upon the road  on every piece of waste or common ground some small gambler drove his noisy trade and bellowed to the idle passersby to stop and try their chance the crowd grew thicker and more noisy gilt gingerbread in blanketstalls exposed its glories to the dust and often a fourhorse carriage dashing by obscured all objects in the gritty cloud it raised and left them stunned and blinded far behind  it was dark before they reached the town itself and long indeed the few last miles had been  here all was tumult and confusion the streets were filled with throngs of peoplemany strangers were there it seemed by the looks they cast aboutthe churchbells rang out their noisy peals and flags streamed from windows and housetops  in the large innyards waiters flitted to and fro and ran against each other horses clattered on the uneven stones carriage steps fell rattling down and sickening smells from many dinners came in a heavy lukewarm breath upon the sense  in the smaller publichouses fiddles with all their might and main were squeaking out the tune to staggering feet drunken men oblivious of the burden of their song joined in a senseless howl which drowned the tinkling of the feeble bell and made them savage for their drink vagabond groups assembled round the doors to see the stroller woman dance and add their uproar to the shrill flageolet and deafening drum  through this delirious scene the child frightened and repelled by all she saw led on her bewildered charge clinging close to her conductor and trembling lest in the press she should be separated from him and left to find her way alone  quickening their steps to get clear of all the roar and riot they at length passed through the town and made for the racecourse which was upon an open heath situated on an eminence a full mile distant from its furthest bounds  although there were many people here none of the best favoured or best clad busily erecting tents and driving stakes in the ground and hurrying to and fro with dusty feet and many a grumbled oathalthough there were tired children cradled on heaps of straw between the wheels of carts crying themselves to sleepand poor lean horses and donkeys just turned loose grazing among the men and women and pots and kettles and halflighted fires and ends of candles flaring and wasting in the airfor all this the child felt it an escape from the town and drew her breath more freely  after a scanty supper the purchase of which reduced her little stock so low that she had only a few halfpence with which to buy a breakfast on the morrow she and the old man lay down to rest in a corner of a tent and slept despite the busy preparations that were going on around them all night long  and now they had come to the time when they must beg their bread  soon after sunrise in the morning she stole out from the tent and rambling into some fields at a short distance plucked a few wild roses and such humble flowers purposing to make them into little nosegays and offer them to the ladies in the carriages when the company arrived  her thoughts were not idle while she was thus employed when she returned and was seated beside the old man in one corner of the tent tying her flowers together while the two men lay dozing in another corner she plucked him by the sleeve and slightly glancing towards them said in a low voice  grandfather dont look at those i talk of and dont seem as if i spoke of anything but what i am about  what was that you told me before we left the old house  that if they knew what we were going to do they would say that you were mad and part us  the old man turned to her with an aspect of wild terror but she checked him by a look and bidding him hold some flowers while she tied them up and so bringing her lips closer to his ear said  i know that was what you told me  you neednt speak dear  i recollect it very well  it was not likely that i should forget it grandfather these men suspect that we have secretly left our friends and mean to carry us before some gentleman and have us taken care of and sent back  if you let your hand tremble so we can never get away from them but if youre only quiet now we shall do so easily  how muttered the old man  dear nelly how  they will shut me up in a stone room dark and cold and chain me up to the wall nellflog me with whips and never let me see thee more  youre trembling again said the child  keep close to me all day never mind them dont look at them but me  i shall find a time when we can steal away  when i do mind you come with me and do not stop or speak a word  hush  thats all  halloa what are you up to my dear said mr codlin raising his head and yawning  then observing that his companion was fast asleep he added in an earnest whisper codlins the friend remembernot short  making some nosegays the child replied i am going to try and sell some these three days of the races  will you have oneas a present i mean  mr codlin would have risen to receive it but the child hurried towards him and placed it in his hand  he stuck it in his buttonhole with an air of ineffable complacency for a misanthrope and leering exultingly at the unconscious short muttered as he laid himself down again tom codlins the friend by g  as the morning wore on the tents assumed a gayer and more brilliant appearance and long lines of carriages came rolling softly on the turf  men who had lounged about all night in smockfrocks and leather leggings came out in silken vests and hats and plumes as jugglers or mountebanks or in gorgeous liveries as softspoken servants at gambling booths or in sturdy yeoman dress as decoys at unlawful games blackeyed gipsy girls hooded in showy handkerchiefs sallied forth to tell fortunes and pale slender women with consumptive faces lingered upon the footsteps of ventriloquists and conjurors and counted the sixpences with anxious eyes long before they were gained  as many of the children as could be kept within bounds were stowed away with all the other signs of dirt and poverty among the donkeys carts and horses and as many as could not be thus disposed of ran in and out in all intricate spots crept between peoples legs and carriage wheels and came forth unharmed from under horses hoofs  the dancingdogs the stilts the little lady and the tall man and all the other attractions with organs out of number and bands innumerable emerged from the holes and corners in which they had passed the night and flourished boldly in the sun  along the uncleared course short led his party sounding the brazen trumpet and revelling in the voice of punch and at his heels went thomas codlin bearing the show as usual and keeping his eye on nelly and her grandfather as they rather lingered in the rear  the child bore upon her arm the little basket with her flowers and sometimes stopped with timid and modest looks to offer them at some gay carriage but alas there were many bolder beggars there gipsies who promised husbands and other adepts in their trade and although some ladies smiled gently as they shook their heads and others cried to the gentlemen beside them see what a pretty face they let the pretty face pass on and never thought that it looked tired or hungry  there was but one lady who seemed to understand the child and she was one who sat alone in a handsome carriage while two young men in dashing clothes who had just dismounted from it talked and laughed loudly at a little distance appearing to forget her quite  there were many ladies all around but they turned their backs or looked another way or at the two young men not unfavourably at them and left her to herself  she motioned away a gipsywoman urgent to tell her fortune saying that it was told already and had been for some years but called the child towards her and taking her flowers put money into her trembling hand and bade her go home and keep at home for gods sake  many a time they went up and down those long long lines seeing everything but the horses and the race when the bell rang to clear the course going back to rest among the carts and donkeys and not coming out again until the heat was over  many a time too was punch displayed in the full zenith of his humour but all this while the eye of thomas codlin was upon them and to escape without notice was impracticable  at length late in the day mr codlin pitched the show in a convenient spot and the spectators were soon in the very triumph of the scene the child sitting down with the old man close behind it had been thinking how strange it was that horses who were such fine honest creatures should seem to make vagabonds of all the men they drew about them when a loud laugh at some extemporaneous witticism of mr shorts having allusion to the circumstances of the day roused her from her meditation and caused her to look around  if they were ever to get away unseen that was the very moment  short was plying the quarterstaves vigorously and knocking the characters in the fury of the combat against the sides of the show the people were looking on with laughing faces and mr codlin had relaxed into a grim smile as his roving eye detected hands going into waistcoat pockets and groping secretly for sixpences  if they were ever to get away unseen that was the very moment  they seized it and fled  they made a path through booths and carriages and throngs of people and never once stopped to look behind  the bell was ringing and the course was cleared by the time they reached the ropes but they dashed across it insensible to the shouts and screeching that assailed them for breaking in upon its sanctity and creeping under the brow of the hill at a quick pace made for the open fields     chapter 20  day after day as he bent his steps homeward returning from some new effort to procure employment kit raised his eyes to the window of the little room he had so much commended to the child and hoped to see some indication of her presence  his own earnest wish coupled with the assurance he had received from quilp filled him with the belief that she would yet arrive to claim the humble shelter he had offered and from the death of each days hope another hope sprung up to live tomorrow  i think they must certainly come tomorrow eh mother said kit laying aside his hat with a weary air and sighing as he spoke  they have been gone a week  they surely couldnt stop away more than a week could they now  the mother shook her head and reminded him how often he had been disappointed already  for the matter of that said kit you speak true and sensible enough as you always do mother  still i do consider that a week is quite long enough for em to be rambling about dont you say so  quite long enough kit longer than enough but they may not come back for all that  kit was for a moment disposed to be vexed by this contradiction and not the less so from having anticipated it in his own mind and knowing how just it was  but the impulse was only momentary and the vexed look became a kind one before it had crossed the room  then what do you think mother has become of em  you dont think theyve gone to sea anyhow  not gone for sailors certainly returned the mother with a smile but i cant help thinking that they have gone to some foreign country  i say cried kit with a rueful face dont talk like that mother  i am afraid they have and thats the truth she said  its the talk of all the neighbours and there are some even that know of their having been seen on board ship and can tell you the name of the place theyve gone to which is more than i can my dear for its a very hard one  i dont believe it said kit  not a word of it  a set of idle chatterboxes how should they know  they may be wrong of course returned the mother i cant tell about that though i dont think its at all unlikely that theyre in the right for the talk is that the old gentleman had put by a little money that nobody knew of not even that ugly little man you talk to me aboutwhats his namequilp and that he and miss nell have gone to live abroad where it cant be taken from them and they will never be disturbed  that dont seem very far out of the way now do it  kit scratched his head mournfully in reluctant admission that it did not and clambering up to the old nail took down the cage and set himself to clean it and to feed the bird  his thoughts reverting from this occupation to the little old gentleman who had given him the shilling he suddenly recollected that that was the very daynay nearly the very hourat which the little old gentleman had said he should be at the notarys house again  he no sooner remembered this than he hung up the cage with great precipitation and hastily explaining the nature of his errand went off at full speed to the appointed place  it was some two minutes after the time when he reached the spot which was a considerable distance from his home but by great good luck the little old gentleman had not yet arrived at least there was no ponychaise to be seen and it was not likely that he had come and gone again in so short a space  greatly relieved to find that he was not too late kit leant against a lamppost to take breath and waited the advent of the pony and his charge  sure enough before long the pony came trotting round the corner of the street looking as obstinate as pony might and picking his steps as if he were spying about for the cleanest places and would by no means dirty his feet or hurry himself inconveniently  behind the pony sat the little old gentleman and by the old gentlemans side sat the little old lady carrying just such a nosegay as she had brought before  the old gentleman the old lady the pony and the chaise came up the street in perfect unanimity until they arrived within some half a dozen doors of the notarys house when the pony deceived by a brassplate beneath a tailors knocker came to a halt and maintained by a sturdy silence that that was the house they wanted  now sir will you ha the goodness to go on this is not the place said the old gentleman  the pony looked with great attention into a fireplug which was near him and appeared to be quite absorbed in contemplating it  oh dear such a naughty whisker cried the old lady  after being so good too and coming along so well  i am quite ashamed of him  i dont know what we are to do with him i really dont  the pony having thoroughly satisfied himself as to the nature and properties of the fireplug looked into the air after his old enemies the flies and as there happened to be one of them tickling his ear at that moment he shook his head and whisked his tail after which he appeared full of thought but quite comfortable and collected  the old gentleman having exhausted his powers of persuasion alighted to lead him whereupon the pony perhaps because he held this to be a sufficient concession perhaps because he happened to catch sight of the other brassplate or perhaps because he was in a spiteful humour darted off with the old lady and stopped at the right house leaving the old gentleman to come panting on behind  it was then that kit presented himself at the ponys head and touched his hat with a smile  why bless me cried the old gentleman the lad is here  my dear do you see  i said id be here sir said kit patting whiskers neck  i hope youve had a pleasant ride sir  hes a very nice little pony  my dear said the old gentleman  this is an uncommon lad a good lad im sure  im sure he is rejoined the old lady  a very good lad and i am sure he is a good son  kit acknowledged these expressions of confidence by touching his hat again and blushing very much  the old gentleman then handed the old lady out and after looking at him with an approving smile they went into the housetalking about him as they went kit could not help feeling  presently mr witherden smelling very hard at the nosegay came to the window and looked at him and after that mr abel came and looked at him and after that the old gentleman and lady came and looked at him again and after that they all came and looked at him together which kit feeling very much embarrassed by made a pretence of not observing  therefore he patted the pony more and more and this liberty the pony most handsomely permitted  the faces had not disappeared from the window many moments when mr chuckster in his official coat and with his hat hanging on his head just as it happened to fall from its peg appeared upon the pavement and telling him he was wanted inside bade him go in and he would mind the chaise the while  in giving him this direction mr chuckster remarked that he wished that he might be blessed if he could make out whether he kit was precious raw or precious deep but intimated by a distrustful shake of the head that he inclined to the latter opinion  kit entered the office in a great tremor for he was not used to going among strange ladies and gentlemen and the tin boxes and bundles of dusty papers had in his eyes an awful and venerable air  mr witherden too was a bustling gentleman who talked loud and fast and all eyes were upon him and he was very shabby  well boy said mr witherden you came to work out that shillingnot to get another hey  no indeed sir replied kit taking courage to look up  i never thought of such a thing  father alive said the notary  dead sir  mother  yes sir  married againeh  kit made answer not without some indignation that she was a widow with three children and that as to her marrying again if the gentleman knew her he wouldnt think of such a thing  at this reply mr witherden buried his nose in the flowers again and whispered behind the nosegay to the old gentleman that he believed the lad was as honest a lad as need be  now said mr garland when they had made some further inquiries of him i am not going to give you anything  thank you sir kit replied and quite seriously too for this announcement seemed to free him from the suspicion which the notary had hinted  but resumed the old gentleman perhaps i may want to know something more about you so tell me where you live and ill put it down in my pocketbook  kit told him and the old gentleman wrote down the address with his pencil  he had scarcely done so when there was a great uproar in the street and the old lady hurrying to the window cried that whisker had run away upon which kit darted out to the rescue and the others followed  it seemed that mr chuckster had been standing with his hands in his pockets looking carelessly at the pony and occasionally insulting him with such admonitions as stand stillbe quietwoaa and the like which by a pony of spirit cannot be borne  consequently the pony being deterred by no considerations of duty or obedience and not having before him the slightest fear of the human eye had at length started off and was at that moment rattling down the streetmr chuckster with his hat off and a pen behind his ear hanging on in the rear of the chaise and making futile attempts to draw it the other way to the unspeakable admiration of all beholders  even in running away however whisker was perverse for he had not gone very far when he suddenly stopped and before assistance could be rendered commenced backing at nearly as quick a pace as he had gone forward  by these means mr chuckster was pushed and hustled to the office again in a most inglorious manner and arrived in a state of great exhaustion and discomfiture  the old lady then stepped into her seat and mr abel whom they had come to fetch into his  the old gentleman after reasoning with the pony on the extreme impropriety of his conduct and making the best amends in his power to mr chuckster took his place also and they drove away waving a farewell to the notary and his clerk and more than once turning to nod kindly to kit as he watched them from the road     chapter 21  kit turned away and very soon forgot the pony and the chaise and the little old lady and the little old gentleman and the little young gentleman to boot in thinking what could have become of his late master and his lovely grandchild who were the fountainhead of all his meditations  still casting about for some plausible means of accounting for their nonappearance and of persuading himself that they must soon return he bent his steps towards home intending to finish the task which the sudden recollection of his contract had interrupted and then to sally forth once more to seek his fortune for the day  when he came to the corner of the court in which he lived lo and behold there was the pony again  yes there he was looking more obstinate than ever and alone in the chaise keeping a steady watch upon his every wink sat mr abel who lifting up his eyes by chance and seeing kit pass by nodded to him as though he would have nodded his head off  kit wondered to see the pony again so near his own home too but it never occurred to him for what purpose the pony might have come there or where the old lady and the old gentleman had gone until he lifted the latch of the door and walking in found them seated in the room in conversation with his mother at which unexpected sight he pulled off his hat and made his best bow in some confusion  we are here before you you see christopher said mr garland smiling  yes sir said kit and as he said it he looked towards his mother for an explanation of the visit  the gentlemans been kind enough my dear said she in reply to this mute interrogation to ask me whether you were in a good place or in any place at all and when i told him no you were not in any he was so good as to say that  that we wanted a good lad in our house said the old gentleman and the old lady both together and that perhaps we might think of it if we found everything as we would wish it to be  as this thinking of it plainly meant the thinking of engaging kit he immediately partook of his mothers anxiety and fell into a great flutter for the little old couple were very methodical and cautious and asked so many questions that he began to be afraid there was no chance of his success  you see my good woman said mrs garland to kits mother that its necessary to be very careful and particular in such a matter as this for were only three in family and are very quiet regular folks and it would be a sad thing if we made any kind of mistake and found things different from what we hoped and expected  to this kits mother replied that certainly it was quite true and quite right and quite proper and heaven forbid that she should shrink or have cause to shrink from any inquiry into her character or that of her son who was a very good son though she was his mother in which respect she was bold to say he took after his father who was not only a good son to his mother but the best of husbands and the best of fathers besides which kit could and would corroborate she knew and so would little jacob and the baby likewise if they were old enough which unfortunately they were not though as they didnt know what a loss they had had perhaps it was a great deal better that they should be as young as they were and so kits mother wound up a long story by wiping her eyes with her apron and patting little jacobs head who was rocking the cradle and staring with all his might at the strange lady and gentleman  when kits mother had done speaking the old lady struck in again and said that she was quite sure she was a very honest and very respectable person or she never would have expressed herself in that manner and that certainly the appearance of the children and the cleanliness of the house deserved great praise and did her the utmost credit whereat kits mother dropped a curtsey and became consoled  then the good woman entered in a long and minute account of kits life and history from the earliest period down to that time not omitting to make mention of his miraculous fall out of a backparlour window when an infant of tender years or his uncommon sufferings in a state of measles which were illustrated by correct imitations of the plaintive manner in which he called for toast and water day and night and said dont cry mother i shall soon be better for proof of which statements reference was made to mrs green lodger at the cheesemongers round the corner and divers other ladies and gentlemen in various parts of england and wales and one mr brown who was supposed to be then a corporal in the east indies and who could of course be found with very little trouble within whose personal knowledge the circumstances had occurred  this narration ended mr garland put some questions to kit respecting his qualifications and general acquirements while mrs garland noticed the children and hearing from kits mother certain remarkable circumstances which had attended the birth of each related certain other remarkable circumstances which had attended the birth of her own son mr abel from which it appeared that both kits mother and herself had been above and beyond all other women of what condition or age soever peculiarly hemmed in with perils and dangers  lastly inquiry was made into the nature and extent of kits wardrobe and a small advance being made to improve the same he was formally hired at an annual income of six pounds over and above his board and lodging by mr and mrs garland of abel cottage finchley  it would be difficult to say which party appeared most pleased with this arrangement the conclusion of which was hailed with nothing but pleasant looks and cheerful smiles on both sides  it was settled that kit should repair to his new abode on the next day but one in the morning and finally the little old couple after bestowing a bright halfcrown on little jacob and another on the baby took their leaves being escorted as far as the street by their new attendant who held the obdurate pony by the bridle while they took their seats and saw them drive away with a lightened heart  well mother said kit hurrying back into the house i think my fortunes about made now  i should think it was indeed kit rejoined his mother  six pound a year  only think  ah said kit trying to maintain the gravity which the consideration of such a sum demanded but grinning with delight in spite of himself theres a property  kit drew a long breath when he had said this and putting his hands deep into his pockets as if there were one years wages at least in each looked at his mother as though he saw through her and down an immense perspective of sovereigns beyond  please god well make such a lady of you for sundays mother such a scholar of jacob such a child of the baby such a room of the one up stairs  six pound a year  hem croaked a strange voice  whats that about six pound a year what about six pound a year  and as the voice made this inquiry daniel quilp walked in with richard swiveller at his heels  who said he was to have six pound a year said quilp looking sharply round  did the old man say it or did little nell say it  and whats he to have it for and where are they eh  the good woman was so much alarmed by the sudden apparition of this unknown piece of ugliness that she hastily caught the baby from its cradle and retreated into the furthest corner of the room while little jacob sitting upon his stool with his hands on his knees looked full at him in a species of fascination roaring lustily all the time  richard swiveller took an easy observation of the family over mr quilps head and quilp himself with his hands in his pockets smiled in an exquisite enjoyment of the commotion he occasioned  dont be frightened mistress said quilp after a pause  your son knows me i dont eat babies i dont like em  it will be as well to stop that young screamer though in case i should be tempted to do him a mischief  holloa sir  will you be quiet  little jacob stemmed the course of two tears which he was squeezing out of his eyes and instantly subsided into a silent horror  mind you dont break out again you villain said quilp looking sternly at him or ill make faces at you and throw you into fits i will  now you sir why havent you been to me as you promised  what should i come for retorted kit  i hadnt any business with you no more than you had with me  here mistress said quilp turning quickly away and appealing from kit to his mother  when did his old master come or send here last is he here now  if not wheres he gone  he has not been here at all she replied  i wish we knew where they have gone for it would make my son a good deal easier in his mind and me too  if youre the gentleman named mr quilp i should have thought youd have known and so i told him only this very day  humph muttered quilp evidently disappointed to believe that this was true  thats what you tell this gentleman too is it  if the gentleman comes to ask the same question i cant tell him anything else sir and i only wish i could for our own sakes was the reply  quilp glanced at richard swiveller and observed that having met him on the threshold he assumed that he had come in search of some intelligence of the fugitives  he supposed he was right  yes said dick that was the object of the present expedition  i fancied it possiblebut let us go ring fancys knell  ill begin it  you seem disappointed observed quilp  a baffler sir a baffler thats all returned dick  i have entered upon a speculation which has proved a baffler and a being of brightness and beauty will be offered up a sacrifice at cheggss altar thats all sir  the dwarf eyed richard with a sarcastic smile but richard who had been taking a rather strong lunch with a friend observed him not and continued to deplore his fate with mournful and despondent looks quilp plainly discerned that there was some secret reason for this visit and his uncommon disappointment and in the hope that there might be means of mischief lurking beneath it resolved to worm it out he had no sooner adopted this resolution than he conveyed as much honesty into his face as it was capable of expressing and sympathised with mr swiveller exceedingly  i am disappointed myself said quilp out of mere friendly feeling for them but you have real reasons private reasons i have no doubt for your disappointment and therefore it comes heavier than mine  why of course it does dick observed testily  upon my word im very sorry very sorry  im rather cast down myself  as we are companions in adversity shall we be companions in the surest way of forgetting it  if you had no particular business now to lead you in another direction urged quilp plucking him by the sleeve and looking slyly up into his face out of the corners of his eyes there is a house by the waterside where they have some of the noblest schiedamreputed to be smuggled but thats between ourselvesthat can be got in all the world  the landlord knows me theres a little summerhouse overlooking the river where we might take a glass of this delicious liquor with a whiff of the best tobaccoits in this case and of the rarest quality to my certain knowledgeand be perfectly snug and happy could we possibly contrive it or is there any very particular engagement that peremptorily takes you another way mr swiveller eh  as the dwarf spoke dicks face relaxed into a compliant smile and his brows slowly unbent  by the time he had finished dick was looking down at quilp in the same sly manner as quilp was looking up at him and there remained nothing more to be done but to set out for the house in question  this they did straightway  the moment their backs were turned little jacob thawed and resumed his crying from the point where quilp had frozen him  the summerhouse of which mr quilp had spoken was a rugged wooden box rotten and bare to see which overhung the rivers mud and threatened to slide down into it  the tavern to which it belonged was a crazy building sapped and undermined by the rats and only upheld by great bars of wood which were reared against its walls and had propped it up so long that even they were decaying and yielding with their load and of a windy night might be heard to creak and crack as if the whole fabric were about to come toppling down  the house stoodif anything so old and feeble could be said to standon a piece of waste ground blighted with the unwholesome smoke of factory chimneys and echoing the clank of iron wheels and rush of troubled water  its internal accommodations amply fulfilled the promise of the outside  the rooms were low and damp the clammy walls were pierced with chinks and holes the rotten floors had sunk from their level the very beams started from their places and warned the timid stranger from their neighbourhood  to this inviting spot entreating him to observe its beauties as they passed along mr quilp led richard swiveller and on the table of the summerhouse scored deep with many a gallows and initial letter there soon appeared a wooden keg full of the vaunted liquor  drawing it off into the glasses with the skill of a practised hand and mixing it with about a third part of water mr quilp assigned to richard swiveller his portion and lighting his pipe from an end of a candle in a very old and battered lantern drew himself together upon a seat and puffed away  is it good said quilp as richard swiveller smacked his lips is it strong and fiery  does it make you wink and choke and your eyes water and your breath come shortdoes it  does it cried dick throwing away part of the contents of his glass and filling it up with water why man you dont mean to tell me that you drink such fire as this  no rejoined quilp not drink it  look here  and here  and here again  not drink it  as he spoke daniel quilp drew off and drank three small glassfuls of the raw spirit and then with a horrible grimace took a great many pulls at his pipe and swallowing the smoke discharged it in a heavy cloud from his nose  this feat accomplished he drew himself together in his former position and laughed excessively  give us a toast cried quilp rattling on the table in a dexterous manner with his fist and elbow alternately in a kind of tune a woman a beauty  lets have a beauty for our toast and empty our glasses to the last drop  her name come  if you want a name said dick heres sophy wackles  sophy wackles screamed the dwarf miss sophy wackles that ismrs richard swiveller that shall bethat shall beha ha ha  ah said dick you might have said that a few weeks ago but it wont do now my buck  immolating herself upon the shrine of cheggs  poison cheggs cut cheggss ears off rejoined quilp  i wont hear of cheggs  her name is swiveller or nothing  ill drink her health again and her fathers and her mothers and to all her sisters and brothersthe glorious family of the wacklesesall the wackleses in one glassdown with it to the dregs  well said richard swiveller stopping short in the act of raising the glass to his lips and looking at the dwarf in a species of stupor as he flourished his arms and legs about youre a jolly fellow but of all the jolly fellows i ever saw or heard of you have the queerest and most extraordinary way with you upon my life you have  this candid declaration tended rather to increase than restrain mr quilps eccentricities and richard swiveller astonished to see him in such a roystering vein and drinking not a little himself for companybegan imperceptibly to become more companionable and confiding so that being judiciously led on by mr quilp he grew at last very confiding indeed  having once got him into this mood and knowing now the keynote to strike whenever he was at a loss daniel quilps task was comparatively an easy one and he was soon in possession of the whole details of the scheme contrived between the easy dick and his more designing friend  stop said quilp  thats the thing thats the thing  it can be brought about it shall be brought about  theres my hand upon it i am your friend from this minute  what do you think theres still a chance inquired dick in surprise at this encouragement  a chance echoed the dwarf a certainty  sophy wackles may become a cheggs or anything else she likes but not a swiveller  oh you lucky dog  hes richer than any jew alive youre a made man  i see in you now nothing but nellys husband rolling in gold and silver  ill help you  it shall be done  mind my words it shall be done  but how said dick  theres plenty of time rejoined the dwarf and it shall be done well sit down and talk it over again all the way through  fill your glass while im gone  i shall be back directlydirectly  with these hasty words daniel quilp withdrew into a dismantled skittleground behind the publichouse and throwing himself upon the ground actually screamed and rolled about in uncontrollable delight  heres sport he cried sport ready to my hand all invented and arranged and only to be enjoyed  it was this shallowpated fellow who made my bones ache tother day was it  it was his friend and fellowplotter mr trent that once made eyes at mrs quilp and leered and looked was it  after labouring for two or three years in their precious scheme to find that theyve got a beggar at last and one of them tied for life  ha ha ha  he shall marry nell  he shall have her and ill be the first man when the knots tied hard and fast to tell em what theyve gained and what ive helped em to  here will be a clearing of old scores here will be a time to remind em what a capital friend i was and how i helped them to the heiress  ha ha ha  in the height of his ecstasy mr quilp had like to have met with a disagreeable check for rolling very near a broken dogkennel there leapt forth a large fierce dog who but that his chain was of the shortest would have given him a disagreeable salute  as it was the dwarf remained upon his back in perfect safety taunting the dog with hideous faces and triumphing over him in his inability to advance another inch though there were not a couple of feet between them  why dont you come and bite me why dont you come and tear me to pieces you coward said quilp hissing and worrying the animal till he was nearly mad  youre afraid you bully youre afraid you know you are  the dog tore and strained at his chain with starting eyes and furious bark but there the dwarf lay snapping his fingers with gestures of defiance and contempt  when he had sufficiently recovered from his delight he rose and with his arms akimbo achieved a kind of demondance round the kennel just without the limits of the chain driving the dog quite wild  having by this means composed his spirits and put himself in a pleasant train he returned to his unsuspicious companion whom he found looking at the tide with exceeding gravity and thinking of that same gold and silver which mr quilp had mentioned     chapter 22  the remainder of that day and the whole of the next were a busy time for the nubbles family to whom everything connected with kits outfit and departure was matter of as great moment as if he had been about to penetrate into the interior of africa or to take a cruise round the world  it would be difficult to suppose that there ever was a box which was opened and shut so many times within fourandtwenty hours as that which contained his wardrobe and necessaries and certainly there never was one which to two small eyes presented such a mine of clothing as this mighty chest with its three shirts and proportionate allowance of stockings and pockethandkerchiefs disclosed to the astonished vision of little jacob  at last it was conveyed to the carriers at whose house at finchley kit was to find it next day and the box being gone there remained but two questions for consideration firstly whether the carrier would lose or dishonestly feign to lose the box upon the road secondly whether kits mother perfectly understood how to take care of herself in the absence of her son  i dont think theres hardly a chance of his really losing it but carriers are under great temptation to pretend they lose things no doubt said mrs nubbles apprehensively in reference to the first point  no doubt about it returned kit with a serious look upon my word mother i dont think it was right to trust it to itself  somebody ought to have gone with it im afraid  we cant help it now said his mother but it was foolish and wrong people oughtnt to be tempted  kit inwardly resolved that he would never tempt a carrier any more save with an empty box and having formed this christian determination he turned his thoughts to the second question  you know you must keep up your spirits mother and not be lonesome because im not at home  i shall very often be able to look in when i come into town i dare say and i shall send you a letter sometimes and when the quarter comes round i can get a holiday of course and then see if we dont take little jacob to the play and let him know what oysters means  i hope plays maynt be sinful kit but im amost afraid said mrs nubbles  i know who has been putting that in your head rejoined her son disconsolately thats little bethel again  now i say mother pray dont take to going there regularly for if i was to see your goodhumoured face that has always made home cheerful turned into a grievous one and the baby trained to look grievous too and to call itself a young sinner bless its heart and a child of the devil which is calling its dead father names if i was to see this and see little jacob looking grievous likewise i should so take it to heart that im sure i should go and list for a soldier and run my head on purpose against the first cannonball i saw coming my way  oh kit dont talk like that  i would indeed mother and unless you want to make me feel very wretched and uncomfortable youll keep that bow on your bonnet which youd more than half a mind to pull off last week  can you suppose theres any harm in looking as cheerful and being as cheerful as our poor circumstances will permit  do i see anything in the way im made which calls upon me to be a snivelling solemn whispering chap sneaking about as if i couldnt help it and expressing myself in a most unpleasant snuffle  on the contrary dont i see every reason why i shouldnt  just hear this  ha ha ha  ant that as natral as walking and as good for the health  ha ha ha  ant that as natral as a sheeps bleating or a pigs grunting or a horses neighing or a birds singing  ha ha ha  isnt it mother  there was something contagious in kits laugh for his mother who had looked grave before first subsided into a smile and then fell to joining in it heartily which occasioned kit to say that he knew it was natural and to laugh the more  kit and his mother laughing together in a pretty loud key woke the baby who finding that there was something very jovial and agreeable in progress was no sooner in its mothers arms than it began to kick and laugh most vigorously  this new illustration of his argument so tickled kit that he fell backward in his chair in a state of exhaustion pointing at the baby and shaking his sides till he rocked again  after recovering twice or thrice and as often relapsing he wiped his eyes and said grace and a very cheerful meal their scanty supper was  with more kisses and hugs and tears than many young gentlemen who start upon their travels and leave wellstocked homes behind them would deem within the bounds of probability if matter so low could be herein set down kit left the house at an early hour next morning and set out to walk to finchley feeling a sufficient pride in his appearance to have warranted his excommunication from little bethel from that time forth if he had ever been one of that mournful congregation  lest anybody should feel a curiosity to know how kit was clad it may be briefly remarked that he wore no livery but was dressed in a coat of pepperandsalt with waistcoat of canary colour and nether garments of irongrey besides these glories he shone in the lustre of a new pair of boots and an extremely stiff and shiny hat which on being struck anywhere with the knuckles sounded like a drum  and in this attire rather wondering that he attracted so little attention and attributing the circumstance to the insensibility of those who got up early he made his way towards abel cottage  without encountering any more remarkable adventure on the road than meeting a lad in a brimless hat the exact counterpart of his old one on whom he bestowed half the sixpence he possessed kit arrived in course of time at the carriers house where to the lasting honour of human nature he found the box in safety  receiving from the wife of this immaculate man a direction to mr garlands he took the box upon his shoulder and repaired thither directly  to be sure it was a beautiful little cottage with a thatched roof and little spires at the gableends and pieces of stained glass in some of the windows almost as large as pocketbooks  on one side of the house was a little stable just the size for the pony with a little room over it just the size for kit  white curtains were fluttering and birds in cages that looked as bright as if they were made of gold were singing at the windows plants were arranged on either side of the path and clustered about the door and the garden was bright with flowers in full bloom which shed a sweet odour all round and had a charming and elegant appearance  everything within the house and without seemed to be the perfection of neatness and order  in the garden there was not a weed to be seen and to judge from some dapper gardeningtools a basket and a pair of gloves which were lying in one of the walks old mr garland had been at work in it that very morning  kit looked about him and admired and looked again and this a great many times before he could make up his mind to turn his head another way and ring the bell  there was abundance of time to look about him again though when he had rung it for nobody came so after ringing it twice or thrice he sat down upon his box and waited  he rang the bell a great many times and yet nobody came  but at last as he was sitting upon the box thinking about giants castles and princesses tied up to pegs by the hair of their heads and dragons bursting out from behind gates and other incidents of the like nature common in storybooks to youths of low degree on their first visit to strange houses the door was gently opened and a little servantgirl very tidy modest and demure but very pretty too appeared  i suppose youre christopher sir said the servantgirl  kit got off the box and said yes he was  im afraid youve rung a good many times perhaps she rejoined but we couldnt hear you because weve been catching the pony  kit rather wondered what this meant but as he couldnt stop there asking questions he shouldered the box again and followed the girl into the hall where through a backdoor he descried mr garland leading whisker in triumph up the garden after that selfwilled pony had as he afterwards learned dodged the family round a small paddock in the rear for one hour and three quarters  the old gentleman received him very kindly and so did the old lady whose previous good opinion of him was greatly enhanced by his wiping his boots on the mat until the soles of his feet burnt again  he was then taken into the parlour to be inspected in his new clothes and when he had been surveyed several times and had afforded by his appearance unlimited satisfaction he was taken into the stable where the pony received him with uncommon complaisance and thence into the little chamber he had already observed which was very clean and comfortable and thence into the garden in which the old gentleman told him he would be taught to employ himself and where he told him besides what great things he meant to do to make him comfortable and happy if he found he deserved it  all these kindnesses kit acknowledged with various expressions of gratitude and so many touches of the new hat that the brim suffered considerably  when the old gentleman had said all he had to say in the way of promise and advice and kit had said all he had to say in the way of assurance and thankfulness he was handed over again to the old lady who summoning the little servantgirl whose name was barbara instructed her to take him down stairs and give him something to eat and drink after his walk  down stairs therefore kit went and at the bottom of the stairs there was such a kitchen as was never before seen or heard of out of a toyshop window with everything in it as bright and glowing and as precisely ordered too as barbara herself  and in this kitchen kit sat himself down at a table as white as a tablecloth to eat cold meat and drink small ale and use his knife and fork the more awkwardly because there was an unknown barbara looking on and observing him  it did not appear however that there was anything remarkably tremendous about this strange barbara who having lived a very quiet life blushed very much and was quite as embarrassed and uncertain what she ought to say or do as kit could possibly be  when he had sat for some little time attentive to the ticking of the sober clock he ventured to glance curiously at the dresser and there among the plates and dishes were barbaras little workbox with a sliding lid to shut in the balls of cotton and barbaras prayerbook and barbaras hymnbook and barbaras bible  barbaras little lookingglass hung in a good light near the window and barbaras bonnet was on a nail behind the door  from all these mute signs and tokens of her presence he naturally glanced at barbara herself who sat as mute as they shelling peas into a dish and just when kit was looking at her eyelashes and wonderingquite in the simplicity of his heartwhat colour her eyes might be it perversely happened that barbara raised her head a little to look at him when both pair of eyes were hastily withdrawn and kit leant over his plate and barbara over her peashells each in extreme confusion at having been detected by the other     chapter 23  mr richard swiveller wending homeward from the wilderness for such was the appropriate name of quilps choice retreat after a sinuous and corkscrew fashion with many checks and stumbles after stopping suddenly and staring about him then as suddenly running forward for a few paces and as suddenly halting again and shaking his head doing everything with a jerk and nothing by premeditationmr richard swiveller wending his way homeward after this fashion which is considered by evilminded men to be symbolical of intoxication and is not held by such persons to denote that state of deep wisdom and reflection in which the actor knows himself to be began to think that possibly he had misplaced his confidence and that the dwarf might not be precisely the sort of person to whom to entrust a secret of such delicacy and importance  and being led and tempted on by this remorseful thought into a condition which the evilminded class before referred to would term the maudlin state or stage of drunkenness it occurred to mr swiveller to cast his hat upon the ground and moan crying aloud that he was an unhappy orphan and that if he had not been an unhappy orphan things had never come to this  left an infant by my parents at an early age said mr swiveller bewailing his hard lot cast upon the world in my tenderest period and thrown upon the mercies of a deluding dwarf who can wonder at my weakness  heres a miserable orphan for you  here said mr swiveller raising his voice to a high pitch and looking sleepily round is a miserable orphan  then said somebody hard by let me be a father to you  mr swiveller swayed himself to and fro to preserve his balance and looking into a kind of haze which seemed to surround him at last perceived two eyes dimly twinkling through the mist which he observed after a short time were in the neighbourhood of a nose and mouth casting his eyes down towards that quarter in which with reference to a mans face his legs are usually to be found he observed that the face had a body attached and when he looked more intently he was satisfied that the person was mr quilp who indeed had been in his company all the time but whom he had some vague idea of having left a mile or two behind  you have deceived an orphan sir said mr swiveller solemnly  i  im a second father to you replied quilp  you my father sir retorted dick  being all right myself sir i request to be left aloneinstantly sir  what a funny fellow you are cried quilp  go sir returned dick leaning against a post and waving his hand go deceiver go some day sir praps youll waken from pleasures dream to know the grief of orphans forsaken  will you go sir  the dwarf taking no heed of this adjuration mr swiveller advanced with the view of inflicting upon him condign chastisement  but forgetting his purpose or changing his mind before he came close to him he seized his hand and vowed eternal friendship declaring with an agreeable frankness that from that time forth they were brothers in everything but personal appearance  then he told his secret over again with the addition of being pathetic on the subject of miss wackles who he gave mr quilp to understand was the occasion of any slight incoherency he might observe in his speech at that moment which was attributable solely to the strength of his affection and not to rosy wine or other fermented liquor  and then they went on arminarm very lovingly together  im as sharp said quilp to him at parting as sharp as a ferret and as cunning as a weazel  you bring trent to me assure him that im his friend though i fear he a little distrusts me i dont know why i have not deserved it and youve both of you made your fortunesin perspective  thats the worst of it returned dick  these fortunes in perspective look such a long way off  but they look smaller than they really are on that account said quilp pressing his arm  youll have no conception of the value of your prize until you draw close to it  mark that  dye think not said dick  aye i do and i am certain of what i say thats better returned the dwarf  you bring trent to me  tell him i am his friend and yourswhy shouldnt i be  theres no reason why you shouldnt certainly replied dick and perhaps there are a great many why you shouldat least there would be nothing strange in your wanting to be my friend if you were a choice spirit but then you know youre not a choice spirit  i not a choice spirit cried quilp  devil a bit sir returned dick  a man of your appearance couldnt be  if youre any spirit at all sir youre an evil spirit  choice spirits added dick smiting himself on the breast are quite a different looking sort of people you may take your oath of that sir  quilp glanced at his freespoken friend with a mingled expression of cunning and dislike and wringing his hand almost at the same moment declared that he was an uncommon character and had his warmest esteem with that they parted mr swiveller to make the best of his way home and sleep himself sober and quilp to cogitate upon the discovery he had made and exult in the prospect of the rich field of enjoyment and reprisal it opened to him  it was not without great reluctance and misgiving that mr swiveller next morning his head racked by the fumes of the renowned schiedam repaired to the lodging of his friend trent which was in the roof of an old house in an old ghostly inn and recounted by very slow degrees what had yesterday taken place between him and quilp  nor was it without great surprise and much speculation on quilps probable motives nor without many bitter comments on dick swivellers folly that his friend received the tale  i dont defend myself fred said the penitent richard but the fellow has such a queer way with him and is such an artful dog that first of all he set me upon thinking whether there was any harm in telling him and while i was thinking screwed it out of me  if you had seen him drink and smoke as i did you couldnt have kept anything from him  hes a salamander you know thats what he is  without inquiring whether salamanders were of necessity good confidential agents or whether a fireproof man was as a matter of course trustworthy frederick trent threw himself into a chair and burying his head in his hands endeavoured to fathom the motives which had led quilp to insinuate himself into richard swivellers confidencefor that the disclosure was of his seeking and had not been spontaneously revealed by dick was sufficiently plain from quilps seeking his company and enticing him away  the dwarf had twice encountered him when he was endeavouring to obtain intelligence of the fugitives  this perhaps as he had not shown any previous anxiety about them was enough to awaken suspicion in the breast of a creature so jealous and distrustful by nature setting aside any additional impulse to curiosity that he might have derived from dicks incautious manner  but knowing the scheme they had planned why should he offer to assist it  this was a question more difficult of solution but as knaves generally overreach themselves by imputing their own designs to others the idea immediately presented itself that some circumstances of irritation between quilp and the old man arising out of their secret transactions and not unconnected perhaps with his sudden disappearance now rendered the former desirous of revenging himself upon him by seeking to entrap the sole object of his love and anxiety into a connexion of which he knew he had a dread and hatred  as frederick trent himself utterly regardless of his sister had this object at heart only second to the hope of gain it seemed to him the more likely to be quilps main principle of action once investing the dwarf with a design of his own in abetting them which the attainment of their purpose would serve it was easy to believe him sincere and hearty in the cause and as there could be no doubt of his proving a powerful and useful auxiliary trent determined to accept his invitation and go to his house that night and if what he said and did confirmed him in the impression he had formed to let him share the labour of their plan but not the profit  having revolved these things in his mind and arrived at this conclusion he communicated to mr swiveller as much of his meditations as he thought proper dick would have been perfectly satisfied with less and giving him the day to recover himself from his late salamandering accompanied him at evening to mr quilps house  mighty glad mr quilp was to see them or mightily glad he seemed to be and fearfully polite mr quilp was to mrs quilp and mrs jiniwin and very sharp was the look he cast on his wife to observe how she was affected by the recognition of young trent  mrs quilp was as innocent as her own mother of any emotion painful or pleasant which the sight of him awakened but as her husbands glance made her timid and confused and uncertain what to do or what was required of her mr quilp did not fail to assign her embarrassment to the cause he had in his mind and while he chuckled at his penetration was secretly exasperated by his jealousy  nothing of this appeared however  on the contrary mr quilp was all blandness and suavity and presided over the casebottle of rum with extraordinary openheartedness  why let me see said quilp  it must be a matter of nearly two years since we were first acquainted  nearer three i think said trent  nearer three cried quilp  how fast time flies  does it seem as long as that to you mrs quilp  yes i think it seems full three years quilp was the unfortunate reply  oh indeed maam thought quilp you have been pining have you very good maam  it seems to me but yesterday that you went out to demerara in the mary anne said quilp but yesterday i declare  well i like a little wildness  i was wild myself once  mr quilp accompanied this admission with such an awful wink indicative of old rovings and backslidings that mrs jiniwin was indignant and could not forbear from remarking under her breath that he might at least put off his confessions until his wife was absent for which act of boldness and insubordination mr quilp first stared her out of countenance and then drank her health ceremoniously  i thought youd come back directly fred  i always thought that said quilp setting down his glass  and when the mary anne returned with you on board instead of a letter to say what a contrite heart you had and how happy you were in the situation that had been provided for you i was amusedexceedingly amused  ha ha ha  the young man smiled but not as though the theme was the most agreeable one that could have been selected for his entertainment and for that reason quilp pursued it  i always will say he resumed that when a rich relation having two young peoplesisters or brothers or brother and sisterdependent on him attaches himself exclusively to one and casts off the other he does wrong  the young man made a movement of impatience but quilp went on as calmly as if he were discussing some abstract question in which nobody present had the slightest personal interest  its very true said quilp that your grandfather urged repeated forgiveness ingratitude riot and extravagance and all that but as i told him these are common faults  but hes a scoundrel said he granting that said i for the sake of argument of course a great many young noblemen and gentlemen are scoundrels too but he wouldnt be convinced  i wonder at that mr quilp said the young man sarcastically  well so did i at the time returned quilp but he was always obstinate  he was in a manner a friend of mine but he was always obstinate and wrongheaded  little nell is a nice girl a charming girl but youre her brother frederick  youre her brother after all as you told him the last time you met he cant alter that  he would if he could confound him for that and all other kindnesses said the young man impatiently  but nothing can come of this subject now and let us have done with it in the devils name  agreed returned quilp agreed on my part readily  why have i alluded to it  just to show you frederick that i have always stood your friend  you little knew who was your friend and who your foe now did you  you thought i was against you and so there has been a coolness between us but it was all on your side entirely on your side  lets shake hands again fred  with his head sunk down between his shoulders and a hideous grin overspreading his face the dwarf stood up and stretched his short arm across the table  after a moments hesitation the young man stretched out his to meet it quilp clutched his fingers in a grip that for the moment stopped the current of the blood within them and pressing his other hand upon his lip and frowning towards the unsuspicious richard released them and sat down  this action was not lost upon trent who knowing that richard swiveller was a mere tool in his hands and knew no more of his designs than he thought proper to communicate saw that the dwarf perfectly understood their relative position and fully entered into the character of his friend  it is something to be appreciated even in knavery  this silent homage to his superior abilities no less than a sense of the power with which the dwarfs quick perception had already invested him inclined the young man towards that ugly worthy and determined him to profit by his aid  it being now mr quilps cue to change the subject with all convenient expedition lest richard swiveller in his heedlessness should reveal anything which it was inexpedient for the women to know he proposed a game at fourhanded cribbage and partners being cut for mrs quilp fell to frederick trent and dick himself to quilp  mrs jiniwin being very fond of cards was carefully excluded by her soninlaw from any participation in the game and had assigned to her the duty of occasionally replenishing the glasses from the casebottle mr quilp from that moment keeping one eye constantly upon her lest she should by any means procure a taste of the same and thereby tantalising the wretched old lady who was as much attached to the casebottle as the cards in a double degree and most ingenious manner  but it was not to mrs jiniwin alone that mr quilps attention was restricted as several other matters required his constant vigilance among his various eccentric habits he had a humorous one of always cheating at cards which rendered necessary on his part not only a close observance of the game and a sleightofhand in counting and scoring but also involved the constant correction by looks and frowns and kicks under the table of richard swiveller who being bewildered by the rapidity with which his cards were told and the rate at which the pegs travelled down the board could not be prevented from sometimes expressing his surprise and incredulity  mrs quilp too was the partner of young trent and for every look that passed between them and every word they spoke and every card they played the dwarf had eyes and ears not occupied alone with what was passing above the table but with signals that might be exchanging beneath it which he laid all kinds of traps to detect besides often treading on his wifes toes to see whether she cried out or remained silent under the infliction in which latter case it would have been quite clear that trent had been treading on her toes before  yet in the most of all these distractions the one eye was upon the old lady always and if she so much as stealthily advanced a teaspoon towards a neighbouring glass which she often did for the purpose of abstracting but one sup of its sweet contents quilps hand would overset it in the very moment of her triumph and quilps mocking voice implore her to regard her precious health  and in any one of these his many cares from first to last quilp never flagged nor faltered  at length when they had played a great many rubbers and drawn pretty freely upon the casebottle mr quilp warned his lady to retire to rest and that submissive wife complying and being followed by her indignant mother mr swiveller fell asleep  the dwarf beckoning his remaining companion to the other end of the room held a short conference with him in whispers  its as well not to say more than one can help before our worthy friend said quilp making a grimace towards the slumbering dick  is it a bargain between us fred  shall he marry little rosy nell byandby  you have some end of your own to answer of course returned the other  of course i have dear fred said quilp grinning to think how little he suspected what the real end was  its retaliation perhaps perhaps whim  i have influence fred to help or oppose  which way shall i use it  there are a pair of scales and it goes into one  throw it into mine then said trent  its done fred rejoined quilp stretching out his clenched hand and opening it as if he had let some weight fall out  its in the scale from this time and turns it fred  mind that  where have they gone asked trent  quilp shook his head and said that point remained to be discovered which it might be easily  when it was they would begin their preliminary advances  he would visit the old man or even richard swiveller might visit him and by affecting a deep concern in his behalf and imploring him to settle in some worthy home lead to the childs remembering him with gratitude and favour  once impressed to this extent it would be easy he said to win her in a year or two for she supposed the old man to be poor as it was a part of his jealous policy in common with many other misers to feign to be so to those about him  he has feigned it often enough to me of late said trent  oh and to me too replied the dwarf  which is more extraordinary as i know how rich he really is  i suppose you should said trent  i think i should indeed rejoined the dwarf and in that at least he spoke the truth  after a few more whispered words they returned to the table and the young man rousing richard swiveller informed him that he was waiting to depart  this was welcome news to dick who started up directly  after a few words of confidence in the result of their project had been exchanged they bade the grinning quilp good night  quilp crept to the window as they passed in the street below and listened  trent was pronouncing an encomium upon his wife and they were both wondering by what enchantment she had been brought to marry such a misshapen wretch as he  the dwarf after watching their retreating shadows with a wider grin than his face had yet displayed stole softly in the dark to bed  in this hatching of their scheme neither trent nor quilp had had one thought about the happiness or misery of poor innocent nell  it would have been strange if the careless profligate who was the butt of both had been harassed by any such consideration for his high opinion of his own merits and deserts rendered the project rather a laudable one than otherwise and if he had been visited by so unwonted a guest as reflection he wouldbeing a brute only in the gratification of his appetiteshave soothed his conscience with the plea that he did not mean to beat or kill his wife and would therefore after all said and done be a very tolerable average husband     chapter 24  it was not until they were quite exhausted and could no longer maintain the pace at which they had fled from the raceground that the old man and the child ventured to stop and sit down to rest upon the borders of a little wood  here though the course was hidden from their view they could yet faintly distinguish the noise of distant shouts the hum of voices and the beating of drums  climbing the eminence which lay between them and the spot they had left the child could even discern the fluttering flags and white tops of booths but no person was approaching towards them and their restingplace was solitary and still  some time elapsed before she could reassure her trembling companion or restore him to a state of moderate tranquillity  his disordered imagination represented to him a crowd of persons stealing towards them beneath the cover of the bushes lurking in every ditch and peeping from the boughs of every rustling tree  he was haunted by apprehensions of being led captive to some gloomy place where he would be chained and scourged and worse than all where nell could never come to see him save through iron bars and gratings in the wall  his terrors affected the child  separation from her grandfather was the greatest evil she could dread and feeling for the time as though go where they would they were to be hunted down and could never be safe but in hiding her heart failed her and her courage drooped  in one so young and so unused to the scenes in which she had lately moved this sinking of the spirit was not surprising  but nature often enshrines gallant and noble hearts in weak bosomsoftenest god bless her in female breastsand when the child casting her tearful eyes upon the old man remembered how weak he was and how destitute and helpless he would be if she failed him her heart swelled within her and animated her with new strength and fortitude  we are quite safe now and have nothing to fear indeed dear grandfather she said  nothing to fear returned the old man  nothing to fear if they took me from thee  nothing to fear if they parted us  nobody is true to me  no not one  not even nell  oh do not say that replied the child for if ever anybody was true at heart and earnest i am  i am sure you know i am  then how said the old man looking fearfully round how can you bear to think that we are safe when they are searching for me everywhere and may come here and steal upon us even while were talking  because im sure we have not been followed said the child  judge for yourself dear grandfather look round and see how quiet and still it is  we are alone together and may ramble where we like  not safe could i feel easydid i feel at easewhen any danger threatened you  true too he answered pressing her hand but still looking anxiously about  what noise was that  a bird said the child flying into the wood and leading the way for us to follow  you remember that we said we would walk in woods and fields and by the side of rivers and how happy we would beyou remember that  but here while the sun shines above our heads and everything is bright and happy we are sitting sadly down and losing time  see what a pleasant path and theres the birdthe same birdnow he flies to another tree and stays to sing  come  when they rose up from the ground and took the shady track which led them through the wood she bounded on before printing her tiny footsteps in the moss which rose elastic from so light a pressure and gave it back as mirrors throw off breath and thus she lured the old man on with many a backward look and merry beck now pointing stealthily to some lone bird as it perched and twittered on a branch that strayed across their path now stopping to listen to the songs that broke the happy silence or watch the sun as it trembled through the leaves and stealing in among the ivied trunks of stout old trees opened long paths of light  as they passed onward parting the boughs that clustered in their way the serenity which the child had first assumed stole into her breast in earnest the old man cast no longer fearful looks behind but felt at ease and cheerful for the further they passed into the deep green shade the more they felt that the tranquil mind of god was there and shed its peace on them  at length the path becoming clearer and less intricate brought them to the end of the wood and into a public road  taking their way along it for a short distance they came to a lane so shaded by the trees on either hand that they met together overhead and arched the narrow way  a broken fingerpost announced that this led to a village three miles off and thither they resolved to bend their steps  the miles appeared so long that they sometimes thought they must have missed their road  but at last to their great joy it led downwards in a steep descent with overhanging banks over which the footpaths led and the clustered houses of the village peeped from the woody hollow below  it was a very small place  the men and boys were playing at cricket on the green and as the other folks were looking on they wandered up and down uncertain where to seek a humble lodging  there was but one old man in the little garden before his cottage and him they were timid of approaching for he was the schoolmaster and had school written up over his window in black letters on a white board  he was a pale simplelooking man of a spare and meagre habit and sat among his flowers and beehives smoking his pipe in the little porch before his door  speak to him dear the old man whispered  i am almost afraid to disturb him said the child timidly  he does not seem to see us  perhaps if we wait a little he may look this way  they waited but the schoolmaster cast no look towards them and still sat thoughtful and silent in the little porch  he had a kind face in his plain old suit of black he looked pale and meagre  they fancied too a lonely air about him and his house but perhaps that was because the other people formed a merry company upon the green and he seemed the only solitary man in all the place  they were very tired and the child would have been bold enough to address even a schoolmaster but for something in his manner which seemed to denote that he was uneasy or distressed  as they stood hesitating at a little distance they saw that he sat for a few minutes at a time like one in a brown study then laid aside his pipe and took a few turns in his garden then approached the gate and looked towards the green then took up his pipe again with a sigh and sat down thoughtfully as before  as nobody else appeared and it would soon be dark nell at length took courage and when he had resumed his pipe and seat ventured to draw near leading her grandfather by the hand  the slight noise they made in raising the latch of the wicketgate caught his attention  he looked at them kindly but seemed disappointed too and slightly shook his head  nell dropped a curtsey and told him they were poor travellers who sought a shelter for the night which they would gladly pay for so far as their means allowed  the schoolmaster looked earnestly at her as she spoke laid aside his pipe and rose up directly  if you could direct us anywhere sir said the child we should take it very kindly  you have been walking a long way said the schoolmaster  a long way sir the child replied  youre a young traveller my child he said laying his hand gently on her head  your grandchild friend  aye sir cried the old man and the stay and comfort of my life  come in said the schoolmaster  without further preface he conducted them into his little schoolroom which was parlour and kitchen likewise and told them that they were welcome to remain under his roof till morning  before they had done thanking him he spread a coarse white cloth upon the table with knives and platters and bringing out some bread and cold meat and a jug of beer besought them to eat and drink  the child looked round the room as she took her seat  there were a couple of forms notched and cut and inked all over a small deal desk perched on four legs at which no doubt the master sat a few dogseared books upon a high shelf and beside them a motley collection of pegtops balls kites fishinglines marbles halfeaten apples and other confiscated property of idle urchins displayed on hooks upon the wall in all their terrors were the cane and ruler and near them on a small shelf of its own the dunces cap made of old newspapers and decorated with glaring wafers of the largest size  but the great ornaments of the walls were certain moral sentences fairly copied in good round text and wellworked sums in simple addition and multiplication evidently achieved by the same hand which were plentifully pasted all round the room for the double purpose as it seemed of bearing testimony to the excellence of the school and kindling a worthy emulation in the bosoms of the scholars  yes said the old schoolmaster observing that her attention was caught by these latter specimens  thats beautiful writing my dear  very sir replied the child modestly is it yours  mine he returned taking out his spectacles and putting them on to have a better view of the triumphs so dear to his heart  i couldnt write like that nowadays  no  theyre all done by one hand a little hand it is not so old as yours but a very clever one  as the schoolmaster said this he saw that a small blot of ink had been thrown on one of the copies so he took a penknife from his pocket and going up to the wall carefully scraped it out  when he had finished he walked slowly backward from the writing admiring it as one might contemplate a beautiful picture but with something of sadness in his voice and manner which quite touched the child though she was unacquainted with its cause  a little hand indeed said the poor schoolmaster  far beyond all his companions in his learning and his sports too how did he ever come to be so fond of me  that i should love him is no wonder but that he should love me and there the schoolmaster stopped and took off his spectacles to wipe them as though they had grown dim  i hope there is nothing the matter sir said nell anxiously  not much my dear returned the schoolmaster  i hoped to have seen him on the green tonight  he was always foremost among them  but hell be there tomorrow  has he been ill asked the child with a childs quick sympathy  not very  they said he was wandering in his head yesterday dear boy and so they said the day before  but thats a part of that kind of disorder its not a bad signnot at all a bad sign the child was silent  he walked to the door and looked wistfully out  the shadows of night were gathering and all was still  if he could lean upon anybodys arm he would come to me i know he said returning into the room  he always came into the garden to say good night  but perhaps his illness has only just taken a favourable turn and its too late for him to come out for its very damp and theres a heavy dew  its much better he shouldnt come tonight  the schoolmaster lighted a candle fastened the windowshutter and closed the door  but after he had done this and sat silent a little time he took down his hat and said he would go and satisfy himself if nell would sit up till he returned  the child readily complied and he went out  she sat there halfanhour or more feeling the place very strange and lonely for she had prevailed upon the old man to go to bed and there was nothing to be heard but the ticking of an old clock and the whistling of the wind among the trees  when he returned he took his seat in the chimney corner but remained silent for a long time  at length he turned to her and speaking very gently hoped she would say a prayer that night for a sick child  my favourite scholar said the poor schoolmaster smoking a pipe he had forgotten to light and looking mournfully round upon the walls it is a little hand to have done all that and waste away with sickness  it is a very very little hand     chapter 25  after a sound nights rest in a chamber in the thatched roof in which it seemed the sexton had for some years been a lodger but which he had lately deserted for a wife and a cottage of his own the child rose early in the morning and descended to the room where she had supped last night  as the schoolmaster had already left his bed and gone out she bestirred herself to make it neat and comfortable and had just finished its arrangement when the kind host returned  he thanked her many times and said that the old dame who usually did such offices for him had gone to nurse the little scholar whom he had told her of  the child asked how he was and hoped he was better  no rejoined the schoolmaster shaking his head sorrowfully no better  they even say he is worse  i am very sorry for that sir said the child  the poor schoolmaster appeared to be gratified by her earnest manner but yet rendered more uneasy by it for he added hastily that anxious people often magnified an evil and thought it greater than it was for my part he said in his quiet patient way i hope its not so  i dont think he can be worse  the child asked his leave to prepare breakfast and her grandfather coming down stairs they all three partook of it together  while the meal was in progress their host remarked that the old man seemed much fatigued and evidently stood in need of rest  if the journey you have before you is a long one he said and dont press you for one day youre very welcome to pass another night here i should really be glad if you would friend  he saw that the old man looked at nell uncertain whether to accept or decline his offer and added  i shall be glad to have your young companion with me for one day  if you can do a charity to a lone man and rest yourself at the same time do so  if you must proceed upon your journey i wish you well through it and will walk a little way with you before school begins  what are we to do nell said the old man irresolutely say what were to do dear  it required no great persuasion to induce the child to answer that they had better accept the invitation and remain  she was happy to show her gratitude to the kind schoolmaster by busying herself in the performance of such household duties as his little cottage stood in need of  when these were done she took some needlework from her basket and sat herself down upon a stool beside the lattice where the honeysuckle and woodbine entwined their tender stems and stealing into the room filled it with their delicious breath  her grandfather was basking in the sun outside breathing the perfume of the flowers and idly watching the clouds as they floated on before the light summer wind  as the schoolmaster after arranging the two forms in due order took his seat behind his desk and made other preparations for school the child was apprehensive that she might be in the way and offered to withdraw to her little bedroom  but this he would not allow and as he seemed pleased to have her there she remained busying herself with her work  have you many scholars sir she asked  the poor schoolmaster shook his head and said that they barely filled the two forms  are the others clever sir asked the child glancing at the trophies on the wall  good boys returned the schoolmaster good boys enough my dear but theyll never do like that  a small whiteheaded boy with a sunburnt face appeared at the door while he was speaking and stopping there to make a rustic bow came in and took his seat upon one of the forms  the whiteheaded boy then put an open book astonishingly dogseared upon his knees and thrusting his hands into his pockets began counting the marbles with which they were filled displaying in the expression of his face a remarkable capacity of totally abstracting his mind from the spelling on which his eyes were fixed  soon afterwards another whiteheaded little boy came straggling in and after him a redheaded lad and after him two more with white heads and then one with a flaxen poll and so on until the forms were occupied by a dozen boys or thereabouts with heads of every colour but grey and ranging in their ages from four years old to fourteen years or more for the legs of the youngest were a long way from the floor when he sat upon the form and the eldest was a heavy goodtempered foolish fellow about half a head taller than the schoolmaster  at the top of the first formthe post of honour in the schoolwas the vacant place of the little sick scholar and at the head of the row of pegs on which those who came in hats or caps were wont to hang them up one was left empty  no boy attempted to violate the sanctity of seat or peg but many a one looked from the empty spaces to the schoolmaster and whispered his idle neighbour behind his hand  then began the hum of conning over lessons and getting them by heart the whispered jest and stealthy game and all the noise and drawl of school and in the midst of the din sat the poor schoolmaster the very image of meekness and simplicity vainly attempting to fix his mind upon the duties of the day and to forget his little friend  but the tedium of his office reminded him more strongly of the willing scholar and his thoughts were rambling from his pupilsit was plain  none knew this better than the idlest boys who growing bolder with impunity waxed louder and more daring playing oddoreven under the masters eye eating apples openly and without rebuke pinching each other in sport or malice without the least reserve and cutting their autographs in the very legs of his desk  the puzzled dunce who stood beside it to say his lesson out of book looked no longer at the ceiling for forgotten words but drew closer to the masters elbow and boldly cast his eye upon the page the wag of the little troop squinted and made grimaces at the smallest boy of course holding no book before his face and his approving audience knew no constraint in their delight  if the master did chance to rouse himself and seem alive to what was going on the noise subsided for a moment and no eyes met his but wore a studious and a deeply humble look but the instant he relapsed again it broke out afresh and ten times louder than before  oh how some of those idle fellows longed to be outside and how they looked at the open door and window as if they half meditated rushing violently out plunging into the woods and being wild boys and savages from that time forth  what rebellious thoughts of the cool river and some shady bathingplace beneath willow trees with branches dipping in the water kept tempting and urging that sturdy boy who with his shirtcollar unbuttoned and flung back as far as it could go sat fanning his flushed face with a spellingbook wishing himself a whale or a tittlebat or a fly or anything but a boy at school on that hot broiling day  heat  ask that other boy whose seat being nearest to the door gave him opportunities of gliding out into the garden and driving his companions to madness by dipping his face into the bucket of the well and then rolling on the grassask him if there were ever such a day as that when even the bees were diving deep down into the cups of flowers and stopping there as if they had made up their minds to retire from business and be manufacturers of honey no more  the day was made for laziness and lying on ones back in green places and staring at the sky till its brightness forced one to shut ones eyes and go to sleep and was this a time to be poring over musty books in a dark room slighted by the very sun itself  monstrous  nell sat by the window occupied with her work but attentive still to all that passed though sometimes rather timid of the boisterous boys the lessons over writing time began and there being but one desk and that the masters each boy sat at it in turn and laboured at his crooked copy while the master walked about  this was a quieter time for he would come and look over the writers shoulder and tell him mildly to observe how such a letter was turned in such a copy on the wall praise such an upstroke here and such a downstroke there and bid him take it for his model  then he would stop and tell them what the sick child had said last night and how he had longed to be among them once again and such was the poor schoolmasters gentle and affectionate manner that the boys seemed quite remorseful that they had worried him so much and were absolutely quiet eating no apples cutting no names inflicting no pinches and making no grimaces for full two minutes afterwards  i think boys said the schoolmaster when the clock struck twelve that i shall give an extra halfholiday this afternoon  at this intelligence the boys led on and headed by the tall boy raised a great shout in the midst of which the master was seen to speak but could not be heard  as he held up his hand however in token of his wish that they should be silent they were considerate enough to leave off as soon as the longestwinded among them were quite out of breath  you must promise me first said the schoolmaster that youll not be noisy or at least if you are that youll go away and be soaway out of the village i mean  im sure you wouldnt disturb your old playmate and companion  there was a general murmur and perhaps a very sincere one for they were but boys in the negative and the tall boy perhaps as sincerely as any of them called those about him to witness that he had only shouted in a whisper  then pray dont forget theres my dear scholars said the schoolmaster what i have asked you and do it as a favour to me  be as happy as you can and dont be unmindful that you are blessed with health  goodbye all  thankee sir and goodbye sir were said a good many times in a variety of voices and the boys went out very slowly and softly  but there was the sun shining and there were the birds singing as the sun only shines and the birds only sing on holidays and halfholidays there were the trees waving to all free boys to climb and nestle among their leafy branches the hay entreating them to come and scatter it to the pure air the green corn gently beckoning towards wood and stream the smooth ground rendered smoother still by blending lights and shadows inviting to runs and leaps and long walks god knows whither  it was more than boy could bear and with a joyous whoop the whole cluster took to their heels and spread themselves about shouting and laughing as they went  its natural thank heaven said the poor schoolmaster looking after them  im very glad they didnt mind me  it is difficult however to please everybody as most of us would have discovered even without the fable which bears that moral and in the course of the afternoon several mothers and aunts of pupils looked in to express their entire disapproval of the schoolmasters proceeding a few confined themselves to hints such as politely inquiring what redletter day or saints day the almanack said it was a few these were the profound village politicians argued that it was a slight to the throne and an affront to church and state and savoured of revolutionary principles to grant a halfholiday upon any lighter occasion than the birthday of the monarch but the majority expressed their displeasure on private grounds and in plain terms arguing that to put the pupils on this short allowance of learning was nothing but an act of downright robbery and fraud and one old lady finding that she could not inflame or irritate the peaceable schoolmaster by talking to him bounced out of his house and talked at him for halfanhour outside his own window to another old lady saying that of course he would deduct this halfholiday from his weekly charge or of course he would naturally expect to have an opposition started against him there was no want of idle chaps in that neighbourhood here the old lady raised her voice and some chaps who were too idle even to be schoolmasters might soon find that there were other chaps put over their heads and so she would have them take care and look pretty sharp about them  but all these taunts and vexations failed to elicit one word from the meek schoolmaster who sat with the child by his sidea little more dejected perhaps but quite silent and uncomplaining  towards night an old woman came tottering up the garden as speedily as she could and meeting the schoolmaster at the door said he was to go to dame wests directly and had best run on before her  he and the child were on the point of going out together for a walk and without relinquishing her hand the schoolmaster hurried away leaving the messenger to follow as she might  they stopped at a cottagedoor and the schoolmaster knocked softly at it with his hand  it was opened without loss of time  they entered a room where a little group of women were gathered about one older than the rest who was crying very bitterly and sat wringing her hands and rocking herself to and fro  oh dame said the schoolmaster drawing near her chair is it so bad as this  hes going fast cried the old woman my grandsons dying  its all along of you  you shouldnt see him now but for his being so earnest on it  this is what his learning has brought him to  oh dear dear dear what can i do  do not say that i am in any fault urged the gentle schoolmaster i am not hurt dame  no no  you are in great distress of mind and dont mean what you say  i am sure you dont  i do returned the old woman  i mean it all  if he hadnt been poring over his books out of fear of you he would have been well and merry now i know he would  the schoolmaster looked round upon the other women as if to entreat some one among them to say a kind word for him but they shook their heads and murmured to each other that they never thought there was much good in learning and that this convinced them  without saying a word in reply or giving them a look of reproach he followed the old woman who had summoned him and who had now rejoined them into another room where his infant friend halfdressed lay stretched upon a bed  he was a very young boy quite a little child  his hair still hung in curls about his face and his eyes were very bright but their light was of heaven not earth  the schoolmaster took a seat beside him and stooping over the pillow whispered his name  the boy sprung up stroked his face with his hand and threw his wasted arms round his neck crying out that he was his dear kind friend  i hope i always was  i meant to be god knows said the poor schoolmaster  who is that said the boy seeing nell  i am afraid to kiss her lest i should make her ill  ask her to shake hands with me  the sobbing child came closer up and took the little languid hand in hers releasing his again after a time the sick boy laid him gently down  you remember the garden harry whispered the schoolmaster anxious to rouse him for a dulness seemed gathering upon the child and how pleasant it used to be in the evening time  you must make haste to visit it again for i think the very flowers have missed you and are less gay than they used to be  you will come soon my dear very soon nowwont you  the boy smiled faintlyso very very faintlyand put his hand upon his friends grey head  he moved his lips too but no voice came from them no not a sound  in the silence that ensued the hum of distant voices borne upon the evening air came floating through the open window  whats that said the sick child opening his eyes  the boys at play upon the green  he took a handkerchief from his pillow and tried to wave it above his head  but the feeble arm dropped powerless down  shall i do it said the schoolmaster  please wave it at the window was the faint reply  tie it to the lattice  some of them may see it there  perhaps theyll think of me and look this way  he raised his head and glanced from the fluttering signal to his idle bat that lay with slate and book and other boyish property upon a table in the room  and then he laid him softly down once more and asked if the little girl were there for he could not see her  she stepped forward and pressed the passive hand that lay upon the coverlet  the two old friends and companionsfor such they were though they were man and childheld each other in a long embrace and then the little scholar turned his face towards the wall and fell asleep  the poor schoolmaster sat in the same place holding the small cold hand in his and chafing it  it was but the hand of a dead child  he felt that and yet he chafed it still and could not lay it down     chapter 26  almost brokenhearted nell withdrew with the schoolmaster from the bedside and returned to his cottage  in the midst of her grief and tears she was yet careful to conceal their real cause from the old man for the dead boy had been a grandchild and left but one aged relative to mourn his premature decay  she stole away to bed as quickly as she could and when she was alone gave free vent to the sorrow with which her breast was overcharged but the sad scene she had witnessed was not without its lesson of content and gratitude of content with the lot which left her health and freedom and gratitude that she was spared to the one relative and friend she loved and to live and move in a beautiful world when so many young creaturesas young and full of hope as shewere stricken down and gathered to their graves  how many of the mounds in that old churchyard where she had lately strayed grew green above the graves of children  and though she thought as a child herself and did not perhaps sufficiently consider to what a bright and happy existence those who die young are borne and how in death they lose the pain of seeing others die around them bearing to the tomb some strong affection of their hearts which makes the old die many times in one long life still she thought wisely enough to draw a plain and easy moral from what she had seen that night and to store it deep in her mind  her dreams were of the little scholar not coffined and covered up but mingling with angels and smiling happily  the sun darting his cheerful rays into the room awoke her and now there remained but to take leave of the poor schoolmaster and wander forth once more  by the time they were ready to depart school had begun  in the darkened room the din of yesterday was going on again a little sobered and softened down perhaps but only a very little if at all the schoolmaster rose from his desk and walked with them to the gate  it was with a trembling and reluctant hand that the child held out to him the money which the lady had given her at the races for her flowers faltering in her thanks as she thought how small the sum was and blushing as she offered it  but he bade her put it up and stooping to kiss her cheek turned back into his house  they had not gone halfadozen paces when he was at the door again the old man retraced his steps to shake hands and the child did the same  good fortune and happiness go with you said the poor schoolmaster i am quite a solitary man now  if you ever pass this way again youll not forget the little villageschool  we shall never forget it sir rejoined nell nor ever forget to be grateful to you for your kindness to us  i have heard such words from the lips of children very often said the schoolmaster shaking his head and smiling thoughtfully but they were soon forgotten  i had attached one young friend to me the better friend for being youngbut thats overgod bless you  they bade him farewell very many times and turned away walking slowly and often looking back until they could see him no more  at length they had left the village far behind and even lost sight of the smoke among the trees  they trudged onward now at a quicker pace resolving to keep the main road and go wherever it might lead them  but main roads stretch a long long way  with the exception of two or three inconsiderable clusters of cottages which they passed without stopping and one lonely roadside publichouse where they had some bread and cheese this highway had led them to nothinglate in the afternoonand still lengthened out far in the distance the same dull tedious winding course that they had been pursuing all day  as they had no resource however but to go forward they still kept on though at a much slower pace being very weary and fatigued  the afternoon had worn away into a beautiful evening when they arrived at a point where the road made a sharp turn and struck across a common on the border of this common and close to the hedge which divided it from the cultivated fields a caravan was drawn up to rest upon which by reason of its situation they came so suddenly that they could not have avoided it if they would  it was not a shabby dingy dusty cart but a smart little house upon wheels with white dimity curtains festooning the windows and windowshutters of green picked out with panels of a staring red in which happilycontrasted colours the whole concern shone brilliant neither was it a poor caravan drawn by a single donkey or emaciated horse for a pair of horses in pretty good condition were released from the shafts and grazing on the frouzy grass  neither was it a gipsy caravan for at the open door graced with a bright brass knocker sat a christian lady stout and comfortable to look upon who wore a large bonnet trembling with bows  and that it was not an unprovided or destitute caravan was clear from this ladys occupation which was the very pleasant and refreshing one of taking tea  the teathings including a bottle of rather suspicious character and a cold knuckle of ham were set forth upon a drum covered with a white napkin and there as if at the most convenient roundtable in all the world sat this roving lady taking her tea and enjoying the prospect  it happened that at that moment the lady of the caravan had her cup which that everything about her might be of a stout and comfortable kind was a breakfast cup to her lips and that having her eyes lifted to the sky in her enjoyment of the full flavour of the tea not unmingled possibly with just the slightest dash or gleam of something out of the suspicious bottlebut this is mere speculation and not distinct matter of historyit happened that being thus agreeably engaged she did not see the travellers when they first came up  it was not until she was in the act of getting down the cup and drawing a long breath after the exertion of causing its contents to disappear that the lady of the caravan beheld an old man and a young child walking slowly by and glancing at her proceedings with eyes of modest but hungry admiration  hey cried the lady of the caravan scooping the crumbs out of her lap and swallowing the same before wiping her lips  yes to be surewho won the helterskelter plate child  won what maam asked nell  the helterskelter plate at the races childthe plate that was run for on the second day  on the second day maam  second day  yes second day repeated the lady with an air of impatience  cant you say who won the helterskelter plate when youre asked the question civilly  i dont know maam  dont know repeated the lady of the caravan why you were there i saw you with my own eyes  nell was not a little alarmed to hear this supposing that the lady might be intimately acquainted with the firm of short and codlin but what followed tended to reassure her  and very sorry i was said the lady of the caravan to see you in company with a punch a low practical wulgar wretch that people should scorn to look at  i was not there by choice returned the child we didnt know our way and the two men were very kind to us and let us travel with them do youdo you know them maam  know em child cried the lady of the caravan in a sort of shriek know them  but youre young and inexperienced and thats your excuse for asking sich a question  do i look as if i knowd em does the caravan look as if it knowd em  no maam no said the child fearing she had committed some grievous fault  i beg your pardon  it was granted immediately though the lady still appeared much ruffled and discomposed by the degrading supposition  the child then explained that they had left the races on the first day and were travelling to the next town on that road where they purposed to spend the night  as the countenance of the stout lady began to clear up she ventured to inquire how far it was  the replywhich the stout lady did not come to until she had thoroughly explained that she went to the races on the first day in a gig and as an expedition of pleasure and that her presence there had no connexion with any matters of business or profitwas that the town was eight miles off  this discouraging information a little dashed the child who could scarcely repress a tear as she glanced along the darkening road  her grandfather made no complaint but he sighed heavily as he leaned upon his staff and vainly tried to pierce the dusty distance  the lady of the caravan was in the act of gathering her tea equipage together preparatory to clearing the table but noting the childs anxious manner she hesitated and stopped  the child curtseyed thanked her for her information and giving her hand to the old man had already got some fifty yards or so away when the lady of the caravan called to her to return  come nearer nearer still said she beckoning to her to ascend the steps  are you hungry child  not very but we are tired and itsit is a long way  well hungry or not you had better have some tea rejoined her new acquaintance  i suppose you are agreeable to that old gentleman  the grandfather humbly pulled off his hat and thanked her  the lady of the caravan then bade him come up the steps likewise but the drum proving an inconvenient table for two they descended again and sat upon the grass where she handed down to them the teatray the bread and butter the knuckle of ham and in short everything of which she had partaken herself except the bottle which she had already embraced an opportunity of slipping into her pocket  set em out near the hind wheels child thats the best place said their friend superintending the arrangements from above  now hand up the teapot for a little more hot water and a pinch of fresh tea and then both of you eat and drink as much as you can and dont spare anything thats all i ask of you  they might perhaps have carried out the ladys wish if it had been less freely expressed or even if it had not been expressed at all but as this direction relieved them from any shadow of delicacy or uneasiness they made a hearty meal and enjoyed it to the utmost  while they were thus engaged the lady of the caravan alighted on the earth and with her hands clasped behind her and her large bonnet trembling excessively walked up and down in a measured tread and very stately manner surveying the caravan from time to time with an air of calm delight and deriving particular gratification from the red panels and the brass knocker  when she had taken this gentle exercise for some time she sat down upon the steps and called george whereupon a man in a carters frock who had been so shrouded in a hedge up to this time as to see everything that passed without being seen himself parted the twigs that concealed him and appeared in a sitting attitude supporting on his legs a bakingdish and a halfgallon stone bottle and bearing in his right hand a knife and in his left a fork  yes missus said george  how did you find the cold pie george  it warnt amiss mum  and the beer said the lady of the caravan with an appearance of being more interested in this question than the last is it passable george  its more flatterer than it might be george returned but it ant so bad for all that  to set the mind of his mistress at rest he took a sip amounting in quantity to a pint or thereabouts from the stone bottle and then smacked his lips winked his eye and nodded his head  no doubt with the same amiable desire he immediately resumed his knife and fork as a practical assurance that the beer had wrought no bad effect upon his appetite  the lady of the caravan looked on approvingly for some time and then said  have you nearly finished  wery nigh mum  and indeed after scraping the dish all round with his knife and carrying the choice brown morsels to his mouth and after taking such a scientific pull at the stone bottle that by degrees almost imperceptible to the sight his head went further and further back until he lay nearly at his full length upon the ground this gentleman declared himself quite disengaged and came forth from his retreat  i hope i havent hurried you george said his mistress who appeared to have a great sympathy with his late pursuit  if you have returned the follower wisely reserving himself for any favourable contingency that might occur we must make up for it next time thats all  we are not a heavy load george  thats always what the ladies say replied the man looking a long way round as if he were appealing to nature in general against such monstrous propositions  if you see a woman a driving youll always perceive that she never will keep her whip still the horse cant go fast enough for her  if cattle have got their proper load you never can persuade a woman that theyll not bear something more  what is the cause of this here  would these two travellers make much difference to the horses if we took them with us asked his mistress offering no reply to the philosophical inquiry and pointing to nell and the old man who were painfully preparing to resume their journey on foot  theyd make a difference in course said george doggedly  would they make much difference repeated his mistress  they cant be very heavy  the weight o the pair mum said george eyeing them with the look of a man who was calculating within half an ounce or so would be a trifle under that of oliver cromwell  nell was very much surprised that the man should be so accurately acquainted with the weight of one whom she had read of in books as having lived considerably before their time but speedily forgot the subject in the joy of hearing that they were to go forward in the caravan for which she thanked its lady with unaffected earnestness she helped with great readiness and alacrity to put away the teathings and other matters that were lying about and the horses being by that time harnessed mounted into the vehicle followed by her delighted grandfather  their patroness then shut the door and sat herself down by her drum at an open window and the steps being struck by george and stowed under the carriage away they went with a great noise of flapping and creaking and straining and the bright brass knocker which nobody ever knocked at knocking one perpetual double knock of its own accord as they jolted heavily along     chapter 27  when they had travelled slowly forward for some short distance nell ventured to steal a look round the caravan and observe it more closely one half of itthat moiety in which the comfortable proprietress was then seatedwas carpeted and so partitioned off at the further end as to accommodate a sleepingplace constructed after the fashion of a berth on board ship which was shaded like the little windows with fair white curtains and looked comfortable enough though by what kind of gymnastic exercise the lady of the caravan ever contrived to get into it was an unfathomable mystery  the other half served for a kitchen and was fitted up with a stove whose small chimney passed through the roof  it held also a closet or larder several chests a great pitcher of water and a few cookingutensils and articles of crockery  these latter necessaries hung upon the walls which in that portion of the establishment devoted to the lady of the caravan were ornamented with such gayer and lighter decorations as a triangle and a couple of wellthumbed tambourines  the lady of the caravan sat at one window in all the pride and poetry of the musical instruments and little nell and her grandfather sat at the other in all the humility of the kettle and saucepans while the machine jogged on and shifted the darkening prospect very slowly  at first the two travellers spoke little and only in whispers but as they grew more familiar with the place they ventured to converse with greater freedom and talked about the country through which they were passing and the different objects that presented themselves until the old man fell asleep which the lady of the caravan observing invited nell to come and sit beside her  well child she said how do you like this way of travelling  nell replied that she thought it was very pleasant indeed to which the lady assented in the case of people who had their spirits  for herself she said she was troubled with a lowness in that respect which required a constant stimulant though whether the aforesaid stimulant was derived from the suspicious bottle of which mention has been already made or from other sources she did not say  thats the happiness of you young people she continued  you dont know what it is to be low in your feelings  you always have your appetites too and what a comfort that is  nell thought that she could sometimes dispense with her own appetite very conveniently and thought moreover that there was nothing either in the ladys personal appearance or in her manner of taking tea to lead to the conclusion that her natural relish for meat and drink had at all failed her  she silently assented however as in duty bound to what the lady had said and waited until she should speak again  instead of speaking however she sat looking at the child for a long time in silence and then getting up brought out from a corner a large roll of canvas about a yard in width which she laid upon the floor and spread open with her foot until it nearly reached from one end of the caravan to the other  there child she said read that  nell walked down it and read aloud in enormous black letters the inscription jarleys waxwork  read it again said the lady complacently  jarleys waxwork repeated nell  thats me said the lady  i am mrs jarley  giving the child an encouraging look intended to reassure her and let her know that although she stood in the presence of the original jarley she must not allow herself to be utterly overwhelmed and borne down the lady of the caravan unfolded another scroll whereon was the inscription one hundred figures the full size of life and then another scroll on which was written the only stupendous collection of real waxwork in the world and then several smaller scrolls with such inscriptions as now exhibiting withinthe genuine and only jarleyjarleys unrivalled collectionjarley is the delight of the nobility and gentrythe royal family are the patrons of jarley when she had exhibited these leviathans of public announcement to the astonished child she brought forth specimens of the lesser fry in the shape of handbills some of which were couched in the form of parodies on popular melodies as believe me if all jarleys waxwork so rarei saw thy show in youthful primeover the water to jarley while to consult all tastes others were composed with a view to the lighter and more facetious spirits as a parody on the favourite air of if i had a donkey beginning    if i knowd a donkey wot wouldnt go   to see mrs jarleys waxwork show   do you think id acknowledge him  oh no no   then run to jarleys  besides several compositions in prose purporting to be dialogues between the emperor of china and an oyster or the archbishop of canterbury and a dissenter on the subject of churchrates but all having the same moral namely that the reader must make haste to jarleys and that children and servants were admitted at halfprice when she had brought all these testimonials of her important position in society to bear upon her young companion mrs jarley rolled them up and having put them carefully away sat down again and looked at the child in triumph  never go into the company of a filthy punch any more said mrs jarley after this  i never saw any waxwork maam said nell  is it funnier than punch  funnier said mrs jarley in a shrill voice  it is not funny at all  oh said nell with all possible humility  it isnt funny at all repeated mrs jarley  its calm andwhats that word againcriticalnoclassical thats itits calm and classical  no low beatings and knockings about no jokings and squeakings like your precious punches but always the same with a constantly unchanging air of coldness and gentility and so like life that if waxwork only spoke and walked about youd hardly know the difference  i wont go so far as to say that as it is ive seen waxwork quite like life but ive certainly seen some life that was exactly like waxwork  is it here maam asked nell whose curiosity was awakened by this description  is what here child  the waxwork maam  why bless you child what are you thinking of  how could such a collection be here where you see everything except the inside of one little cupboard and a few boxes  its gone on in the other wans to the assemblyrooms and there itll be exhibited the day after tomorrow you are going to the same town and youll see it i dare say  its natural to expect that youll see it and ive no doubt you will  i suppose you couldnt stop away if you was to try ever so much  i shall not be in the town i think maam said the child  not there cried mrs jarley  then where will you be  iidont quite know  i am not certain  you dont mean to say that youre travelling about the country without knowing where youre going to said the lady of the caravan  what curious people you are  what line are you in  you looked to me at the races child as if you were quite out of your element and had got there by accident  we were there quite by accident returned nell confused by this abrupt questioning  we are poor people maam and are only wandering about  we have nothing to doi wish we had  you amaze me more and more said mrs jarley after remaining for some time as mute as one of her own figures  why what do you call yourselves  not beggars  indeed maam i dont know what else we are returned the child  lord bless me said the lady of the caravan  i never heard of such a thing  whod have thought it  she remained so long silent after this exclamation that nell feared she felt her having been induced to bestow her protection and conversation upon one so poor to be an outrage upon her dignity that nothing could repair  this persuasion was rather confirmed than otherwise by the tone in which she at length broke silence and said  and yet you can read  and write too i shouldnt wonder  yes maam said the child fearful of giving new offence by the confession  well and what a thing that is returned mrs jarley  i cant  nell said indeed in a tone which might imply either that she was reasonably surprised to find the genuine and only jarley who was the delight of the nobility and gentry and the peculiar pet of the royal family destitute of these familiar arts or that she presumed so great a lady could scarcely stand in need of such ordinary accomplishments in whatever way mrs jarley received the response it did not provoke her to further questioning or tempt her into any more remarks at the time for she relapsed into a thoughtful silence and remained in that state so long that nell withdrew to the other window and rejoined her grandfather who was now awake  at length the lady of the caravan shook off her fit of meditation and summoning the driver to come under the window at which she was seated held a long conversation with him in a low tone of voice as if she were asking his advice on an important point and discussing the pros and cons of some very weighty matter  this conference at length concluded she drew in her head again and beckoned nell to approach  and the old gentleman too said mrs jarley for i want to have a word with him  do you want a good situation for your granddaughter master  if you do i can put her in the way of getting one  what do you say  i cant leave her answered the old man  we cant separate  what would become of me without her  i should have thought you were old enough to take care of yourself if you ever will be retorted mrs jarley sharply  but he never will be said the child in an earnest whisper  i fear he never will be again  pray do not speak harshly to him  we are very thankful to you she added aloud but neither of us could part from the other if all the wealth of the world were halved between us  mrs jarley was a little disconcerted by this reception of her proposal and looked at the old man who tenderly took nells hand and detained it in his own as if she could have very well dispensed with his company or even his earthly existence  after an awkward pause she thrust her head out of the window again and had another conference with the driver upon some point on which they did not seem to agree quite so readily as on their former topic of discussion but they concluded at last and she addressed the grandfather again  if youre really disposed to employ yourself said mrs jarley there would be plenty for you to do in the way of helping to dust the figures and take the checks and so forth  what i want your granddaughter for is to point em out to the company they would be soon learnt and she has a way with her that people wouldnt think unpleasant though she does come after me for ive been always accustomed to go round with visitors myself which i should keep on doing now only that my spirits make a little ease absolutely necessary  its not a common offer bear in mind said the lady rising into the tone and manner in which she was accustomed to address her audiences its jarleys waxwork remember  the dutys very light and genteel the company particularly select the exhibition takes place in assemblyrooms townhalls large rooms at inns or auction galleries  there is none of your openair wagrancy at jarleys recollect there is no tarpaulin and sawdust at jarleys remember  every expectation held out in the handbills is realised to the utmost and the whole forms an effect of imposing brilliancy hitherto unrivalled in this kingdom  remember that the price of admission is only sixpence and that this is an opportunity which may never occur again  descending from the sublime when she had reached this point to the details of common life mrs jarley remarked that with reference to salary she could pledge herself to no specific sum until she had sufficiently tested nells abilities and narrowly watched her in the performance of her duties  but board and lodging both for her and her grandfather she bound herself to provide and she furthermore passed her word that the board should always be good in quality and in quantity plentiful  nell and her grandfather consulted together and while they were so engaged mrs jarley with her hands behind her walked up and down the caravan as she had walked after tea on the dull earth with uncommon dignity and selfesteem  nor will this appear so slight a circumstance as to be unworthy of mention when it is remembered that the caravan was in uneasy motion all the time and that none but a person of great natural stateliness and acquired grace could have forborne to stagger  now child cried mrs jarley coming to a halt as nell turned towards her  we are very much obliged to you maam said nell and thankfully accept your offer  and youll never be sorry for it returned mrs jarley  im pretty sure of that  so as thats all settled let us have a bit of supper  in the meanwhile the caravan blundered on as if it too had been drinking strong beer and was drowsy and came at last upon the paved streets of a town which were clear of passengers and quiet for it was by this time near midnight and the townspeople were all abed  as it was too late an hour to repair to the exhibition room they turned aside into a piece of waste ground that lay just within the old towngate and drew up there for the night near to another caravan which notwithstanding that it bore on the lawful panel the great name of jarley and was employed besides in conveying from place to place the waxwork which was its countrys pride was designated by a grovelling stampoffice as a common stage waggon and numbered tooseven thousand odd hundredas though its precious freight were mere flour or coals  this illused machine being empty for it had deposited its burden at the place of exhibition and lingered here until its services were again required was assigned to the old man as his sleepingplace for the night and within its wooden walls nell made him up the best bed she could from the materials at hand  for herself she was to sleep in mrs jarleys own travellingcarriage as a signal mark of that ladys favour and confidence  she had taken leave of her grandfather and was returning to the other waggon when she was tempted by the coolness of the night to linger for a little while in the air  the moon was shining down upon the old gateway of the town leaving the low archway very black and dark and with a mingled sensation of curiosity and fear she slowly approached the gate and stood still to look up at it wondering to see how dark and grim and old and cold it looked  there was an empty niche from which some old statue had fallen or been carried away hundreds of years ago and she was thinking what strange people it must have looked down upon when it stood there and how many hard struggles might have taken place and how many murders might have been done upon that silent spot when there suddenly emerged from the black shade of the arch a man  the instant he appeared she recognised himwho could have failed to recognise in that instant the ugly misshapen quilp  the street beyond was so narrow and the shadow of the houses on one side of the way so deep that he seemed to have risen out of the earth but there he was  the child withdrew into a dark corner and saw him pass close to her  he had a stick in his hand and when he had got clear of the shadow of the gateway he leant upon it looked backdirectly as it seemed towards where she stoodand beckoned  to her  oh no thank god not to her for as she stood in an extremity of fear hesitating whether to scream for help or come from her hidingplace and fly before he should draw nearer there issued slowly forth from the arch another figurethat of a boywho carried on his back a trunk  faster sirrah cried quilp looking up at the old gateway and showing in the moonlight like some monstrous image that had come down from its niche and was casting a backward glance at its old house faster  its a dreadful heavy load sir the boy pleaded  ive come on very fast considering  you have come fast considering retorted quilp you creep you dog you crawl you measure distance like a worm  there are the chimes now halfpast twelve  he stopped to listen and then turning upon the boy with a suddenness and ferocity that made him start asked at what hour that london coach passed the corner of the road  the boy replied at one  come on then said quilp or i shall be too late  fasterdo you hear me  faster  the boy made all the speed he could and quilp led onward constantly turning back to threaten him and urge him to greater haste  nell did not dare to move until they were out of sight and hearing and then hurried to where she had left her grandfather feeling as if the very passing of the dwarf so near him must have filled him with alarm and terror  but he was sleeping soundly and she softly withdrew  as she was making her way to her own bed she determined to say nothing of this adventure as upon whatever errand the dwarf had come and she feared it must have been in search of them it was clear by his inquiry about the london coach that he was on his way homeward and as he had passed through that place it was but reasonable to suppose that they were safer from his inquiries there than they could be elsewhere these reflections did not remove her own alarm for she had been too much terrified to be easily composed and felt as if she were hemmed in by a legion of quilps and the very air itself were filled with them  the delight of the nobility and gentry and the patronised of royalty had by some process of selfabridgment known only to herself got into her travelling bed where she was snoring peacefully while the large bonnet carefully disposed upon the drum was revealing its glories by the light of a dim lamp that swung from the roof  the childs bed was already made upon the floor and it was a great comfort to her to hear the steps removed as soon as she had entered and to know that all easy communication between persons outside and the brass knocker was by this means effectually prevented  certain guttural sounds too which from time to time ascended through the floor of the caravan and a rustling of straw in the same direction apprised her that the driver was couched upon the ground beneath and gave her an additional feeling of security  notwithstanding these protections she could get none but broken sleep by fits and starts all night for fear of quilp who throughout her uneasy dreams was somehow connected with the waxwork or was waxwork himself or was mrs jarley and waxwork too or was himself mrs jarley waxwork and a barrel organ all in one and yet not exactly any of them either  at length towards break of day that deep sleep came upon her which succeeds to weariness and overwatching and which has no consciousness but one of overpowering and irresistible enjoyment     chapter 28  sleep hung upon the eyelids of the child so long that when she awoke mrs jarley was already decorated with her large bonnet and actively engaged in preparing breakfast  she received nells apology for being so late with perfect good humour and said that she should not have roused her if she had slept on until noon  because it does you good said the lady of the caravan when youre tired to sleep as long as ever you can and get the fatigue quite off and thats another blessing of your time of lifeyou can sleep so very sound  have you had a bad night maam asked nell  i seldom have anything else child replied mrs jarley with the air of a martyr  i sometimes wonder how i bear it  remembering the snores which had proceeded from that cleft in the caravan in which the proprietress of the waxwork passed the night nell rather thought she must have been dreaming of lying awake however she expressed herself very sorry to hear such a dismal account of her state of health and shortly afterwards sat down with her grandfather and mrs jarley to breakfast  the meal finished nell assisted to wash the cups and saucers and put them in their proper places and these household duties performed mrs jarley arrayed herself in an exceedingly bright shawl for the purpose of making a progress through the streets of the town  the wan will come on to bring the boxes said mrs jarley and you had better come in it child  i am obliged to walk very much against my will but the people expect it of me and public characters cant be their own masters and mistresses in such matters as these  how do i look child  nell returned a satisfactory reply and mrs jarley after sticking a great many pins into various parts of her figure and making several abortive attempts to obtain a full view of her own back was at last satisfied with her appearance and went forth majestically  the caravan followed at no great distance  as it went jolting through the streets nell peeped from the window curious to see in what kind of place they were and yet fearful of encountering at every turn the dreaded face of quilp  it was a pretty large town with an open square which they were crawling slowly across and in the middle of which was the townhall with a clocktower and a weathercock  there were houses of stone houses of red brick houses of yellow brick houses of lath and plaster and houses of wood many of them very old with withered faces carved upon the beams and staring down into the street these had very little winking windows and lowarched doors and in some of the narrower ways quite overhung the pavement  the streets were very clean very sunny very empty and very dull  a few idle men lounged about the two inns and the empty marketplace and the tradesmens doors and some old people were dozing in chairs outside an almshouse wall but scarcely any passengers who seemed bent on going anywhere or to have any object in view went by and if perchance some straggler did his footsteps echoed on the hot bright pavement for minutes afterwards  nothing seemed to be going on but the clocks and they had such drowzy faces such heavy lazy hands and such cracked voices that they surely must have been too slow  the very dogs were all asleep and the flies drunk with moist sugar in the grocers shop forgot their wings and briskness and baked to death in dusty corners of the window  rumbling along with most unwonted noise the caravan stopped at last at the place of exhibition where nell dismounted amidst an admiring group of children who evidently supposed her to be an important item of the curiosities and were fully impressed with the belief that her grandfather was a cunning device in wax  the chests were taken out with all convenient despatch and taken in to be unlocked by mrs jarley who attended by george and another man in velveteen shorts and a drab hat ornamented with turnpike tickets were waiting to dispose their contents consisting of red festoons and other ornamental devices in upholstery work to the best advantage in the decoration of the room  they all got to work without loss of time and very busy they were  as the stupendous collection were yet concealed by cloths lest the envious dust should injure their complexions nell bestirred herself to assist in the embellishment of the room in which her grandfather also was of great service  the two men being well used to it did a great deal in a short time and mrs jarley served out the tin tacks from a linen pocket like a tollcollectors which she wore for the purpose and encouraged her assistants to renewed exertion  while they were thus employed a tallish gentleman with a hook nose and black hair dressed in a military surtout very short and tight in the sleeves and which had once been frogged and braided all over but was now sadly shorn of its garniture and quite threadbaredressed too in ancient grey pantaloons fitting tight to the leg and a pair of pumps in the winter of their existencelooked in at the door and smiled affably  mrs jarleys back being then towards him the military gentleman shook his forefinger as a sign that her myrmidons were not to apprise her of his presence and stealing up close behind her tapped her on the neck and cried playfully boh  what mr slum cried the lady of the waxwork  lot whod have thought of seeing you here  pon my soul and honour said mr slum thats a good remark  pon my soul and honour thats a wise remark  who would have thought it george my faithful feller how are you  george received this advance with a surly indifference observing that he was well enough for the matter of that and hammering lustily all the time  i came here said the military gentleman turning to mrs jarleypon my soul and honour i hardly know what i came here for  it would puzzle me to tell you it would by gad  i wanted a little inspiration a little freshening up a little change of ideas and pon my soul and honour said the military gentleman checking himself and looking round the room what a devilish classical thing this is by gad its quite minervian  itll look well enough when it comes to be finished observed mrs jarley  well enough said mr slum  will you believe me when i say its the delight of my life to have dabbled in poetry when i think ive exercised my pen upon this charming theme  by the wayany orders  is there any little thing i can do for you  it comes so very expensive sir replied mrs jarley and i really dont think it does much good  hush  no no returned mr slum elevating his hand  no fibs  ill not hear it  dont say it dont do good  dont say it  i know better  i dont think it does said mrs jarley  ha ha cried mr slum youre giving way youre coming down  ask the perfumers ask the blackingmakers ask the hatters ask the old lotteryofficekeepersask any man among em what my poetry has done for him and mark my words he blesses the name of slum  if hes an honest man he raises his eyes to heaven and blesses the name of slummark that  you are acquainted with westminster abbey mrs jarley  yes surely  then upon my soul and honour maam youll find in a certain angle of that dreary pile called poets corner a few smaller names than slum retorted that gentleman tapping himself expressively on the forehead to imply that there was some slight quantity of brain behind it  ive got a little trifle here now said mr slum taking off his hat which was full of scraps of paper a little trifle here thrown off in the heat of the moment which i should say was exactly the thing you wanted to set this place on fire with  its an acrosticthe name at this moment is warren and the ideas a convertible one and a positive inspiration for jarley  have the acrostic  i suppose its very dear said mrs jarley  five shillings returned mr slum using his pencil as a toothpick cheaper than any prose  i couldnt give more than three said mrs jarley  and six retorted slum  come  threeandsix  mrs jarley was not proof against the poets insinuating manner and mr slum entered the order in a small notebook as a threeandsixpenny one  mr slum then withdrew to alter the acrostic after taking a most affectionate leave of his patroness and promising to return as soon as he possibly could with a fair copy for the printer  as his presence had not interfered with or interrupted the preparations they were now far advanced and were completed shortly after his departure  when the festoons were all put up as tastily as they might be the stupendous collection was uncovered and there were displayed on a raised platform some two feet from the floor running round the room and parted from the rude public by a crimson rope breast high divers sprightly effigies of celebrated characters singly and in groups clad in glittering dresses of various climes and times and standing more or less unsteadily upon their legs with their eyes very wide open and their nostrils very much inflated and the muscles of their legs and arms very strongly developed and all their countenances expressing great surprise  all the gentlemen were very pigeonbreasted and very blue about the beards and all the ladies were miraculous figures and all the ladies and all the gentlemen were looking intensely nowhere and staring with extraordinary earnestness at nothing  when nell had exhausted her first raptures at this glorious sight mrs jarley ordered the room to be cleared of all but herself and the child and sitting herself down in an armchair in the centre formally invested nell with a willow wand long used by herself for pointing out the characters and was at great pains to instruct her in her duty  that said mrs jarley in her exhibition tone as nell touched a figure at the beginning of the platform is an unfortunate maid of honour in the time of queen elizabeth who died from pricking her finger in consequence of working upon a sunday  observe the blood which is trickling from her finger also the goldeyed needle of the period with which she is at work  all this nell repeated twice or thrice pointing to the finger and the needle at the right times and then passed on to the next  that ladies and gentlemen said mrs jarley is jasper packlemerton of atrocious memory who courted and married fourteen wives and destroyed them all by tickling the soles of their feet when they were sleeping in the consciousness of innocence and virtue  on being brought to the scaffold and asked if he was sorry for what he had done he replied yes he was sorry for having let em off so easy and hoped all christian husbands would pardon him the offence  let this be a warning to all young ladies to be particular in the character of the gentlemen of their choice  observe that his fingers are curled as if in the act of tickling and that his face is represented with a wink as he appeared when committing his barbarous murders  when nell knew all about mr packlemerton and could say it without faltering mrs jarley passed on to the fat man and then to the thin man the tall man the short man the old lady who died of dancing at a hundred and thirtytwo the wild boy of the woods the woman who poisoned fourteen families with pickled walnuts and other historical characters and interesting but misguided individuals  and so well did nell profit by her instructions and so apt was she to remember them that by the time they had been shut up together for a couple of hours she was in full possession of the history of the whole establishment and perfectly competent to the enlightenment of visitors  mrs jarley was not slow to express her admiration at this happy result and carried her young friend and pupil to inspect the remaining arrangements within doors by virtue of which the passage had been already converted into a grove of greenbaize hung with the inscription she had already seen mr slums productions and a highly ornamented table placed at the upper end for mrs jarley herself at which she was to preside and take the money in company with his majesty king george the third mr grimaldi as clown mary queen of scots an anonymous gentleman of the quaker persuasion and mr pitt holding in his hand a correct model of the bill for the imposition of the window duty  the preparations without doors had not been neglected either a nun of great personal attractions was telling her beads on the little portico over the door and a brigand with the blackest possible head of hair and the clearest possible complexion was at that moment going round the town in a cart consulting the miniature of a lady  it now only remained that mr slums compositions should be judiciously distributed that the pathetic effusions should find their way to all private houses and tradespeople and that the parody commencing if i knowd a donkey should be confined to the taverns and circulated only among the lawyers clerks and choice spirits of the place  when this had been done and mrs jarley had waited upon the boardingschools in person with a handbill composed expressly for them in which it was distinctly proved that waxwork refined the mind cultivated the taste and enlarged the sphere of the human understanding that indefatigable lady sat down to dinner and drank out of the suspicious bottle to a flourishing campaign     chapter 29  unquestionably mrs jarley had an inventive genius  in the midst of the various devices for attracting visitors to the exhibition little nell was not forgotten  the light cart in which the brigand usually made his perambulations being gaily dressed with flags and streamers and the brigand placed therein contemplating the miniature of his beloved as usual nell was accommodated with a seat beside him decorated with artificial flowers and in this state and ceremony rode slowly through the town every morning dispersing handbills from a basket to the sound of drum and trumpet  the beauty of the child coupled with her gentle and timid bearing produced quite a sensation in the little country place  the brigand heretofore a source of exclusive interest in the streets became a mere secondary consideration and to be important only as a part of the show of which she was the chief attraction  grownup folks began to be interested in the brighteyed girl and some score of little boys fell desperately in love and constantly left enclosures of nuts and apples directed in smalltext at the waxwork door  this desirable impression was not lost on mrs jarley who lest nell should become too cheap soon sent the brigand out alone again and kept her in the exhibition room where she described the figures every halfhour to the great satisfaction of admiring audiences  and these audiences were of a very superior description including a great many young ladies boardingschools whose favour mrs jarley had been at great pains to conciliate by altering the face and costume of mr grimaldi as clown to represent mr lindley murray as he appeared when engaged in the composition of his english grammar and turning a murderess of great renown into mrs hannah moreboth of which likenesses were admitted by miss monflathers who was at the head of the head boarding and day establishment in the town and who condescended to take a private view with eight chosen young ladies to be quite startling from their extreme correctness  mr pitt in a nightcap and bedgown and without his boots represented the poet cowper with perfect exactness and mary queen of scots in a dark wig white shirtcollar and male attire was such a complete image of lord byron that the young ladies quite screamed when they saw it  miss monflathers however rebuked this enthusiasm and took occasion to reprove mrs jarley for not keeping her collection more select observing that his lordship had held certain opinions quite incompatible with waxwork honours and adding something about a dean and chapter which mrs jarley did not understand  although her duties were sufficiently laborious nell found in the lady of the caravan a very kind and considerate person who had not only a peculiar relish for being comfortable herself but for making everybody about her comfortable also which latter taste it may be remarked is even in persons who live in much finer places than caravans a far more rare and uncommon one than the first and is not by any means its necessary consequence  as her popularity procured her various little fees from the visitors on which her patroness never demanded any toll and as her grandfather too was welltreated and useful she had no cause of anxiety in connexion with the waxwork beyond that which sprung from her recollection of quilp and her fears that he might return and one day suddenly encounter them  quilp indeed was a perpetual nightmare to the child who was constantly haunted by a vision of his ugly face and stunted figure she slept for their better security in the room where the waxwork figures were and she never retired to this place at night but she tortured herselfshe could not help itwith imagining a resemblance in some one or other of their deathlike faces to the dwarf and this fancy would sometimes so gain upon her that she would almost believe he had removed the figure and stood within the clothes  then there were so many of them with their great glassy eyesand as they stood one behind the other all about her bed they looked so like living creatures and yet so unlike in their grim stillness and silence that she had a kind of terror of them for their own sakes and would often lie watching their dusky figures until she was obliged to rise and light a candle or go and sit at the open window and feel a companionship in the bright stars  at these times she would recall the old house and the window at which she used to sit alone and then she would think of poor kit and all his kindness until the tears came into her eyes and she would weep and smile together  often and anxiously at this silent hour her thoughts reverted to her grandfather and she would wonder how much he remembered of their former life and whether he was ever really mindful of the change in their condition and of their late helplessness and destitution  when they were wandering about she seldom thought of this but now she could not help considering what would become of them if he fell sick or her own strength were to fail her  he was very patient and willing happy to execute any little task and glad to be of use but he was in the same listless state with no prospect of improvementa mere childa poor thoughtless vacant creaturea harmless fond old man susceptible of tender love and regard for her and of pleasant and painful impressions but alive to nothing more  it made her very sad to know that this was soso sad to see it that sometimes when he sat idly by smiling and nodding to her when she looked round or when he caressed some little child and carried it to and fro as he was fond of doing by the hour together perplexed by its simple questions yet patient under his own infirmity and seeming almost conscious of it too and humbled even before the mind of an infantso sad it made her to see him thus that she would burst into tears and withdrawing into some secret place fall down upon her knees and pray that he might be restored  but the bitterness of her grief was not in beholding him in this condition when he was at least content and tranquil nor in her solitary meditations on his altered state though these were trials for a young heart  cause for deeper and heavier sorrow was yet to come  one evening a holiday night with them nell and her grandfather went out to walk  they had been rather closely confined for some days and the weather being warm they strolled a long distance  clear of the town they took a footpath which struck through some pleasant fields judging that it would terminate in the road they quitted and enable them to return that way  it made however a much wider circuit than they had supposed and thus they were tempted onward until sunset when they reached the track of which they were in search and stopped to rest  it had been gradually getting overcast and now the sky was dark and lowering save where the glory of the departing sun piled up masses of gold and burning fire decaying embers of which gleamed here and there through the black veil and shone redly down upon the earth  the wind began to moan in hollow murmurs as the sun went down carrying glad day elsewhere and a train of dull clouds coming up against it menaced thunder and lightning  large drops of rain soon began to fall and as the storm clouds came sailing onward others supplied the void they left behind and spread over all the sky  then was heard the low rumbling of distant thunder then the lightning quivered and then the darkness of an hour seemed to have gathered in an instant  fearful of taking shelter beneath a tree or hedge the old man and the child hurried along the high road hoping to find some house in which they could seek a refuge from the storm which had now burst forth in earnest and every moment increased in violence  drenched with the pelting rain confused by the deafening thunder and bewildered by the glare of the forked lightning they would have passed a solitary house without being aware of its vicinity had not a man who was standing at the door called lustily to them to enter  your ears ought to be better than other folks at any rate if you make so little of the chance of being struck blind he said retreating from the door and shading his eyes with his hands as the jagged lightning came again  what were you going past for eh he added as he closed the door and led the way along a passage to a room behind  we didnt see the house sir till we heard you calling nell replied  no wonder said the man with this lightning in ones eyes bytheby  you had better stand by the fire here and dry yourselves a bit  you can call for what you like if you want anything  if you dont want anything you are not obliged to give an order  dont be afraid of that  this is a publichouse thats all  the valiant soldier is pretty well known hereabouts  is this house called the valiant soldier sir asked nell  i thought everybody knew that replied the landlord  where have you come from if you dont know the valiant soldier as well as the church catechism  this is the valiant soldier by james grovesjem groveshonest jem groves as is a man of unblemished moral character and has a good dry skittleground  if any man has got anything to say again jem groves let him say it to jem groves and jem groves can accommodate him with a customer on any terms from four pound a side to forty  with these words the speaker tapped himself on the waistcoat to intimate that he was the jem groves so highly eulogized sparred scientifically at a counterfeit jem groves who was sparring at society in general from a black frame over the chimneypiece and applying a halfemptied glass of spirits and water to his lips drank jem grovess health  the night being warm there was a large screen drawn across the room for a barrier against the heat of the fire  it seemed as if somebody on the other side of this screen had been insinuating doubts of mr grovess prowess and had thereby given rise to these egotistical expressions for mr groves wound up his defiance by giving a loud knock upon it with his knuckles and pausing for a reply from the other side  there ant many men said mr groves no answer being returned who would ventur to cross jem groves under his own roof  theres only one man i know that has nerve enough for that and that mans not a hundred mile from here neither  but hes worth a dozen men and i let him say of me whatever he likes in consequencehe knows that  in return for this complimentary address a very gruff hoarse voice bade mr groves hold his noise and light a candle  and the same voice remarked that the same gentleman neednt waste his breath in brag for most people knew pretty well what sort of stuff he was made of  nell theyretheyre playing cards whispered the old man suddenly interested  dont you hear them  look sharp with that candle said the voice its as much as i can do to see the pips on the cards as it is and get this shutter closed as quick as you can will you  your beer will be the worse for tonights thunder i expectgame  sevenandsixpence to me old isaac  hand over  do you hear nell do you hear them whispered the old man again with increased earnestness as the money chinked upon the table  i havent seen such a storm as this said a sharp cracked voice of most disagreeable quality when a tremendous peal of thunder had died away since the night when old luke withers won thirteen times running on the red  we all said he had the devils luck and his own and as it was the kind of night for the devil to be out and busy i suppose he was looking over his shoulder if anybody could have seen him  ah returned the gruff voice for all old lukes winning through thick and thin of late years i remember the time when he was the unluckiest and unfortunatest of men  he never took a dicebox in his hand or held a card but he was plucked pigeoned and cleaned out completely  do you hear what he says whispered the old man  do you hear that nell  the child saw with astonishment and alarm that his whole appearance had undergone a complete change  his face was flushed and eager his eyes were strained his teeth set his breath came short and thick and the hand he laid upon her arm trembled so violently that she shook beneath its grasp  bear witness he muttered looking upward that i always said it that i knew it dreamed of it felt it was the truth and that it must be so  what money have we nell  come  i saw you with money yesterday  what money have we  give it to me  no no let me keep it grandfather said the frightened child  let us go away from here  do not mind the rain  pray let us go  give it to me i say returned the old man fiercely  hush hush dont cry nell  if i spoke sharply dear i didnt mean it  its for thy good  i have wronged thee nell but i will right thee yet i will indeed  where is the money  do not take it said the child  pray do not take it dear  for both our sakes let me keep it or let me throw it awaybetter let me throw it away than you take it now  let us go do let us go  give me the money returned the old man i must have it theretherethats my dear nell  ill right thee one day child ill right thee never fear  she took from her pocket a little purse  he seized it with the same rapid impatience which had characterised his speech and hastily made his way to the other side of the screen  it was impossible to restrain him and the trembling child followed close behind  the landlord had placed a light upon the table and was engaged in drawing the curtain of the window  the speakers whom they had heard were two men who had a pack of cards and some silver money between them while upon the screen itself the games they had played were scored in chalk  the man with the rough voice was a burly fellow of middle age with large black whiskers broad cheeks a coarse wide mouth and bull neck which was pretty freely displayed as his shirt collar was only confined by a loose red neckerchief  he wore his hat which was of a brownishwhite and had beside him a thick knotted stick  the other man whom his companion had called isaac was of a more slender figurestooping and high in the shoulderswith a very illfavoured face and a most sinister and villainous squint  now old gentleman said isaac looking round  do you know either of us  this side of the screen is private sir  no offence i hope returned the old man  but by g sir there is offence said the other interrupting him when you intrude yourself upon a couple of gentlemen who are particularly engaged  i had no intention to offend said the old man looking anxiously at the cards  i thought that  but you had no right to think sir retorted the other  what the devil has a man at your time of life to do with thinking  now bully boy said the stout man raising his eyes from his cards for the first time cant you let him speak  the landlord who had apparently resolved to remain neutral until he knew which side of the question the stout man would espouse chimed in at this place with ah to be sure cant you let him speak isaac list  cant i let him speak sneered isaac in reply mimicking as nearly as he could in his shrill voice the tones of the landlord  yes i can let him speak jemmy groves  well then do it will you said the landlord  mr lists squint assumed a portentous character which seemed to threaten a prolongation of this controversy when his companion who had been looking sharply at the old man put a timely stop to it  who knows said he with a cunning look but the gentleman may have civilly meant to ask if he might have the honour to take a hand with us  i did mean it cried the old man  that is what i mean  that is what i want now  i thought so returned the same man  then who knows but the gentleman anticipating our objection to play for love civilly desired to play for money  the old man replied by shaking the little purse in his eager hand and then throwing it down upon the table and gathering up the cards as a miser would clutch at gold  oh  that indeed said isaac if thats what the gentleman meant i beg the gentlemans pardon  is this the gentlemans little purse  a very pretty little purse  rather a light purse added isaac throwing it into the air and catching it dexterously but enough to amuse a gentleman for half an hour or so  well make a fourhanded game of it and take in groves said the stout man  come jemmy  the landlord who conducted himself like one who was well used to such little parties approached the table and took his seat  the child in a perfect agony drew her grandfather aside and implored him even then to come away  come and we may be so happy said the child  we will be happy replied the old man hastily  let me go nell the means of happiness are on the cards and the dice  we must rise from little winnings to great  theres little to be won here but great will come in time  i shall but win back my own and its all for thee my darling  god help us cried the child  oh what hard fortune brought us here  hush rejoined the old man laying his hand upon her mouth fortune will not bear chiding  we must not reproach her or she shuns us i have found that out  now mister said the stout man  if youre not coming yourself give us the cards will you  i am coming cried the old man  sit thee down nell sit thee down and look on  be of good heart its all for theeallevery penny i dont tell them no no or else they wouldnt play dreading the chance that such a cause must give me  look at them  see what they are and what thou art  who doubts that we must win  the gentleman has thought better of it and isnt coming said isaac making as though he would rise from the table  im sorry the gentlemans dauntednothing venture nothing havebut the gentleman knows best  why i am ready  you have all been slow but me said the old man  i wonder who is more anxious to begin than i  as he spoke he drew a chair to the table and the other three closing round it at the same time the game commenced  the child sat by and watched its progress with a troubled mind regardless of the run of luck and mindful only of the desperate passion which had its hold upon her grandfather losses and gains were to her alike  exulting in some brief triumph or cast down by a defeat there he sat so wild and restless so feverishly and intensely anxious so terribly eager so ravenous for the paltry stakes that she could have almost better borne to see him dead  and yet she was the innocent cause of all this torture and he gambling with such a savage thirst for gain as the most insatiable gambler never felt had not one selfish thought  on the contrary the other threeknaves and gamesters by their tradewhile intent upon their game were yet as cool and quiet as if every virtue had been centered in their breasts  sometimes one would look up to smile to another or to snuff the feeble candle or to glance at the lightning as it shot through the open window and fluttering curtain or to listen to some louder peal of thunder than the rest with a kind of momentary impatience as if it put him out but there they sat with a calm indifference to everything but their cards perfect philosophers in appearance and with no greater show of passion or excitement than if they had been made of stone  the storm had raged for full three hours the lightning had grown fainter and less frequent the thunder from seeming to roll and break above their heads had gradually died away into a deep hoarse distance and still the game went on and still the anxious child was quite forgotten     chapter 30  at length the play came to an end and mr isaac list rose the only winner  mat and the landlord bore their losses with professional fortitude  isaac pocketed his gains with the air of a man who had quite made up his mind to win all along and was neither surprised nor pleased  nells little purse was exhausted but although it lay empty by his side and the other players had now risen from the table the old man sat poring over the cards dealing them as they had been dealt before and turning up the different hands to see what each man would have held if they had still been playing  he was quite absorbed in this occupation when the child drew near and laid her hand upon his shoulder telling him it was near midnight  see the curse of poverty nell he said pointing to the packs he had spread out upon the table  if i could have gone on a little longer only a little longer the luck would have turned on my side  yes its as plain as the marks upon the cards  see hereand thereand here again  put them away urged the child  try to forget them  try to forget them he rejoined raising his haggard face to hers and regarding her with an incredulous stare  to forget them  how are we ever to grow rich if i forget them  the child could only shake her head  no no nell said the old man patting her cheek they must not be forgotten  we must make amends for this as soon as we can patiencepatience and well right thee yet i promise thee  lose today win tomorrow  and nothing can be won without anxiety and carenothing  come i am ready  do you know what the time is said mr groves who was smoking with his friends  past twelve oclock  and a rainy night added the stout man  the valiant soldier by james groves  good beds  cheap entertainment for man and beast said mr groves quoting his signboard  halfpast twelve oclock  its very late said the uneasy child  i wish we had gone before what will they think of us  it will be two oclock by the time we get back  what would it cost sir if we stopped here  two good beds oneandsixpence supper and beer one shilling total two shillings and sixpence replied the valiant soldier  now nell had still the piece of gold sewn in her dress and when she came to consider the lateness of the hour and the somnolent habits of mrs jarley and to imagine the state of consternation in which they would certainly throw that good lady by knocking her up in the middle of the nightand when she reflected on the other hand that if they remained where they were and rose early in the morning they might get back before she awoke and could plead the violence of the storm by which they had been overtaken as a good apology for their absenceshe decided after a great deal of hesitation to remain  she therefore took her grandfather aside and telling him that she had still enough left to defray the cost of their lodging proposed that they should stay there for the night  if i had had but that money beforeif i had only known of it a few minutes ago muttered the old man  we will decide to stop here if you please said nell turning hastily to the landlord  i think thats prudent returned mr groves  you shall have your suppers directly  accordingly when mr groves had smoked his pipe out knocked out the ashes and placed it carefully in a corner of the fireplace with the bowl downwards he brought in the bread and cheese and beer with many high encomiums upon their excellence and bade his guests fall to and make themselves at home  nell and her grandfather ate sparingly for both were occupied with their own reflections the other gentlemen for whose constitutions beer was too weak and tame a liquid consoled themselves with spirits and tobacco  as they would leave the house very early in the morning the child was anxious to pay for their entertainment before they retired to bed  but as she felt the necessity of concealing her little hoard from her grandfather and had to change the piece of gold she took it secretly from its place of concealment and embraced an opportunity of following the landlord when he went out of the room and tendered it to him in the little bar  will you give me the change here if you please said the child  mr james groves was evidently surprised and looked at the money and rang it and looked at the child and at the money again as though he had a mind to inquire how she came by it  the coin being genuine however and changed at his house he probably felt like a wise landlord that it was no business of his  at any rate he counted out the change and gave it her  the child was returning to the room where they had passed the evening when she fancied she saw a figure just gliding in at the door  there was nothing but a long dark passage between this door and the place where she had changed the money and being very certain that no person had passed in or out while she stood there the thought struck her that she had been watched  but by whom  when she reentered the room she found its inmates exactly as she had left them  the stout fellow lay upon two chairs resting his head on his hand and the squinting man reposed in a similar attitude on the opposite side of the table  between them sat her grandfather looking intently at the winner with a kind of hungry admiration and hanging upon his words as if he were some superior being  she was puzzled for a moment and looked round to see if any else were there  no  then she asked her grandfather in a whisper whether anybody had left the room while she was absent  no he said nobody  it must have been her fancy then and yet it was strange that without anything in her previous thoughts to lead to it she should have imagined this figure so very distinctly  she was still wondering and thinking of it when a girl came to light her to bed  the old man took leave of the company at the same time and they went up stairs together  it was a great rambling house with dull corridors and wide staircases which the flaring candles seemed to make more gloomy  she left her grandfather in his chamber and followed her guide to another which was at the end of a passage and approached by some halfdozen crazy steps  this was prepared for her  the girl lingered a little while to talk and tell her grievances  she had not a good place she said the wages were low and the work was hard  she was going to leave it in a fortnight the child couldnt recommend her to another she supposed  instead she was afraid another would be difficult to get after living there for the house had a very indifferent character there was far too much cardplaying and such like  she was very much mistaken if some of the people who came there oftenest were quite as honest as they might be but she wouldnt have it known that she had said so for the world  then there were some rambling allusions to a rejected sweetheart who had threatened to go a soldieringa final promise of knocking at the door early in the morningand good night  the child did not feel comfortable when she was left alone  she could not help thinking of the figure stealing through the passage down stairs and what the girl had said did not tend to reassure her  the men were very illlooking  they might get their living by robbing and murdering travellers  who could tell  reasoning herself out of these fears or losing sight of them for a little while there came the anxiety to which the adventures of the night gave rise  here was the old passion awakened again in her grandfathers breast and to what further distraction it might tempt him heaven only knew  what fears their absence might have occasioned already  persons might be seeking for them even then  would they be forgiven in the morning or turned adrift again  oh  why had they stopped in that strange place  it would have been better under any circumstances to have gone on  at last sleep gradually stole upon hera broken fitful sleep troubled by dreams of falling from high towers and waking with a start and in great terror  a deeper slumber followed thisand thenwhat that figure in the room  a figure was there  yes she had drawn up the blind to admit the light when it should be dawn and there between the foot of the bed and the dark casement it crouched and slunk along groping its way with noiseless hands and stealing round the bed  she had no voice to cry for help no power to move but lay still watching it  on it cameon silently and stealthily to the beds head  the breath so near her pillow that she shrunk back into it lest those wandering hands should light upon her face  back again it stole to the windowthen turned its head towards her  the dark form was a mere blot upon the lighter darkness of the room but she saw the turning of the head and felt and knew how the eyes looked and the ears listened  there it remained motionless as she at length still keeping the face towards her it busied its hands in something and she heard the chink of money  then on it came again silent and stealthy as before and replacing the garments it had taken from the bedside dropped upon its hands and knees and crawled away  how slowly it seemed to move now that she could hear but not see it creeping along the floor  it reached the door at last and stood upon its feet  the steps creaked beneath its noiseless tread and it was gone  the first impulse of the child was to fly from the terror of being by herself in that roomto have somebody bynot to be aloneand then her power of speech would be restored  with no consciousness of having moved she gained the door  there was the dreadful shadow pausing at the bottom of the steps  she could not pass it she might have done so perhaps in the darkness without being seized but her blood curdled at the thought  the figure stood quite still and so did she not boldly but of necessity for going back into the room was hardly less terrible than going on  the rain beat fast and furiously without and ran down in plashing streams from the thatched roof  some summer insect with no escape into the air flew blindly to and fro beating its body against the walls and ceiling and filling the silent place with murmurs  the figure moved again  the child involuntarily did the same  once in her grandfathers room she would be safe  it crept along the passage until it came to the very door she longed so ardently to reach  the child in the agony of being so near had almost darted forward with the design of bursting into the room and closing it behind her when the figure stopped again  the idea flashed suddenly upon herwhat if it entered there and had a design upon the old mans life  she turned faint and sick  it did it went in  there was a light inside  the figure was now within the chamber and she still dumbquite dumb and almost senselessstood looking on  the door was partly open  not knowing what she meant to do but meaning to preserve him or be killed herself she staggered forward and looked in  what sight was that which met her view  the bed had not been lain on but was smooth and empty  and at a table sat the old man himself the only living creature there his white face pinched and sharpened by the greediness which made his eyes unnaturally brightcounting the money of which his hands had robbed her     chapter 31  with steps more faltering and unsteady than those with which she had approached the room the child withdrew from the door and groped her way back to her own chamber  the terror she had lately felt was nothing compared with that which now oppressed her  no strange robber no treacherous host conniving at the plunder of his guests or stealing to their beds to kill them in their sleep no nightly prowler however terrible and cruel could have awakened in her bosom half the dread which the recognition of her silent visitor inspired  the greyheaded old man gliding like a ghost into her room and acting the thief while he supposed her fast asleep then bearing off his prize and hanging over it with the ghastly exultation she had witnessed was worseimmeasurably worse and far more dreadful for the moment to reflect uponthan anything her wildest fancy could have suggested if he should returnthere was no lock or bolt upon the door and if distrustful of having left some money yet behind he should come back to seek for morea vague awe and horror surrounded the idea of his slinking in again with stealthy tread and turning his face toward the empty bed while she shrank down close at his feet to avoid his touch which was almost insupportable  she sat and listened  hark  a footstep on the stairs and now the door was slowly opening  it was but imagination yet imagination had all the terrors of reality nay it was worse for the reality would have come and gone and there an end but in imagination it was always coming and never went away  the feeling which beset the child was one of dim uncertain horror  she had no fear of the dear old grandfather in whose love for her this disease of the brain had been engendered but the man she had seen that night wrapt in the game of chance lurking in her room and counting the money by the glimmering light seemed like another creature in his shape a monstrous distortion of his image a something to recoil from and be the more afraid of because it bore a likeness to him and kept close about her as he did  she could scarcely connect her own affectionate companion save by his loss with this old man so like yet so unlike him  she had wept to see him dull and quiet  how much greater cause she had for weeping now  the child sat watching and thinking of these things until the phantom in her mind so increased in gloom and terror that she felt it would be a relief to hear the old mans voice or if he were asleep even to see him and banish some of the fears that clustered round his image she stole down the stairs and passage again  the door was still ajar as she had left it and the candle burning as before  she had her own candle in her hand prepared to say if he were waking that she was uneasy and could not rest and had come to see if his were still alight  looking into the room she saw him lying calmly on his bed and so took courage to enter  fast asleep  no passion in the face no avarice no anxiety no wild desire all gentle tranquil and at peace  this was not the gambler or the shadow in her room this was not even the worn and jaded man whose face had so often met her own in the grey morning light this was her dear old friend her harmless fellowtraveller her good kind grandfather  she had no fear as she looked upon his slumbering features but she had a deep and weighty sorrow and it found its relief in tears  god bless him said the child stooping softly to kiss his placid cheek  i see too well now that they would indeed part us if they found us out and shut him up from the light of the sun and sky  he has only me to help him  god bless us both  lighting her candle she retreated as silently as she had come and gaining her own room once more sat up during the remainder of that long long miserable night  at last the day turned her waning candle pale and she fell asleep she was quickly roused by the girl who had shown her up to bed and as soon as she was dressed prepared to go down to her grandfather  but first she searched her pocket and found that her money was all gonenot a sixpence remained  the old man was ready and in a few seconds they were on their road the child thought he rather avoided her eye and appeared to expect that she would tell him of her loss  she felt she must do that or he might suspect the truth  grandfather she said in a tremulous voice after they had walked about a mile in silence do you think they are honest people at the house yonder  why returned the old man trembling  do i think them honestyes they played honestly  ill tell you why i ask rejoined nell  i lost some money last nightout of my bedroom i am sure  unless it was taken by somebody in jestonly in jest dear grandfather which would make me laugh heartily if i could but know it  who would take money in jest returned the old man in a hurried manner  those who take money take it to keep  dont talk of jest  then it was stolen out of my room dear said the child whose last hope was destroyed by the manner of this reply  but is there no more nell said the old man no more anywhere  was it all takenevery farthing of itwas there nothing left  nothing replied the child  we must get more said the old man we must earn it nell hoard it up scrape it together come by it somehow  never mind this loss tell nobody of it and perhaps we may regain it  dont ask howwe may regain it and a great deal morebut tell nobody or trouble may come of it  and so they took it out of thy room when thou wert asleep he added in a compassionate tone very different from the secret cunning way in which he had spoken until now  poor nell poor little nell  the child hung down her head and wept  the sympathising tone in which he spoke was quite sincere she was sure of that  it was not the lightest part of her sorrow to know that this was done for her  not a word about it to any one but me said the old man no not even to me he added hastily for it can do no good  all the losses that ever were are not worth tears from thy eyes darling  why should they be when we will win them back  let them go said the child looking up  let them go once and for ever and i would never shed another tear if every penny had been a thousand pounds  well well returned the old man checking himself as some impetuous answer rose to his lips she knows no better  i ought to be thankful of it  but listen to me said the child earnestly will you listen to me  aye aye ill listen returned the old man still without looking at her a pretty voice  it has always a sweet sound to me  it always had when it was her mothers poor child  let me persuade you thenoh do let me persuade you said the child to think no more of gains or losses and to try no fortune but the fortune we pursue together  we pursue this aim together retorted her grandfather still looking away and seeming to confer with himself  whose image sanctifies the game  have we been worse off resumed the child since you forgot these cares and we have been travelling on together  have we not been much better and happier without a home to shelter us than ever we were in that unhappy house when they were on your mind  she speaks the truth murmured the old man in the same tone as before  it must not turn me but it is the truth no doubt it is  only remember what we have been since that bright morning when we turned our backs upon it for the last time said nell only remember what we have been since we have been free of all those miserieswhat peaceful days and quiet nights we have hadwhat pleasant times we have knownwhat happiness we have enjoyed  if we have been tired or hungry we have been soon refreshed and slept the sounder for it think what beautiful things we have seen and how contented we have felt  and why was this blessed change  he stopped her with a motion of his hand and bade her talk to him no more just then for he was busy  after a time he kissed her cheek still motioning her to silence and walked on looking far before him and sometimes stopping and gazing with a puckered brow upon the ground as if he were painfully trying to collect his disordered thoughts once she saw tears in his eyes  when he had gone on thus for some time he took her hand in his as he was accustomed to do with nothing of the violence or animation of his late manner and so by degrees so fine that the child could not trace them he settled down into his usual quiet way and suffered her to lead him where she would  when they presented themselves in the midst of the stupendous collection they found as nell had anticipated that mrs jarley was not yet out of bed and that although she had suffered some uneasiness on their account overnight and had indeed sat up for them until past eleven oclock she had retired in the persuasion that being overtaken by storm at some distance from home they had sought the nearest shelter and would not return before morning  nell immediately applied herself with great assiduity to the decoration and preparation of the room and had the satisfaction of completing her task and dressing herself neatly before the beloved of the royal family came down to breakfast  we havent had said mrs jarley when the meal was over more than eight of miss monflatherss young ladies all the time weve been here and theres twentysix of em as i was told by the cook when i asked her a question or two and put her on the freelist  we must try em with a parcel of new bills and you shall take it my dear and see what effect that has upon em  the proposed expedition being one of paramount importance mrs jarley adjusted nells bonnet with her own hands and declaring that she certainly did look very pretty and reflected credit on the establishment dismissed her with many commendations and certain needful directions as to the turnings on the right which she was to take and the turnings on the left which she was to avoid  thus instructed nell had no difficulty in finding out miss monflatherss boarding and day establishment which was a large house with a high wall and a large gardengate with a large brass plate and a small grating through which miss monflatherss parlourmaid inspected all visitors before admitting them for nothing in the shape of a manno not even a milkmanwas suffered without special license to pass that gate  even the taxgatherer who was stout and wore spectacles and a broadbrimmed hat had the taxes handed through the grating  more obdurate than gate of adamant or brass this gate of miss monflatherss frowned on all mankind  the very butcher respected it as a gate of mystery and left off whistling when he rang the bell  as nell approached the awful door it turned slowly upon its hinges with a creaking noise and forth from the solemn grove beyond came a long file of young ladies two and two all with open books in their hands and some with parasols likewise  and last of the goodly procession came miss monflathers bearing herself a parasol of lilac silk and supported by two smiling teachers each mortally envious of the other and devoted unto miss monflathers  confused by the looks and whispers of the girls nell stood with downcast eyes and suffered the procession to pass on until miss monflathers bringing up the rear approached her when she curtseyed and presented her little packet on receipt whereof miss monflathers commanded that the line should halt  youre the waxwork child are you not said miss monflathers  yes maam replied nell colouring deeply for the young ladies had collected about her and she was the centre on which all eyes were fixed  and dont you think you must be a very wicked little child said miss monflathers who was of rather uncertain temper and lost no opportunity of impressing moral truths upon the tender minds of the young ladies to be a waxwork child at all  poor nell had never viewed her position in this light and not knowing what to say remained silent blushing more deeply than before  dont you know said miss monflathers that its very naughty and unfeminine and a perversion of the properties wisely and benignantly transmitted to us with expansive powers to be roused from their dormant state through the medium of cultivation  the two teachers murmured their respectful approval of this homethrust and looked at nell as though they would have said that there indeed miss monflathers had hit her very hard  then they smiled and glanced at miss monflathers and then their eyes meeting they exchanged looks which plainly said that each considered herself smiler in ordinary to miss monflathers and regarded the other as having no right to smile and that her so doing was an act of presumption and impertinence  dont you feel how naughty it is of you resumed miss monflathers to be a waxwork child when you might have the proud consciousness of assisting to the extent of your infant powers the manufactures of your country of improving your mind by the constant contemplation of the steamengine and of earning a comfortable and independent subsistence of from twoandninepence to three shillings per week dont you know that the harder you are at work the happier you are  how doth the little murmured one of the teachers in quotation from doctor watts  eh said miss monflathers turning smartly round  who said that  of course the teacher who had not said it indicated the rival who had whom miss monflathers frowningly requested to hold her peace by that means throwing the informing teacher into raptures of joy  the little busy bee said miss monflathers drawing herself up is applicable only to genteel children    in books or work or healthful play  is quite right as far as they are concerned and the work means painting on velvet fancy needlework or embroidery  in such cases as these pointing to nell with her parasol and in the case of all poor peoples children we should read it thus     in work work work  in work alway   let my first years be past   that i may give for evry day   some good account at last   a deep hum of applause rose not only from the two teachers but from all the pupils who were equally astonished to hear miss monflathers improvising after this brilliant style for although she had been long known as a politician she had never appeared before as an original poet  just then somebody happened to discover that nell was crying and all eyes were again turned towards her  there were indeed tears in her eyes and drawing out her handkerchief to brush them away she happened to let it fall  before she could stoop to pick it up one young lady of about fifteen or sixteen who had been standing a little apart from the others as though she had no recognised place among them sprang forward and put it in her hand she was gliding timidly away again when she was arrested by the governess  it was miss edwards who did that i know said miss monflathers predictively  now i am sure that was miss edwards  it was miss edwards and everybody said it was miss edwards and miss edwards herself admitted that it was  is it not said miss monflathers putting down her parasol to take a severer view of the offender a most remarkable thing miss edwards that you have an attachment to the lower classes which always draws you to their sides or rather is it not a most extraordinary thing that all i say and do will not wean you from propensities which your original station in life have unhappily rendered habitual to you you extremely vulgarminded girl  i really intended no harm maam said a sweet voice  it was a momentary impulse indeed  an impulse repeated miss monflathers scornfully  i wonder that you presume to speak of impulses to meboth the teachers assentedi am astonishedboth the teachers were astonishedi suppose it is an impulse which induces you to take the part of every grovelling and debased person that comes in your wayboth the teachers supposed so too  but i would have you know miss edwards resumed the governess in a tone of increased severity that you cannot be permittedif it be only for the sake of preserving a proper example and decorum in this establishmentthat you cannot be permitted and that you shall not be permitted to fly in the face of your superiors in this exceedingly gross manner  if you have no reason to feel a becoming pride before waxwork children there are young ladies here who have and you must either defer to those young ladies or leave the establishment miss edwards  this young lady being motherless and poor was apprenticed at the schooltaught for nothingteaching others what she learnt for nothingboarded for nothinglodged for nothingand set down and rated as something immeasurably less than nothing by all the dwellers in the house  the servantmaids felt her inferiority for they were better treated free to come and go and regarded in their stations with much more respect  the teachers were infinitely superior for they had paid to go to school in their time and were paid now  the pupils cared little for a companion who had no grand stories to tell about home no friends to come with posthorses and be received in all humility with cake and wine by the governess no deferential servant to attend and bear her home for the holidays nothing genteel to talk about and nothing to display  but why was miss monflathers always vexed and irritated with the poor apprenticehow did that come to pass  why the gayest feather in miss monflatherss cap and the brightest glory of miss monflatherss school was a baronets daughterthe real live daughter of a real live baronetwho by some extraordinary reversal of the laws of nature was not only plain in features but dull in intellect while the poor apprentice had both a ready wit and a handsome face and figure  it seems incredible  here was miss edwards who only paid a small premium which had been spent long ago every day outshining and excelling the baronets daughter who learned all the extras or was taught them all and whose halfyearly bill came to double that of any other young ladys in the school making no account of the honour and reputation of her pupilage  therefore and because she was a dependent miss monflathers had a great dislike to miss edwards and was spiteful to her and aggravated by her and when she had compassion on little nell verbally fell upon and maltreated her as we have already seen  you will not take the air today miss edwards said miss monflathers  have the goodness to retire to your own room and not to leave it without permission  the poor girl was moving hastily away when she was suddenly in nautical phrase brought to by a subdued shriek from miss monflathers  she has passed me without any salute cried the governess raising her eyes to the sky  she has actually passed me without the slightest acknowledgment of my presence  the young lady turned and curtsied  nell could see that she raised her dark eyes to the face of her superior and that their expression and that of her whole attitude for the instant was one of mute but most touching appeal against this ungenerous usage  miss monflathers only tossed her head in reply and the great gate closed upon a bursting heart  as for you you wicked child said miss monflathers turning to nell tell your mistress that if she presumes to take the liberty of sending to me any more i will write to the legislative authorities and have her put in the stocks or compelled to do penance in a white sheet and you may depend upon it that you shall certainly experience the treadmill if you dare to come here again  now ladies on  the procession filed off two and two with the books and parasols and miss monflathers calling the baronets daughter to walk with her and smooth her ruffled feelings discarded the two teacherswho by this time had exchanged their smiles for looks of sympathyand left them to bring up the rear and hate each other a little more for being obliged to walk together     chapter 32  mrs jarleys wrath on first learning that she had been threatened with the indignity of stocks and penance passed all description  the genuine and only jarley exposed to public scorn jeered by children and flouted by beadles  the delight of the nobility and gentry shorn of a bonnet which a lady mayoress might have sighed to wear and arrayed in a white sheet as a spectacle of mortification and humility and miss monflathers the audacious creature who presumed even in the dimmest and remotest distance of her imagination to conjure up the degrading picture i am amost inclined said mrs jarley bursting with the fulness of her anger and the weakness of her means of revenge to turn atheist when i think of it  but instead of adopting this course of retaliation mrs jarley on second thoughts brought out the suspicious bottle and ordering glasses to be set forth upon her favourite drum and sinking into a chair behind it called her satellites about her and to them several times recounted word for word the affronts she had received  this done she begged them in a kind of deep despair to drink then laughed then cried then took a little sip herself then laughed and cried again and took a little more and so by degrees the worthy lady went on increasing in smiles and decreasing in tears until at last she could not laugh enough at miss monflathers who from being an object of dire vexation became one of sheer ridicule and absurdity  for which of us is best off i wonder quoth mrs jarley she or me its only talking when all is said and done and if she talks of me in the stocks why i can talk of her in the stocks which is a good deal funnier if we come to that  lord what does it matter after all  having arrived at this comfortable frame of mind to which she had been greatly assisted by certain short interjectional remarks of the philosophical george mrs jarley consoled nell with many kind words and requested as a personal favour that whenever she thought of miss monflathers she would do nothing else but laugh at her all the days of her life  so ended mrs jarleys wrath which subsided long before the going down of the sun  nells anxieties however were of a deeper kind and the checks they imposed upon her cheerfulness were not so easily removed  that evening as she had dreaded her grandfather stole away and did not come back until the night was far spent  worn out as she was and fatigued in mind and body she sat up alone counting the minutes until he returnedpenniless brokenspirited and wretched but still hotly bent upon his infatuation  get me money he said wildly as they parted for the night  i must have money nell  it shall be paid thee back with gallant interest one day but all the money that comes into thy hands must be minenot for myself but to use for thee  remember nell to use for thee  what could the child do with the knowledge she had but give him every penny that came into her hands lest he should be tempted on to rob their benefactress  if she told the truth so thought the child he would be treated as a madman if she did not supply him with money he would supply himself supplying him she fed the fire that burnt him up and put him perhaps beyond recovery  distracted by these thoughts borne down by the weight of the sorrow which she dared not tell tortured by a crowd of apprehensions whenever the old man was absent and dreading alike his stay and his return the colour forsook her cheek her eye grew dim and her heart was oppressed and heavy  all her old sorrows had come back upon her augmented by new fears and doubts by day they were ever present to her mind by night they hovered round her pillow and haunted her in dreams  it was natural that in the midst of her affliction she should often revert to that sweet young lady of whom she had only caught a hasty glance but whose sympathy expressed in one slight brief action dwelt in her memory like the kindnesses of years  she would often think if she had such a friend as that to whom to tell her griefs how much lighter her heart would bethat if she were but free to hear that voice she would be happier  then she would wish that she were something better that she were not quite so poor and humble that she dared address her without fearing a repulse and then feel that there was an immeasurable distance between them and have no hope that the young lady thought of her any more  it was now holidaytime at the schools and the young ladies had gone home and miss monflathers was reported to be flourishing in london and damaging the hearts of middleaged gentlemen but nobody said anything about miss edwards whether she had gone home or whether she had any home to go to whether she was still at the school or anything about her  but one evening as nell was returning from a lonely walk she happened to pass the inn where the stagecoaches stopped just as one drove up and there was the beautiful girl she so well remembered pressing forward to embrace a young child whom they were helping down from the roof  well this was her sister her little sister much younger than nell whom she had not seen so the story went afterwards for five years and to bring whom to that place on a short visit she had been saving her poor means all that time  nell felt as if her heart would break when she saw them meet  they went a little apart from the knot of people who had congregated about the coach and fell upon each others neck and sobbed and wept with joy  their plain and simple dress the distance which the child had come alone their agitation and delight and the tears they shed would have told their history by themselves  they became a little more composed in a short time and went away not so much hand in hand as clinging to each other  are you sure youre happy sister said the child as they passed where nell was standing quite happy now she answered  but always said the child  ah sister why do you turn away your face  nell could not help following at a little distance  they went to the house of an old nurse where the elder sister had engaged a bedroom for the child  i shall come to you early every morning she said and we can be together all the daywhy not at nighttime too dear sister would they be angry with you for that  why were the eyes of little nell wet that night with tears like those of the two sisters  why did she bear a grateful heart because they had met and feel it pain to think that they would shortly part  let us not believe that any selfish referenceunconscious though it might have beento her own trials awoke this sympathy but thank god that the innocent joys of others can strongly move us and that we even in our fallen nature have one source of pure emotion which must be prized in heaven  by mornings cheerful glow but oftener still by evenings gentle light the child with a respect for the short and happy intercourse of these two sisters which forbade her to approach and say a thankful word although she yearned to do so followed them at a distance in their walks and rambles stopping when they stopped sitting on the grass when they sat down rising when they went on and feeling it a companionship and delight to be so near them  their evening walk was by a rivers side  here every night the child was too unseen by them unthought of unregarded but feeling as if they were her friends as if they had confidences and trusts together as if her load were lightened and less hard to bear as if they mingled their sorrows and found mutual consolation  it was a weak fancy perhaps the childish fancy of a young and lonely creature but night after night and still the sisters loitered in the same place and still the child followed with a mild and softened heart  she was much startled on returning home one night to find that mrs jarley had commanded an announcement to be prepared to the effect that the stupendous collection would only remain in its present quarters one day longer in fulfilment of which threat for all announcements connected with public amusements are well known to be irrevocable and most exact the stupendous collection shut up next day  are we going from this place directly maam said nell  look here child returned mrs jarley  thatll inform you and so saying mrs jarley produced another announcement wherein it was stated that in consequence of numerous inquiries at the waxwork door and in consequence of crowds having been disappointed in obtaining admission the exhibition would be continued for one week longer and would reopen next day  for now that the schools are gone and the regular sightseers exhausted said mrs jarley we come to the general public and they want stimulating  upon the following day at noon mrs jarley established herself behind the highlyornamented table attended by the distinguished effigies before mentioned and ordered the doors to be thrown open for the readmission of a discerning and enlightened public  but the first days operations were by no means of a successful character inasmuch as the general public though they manifested a lively interest in mrs jarley personally and such of her waxen satellites as were to be seen for nothing were not affected by any impulses moving them to the payment of sixpence a head  thus notwithstanding that a great many people continued to stare at the entry and the figures therein displayed and remained there with great perseverance by the hour at a time to hear the barrelorgan played and to read the bills and notwithstanding that they were kind enough to recommend their friends to patronise the exhibition in the like manner until the doorway was regularly blockaded by half the population of the town who when they went off duty were relieved by the other half it was not found that the treasury was any the richer or that the prospects of the establishment were at all encouraging  in this depressed state of the classical market mrs jarley made extraordinary efforts to stimulate the popular taste and whet the popular curiosity  certain machinery in the body of the nun on the leads over the door was cleaned up and put in motion so that the figure shook its head paralytically all day long to the great admiration of a drunken but very protestant barber over the way who looked upon the said paralytic motion as typical of the degrading effect wrought upon the human mind by the ceremonies of the romish church and discoursed upon that theme with great eloquence and morality  the two carters constantly passed in and out of the exhibitionroom under various disguises protesting aloud that the sight was better worth the money than anything they had beheld in all their lives and urging the bystanders with tears in their eyes not to neglect such a brilliant gratification  mrs jarley sat in the payplace chinking silver moneys from noon till night and solemnly calling upon the crowd to take notice that the price of admission was only sixpence and that the departure of the whole collection on a short tour among the crowned heads of europe was positively fixed for that day week  so be in time be in time be in time said mrs jarley at the close of every such address  remember that this is jarleys stupendous collection of upwards of one hundred figures and that it is the only collection in the world all others being imposters and deceptions  be in time be in time be in time     chapter 33  as the course of this tale requires that we should become acquainted somewhere hereabouts with a few particulars connected with the domestic economy of mr sampson brass and as a more convenient place than the present is not likely to occur for that purpose the historian takes the friendly reader by the hand and springing with him into the air and cleaving the same at a greater rate than ever don cleophas leandro perez zambullo and his familiar travelled through that pleasant region in company alights with him upon the pavement of bevis marks  the intrepid aeronauts alight before a small dark house once the residence of mr sampson brass  in the parlour window of this little habitation which is so close upon the footway that the passenger who takes the wall brushes the dim glass with his coat sleevemuch to its improvement for it is very dirtyin this parlour window in the days of its occupation by sampson brass there hung all awry and slack and discoloured by the sun a curtain of faded green so threadbare from long service as by no means to intercept the view of the little dark room but rather to afford a favourable medium through which to observe it accurately  there was not much to look at  a rickety table with spare bundles of papers yellow and ragged from long carriage in the pocket ostentatiously displayed upon its top a couple of stools set face to face on opposite sides of this crazy piece of furniture a treacherous old chair by the fireplace whose withered arms had hugged full many a client and helped to squeeze him dry a secondhand wig box used as a depository for blank writs and declarations and other small forms of law once the sole contents of the head which belonged to the wig which belonged to the box as they were now of the box itself two or three common books of practice a jar of ink a pounce box a stunted hearthbroom a carpet trodden to shreds but still clinging with the tightness of desperation to its tacksthese with the yellow wainscot of the walls the smokediscoloured ceiling the dust and cobwebs were among the most prominent decorations of the office of mr sampson brass  but this was mere stilllife of no greater importance than the plate brass solicitor upon the door and the bill first floor to let to a single gentleman which was tied to the knocker  the office commonly held two examples of animated nature more to the purpose of this history and in whom it has a stronger interest and more particular concern  of these one was mr brass himself who has already appeared in these pages  the other was his clerk assistant housekeeper secretary confidential plotter adviser intriguer and bill of cost increaser miss brassa kind of amazon at common law of whom it may be desirable to offer a brief description  miss sally brass then was a lady of thirtyfive or thereabouts of a gaunt and bony figure and a resolute bearing which if it repressed the softer emotions of love and kept admirers at a distance certainly inspired a feeling akin to awe in the breasts of those male strangers who had the happiness to approach her  in face she bore a striking resemblance to her brother sampsonso exact indeed was the likeness between them that had it consorted with miss brasss maiden modesty and gentle womanhood to have assumed her brothers clothes in a frolic and sat down beside him it would have been difficult for the oldest friend of the family to determine which was sampson and which sally especially as the lady carried upon her upper lip certain reddish demonstrations which if the imagination had been assisted by her attire might have been mistaken for a beard  these were however in all probability nothing more than eyelashes in a wrong place as the eyes of miss brass were quite free from any such natural impertinencies  in complexion miss brass was sallowrather a dirty sallow so to speakbut this hue was agreeably relieved by the healthy glow which mantled in the extreme tip of her laughing nose  her voice was exceedingly impressivedeep and rich in quality and once heard not easily forgotten  her usual dress was a green gown in colour not unlike the curtain of the office window made tight to the figure and terminating at the throat where it was fastened behind by a peculiarly large and massive button  feeling no doubt that simplicity and plainness are the soul of elegance miss brass wore no collar or kerchief except upon her head which was invariably ornamented with a brown gauze scarf like the wing of the fabled vampire and which twisted into any form that happened to suggest itself formed an easy and graceful headdress  such was miss brass in person  in mind she was of a strong and vigorous turn having from her earliest youth devoted herself with uncommon ardour to the study of law not wasting her speculations upon its eagle flights which are rare but tracing it attentively through all the slippery and eellike crawlings in which it commonly pursues its way  nor had she like many persons of great intellect confined herself to theory or stopped short where practical usefulness begins inasmuch as she could ingross faircopy fill up printed forms with perfect accuracy and in short transact any ordinary duty of the office down to pouncing a skin of parchment or mending a pen  it is difficult to understand how possessed of these combined attractions she should remain miss brass but whether she had steeled her heart against mankind or whether those who might have wooed and won her were deterred by fears that being learned in the law she might have too near her fingers ends those particular statutes which regulate what are familiarly termed actions for breach certain it is that she was still in a state of celibacy and still in daily occupation of her old stool opposite to that of her brother sampson  and equally certain it is by the way that between these two stools a great many people had come to the ground  one morning mr sampson brass sat upon his stool copying some legal process and viciously digging his pen deep into the paper as if he were writing upon the very heart of the party against whom it was directed and miss sally brass sat upon her stool making a new pen preparatory to drawing out a little bill which was her favourite occupation and so they sat in silence for a long time until miss brass broke silence  have you nearly done sammy said miss brass for in her mild and feminine lips sampson became sammy and all things were softened down  no returned her brother  it would have been all done though if you had helped at the right time  oh yes indeed cried miss sally you want my help dont youyou too that are going to keep a clerk  am i going to keep a clerk for my own pleasure or because of my own wish you provoking rascal said mr brass putting his pen in his mouth and grinning spitefully at his sister  what do you taunt me about going to keep a clerk for  it may be observed in this place lest the fact of mr brass calling a lady a rascal should occasion any wonderment or surprise that he was so habituated to having her near him in a mans capacity that he had gradually accustomed himself to talk to her as though she were really a man  and this feeling was so perfectly reciprocal that not only did mr brass often call miss brass a rascal or even put an adjective before the rascal but miss brass looked upon it as quite a matter of course and was as little moved as any other lady would be by being called an angel  what do you taunt me after three hours talk last night with going to keep a clerk for repeated mr brass grinning again with the pen in his mouth like some noblemans or gentlemans crest  is it my fault  all i know is said miss sally smiling drily for she delighted in nothing so much as irritating her brother that if every one of your clients is to force us to keep a clerk whether we want to or not you had better leave off business strike yourself off the roll and get taken in execution as soon as you can  have we got any other client like him said brass  have we got another client like him nowwill you answer me that  do you mean in the face said his sister  do i mean in the face sneered sampson brass reaching over to take up the billbook and fluttering its leaves rapidly  look heredaniel quilp esquiredaniel quilp esquiredaniel quilp esquireall through  whether should i take a clerk that he recommends and says this is the man for you or lose all this eh  miss sally deigned to make no reply but smiled again and went on with her work  but i know what it is resumed brass after a short silence  youre afraid you wont have as long a finger in the business as youve been used to have  do you think i dont see through that  the business wouldnt go on very long i expect without me returned his sister composedly  dont you be a fool and provoke me sammy but mind what youre doing and do it  sampson brass who was at heart in great fear of his sister sulkily bent over his writing again and listened as she said  if i determined that the clerk ought not to come of course he wouldnt be allowed to come  you know that well enough so dont talk nonsense  mr brass received this observation with increased meekness merely remarking under his breath that he didnt like that kind of joking and that miss sally would be a much better fellow if she forbore to aggravate him  to this compliment miss sally replied that she had a relish for the amusement and had no intention to forego its gratification  mr brass not caring as it seemed to pursue the subject any further they both plied their pens at a great pace and there the discussion ended  while they were thus employed the window was suddenly darkened as by some person standing close against it  as mr brass and miss sally looked up to ascertain the cause the top sash was nimbly lowered from without and quilp thrust in his head  hallo he said standing on tiptoe on the windowsill and looking down into the room  is there anybody at home  is there any of the devils ware here  is brass at a premium eh  ha ha ha laughed the lawyer in an affected ecstasy  oh very good sir  oh very good indeed  quite eccentric  dear me what humour he has  is that my sally croaked the dwarf ogling the fair miss brass  is it justice with the bandage off her eyes and without the sword and scales  is it the strong arm of the law  is it the virgin of bevis  what an amazing flow of spirits cried brass  upon my word its quite extraordinary  open the door said quilp ive got him here  such a clerk for you brass such a prize such an ace of trumps  be quick and open the door or if theres another lawyer near and he should happen to look out of window hell snap him up before your eyes he will  it is probable that the loss of the phoenix of clerks even to a rival practitioner would not have broken mr brasss heart but pretending great alacrity he rose from his seat and going to the door returned introducing his client who led by the hand no less a person than mr richard swiveller  there she is said quilp stopping short at the door and wrinkling up his eyebrows as he looked towards miss sally there is the woman i ought to have marriedthere is the beautiful sarahthere is the female who has all the charms of her sex and none of their weaknesses oh sally sally  to this amorous address miss brass briefly responded bother  hardhearted as the metal from which she takes her name said quilp why dont she change itmelt down the brass and take another name  hold your nonsense mr quilp do returned miss sally with a grim smile  i wonder youre not ashamed of yourself before a strange young man  the strange young man said quilp handing dick swiveller forward is too susceptible himself not to understand me well  this is mr swiveller my intimate frienda gentleman of good family and great expectations but who having rather involved himself by youthful indiscretion is content for a time to fill the humble station of a clerkhumble but here most enviable  what a delicious atmosphere  if mr quilp spoke figuratively and meant to imply that the air breathed by miss sally brass was sweetened and rarefied by that dainty creature he had doubtless good reason for what he said  but if he spoke of the delights of the atmosphere of mr brasss office in a literal sense he had certainly a peculiar taste as it was of a close and earthy kind and besides being frequently impregnated with strong whiffs of the secondhand wearing apparel exposed for sale in dukes place and houndsditch had a decided flavour of rats and mice and a taint of mouldiness  perhaps some doubts of its pure delight presented themselves to mr swiveller as he gave vent to one or two short abrupt sniffs and looked incredulously at the grinning dwarf  mr swiveller said quilp being pretty well accustomed to the agricultural pursuits of sowing wild oats miss sally prudently considers that half a loaf is better than no bread  to be out of harms way he prudently thinks is something too and therefore he accepts your brothers offer  brass mr swiveller is yours  i am very glad sir said mr brass very glad indeed  mr swiveller sir is fortunate enough to have your friendship  you may be very proud sir to have the friendship of mr quilp  dick murmured something about never wanting a friend or a bottle to give him and also gasped forth his favourite allusion to the wing of friendship and its never moulting a feather but his faculties appeared to be absorbed in the contemplation of miss sally brass at whom he stared with blank and rueful looks which delighted the watchful dwarf beyond measure  as to the divine miss sally herself she rubbed her hands as men of business do and took a few turns up and down the office with her pen behind her ear  i suppose said the dwarf turning briskly to his legal friend that mr swiveller enters upon his duties at once  its monday morning  at once if you please sir by all means returned brass  miss sally will teach him law the delightful study of the law said quilp shell be his guide his friend his companion his blackstone his coke upon littleton his young lawyers best companion  he is exceedingly eloquent said brass like a man abstracted and looking at the roofs of the opposite houses with his hands in his pockets he has an extraordinary flow of language  beautiful really  with miss sally quilp went on and the beautiful fictions of the law his days will pass like minutes  those charming creations of the poet john doe and richard roe when they first dawn upon him will open a new world for the enlargement of his mind and the improvement of his heart  oh beautiful beautiful  beautiful indeed cried brass  its a treat to hear him  where will mr swiveller sit said quilp looking round  why well buy another stool sir returned brass  we hadnt any thoughts of having a gentleman with us sir until you were kind enough to suggest it and our accommodations not extensive  well look about for a secondhand stool sir  in the meantime if mr swiveller will take my seat and try his hand at a fair copy of this ejectment as i shall be out pretty well all the morning  walk with me said quilp  i have a word or two to say to you on points of business  can you spare the time  can i spare the time to walk with you sir  youre joking sir youre joking with me replied the lawyer putting on his hat  im ready sir quite ready  my time must be fully occupied indeed sir not to leave me time to walk with you  its not everybody sir who has an opportunity of improving himself by the conversation of mr quilp  the dwarf glanced sarcastically at his brazen friend and with a short dry cough turned upon his heel to bid adieu to miss sally  after a very gallant parting on his side and a very cool and gentlemanly sort of one on hers he nodded to dick swiveller and withdrew with the attorney  dick stood at the desk in a state of utter stupefaction staring with all his might at the beauteous sally as if she had been some curious animal whose like had never lived  when the dwarf got into the street he mounted again upon the windowsill and looked into the office for a moment with a grinning face as a man might peep into a cage  dick glanced upward at him but without any token of recognition and long after he had disappeared still stood gazing upon miss sally brass seeing or thinking of nothing else and rooted to the spot  miss brass being by this time deep in the bill of costs took no notice whatever of dick but went scratching on with a noisy pen scoring down the figures with evident delight and working like a steamengine there stood dick gazing now at the green gown now at the brown headdress now at the face and now at the rapid pen in a state of stupid perplexity wondering how he got into the company of that strange monster and whether it was a dream and he would ever wake  at last he heaved a deep sigh and began slowly pulling off his coat  mr swiveller pulled off his coat and folded it up with great elaboration staring at miss sally all the time then put on a blue jacket with a double row of gilt buttons which he had originally ordered for aquatic expeditions but had brought with him that morning for office purposes and still keeping his eye upon her suffered himself to drop down silently upon mr brasss stool  then he underwent a relapse and becoming powerless again rested his chin upon his hand and opened his eyes so wide that it appeared quite out of the question that he could ever close them any more  when he had looked so long that he could see nothing dick took his eyes off the fair object of his amazement turned over the leaves of the draft he was to copy dipped his pen into the inkstand and at last and by slow approaches began to write  but he had not written halfadozen words when reaching over to the inkstand to take a fresh dip he happened to raise his eyes  there was the intolerable brown headdressthere was the green gownthere in short was miss sally brass arrayed in all her charms and more tremendous than ever  this happened so often that mr swiveller by degrees began to feel strange influences creeping over himhorrible desires to annihilate this sally brassmysterious promptings to knock her headdress off and try how she looked without it  there was a very large ruler on the table a large black shining ruler  mr swiveller took it up and began to rub his nose with it  from rubbing his nose with the ruler to poising it in his hand and giving it an occasional flourish after the tomahawk manner the transition was easy and natural  in some of these flourishes it went close to miss sallys head the ragged edges of the headdress fluttered with the wind it raised advance it but an inch and that great brown knot was on the ground yet still the unconscious maiden worked away and never raised her eyes  well this was a great relief  it was a good thing to write doggedly and obstinately until he was desperate and then snatch up the ruler and whirl it about the brown headdress with the consciousness that he could have it off if he liked  it was a good thing to draw it back and rub his nose very hard with it if he thought miss sally was going to look up and to recompense himself with more hardy flourishes when he found she was still absorbed  by these means mr swiveller calmed the agitation of his feelings until his applications to the ruler became less fierce and frequent and he could even write as many as halfadozen consecutive lines without having recourse to itwhich was a great victory     chapter 34  in course of time that is to say after a couple of hours or so of diligent application miss brass arrived at the conclusion of her task and recorded the fact by wiping her pen upon the green gown and taking a pinch of snuff from a little round tin box which she carried in her pocket  having disposed of this temperate refreshment she arose from her stool tied her papers into a formal packet with red tape and taking them under her arm marched out of the office  mr swiveller had scarcely sprung off his seat and commenced the performance of a maniac hornpipe when he was interrupted in the fulness of his joy at being again alone by the opening of the door and the reappearance of miss sallys head  i am going out said miss brass  very good maam returned dick  and dont hurry yourself on my account to come back maam he added inwardly  if anybody comes on office business take their messages and say that the gentleman who attends to that matter isnt in at present will you said miss brass  i will maam replied dick  i shant be very long said miss brass retiring  im sorry to hear it maam rejoined dick when she had shut the door  i hope you may be unexpectedly detained maam  if you could manage to be run over maam but not seriously so much the better  uttering these expressions of goodwill with extreme gravity mr swiveller sat down in the clients chair and pondered then took a few turns up and down the room and fell into the chair again  so im brasss clerk am i said dick  brasss clerk eh  and the clerk of brasss sisterclerk to a female dragon  very good very good  what shall i be next  shall i be a convict in a felt hat and a grey suit trotting about a dockyard with my number neatly embroidered on my uniform and the order of the garter on my leg restrained from chafing my ankle by a twisted belcher handkerchief  shall i be that will that do or is it too genteel  whatever you please have it your own way of course  as he was entirely alone it may be presumed that in these remarks mr swiveller addressed himself to his fate or destiny whom as we learn by the precedents it is the custom of heroes to taunt in a very bitter and ironical manner when they find themselves in situations of an unpleasant nature  this is the more probable from the circumstance of mr swiveller directing his observations to the ceiling which these bodily personages are usually supposed to inhabitexcept in theatrical cases when they live in the heart of the great chandelier  quilp offers me this place which he says he can insure me resumed dick after a thoughtful silence and telling off the

man knocks himself down if his destiny knocks him down his destiny must pick him up again  then im very glad that mine has brought all this upon itself and i shall be as careless as i can and make myself quite at home to spite it  so go on my buck said mr swiveller taking his leave of the ceiling with a significant nod and let us see which of us will be tired first  dismissing the subject of his downfall with these reflections which were no doubt very profound and are indeed not altogether unknown in certain systems of moral philosophy mr swiveller shook off his despondency and assumed the cheerful ease of an irresponsible clerk  as a means towards his composure and selfpossession he entered into a more minute examination of the office than he had yet had time to make looked into the wigbox the books and inkbottle untied and inspected all the papers carved a few devices on the table with a sharp blade of mr brasss penknife and wrote his name on the inside of the wooden coalscuttle  having as it were taken formal possession of his clerkship in virtue of these proceedings he opened the window and leaned negligently out of it until a beerboy happened to pass whom he commanded to set down his tray and to serve him with a pint of mild porter which he drank upon the spot and promptly paid for with the view of breaking ground for a system of future credit and opening a correspondence tending thereto without loss of time  then three or four little boys dropped in on legal errands from three or four attorneys of the brass grade whom mr swiveller received and dismissed with about as professional a manner and as correct and comprehensive an understanding of their business as would have been shown by a clown in a pantomime under similar circumstances  these things done and over he got upon his stool again and tried his hand at drawing caricatures of miss brass with a pen and ink whistling very cheerfully all the time  he was occupied in this diversion when a coach stopped near the door and presently afterwards there was a loud doubleknock  as this was no business of mr swivellers the person not ringing the office bell he pursued his diversion with perfect composure notwithstanding that he rather thought there was nobody else in the house  in this however he was mistaken for after the knock had been repeated with increased impatience the door was opened and somebody with a very heavy tread went up the stairs and into the room above  mr swiveller was wondering whether this might be another miss brass twin sister to the dragon when there came a rapping of knuckles at the office door  come in said dick  dont stand upon ceremony  the business will get rather complicated if ive many more customers  come in  oh please said a little voice very low down in the doorway will you come and show the lodgings  dick leant over the table and descried a small slipshod girl in a dirty coarse apron and bib which left nothing of her visible but her face and feet  she might as well have been dressed in a violincase  why who are you said dick  to which the only reply was oh please will you come and show the lodgings  there never was such an oldfashioned child in her looks and manner she must have been at work from her cradle  she seemed as much afraid of dick as dick was amazed at her  i havnt got anything to do with the lodgings said dick  tell em to call again  oh but please will you come and show the lodgings returned the girl its eighteen shillings a week and us finding plate and linen boots and clothes is extra and fires in wintertime is eightpence a day  why dont you show em yourself  you seem to know all about em said dick  miss sally said i wasnt to because people wouldnt believe the attendance was good if they saw how small i was first  well but theyll see how small you are afterwards wont they said dick  ah  but then theyll have taken em for a fortnight certain replied the child with a shrewd look and people dont like moving when theyre once settled  this is a queer sort of thing muttered dick rising  what do you mean to say you arethe cook  yes i do plain cooking replied the child  im housemaid too i do all the work of the house  i suppose brass and the dragon and i do the dirtiest part of it thought dick  and he might have thought much more being in a doubtful and hesitating mood but that the girl again urged her request and certain mysterious bumping sounds on the passage and staircase seemed to give note of the applicants impatience  richard swiveller therefore sticking a pen behind each ear and carrying another in his mouth as a token of his great importance and devotion to business hurried out to meet and treat with the single gentleman  he was a little surprised to perceive that the bumping sounds were occasioned by the progress upstairs of the single gentlemans trunk which being nearly twice as wide as the staircase and exceedingly heavy withal it was no easy matter for the united exertions of the single gentleman and the coachman to convey up the steep ascent  but there they were crushing each other and pushing and pulling with all their might and getting the trunk tight and fast in all kinds of impossible angles and to pass them was out of the question for which sufficient reason mr swiveller followed slowly behind entering a new protest on every stair against the house of mr sampson brass being thus taken by storm  to these remonstrances the single gentleman answered not a word but when the trunk was at last got into the bedroom sat down upon it and wiped his bald head and face with his handkerchief  he was very warm and well he might be for not to mention the exertion of getting the trunk up stairs he was closely muffled in winter garments though the thermometer had stood all day at eightyone in the shade  i believe sir said richard swiveller taking his pen out of his mouth that you desire to look at these apartments  they are very charming apartments sir  they command an uninterrupted view ofof over the way and they are within one minutes walk ofof the corner of the street  there is exceedingly mild porter sir in the immediate vicinity and the contingent advantages are extraordinary  whats the rent said the single gentleman  one pound per week replied dick improving on the terms  ill take em  the boots and clothes are extras said dick and the fires in winter time are  are all agreed to answered the single gentleman  two weeks certain said dick are the  two weeks cried the single gentleman gruffly eyeing him from top to toe  two years  i shall live here for two years  here  ten pounds down  the bargains made  why you see said dick my name is not brass and  who said it was  my names not brass  what then  the name of the master of the house is said dick  im glad of it returned the single gentleman its a good name for a lawyer  coachman you may go  so may you sir  mr swiveller was so much confounded by the single gentleman riding roughshod over him at this rate that he stood looking at him almost as hard as he had looked at miss sally  the single gentleman however was not in the slightest degree affected by this circumstance but proceeded with perfect composure to unwind the shawl which was tied round his neck and then to pull off his boots  freed of these encumbrances he went on to divest himself of his other clothing which he folded up piece by piece and ranged in order on the trunk  then he pulled down the windowblinds drew the curtains wound up his watch and quite leisurely and methodically got into bed  take down the bill were his parting words as he looked out from between the curtains and let nobody call me till i ring the bell  with that the curtains closed and he seemed to snore immediately  this is a most remarkable and supernatural sort of house said mr swiveller as he walked into the office with the bill in his hand shedragons in the business conducting themselves like professional gentlemen plain cooks of three feet high appearing mysteriously from under ground strangers walking in and going to bed without leave or licence in the middle of the day  if he should be one of the miraculous fellows that turn up now and then and has gone to sleep for two years i shall be in a pleasant situation  its my destiny however and i hope brass may like it  i shall be sorry if he dont but its no business of minei have nothing whatever to do with it     chapter 35  mr brass on returning home received the report of his clerk with much complacency and satisfaction and was particular in inquiring after the tenpound note which proving on examination to be a good and lawful note of the governor and company of the bank of england increased his goodhumour considerably  indeed he so overflowed with liberality and condescension that in the fulness of his heart he invited mr swiveller to partake of a bowl of punch with him at that remote and indefinite period which is currently denominated one of these days and paid him many handsome compliments on the uncommon aptitude for business which his conduct on the first day of his devotion to it had so plainly evinced  it was a maxim with mr brass that the habit of paying compliments kept a mans tongue oiled without any expense and as that useful member ought never to grow rusty or creak in turning on its hinges in the case of a practitioner of the law in whom it should be always glib and easy he lost few opportunities of improving himself by the utterance of handsome speeches and eulogistic expressions  and this had passed into such a habit with him that if he could not be correctly said to have his tongue at his fingers ends he might certainly be said to have it anywhere but in his face which being as we have already seen of a harsh and repulsive character was not oiled so easily but frowned above all the smooth speechesone of natures beacons warning off those who navigated the shoals and breakers of the world or of that dangerous strait the law and admonishing them to seek less treacherous harbours and try their fortune elsewhere  while mr brass by turns overwhelmed his clerk with compliments and inspected the tenpound note miss sally showed little emotion and that of no pleasurable kind for as the tendency of her legal practice had been to fix her thoughts on small gains and gripings and to whet and sharpen her natural wisdom she was not a little disappointed that the single gentleman had obtained the lodgings at such an easy rate arguing that when he was seen to have set his mind upon them he should have been at the least charged double or treble the usual terms and that in exact proportion as he pressed forward mr swiveller should have hung back  but neither the good opinion of mr brass nor the dissatisfaction of miss sally wrought any impression upon that young gentleman who throwing the responsibility of this and all other acts and deeds thereafter to be done by him upon his unlucky destiny was quite resigned and comfortable fully prepared for the worst and philosophically indifferent to the best   good morning mr richard said brass on the second day of mr swivellers clerkship  sally found you a secondhand stool sir yesterday evening in whitechapel  shes a rare fellow at a bargain i can tell you mr richard  youll find that a firstrate stool sir take my word for it  its rather a crazy one to look at said dick  youll find it a most amazing stool to sit down upon you may depend returned mr brass  it was bought in the open street just opposite the hospital and as it has been standing there a month of two it has got rather dusty and a little brown from being in the sun thats all  i hope it hasnt got any fevers or anything of that sort in it said dick sitting himself down discontentedly between mr sampson and the chaste sally  one of the legs is longer than the others  then we get a bit of timber in sir retorted brass  ha ha ha we get a bit of timber in sir and thats another advantage of my sisters going to market for us  miss brass mr richard is the  will you keep quiet interrupted the fair subject of these remarks looking up from her papers  how am i to work if you keep on chattering  what an uncertain chap you are returned the lawyer  sometimes youre all for a chat  at another time youre all for work  a man never knows what humour hell find you in  im in a working humour now said sally so dont disturb me if you please  and dont take him miss sally pointed with the feather of her pen to richard off his business  he wont do more than he can help i dare say  mr brass had evidently a strong inclination to make an angry reply but was deterred by prudent or timid considerations as he only muttered something about aggravation and a vagabond not associating the terms with any individual but mentioning them as connected with some abstract ideas which happened to occur to him  they went on writing for a long time in silence after thisin such a dull silence that mr swiveller who required excitement had several times fallen asleep and written divers strange words in an unknown character with his eyes shut when miss sally at length broke in upon the monotony of the office by pulling out the little tin box taking a noisy pinch of snuff and then expressing her opinion that mr richard swiveller had done it  done what maam said richard  do you know returned miss brass that the lodger isnt up yet that nothing has been seen or heard of him since he went to bed yesterday afternoon  well maam said dick i suppose he may sleep his ten pound out in peace and quietness if he likes  ah  i begin to think hell never wake observed miss sally  its a very remarkable circumstance said brass laying down his pen really very remarkable  mr richard youll remember if this gentleman should be found to have hung himself to the bedpost or any unpleasant accident of that kind should happenyoull remember mr richard that this ten pound note was given to you in part payment of two years rent  youll bear that in mind mr richard you had better make a note of it sir in case you should ever be called upon to give evidence  mr swiveller took a large sheet of foolscap and with a countenance of profound gravity began to make a very small note in one corner  we can never be too cautious said mr brass  there is a deal of wickedness going about the world a deal of wickedness  did the gentleman happen to say sirbut never mind that at present sir finish that little memorandum first  dick did so and handed it to mr brass who had dismounted from his stool and was walking up and down the office  oh this is the memorandum is it said brass running his eye over the document  very good  now mr richard did the gentleman say anything else  no  are you sure mr richard said brass solemnly that the gentleman said nothing else  devil a word sir replied dick  think again sir said brass its my duty sir in the position in which i stand and as an honourable member of the legal professionthe first profession in this country sir or in any other country or in any of the planets that shine above us at night and are supposed to be inhabitedits my duty sir as an honourable member of that profession not to put to you a leading question in a matter of this delicacy and importance  did the gentleman sir who took the first floor of you yesterday afternoon and who brought with him a box of propertya box of propertysay anything more than is set down in this memorandum  come dont be a fool said miss sally  dick looked at her and then at brass and then at miss sally again and still said no  pooh pooh  deuce take it mr richard how dull you are cried brass relaxing into a smile  did he say anything about his propertythere  thats the way to put it said miss sally nodding to her brother  did he say for instance added brass in a kind of comfortable cozy tonei dont assert that he did say so mind i only ask you to refresh your memorydid he say for instance that he was a stranger in londonthat it was not his humour or within his ability to give any referencesthat he felt we had a right to require themand that in case anything should happen to him at any time he particularly desired that whatever property he had upon the premises should be considered mine as some slight recompense for the trouble and annoyance i should sustainand were you in short added brass still more comfortably and cozily than before were you induced to accept him on my behalf as a tenant upon those conditions  certainly not replied dick  why then mr richard said brass darting at him a supercilious and reproachful look its my opinion that youve mistaken your calling and will never make a lawyer  not if you live a thousand years added miss sally  whereupon the brother and sister took each a noisy pinch of snuff from the little tin box and fell into a gloomy thoughtfulness  nothing further passed up to mr swivellers dinnertime which was at three oclock and seemed about three weeks in coming  at the first stroke of the hour the new clerk disappeared  at the last stroke of five he reappeared and the office as if by magic became fragrant with the smell of gin and water and lemonpeel  mr richard said brass this mans not up yet  nothing will wake him sir  whats to be done  i should let him have his sleep out returned dick  sleep out cried brass why he has been asleep now sixandtwenty hours  we have been moving chests of drawers over his head we have knocked double knocks at the streetdoor we have made the servantgirl fall down stairs several times shes a light weight and it dont hurt her much but nothing wakes him  perhaps a ladder suggested dick and getting in at the firstfloor window  but then theres a door between besides the neighbours would be up in arms said brass  what do you say to getting on the roof of the house through the trapdoor and dropping down the chimney suggested dick  that would be an excellent plan said brass if anybody would be and here he looked very hard at mr swivellerwould be kind and friendly and generous enough to undertake it  i dare say it would not be anything like as disagreeable as one supposes  dick had made the suggestion thinking that the duty might possibly fall within miss sallys department  as he said nothing further and declined taking the hint mr brass was fain to propose that they should go up stairs together and make a last effort to awaken the sleeper by some less violent means which if they failed on this last trial must positively be succeeded by stronger measures  mr swiveller assenting armed himself with his stool and the large ruler and repaired with his employer to the scene of action where miss brass was already ringing a handbell with all her might and yet without producing the smallest effect upon their mysterious lodger  there are his boots mr richard said brass  very obstinatelooking articles they are too quoth richard swiveller  and truly they were as sturdy and bluff a pair of boots as one would wish to see as firmly planted on the ground as if their owners legs and feet had been in them and seeming with their broad soles and blunt toes to hold possession of their place by main force  i cant see anything but the curtain of the bed said brass applying his eye to the keyhole of the door  is he a strong man mr richard  very answered dick  it would be an extremely unpleasant circumstance if he was to bounce out suddenly said brass  keep the stairs clear  i should be more than a match for him of course but im the master of the house and the laws of hospitality must be respectedhallo there  hallo hallo  while mr brass with his eye curiously twisted into the keyhole uttered these sounds as a means of attracting the lodgers attention and while miss brass plied the handbell mr swiveller put his stool close against the wall by the side of the door and mounting on the top and standing bolt upright so that if the lodger did make a rush he would most probably pass him in its onward fury began a violent battery with the ruler upon the upper panels of the door  captivated with his own ingenuity and confident in the strength of his position which he had taken up after the method of those hardy individuals who open the pit and gallery doors of theatres on crowded nights mr swiveller rained down such a shower of blows that the noise of the bell was drowned and the small servant who lingered on the stairs below ready to fly at a moments notice was obliged to hold her ears lest she should be rendered deaf for life  suddenly the door was unlocked on the inside and flung violently open the small servant flew to the coalcellar miss sally dived into her own bedroom mr brass who was not remarkable for personal courage ran into the next street and finding that nobody followed him armed with a poker or other offensive weapon put his hands in his pockets walked very slowly all at once and whistled  meanwhile mr swiveller on the top of the stool drew himself into as flat a shape as possible against the wall and looked not unconcernedly down upon the single gentleman who appeared at the door growling and cursing in a very awful manner and with the boots in his hand seemed to have an intention of hurling them down stairs on speculation  this idea however he abandoned  he was turning into his room again still growling vengefully when his eyes met those of the watchful richard  have you been making that horrible noise said the single gentleman  i have been helping sir returned dick keeping his eye upon him and waving the ruler gently in his right hand as an indication of what the single gentleman had to expect if he attempted any violence  how dare you then said the lodger eh  to this dick made no other reply than by inquiring whether the lodger held it to be consistent with the conduct and character of a gentleman to go to sleep for sixandtwenty hours at a stretch and whether the peace of an amiable and virtuous family was to weigh as nothing in the balance  is my peace nothing said the single gentleman  is their peace nothing sir returned dick  i dont wish to hold out any threats sirindeed the law does not allow of threats for to threaten is an indictable offencebut if ever you do that again take care youre not sat upon by the coroner and buried in a cross road before you wake  we have been distracted with fears that you were dead sir said dick gently sliding to the ground and the short and the long of it is that we cannot allow single gentlemen to come into this establishment and sleep like double gentlemen without paying extra for it  indeed cried the lodger  yes sir indeed returned dick yielding to his destiny and saying whatever came uppermost an equal quantity of slumber was never got out of one bed and bedstead and if youre going to sleep in that way you must pay for a doublebedded room  instead of being thrown into a greater passion by these remarks the lodger lapsed into a broad grin and looked at mr swiveller with twinkling eyes  he was a brownfaced sunburnt man and appeared browner and more sunburnt from having a white nightcap on  as it was clear that he was a choleric fellow in some respects mr swiveller was relieved to find him in such good humour and to encourage him in it smiled himself  the lodger in the testiness of being so rudely roused had pushed his nightcap very much on one side of his bald head  this gave him a rakish eccentric air which now that he had leisure to observe it charmed mr swiveller exceedingly therefore by way of propitiation he expressed his hope that the gentleman was going to get up and further that he would never do so any more  come here you impudent rascal was the lodgers answer as he reentered his room  mr swiveller followed him in leaving the stool outside but reserving the ruler in case of a surprise  he rather congratulated himself on his prudence when the single gentleman without notice or explanation of any kind doublelocked the door  can you drink anything was his next inquiry  mr swiveller replied that he had very recently been assuaging the pangs of thirst but that he was still open to a modest quencher if the materials were at hand  without another word spoken on either side the lodger took from his great trunk a kind of temple shining as of polished silver and placed it carefully on the table  greatly interested in his proceedings mr swiveller observed him closely  into one little chamber of this temple he dropped an egg into another some coffee into a third a compact piece of raw steak from a neat tin case into a fourth he poured some water  then with the aid of a phosphorusbox and some matches he procured a light and applied it to a spiritlamp which had a place of its own below the temple then he shut down the lids of all the little chambers then he opened them and then by some wonderful and unseen agency the steak was done the egg was boiled the coffee was accurately prepared and his breakfast was ready  hot water said the lodger handing it to mr swiveller with as much coolness as if he had a kitchen fire before himextraordinary rumsugarand a travelling glass  mix for yourself  and make haste  dick complied his eyes wandering all the time from the temple on the table which seemed to do everything to the great trunk which seemed to hold everything  the lodger took his breakfast like a man who was used to work these miracles and thought nothing of them  the man of the house is a lawyer is he not said the lodger  dick nodded  the rum was amazing  the woman of the housewhats she  a dragon said dick  the single gentleman perhaps because he had met with such things in his travels or perhaps because he was a single gentleman evinced no surprise but merely inquired wife or sistersister said dickso much the better said the single gentleman he can get rid of her when he likes  i want to do as i like young man he added after a short silence to go to bed when i like get up when i like come in when i like go out when i liketo be asked no questions and be surrounded by no spies  in this last respect servants are the devil  theres only one here  and a very little one said dick  and a very little one repeated the lodger  well the place will suit me will it  yes said dick  sharks i suppose said the lodger  dick nodded assent and drained his glass  let them know my humour said the single gentleman rising  if they disturb me they lose a good tenant  if they know me to be that they know enough  if they try to know more its a notice to quit  its better to understand these things at once  good day  i beg your pardon said dick halting in his passage to the door which the lodger prepared to open  when he who adores thee has left but the name  what do you mean  but the name said dickhas left but the namein case of letters or parcels  i never have any returned the lodger  or in the case anybody should call  nobody ever calls on me  if any mistake should arise from not having the name dont say it was my fault sir added dick still lingeringoh blame not the bard  ill blame nobody said the lodger with such irascibility that in a moment dick found himself on the staircase and the locked door between them  mr brass and miss sally were lurking hard by having been indeed only routed from the keyhole by mr swivellers abrupt exit  as their utmost exertions had not enabled them to overhear a word of the interview however in consequence of a quarrel for precedence which though limited of necessity to pushes and pinches and such quiet pantomime had lasted the whole time they hurried him down to the office to hear his account of the conversation  this mr swiveller gave themfaithfully as regarded the wishes and character of the single gentleman and poetically as concerned the great trunk of which he gave a description more remarkable for brilliancy of imagination than a strict adherence to truth declaring with many strong asseverations that it contained a specimen of every kind of rich food and wine known in these times and in particular that it was of a selfacting kind and served up whatever was required as he supposed by clockwork he also gave them to understand that the cooking apparatus roasted a fine piece of sirloin of beef weighing about six pounds avoirdupoise in two minutes and a quarter as he had himself witnessed and proved by his sense of taste and further that however the effect was produced he had distinctly seen water boil and bubble up when the single gentleman winked from which facts he mr swiveller was led to infer that the lodger was some great conjuror or chemist or both whose residence under that roof could not fail at some future days to shed a great credit and distinction on the name of brass and add a new interest to the history of bevis marks  there was one point which mr swiveller deemed it unnecessary to enlarge upon and that was the fact of the modest quencher which by reason of its intrinsic strength and its coming close upon the heels of the temperate beverage he had discussed at dinner awakened a slight degree of fever and rendered necessary two or three other modest quenchers at the publichouse in the course of the evening     chapter 36  as the single gentleman after some weeks occupation of his lodgings still declined to correspond by word or gesture either with mr brass or his sister sally but invariably chose richard swiveller as his channel of communication and as he proved himself in all respects a highly desirable inmate paying for everything beforehand giving very little trouble making no noise and keeping early hours mr richard imperceptibly rose to an important position in the family as one who had influence over this mysterious lodger and could negotiate with him for good or evil when nobody else durst approach his person  if the truth must be told even mr swivellers approaches to the single gentleman were of a very distant kind and met with small encouragement but as he never returned from a monosyllabic conference with the unknown without quoting such expressions as swiveller i know i can rely upon youi have no hesitation in saying swiveller that i entertain a regard for youswiveller you are my friend and will stand by me i am sure with many other short speeches of the same familiar and confiding kind purporting to have been addressed by the single gentleman to himself and to form the staple of their ordinary discourse neither mr brass nor miss sally for a moment questioned the extent of his influence but accorded to him their fullest and most unqualified belief  but quite apart from and independent of this source of popularity mr swiveller had another which promised to be equally enduring and to lighten his position considerably  he found favour in the eyes of miss sally brass  let not the light scorners of female fascination erect their ears to listen to a new tale of love which shall serve them for a jest for miss brass however accurately formed to be beloved was not of the loving kind  that amiable virgin having clung to the skirts of the law from her earliest youth having sustained herself by their aid as it were in her first running alone and maintained a firm grasp upon them ever since had passed her life in a kind of legal childhood  she had been remarkable when a tender prattler for an uncommon talent in counterfeiting the walk and manner of a bailiff in which character she had learned to tap her little playfellows on the shoulder and to carry them off to imaginary sponginghouses with a correctness of imitation which was the surprise and delight of all who witnessed her performances and which was only to be exceeded by her exquisite manner of putting an execution into her dolls house and taking an exact inventory of the chairs and tables  these artless sports had naturally soothed and cheered the decline of her widowed father a most exemplary gentleman called old foxey by his friends from his extreme sagacity who encouraged them to the utmost and whose chief regret on finding that he drew near to houndsditch churchyard was that his daughter could not take out an attorneys certificate and hold a place upon the roll filled with this affectionate and touching sorrow he had solemnly confided her to his son sampson as an invaluable auxiliary and from the old gentlemans decease to the period of which we treat miss sally brass had been the prop and pillar of his business  it is obvious that having devoted herself from infancy to this one pursuit and study miss brass could know but little of the world otherwise than in connection with the law and that from a lady gifted with such high tastes proficiency in those gentler and softer arts in which women usually excel was scarcely to be looked for  miss sallys accomplishments were all of a masculine and strictly legal kind  they began with the practice of an attorney and they ended with it  she was in a state of lawful innocence so to speak  the law had been her nurse  and as bandylegs or such physical deformities in children are held to be the consequence of bad nursing so if in a mind so beautiful any moral twist or handiness could be found miss sally brasss nurse was alone to blame  it was on this lady then that mr swiveller burst in full freshness as something new and hitherto undreamed of lighting up the office with scraps of song and merriment conjuring with inkstands and boxes of wafers catching three oranges in one hand balancing stools upon his chin and penknives on his nose and constantly performing a hundred other feats with equal ingenuity for with such unbendings did richard in mr brasss absence relieve the tedium of his confinement  these social qualities which miss sally first discovered by accident gradually made such an impression upon her that she would entreat mr swiveller to relax as though she were not by which mr swiveller nothing loth would readily consent to do  by these means a friendship sprung up between them  mr swiveller gradually came to look upon her as her brother sampson did and as he would have looked upon any other clerk  he imparted to her the mystery of going the odd man or plain newmarket for fruit gingerbeer baked potatoes or even a modest quencher of which miss brass did not scruple to partake  he would often persuade her to undertake his share of writing in addition to her own nay he would sometimes reward her with a hearty slap on the back and protest that she was a devilish good fellow a jolly dog and so forth all of which compliments miss sally would receive in entire good part and with perfect satisfaction  one circumstance troubled mr swivellers mind very much and that was that the small servant always remained somewhere in the bowels of the earth under bevis marks and never came to the surface unless the single gentleman rang his bell when she would answer it and immediately disappear again  she never went out or came into the office or had a clean face or took off the coarse apron or looked out of any one of the windows or stood at the streetdoor for a breath of air or had any rest or enjoyment whatever  nobody ever came to see her nobody spoke of her nobody cared about her  mr brass had said once that he believed she was a lovechild which means anything but a child of love and that was all the information richard swiveller could obtain  its of no use asking the dragon thought dick one day as he sat contemplating the features of miss sally brass  i suspect if i asked any questions on that head our alliance would be at an end  i wonder whether she is a dragon bythebye or something in the mermaid way she has rather a scaly appearance  but mermaids are fond of looking at themselves in the glass which she cant be  and they have a habit of combing their hair which she hasnt  no shes a dragon  where are you going old fellow said dick aloud as miss sally wiped her pen as usual on the green dress and uprose from her seat  to dinner answered the dragon  to dinner thought dick thats another circumstance  i dont believe that small servant ever has anything to eat  sammy wont be home said miss brass  stop till i come back  i shant be long  dick nodded and followed miss brasswith his eyes to the door and with his ears to a little back parlour where she and her brother took their meals  now said dick walking up and down with his hands in his pockets id give somethingif i had itto know how they use that child and where they keep her  my mother must have been a very inquisitive woman i have no doubt im marked with a note of interrogation somewhere  my feelings i smother but thou hast been the cause of this anguish myupon my word said mr swiveller checking himself and falling thoughtfully into the clients chair i should like to know how they use her  after running on in this way for some time mr swiveller softly opened the office door with the intention of darting across the street for a glass of the mild porter  at that moment he caught a parting glimpse of the brown headdress of miss brass flitting down the kitchen stairs  and by jove thought dick shes going to feed the small servant  now or never  first peeping over the handrail and allowing the headdress to disappear in the darkness below he groped his way down and arrived at the door of a back kitchen immediately after miss brass had entered the same bearing in her hand a cold leg of mutton  it was a very dark miserable place very low and very damp the walls disfigured by a thousand rents and blotches  the water was trickling out of a leaky butt and a most wretched cat was lapping up the drops with the sickly eagerness of starvation  the grate which was a wide one was wound and screwed up tight so as to hold no more than a little thin sandwich of fire  everything was locked up the coalcellar the candlebox the saltbox the meatsafe were all padlocked  there was nothing that a beetle could have lunched upon  the pinched and meagre aspect of the place would have killed a chameleon  he would have known at the first mouthful that the air was not eatable and must have given up the ghost in despair  the small servant stood with humility in presence of miss sally and hung her head  are you there said miss sally  yes maam was the answer in a weak voice  go further away from the leg of mutton or youll be picking it i know said miss sally  the girl withdrew into a corner while miss brass took a key from her pocket and opening the safe brought from it a dreary waste of cold potatoes looking as eatable as stonehenge  this she placed before the small servant ordering her to sit down before it and then taking up a great carvingknife made a mighty show of sharpening it upon the carvingfork  do you see this said miss brass slicing off about two square inches of cold mutton after all this preparation and holding it out on the point of the fork  the small servant looked hard enough at it with her hungry eyes to see every shred of it small as it was and answered yes  then dont you ever go and say retorted miss sally that you hadnt meat here  there eat it up  this was soon done  now do you want any more said miss sally  the hungry creature answered with a faint no  they were evidently going through an established form  youve been helped once to meat said miss brass summing up the facts you have had as much as you can eat youre asked if you want any more and you answer no then dont you ever go and say you were allowanced mind that  with those words miss sally put the meat away and locked the safe and then drawing near to the small servant overlooked her while she finished the potatoes  it was plain that some extraordinary grudge was working in miss brasss gentle breast and that it was that which impelled her without the smallest present cause to rap the child with the blade of the knife now on her hand now on her head and now on her back as if she found it quite impossible to stand so close to her without administering a few slight knocks  but mr swiveller was not a little surprised to see his fellowclerk after walking slowly backwards towards the door as if she were trying to withdraw herself from the room but could not accomplish it dart suddenly forward and falling on the small servant give her some hard blows with her clenched hand  the victim cried but in a subdued manner as if she feared to raise her voice and miss sally comforting herself with a pinch of snuff ascended the stairs just as richard had safely reached the office     chapter 37  the single gentleman among his other peculiaritiesand he had a very plentiful stock of which he every day furnished some new specimentook a most extraordinary and remarkable interest in the exhibition of punch  if the sound of a punchs voice at ever so remote a distance reached bevis marks the single gentleman though in bed and asleep would start up and hurrying on his clothes make for the spot with all speed and presently return at the head of a long procession of idlers having in the midst the theatre and its proprietors  straightway the stage would be set up in front of mr brasss house the single gentleman would establish himself at the first floor window and the entertainment would proceed with all its exciting accompaniments of fife and drum and shout to the excessive consternation of all sober votaries of business in that silent thoroughfare  it might have been expected that when the play was done both players and audience would have dispersed but the epilogue was as bad as the play for no sooner was the devil dead than the manager of the puppets and his partner were summoned by the single gentleman to his chamber where they were regaled with strong waters from his private store and where they held with him long conversations the purport of which no human being could fathom  but the secret of these discussions was of little importance  it was sufficient to know that while they were proceeding the concourse without still lingered round the house that boys beat upon the drum with their fists and imitated punch with their tender voices that the officewindow was rendered opaque by flattened noses and the keyhole of the streetdoor luminous with eyes that every time the single gentleman or either of his guests was seen at the upper window or so much as the end of one of their noses was visible there was a great shout of execration from the excluded mob who remained howling and yelling and refusing consolation until the exhibitors were delivered up to them to be attended elsewhere  it was sufficient in short to know that bevis marks was revolutionised by these popular movements and that peace and quietness fled from its precincts  nobody was rendered more indignant by these proceedings than mr sampson brass who as he could by no means afford to lose so profitable an inmate deemed it prudent to pocket his lodgers affront along with his cash and to annoy the audiences who clustered round his door by such imperfect means of retaliation as were open to him and which were confined to the trickling down of foul water on their heads from unseen watering pots pelting them with fragments of tile and mortar from the roof of the house and bribing the drivers of hackney cabriolets to come suddenly round the corner and dash in among them precipitately it may at first sight be matter of surprise to the thoughtless few that mr brass being a professional gentleman should not have legally indicted some party or parties active in the promotion of the nuisance but they will be good enough to remember that as doctors seldom take their own prescriptions and divines do not always practise what they preach so lawyers are shy of meddling with the law on their own account knowing it to be an edged tool of uncertain application very expensive in the working and rather remarkable for its properties of close shaving than for its always shaving the right person  come said mr brass one afternoon this is two days without a punch im in hopes he has run through em all at last  why are you in hopes returned miss sally  what harm do they do  heres a pretty sort of a fellow cried brass laying down his pen in despair  now heres an aggravating animal  well what harm do they do retorted sally  what harm cried brass  is it no harm to have a constant hallooing and hooting under ones very nose distracting one from business and making one grind ones teeth with vexation  is it no harm to be blinded and choked up and have the kings highway stopped with a set of screamers and roarers whose throats must be made ofof  brass suggested mr swiveller  ah of brass said the lawyer glancing at his clerk to assure himself that he had suggested the word in good faith and without any sinister intention  is that no harm  the lawyer stopped short in his invective and listening for a moment and recognising the wellknown voice rested his head upon his hand raised his eyes to the ceiling and muttered faintly  theres another  up went the single gentlemans window directly  theres another repeated brass and if i could get a break and four blood horses to cut into the marks when the crowd is at its thickest id give eighteenpence and never grudge it  the distant squeak was heard again  the single gentlemans door burst open  he ran violently down the stairs out into the street and so past the window without any hat towards the quarter whence the sound proceededbent no doubt upon securing the strangers services directly  i wish i only knew who his friends were muttered sampson filling his pocket with papers if theyd just get up a pretty little commission de lunatico at the grays inn coffee house and give me the job id be content to have the lodgings empty for one while at all events  with which words and knocking his hat over his eyes as if for the purpose of shutting out even a glimpse of the dreadful visitation mr brass rushed from the house and hurried away  as mr swiveller was decidedly favourable to these performances upon the ground that looking at a punch or indeed looking at anything out of window was better than working and as he had been for this reason at some pains to awaken in his fellow clerk a sense of their beauties and manifold deserts both he and miss sally rose as with one accord and took up their positions at the window upon the sill whereof as in a post of honour sundry young ladies and gentlemen who were employed in the dry nurture of babies and who made a point of being present with their young charges on such occasions had already established themselves as comfortably as the circumstances would allow  the glass being dim mr swiveller agreeably to a friendly custom which he had established between them hitched off the brown headdress from miss sallys head and dusted it carefully therewith  by the time he had handed it back and its beautiful wearer had put it on again which she did with perfect composure and indifference the lodger returned with the show and showmen at his heels and a strong addition to the body of spectators  the exhibitor disappeared with all speed behind the drapery and his partner stationing himself by the side of the theatre surveyed the audience with a remarkable expression of melancholy which became more remarkable still when he breathed a hornpipe tune into that sweet musical instrument which is popularly termed a mouthorgan without at all changing the mournful expression of the upper part of his face though his mouth and chin were of necessity in lively spasms  the drama proceeded to its close and held the spectators enchained in the customary manner  the sensation which kindles in large assemblies when they are relieved from a state of breathless suspense and are again free to speak and move was yet rife when the lodger as usual summoned the men up stairs  both of you he called from the window for only the actual exhibitora little fat manprepared to obey the summons  i want to talk to you  come both of you  come tommy said the little man  i ant a talker replied the other  tell him so  what should i go and talk for  dont you see the gentlemans got a bottle and glass up there returned the little man  and couldnt you have said so at first retorted the other with sudden alacrity  now what are you waiting for  are you going to keep the gentleman expecting us all day  havent you no manners  with this remonstrance the melancholy man who was no other than mr thomas codlin pushed past his friend and brother in the craft mr harris otherwise short or trotters and hurried before him to the single gentlemans apartment  now my men said the single gentleman you have done very well what will you take  tell that little man behind to shut the door  shut the door cant you said mr codlin turning gruffly to his friend  you might have knowed that the gentleman wanted the door shut without being told i think  mr short obeyed observing under his breath that his friend seemed unusually cranky and expressing a hope that there was no dairy in the neighbourhood or his temper would certainly spoil its contents  the gentleman pointed to a couple of chairs and intimated by an emphatic nod of his head that he expected them to be seated  messrs codlin and short after looking at each other with considerable doubt and indecision at length sat downeach on the extreme edge of the chair pointed out to himand held their hats very tight while the single gentleman filled a couple of glasses from a bottle on the table beside him and presented them in due form  youre pretty well browned by the sun both of you said their entertainer  have you been travelling  mr short replied in the affirmative with a nod and a smile  mr codlin added a corroborative nod and a short groan as if he still felt the weight of the temple on his shoulders  to fairs markets races and so forth i suppose pursued the single gentleman  yes sir returned short pretty nigh all over the west of england  i have talked to men of your craft from north east and south returned their host in rather a hasty manner but i never lighted on any from the west before  its our reglar summer circuit is the west master said short thats where it is  we takes the east of london in the spring and winter and the west of england in the summer time  manys the hard days walking in rain and mud and with never a penny earned weve had down in the west  let me fill your glass again  much obleeged to you sir i think i will said mr codlin suddenly thrusting in his own and turning shorts aside  im the sufferer sir in all the travelling and in all the staying at home  in town or country wet or dry hot or cold tom codlin suffers  but tom codlin isnt to complain for all that  oh no  short may complain but if codlin grumbles by so much as a wordoh dear down with him down with him directly  it isnt his place to grumble  thats quite out of the question  codlin ant without his usefulness observed short with an arch look but he dont always keep his eyes open  he falls asleep sometimes you know  remember them last races tommy  will you never leave off aggravating a man said codlin  its very like i was asleep when fiveandtenpence was collected in one round isnt it  i was attending to my business and couldnt have my eyes in twenty places at once like a peacock no more than you could  if i ant a match for an old man and a young child you ant neither so dont throw that out against me for the cap fits your head quite as correct as it fits mine  you may as well drop the subject tom said short  it isnt particular agreeable to the gentleman i dare say  then you shouldnt have brought it up returned mr codlin and i ask the gentlemans pardon on your account as a giddy chap that likes to hear himself talk and dont much care what he talks about so that he does talk  their entertainer had sat perfectly quiet in the beginning of this dispute looking first at one man and then at the other as if he were lying in wait for an opportunity of putting some further question or reverting to that from which the discourse had strayed  but from the point where mr codlin was charged with sleepiness he had shown an increasing interest in the discussion which now attained a very high pitch  you are the two men i want he said the two men i have been looking for and searching after  where are that old man and that child you speak of  sir said short hesitating and looking towards his friend  the old man and his grandchild who travelled with youwhere are they it will be worth your while to speak out i assure you much better worth your while than you believe  they left you you sayat those races as i understand  they have been traced to that place and there lost sight of  have you no clue can you suggest no clue to their recovery  did i always say thomas cried short turning with a look of amazement to his friend that there was sure to be an inquiry after them two travellers  you said returned mr codlin  did i always say that that ere blessed child was the most interesting i ever see  did i always say i loved her and doated on her  pretty creetur i think i hear her now codlins my friend she says with a tear of gratitude a trickling down her little eye codlins my friend she saysnot short shorts very well she says ive no quarrel with short he means kind i dare say but codlin she says has the feelings for my money though he maynt look it  repeating these words with great emotion mr codlin rubbed the bridge of his nose with his coatsleeve and shaking his head mournfully from side to side left the single gentleman to infer that from the moment when he lost sight of his dear young charge his peace of mind and happiness had fled  good heaven said the single gentleman pacing up and down the room have i found these men at last only to discover that they can give me no information or assistance  it would have been better to have lived on in hope from day to day and never to have lighted on them than to have my expectations scattered thus  stay a minute said short  a man of the name of jerryyou know jerry thomas  oh dont talk to me of jerrys replied mr codlin  how can i care a pinch of snuff for jerrys when i think of that ere darling child codlins my friend she says dear good kind codlin as is always a devising pleasures for me  i dont object to short she says but i cotton to codlin once said that gentleman reflectively she called me father codlin  i thought i should have bust  a man of the name of jerry sir said short turning from his selfish colleague to their new acquaintance wot keeps a company of dancing dogs told me in a accidental sort of way that he had seen the old gentleman in connexion with a travelling waxwork unbeknown to him as theyd given us the slip and nothing had come of it and this was down in the country that hed been seen i took no measures about it and asked no questionsbut i can if you like  is this man in town said the impatient single gentleman  speak faster  no he isnt but he will be tomorrow for he lodges in our house replied mr short rapidly  then bring him here said the single gentleman  heres a sovereign apiece  if i can find these people through your means it is but a prelude to twenty more  return to me tomorrow and keep your own counsel on this subjectthough i need hardly tell you that for youll do so for your own sakes  now give me your address and leave me  the address was given the two men departed the crowd went with them and the single gentleman for two mortal hours walked in uncommon agitation up and down his room over the wondering heads of mr swiveller and miss sally brass     chapter 38  kitfor it happens at this juncture not only that we have breathing time to follow his fortunes but that the necessities of these adventures so adapt themselves to our ease and inclination as to call upon us imperatively to pursue the track we most desire to takekit while the matters treated of in the last fifteen chapters were yet in progress was as the reader may suppose gradually familiarising himself more and more with mr and mrs garland mr abel the pony and barbara and gradually coming to consider them one and all as his particular private friends and abel cottage finchley as his own proper home  staythe words are written and may go but if they convey any notion that kit in the plentiful board and comfortable lodging of his new abode began to think slightingly of the poor fare and furniture of his old dwelling they do their office badly and commit injustice  who so mindful of those he left at homealbeit they were but a mother and two young babiesas kit  what boastful father in the fulness of his heart ever related such wonders of his infant prodigy as kit never wearied of telling barbara in the evening time concerning little jacob  was there ever such a mother as kits mother on her sons showing or was there ever such comfort in poverty as in the poverty of kits family if any correct judgment might be arrived at from his own glowing account  and let me linger in this place for an instant to remark that if ever household affections and loves are graceful things they are graceful in the poor  the ties that bind the wealthy and the proud to home may be forged on earth but those which link the poor man to his humble hearth are of the truer metal and bear the stamp of heaven  the man of high descent may love the halls and lands of his inheritance as part of himself as trophies of his birth and power his associations with them are associations of pride and wealth and triumph the poor mans attachment to the tenements he holds which strangers have held before and may tomorrow occupy again has a worthier root struck deep into a purer soil  his household gods are of flesh and blood with no alloy of silver gold or precious stone he has no property but in the affections of his own heart and when they endear bare floors and walls despite of rags and toil and scanty fare that man has his love of home from god and his rude hut becomes a solemn place  oh if those who rule the destinies of nations would but remember thisif they would but think how hard it is for the very poor to have engendered in their hearts that love of home from which all domestic virtues spring when they live in dense and squalid masses where social decency is lost or rather never foundif they would but turn aside from the wide thoroughfares and great houses and strive to improve the wretched dwellings in byeways where only poverty may walkmany low roofs would point more truly to the sky than the loftiest steeple that now rears proudly up from the midst of guilt and crime and horrible disease to mock them by its contrast  in hollow voices from workhouse hospital and jail this truth is preached from day to day and has been proclaimed for years  it is no light matterno outcry from the working vulgarno mere question of the peoples health and comforts that may be whistled down on wednesday nights  in love of home the love of country has its rise and who are the truer patriots or the better in time of needthose who venerate the land owning its wood and stream and earth and all that they produce  or those who love their country boasting not a foot of ground in all its wide domain  kit knew nothing about such questions but he knew that his old home was a very poor place and that his new one was very unlike it and yet he was constantly looking back with grateful satisfaction and affectionate anxiety and often indited squarefolded letters to his mother enclosing a shilling or eighteenpence or such other small remittance which mr abels liberality enabled him to make  sometimes being in the neighbourhood he had leisure to call upon her and then great was the joy and pride of kits mother and extremely noisy the satisfaction of little jacob and the baby and cordial the congratulations of the whole court who listened with admiring ears to the accounts of abel cottage and could never be told too much of its wonders and magnificence  although kit was in the very highest favour with the old lady and gentleman and mr abel and barbara it is certain that no member of the family evinced such a remarkable partiality for him as the selfwilled pony who from being the most obstinate and opinionated pony on the face of the earth was in his hands the meekest and most tractable of animals  it is true that in exact proportion as he became manageable by kit he became utterly ungovernable by anybody else as if he had determined to keep him in the family at all risks and hazards and that even under the guidance of his favourite he would sometimes perform a great variety of strange freaks and capers to the extreme discomposure of the old ladys nerves but as kit always represented that this was only his fun or a way he had of showing his attachment to his employers mrs garland gradually suffered herself to be persuaded into the belief in which she at last became so strongly confirmed that if in one of these ebullitions he had overturned the chaise she would have been quite satisfied that he did it with the very best intentions  besides becoming in a short time a perfect marvel in all stable matters kit soon made himself a very tolerable gardener a handy fellow within doors and an indispensable attendant on mr abel who every day gave him some new proof of his confidence and approbation mr witherden the notary too regarded him with a friendly eye and even mr chuckster would sometimes condescend to give him a slight nod or to honour him with that peculiar form of recognition which is called taking a sight or to favour him with some other salute combining pleasantry with patronage  one morning kit drove mr abel to the notarys office as he sometimes did and having set him down at the house was about to drive off to a livery stable hard by when this same mr chuckster emerged from the office door and cried woaaaaaadwelling upon the note a long time for the purpose of striking terror into the ponys heart and asserting the supremacy of man over the inferior animals  pull up snobby cried mr chuckster addressing himself to kit youre wanted inside here  has mr abel forgotten anything i wonder said kit as he dismounted  ask no questions snobby returned mr chuckster but go and see woaaa then will you  if that pony was mine id break him  you must be very gentle with him if you please said kit or youll find him troublesome  youd better not keep on pulling his ears please  i know he wont like it  to this remonstrance mr chuckster deigned no other answer than addressing kit with a lofty and distant air as young feller and requesting him to cut and come again with all speed  the young feller complying mr chuckster put his hands in his pockets and tried to look as if he were not minding the pony but happened to be lounging there by accident  kit scraped his shoes very carefully for he had not yet lost his reverence for the bundles of papers and the tin boxes and tapped at the officedoor which was quickly opened by the notary himself  oh come in christopher said mr witherden  is that the lad asked an elderly gentleman but of a stout bluff figurewho was in the room  thats the lad said mr witherden  he fell in with my client mr garland sir at this very door  i have reason to think he is a good lad sir and that you may believe what he says  let me introduce mr abel garland sirhis young master my articled pupil sir and most particular friendmy most particular friend sir repeated the notary drawing out his silk handkerchief and flourishing it about his face  your servant sir said the stranger gentleman  yours sir im sure replied mr abel mildly  you were wishing to speak to christopher sir  yes i was  have i your permission  by all means  my business is no secret or i should rather say it need be no secret here said the stranger observing that mr abel and the notary were preparing to retire  it relates to a dealer in curiosities with whom he lived and in whom i am earnestly and warmly interested  i have been a stranger to this country gentlemen for very many years and if i am deficient in form and ceremony i hope you will forgive me  no forgiveness is necessary sirnone whatever replied the notary and so said mr abel  i have been making inquiries in the neighbourhood in which his old master lived said the stranger and i learn that he was served by this lad  i have found out his mothers house and have been directed by her to this place as the nearest in which i should be likely to find him  thats the cause of my presenting myself here this morning  i am very glad of any cause sir said the notary which procures me the honour of this visit  sir retorted the stranger you speak like a mere man of the world and i think you something better  therefore pray do not sink your real character in paying unmeaning compliments to me  hem coughed the notary  youre a plain speaker sir  and a plain dealer returned the stranger  it may be my long absence and inexperience that lead me to the conclusion but if plain speakers are scarce in this part of the world i fancy plain dealers are still scarcer  if my speaking should offend you sir my dealing i hope will make amends  mr witherden seemed a little disconcerted by the elderly gentlemans mode of conducting the dialogue and as for kit he looked at him in openmouthed astonishment wondering what kind of language he would address to him if he talked in that free and easy way to a notary  it was with no harshness however though with something of constitutional irritability and haste that he turned to kit and said  if you think my lad that i am pursuing these inquiries with any other view than that of serving and reclaiming those i am in search of you do me a very great wrong and deceive yourself  dont be deceived i beg of you but rely upon my assurance  the fact is gentlemen he added turning again to the notary and his pupil that i am in a very painful and wholly unexpected position  i came to this city with a darling object at my heart expecting to find no obstacle or difficulty in the way of its attainment  i find myself suddenly checked and stopped short in the execution of my design by a mystery which i cannot penetrate  every effort i have made to penetrate it has only served to render it darker and more obscure and i am afraid to stir openly in the matter lest those whom i anxiously pursue should fly still farther from me  i assure you that if you could give me any assistance you would not be sorry to do so if you knew how greatly i stand in need of it and what a load it would relieve me from  there was a simplicity in this confidence which occasioned it to find a quick response in the breast of the goodnatured notary who replied in the same spirit that the stranger had not mistaken his desire and that if he could be of service to him he would most readily  kit was then put under examination and closely questioned by the unknown gentleman touching his old master and the child their lonely way of life their retired habits and strict seclusion  the nightly absence of the old man the solitary existence of the child at those times his illness and recovery quilps possession of the house and their sudden disappearance were all the subjects of much questioning and answer  finally kit informed the gentleman that the premises were now to let and that a board upon the door referred all inquirers to mr sampson brass solicitor of bevis marks from whom he might perhaps learn some further particulars  not by inquiry said the gentleman shaking his head  i live there  live at brasss the attorneys cried mr witherden in some surprise having professional knowledge of the gentleman in question  aye was the reply  i entered on his lodgings tother day chiefly because i had seen this very board  it matters little to me where i live and i had a desperate hope that some intelligence might be cast in my way there which would not reach me elsewhere  yes i live at brasssmore shame for me i suppose  thats a mere matter of opinion said the notary shrugging his shoulders  he is looked upon as rather a doubtful character  doubtful echoed the other  i am glad to hear theres any doubt about it  i supposed that had been thoroughly settled long ago  but will you let me speak a word or two with you in private  mr witherden consenting they walked into that gentlemans private closet and remained there in close conversation for some quarter of an hour when they returned into the outer office  the stranger had left his hat in mr witherdens room and seemed to have established himself in this short interval on quite a friendly footing  ill not detain you any longer now he said putting a crown into kits hand and looking towards the notary  you shall hear from me again  not a word of this you know except to your master and mistress  mother sir would be glad to know said kit faltering  glad to know what  anythingso that it was no harmabout miss nell  would she  well then you may tell her if she can keep a secret  but mind not a word of this to anybody else  dont forget that  be particular  ill take care sir said kit  thankee sir and good morning  now it happened that the gentleman in his anxiety to impress upon kit that he was not to tell anybody what had passed between them followed him out to the door to repeat his caution and it further happened that at that moment the eyes of mr richard swiveller were turned in that direction and beheld his mysterious friend and kit together  it was quite an accident and the way in which it came about was this mr chuckster being a gentleman of a cultivated taste and refined spirit was one of that lodge of glorious apollos whereof mr swiveller was perpetual grand  mr swiveller passing through the street in the execution of some brazen errand and beholding one of his glorious brotherhood intently gazing on a pony crossed over to give him that fraternal greeting with which perpetual grands are by the very constitution of their office bound to cheer and encourage their disciples  he had scarcely bestowed upon him his blessing and followed it with a general remark touching the present state and prospects of the weather when lifting up his eyes he beheld the single gentleman of bevis marks in earnest conversation with christopher nubbles  hallo said dick who is that  he called to see my governor this morning replied mr chuckster beyond that i dont know him from adam  at least you know his name said dick  to which mr chuckster replied with an elevation of speech becoming a glorious apollo that he was everlastingly blessed if he did  all i know my dear feller said mr chuckster running his fingers through his hair is that he is the cause of my having stood here twenty minutes for which i hate him with a mortal and undying hatred and would pursue him to the confines of eternity if i could afford the time  while they were thus discoursing the subject of their conversation who had not appeared to recognise mr richard swiveller reentered the house and kit came down the steps and joined them to whom mr swiveller again propounded his inquiry with no better success  he is a very nice gentleman sir said kit and thats all i know about him  mr chuckster waxed wroth at this answer and without applying the remark to any particular case mentioned as a general truth that it was expedient to break the heads of snobs and to tweak their noses without expressing his concurrence in this sentiment mr swiveller after a few moments of abstraction inquired which way kit was driving and being informed declared it was his way and that he would trespass on him for a lift  kit would gladly have declined the proffered honour but as mr swiveller was already established in the seat beside him he had no means of doing so otherwise than by a forcible ejectment and therefore drove briskly offso briskly indeed as to cut short the leavetaking between mr chuckster and his grand master and to occasion the former gentleman some inconvenience from having his corns squeezed by the impatient pony  as whisker was tired of standing and mr swiveller was kind enough to stimulate him by shrill whistles and various sporting cries they rattled off at too sharp a pace to admit of much conversation especially as the pony incensed by mr swivellers admonitions took a particular fancy for the lampposts and cartwheels and evinced a strong desire to run on the pavement and rasp himself against the brick walls  it was not therefore until they had arrived at the stable and the chaise had been extricated from a very small doorway into which the pony dragged it under the impression that he could take it along with him into his usual stall that mr swiveller found time to talk  its hard work said richard  what do you say to some beer  kit at first declined but presently consented and they adjourned to the neighbouring bar together  well drink our friend whatshisname said dick holding up the bright frothy pot that was talking to you this morning you knowi know hima good fellow but eccentricveryheres whatshisname  kit pledged him  he lives in my house said dick at least in the house occupied by the firm in which im a sort of aof a managing partnera difficult fellow to get anything out of but we like himwe like him  i must be going sir if you please said kit moving away  dont be in a hurry christopher replied his patron well drink your mother  thank you sir  an excellent woman that mother of yours christopher said mr swiveller  who ran to catch me when i fell and kissed the place to make it well  my mother  a charming woman  hes a liberal sort of fellow  we must get him to do something for your mother  does he know her christopher  kit shook his head and glancing slyly at his questioner thanked him and made off before he could say another word  humph said mr swiveller pondering this is queer  nothing but mysteries in connection with brasss house  ill keep my own counsel however  everybody and anybody has been in my confidence as yet but now i think ill set up in business for myself  queervery queer  after pondering deeply and with a face of exceeding wisdom for some time mr swiveller drank some more of the beer and summoning a small boy who had been watching his proceedings poured forth the few remaining drops as a libation on the gravel and bade him carry the empty vessel to the bar with his compliments and above all things to lead a sober and temperate life and abstain from all intoxicating and exciting liquors  having given him this piece of moral advice for his trouble which as he wisely observed was far better than halfpence the perpetual grand master of the glorious apollos thrust his hands into his pockets and sauntered away still pondering as he went     chapter 39  all that day though he waited for mr abel until evening kit kept clear of his mothers house determined not to anticipate the pleasures of the morrow but to let them come in their full rush of delight for tomorrow was the great and long lookedfor epoch in his lifetomorrow was the end of his first quarterthe day of receiving for the first time one fourth part of his annual income of six pounds in one vast sum of thirty shillingstomorrow was to be a halfholiday devoted to a whirl of entertainments and little jacob was to know what oysters meant and to see a play  all manner of incidents combined in favour of the occasion not only had mr and mrs garland forewarned him that they intended to make no deduction for his outfit from the great amount but to pay it him unbroken in all its gigantic grandeur not only had the unknown gentleman increased the stock by the sum of five shillings which was a perfect godsend and in itself a fortune not only had these things come to pass which nobody could have calculated upon or in their wildest dreams have hoped but it was barbaras quarter toobarbaras quarter that very dayand barbara had a halfholiday as well as kit and barbaras mother was going to make one of the party and to take tea with kits mother and cultivate her acquaintance  to be sure kit looked out of his window very early that morning to see which way the clouds were flying and to be sure barbara would have been at hers too if she had not sat up so late overnight starching and ironing small pieces of muslin and crimping them into frills and sewing them on to other pieces to form magnificent wholes for next days wear  but they were both up very early for all that and had small appetites for breakfast and less for dinner and were in a state of great excitement when barbaras mother came in with astonishing accounts of the fineness of the weather out of doors but with a very large umbrella notwithstanding for people like barbaras mother seldom make holiday without one and when the bell rang for them to go up stairs and receive their quarters money in gold and silver  well wasnt mr garland kind when he said christopher heres your money and you have earned it well and wasnt mrs garland kind when she said barbara heres yours and im much pleased with you and didnt kit sign his name bold to his receipt and didnt barbara sign her name all a trembling to hers and wasnt it beautiful to see how mrs garland poured out barbaras mother a glass of wine and didnt barbaras mother speak up when she said heres blessing you maam as a good lady and you sir as a good gentleman and barbara my love to you and heres towards you mr christopher and wasnt she as long drinking it as if it had been a tumblerful and didnt she look genteel standing there with her gloves on and wasnt there plenty of laughing and talking among them as they reviewed all these things upon the top of the coach and didnt they pity the people who hadnt got a holiday  but kits mother againwouldnt anybody have supposed she had come of a good stock and been a lady all her life  there she was quite ready to receive them with a display of teathings that might have warmed the heart of a chinashop and little jacob and the baby in such a state of perfection that their clothes looked as good as new though heaven knows they were old enough  didnt she say before they had sat down five minutes that barbaras mother was exactly the sort of lady she expected and didnt barbaras mother say that kits mother was the very picture of what she had expected and didnt kits mother compliment barbaras mother on barbara and didnt barbaras mother compliment kits mother on kit and wasnt barbara herself quite fascinated with little jacob and did ever a child show off when he was wanted as that child did or make such friends as he made  and we are both widows too said barbaras mother  we must have been made to know each other  i havent a doubt about it returned mrs nubbles  and what a pity it is we didnt know each other sooner  but then you know its such a pleasure said barbaras mother to have it brought about by ones son and daughter that its fully made up for  now ant it  to this kits mother yielded her full assent and tracing things back from effects to causes they naturally reverted to their deceased husbands respecting whose lives deaths and burials they compared notes and discovered sundry circumstances that tallied with wonderful exactness such as barbaras father having been exactly four years and ten months older than kits father and one of them having died on a wednesday and the other on a thursday and both of them having been of a very fine make and remarkably goodlooking with other extraordinary coincidences  these recollections being of a kind calculated to cast a shadow on the brightness of the holiday kit diverted the conversation to general topics and they were soon in great force again and as merry as before  among other things kit told them about his old place and the extraordinary beauty of nell of whom he had talked to barbara a thousand times already but the lastnamed circumstance failed to interest his hearers to anything like the extent he had supposed and even his mother said looking accidentally at barbara at the same time that there was no doubt miss nell was very pretty but she was but a child after all and there were many young women quite as pretty as she and barbara mildly observed that she should think so and that she never could help believing mr christopher must be under a mistakewhich kit wondered at very much not being able to conceive what reason she had for doubting him  barbaras mother too observed that it was very common for young folks to change at about fourteen or fifteen and whereas they had been very pretty before to grow up quite plain which truth she illustrated by many forcible examples especially one of a young man who being a builder with great prospects had been particular in his attentions to barbara but whom barbara would have nothing to say to which though everything happened for the best she almost thought was a pity  kit said he thought so too and so he did honestly and he wondered what made barbara so silent all at once and why his mother looked at him as if he shouldnt have said it  however it was high time now to be thinking of the play for which great preparation was required in the way of shawls and bonnets not to mention one handkerchief full of oranges and another of apples which took some time tying up in consequence of the fruit having a tendency to roll out at the corners  at length everything was ready and they went off very fast kits mother carrying the baby who was dreadfully wide awake and kit holding little jacob in one hand and escorting barbara with the othera state of things which occasioned the two mothers who walked behind to declare that they looked quite family folks and caused barbara to blush and say now dont mother but kit said she had no call to mind what they said and indeed she need not have had if she had known how very far from kits thoughts any lovemaking was  poor barbara  at last they got to the theatre which was astleys and in some two minutes after they had reached the yet unopened door little jacob was squeezed flat and the baby had received divers concussions and barbaras mothers umbrella had been carried several yards off and passed back to her over the shoulders of the people and kit had hit a man on the head with the handkerchief of apples for scrowdging his parent with unnecessary violence and there was a great uproar  but when they were once past the payplace and tearing away for very life with their checks in their hands and above all when they were fairly in the theatre and seated in such places that they couldnt have had better if they had picked them out and taken them beforehand all this was looked upon as quite a capital joke and an essential part of the entertainment  dear dear what a place it looked that astleys with all the paint gilding and lookingglass the vague smell of horses suggestive of coming wonders the curtain that hid such gorgeous mysteries the clean white sawdust down in the circus the company coming in and taking their places the fiddlers looking carelessly up at them while they tuned their instruments as if they didnt want the play to begin and knew it all beforehand  what a glow was that which burst upon them all when that long clear brilliant row of lights came slowly up and what the feverish excitement when the little bell rang and the music began in good earnest with strong parts for the drums and sweet effects for the triangles  well might barbaras mother say to kits mother that the gallery was the place to see from and wonder it wasnt much dearer than the boxes well might barbara feel doubtful whether to laugh or cry in her flutter of delight  then the play itself the horses which little jacob believed from the first to be alive and the ladies and gentlemen of whose reality he could be by no means persuaded having never seen or heard anything at all like themthe firing which made barbara winkthe forlorn lady who made her crythe tyrant who made her tremblethe man who sang the song with the ladysmaid and danced the chorus who made her laughthe pony who reared up on his hind legs when he saw the murderer and wouldnt hear of walking on all fours again until he was taken into custodythe clown who ventured on such familiarities with the military man in bootsthe lady who jumped over the nineandtwenty ribbons and came down safe upon the horses backeverything was delightful splendid and surprising  little jacob applauded till his hands were sore kit cried ankor at the end of everything the threeact piece included and barbaras mother beat her umbrella on the floor in her ecstasies until it was nearly worn down to the gingham  in the midst of all these fascinations barbaras thoughts seemed to have been still running on what kit had said at teatime for when they were coming out of the play she asked him with an hysterical simper if miss nell was as handsome as the lady who jumped over the ribbons  as handsome as her said kit  double as handsome  oh christopher im sure she was the beautifullest creature ever was said barbara  nonsense returned kit  she was well enough i dont deny that but think how she was dressed and painted and what a difference that made why you are a good deal better looking than her barbara  oh christopher said barbara looking down  you are any day said kit and sos your mother  poor barbara  what was all this thougheven all thisto the extraordinary dissipation that ensued when kit walking into an oystershop as bold as if he lived there and not so much as looking at the counter or the man behind it led his party into a boxa private box fitted up with red curtains white tablecloth and cruetstand completeand ordered a fierce gentleman with whiskers who acted as waiter and called him him christopher nubbles sir to bring three dozen of his largestsized oysters and to look sharp about it  yes kit told this gentleman to look sharp and he not only said he would look sharp but he actually did and presently came running back with the newest loaves and the freshest butter and the largest oysters ever seen then said kit to this gentleman a pot of beerjust soand the gentleman instead of replying sir did you address that language to me only said pot o beer sir  yes sir and went off and fetched it and put it on the table in a small decanterstand like those which blindmens dogs carry about the streets in their mouths to catch the halfpence in and both kits mother and barbaras mother declared as he turned away that he was one of the slimmest and gracefullest young men she had ever looked upon  then they fell to work upon the supper in earnest and there was barbara that foolish barbara declaring that she could not eat more than two and wanting more pressing than you would believe before she would eat four though her mother and kits mother made up for it pretty well and ate and laughed and enjoyed themselves so thoroughly that it did kit good to see them and made him laugh and eat likewise from strong sympathy  but the greatest miracle of the night was little jacob who ate oysters as if he had been born and bred to the businesssprinkled the pepper and the vinegar with a discretion beyond his yearsand afterwards built a grotto on the table with the shells there was the baby too who had never closed an eye all night but had sat as good as gold trying to force a large orange into his mouth and gazing intently at the lights in the chandelierthere he was sitting up in his mothers lap staring at the gas without winking and making indentations in his soft visage with an oystershell to that degree that a heart of iron must have loved him  in short there never was a more successful supper and when kit ordered in a glass of something hot to finish with and proposed mr and mrs garland before sending it round there were not six happier people in all the world  but all happiness has an endhence the chief pleasure of its next beginningand as it was now growing late they agreed it was time to turn their faces homewards  so after going a little out of their way to see barbara and barbaras mother safe to a friends house where they were to pass the night kit and his mother left them at the door with an early appointment for returning to finchley next morning and a great many plans for next quarters enjoyment  then kit took little jacob on his back and giving his arm to his mother and a kiss to the baby they all trudged merrily home together     chapter 40  full of that vague kind of penitence which holidays awaken next morning kit turned out at sunrise and with his faith in last nights enjoyments a little shaken by cool daylight and the return to everyday duties and occupations went to meet barbara and her mother at the appointed place  and being careful not to awaken any of the little household who were yet resting from their unusual fatigues kit left his money on the chimneypiece with an inscription in chalk calling his mothers attention to the circumstance and informing her that it came from her dutiful son and went his way with a heart something heavier than his pockets but free from any very great oppression notwithstanding  oh these holidays why will they leave us some regret  why cannot we push them back only a week or two in our memories so as to put them at once at that convenient distance whence they may be regarded either with a calm indifference or a pleasant effort of recollection why will they hang about us like the flavour of yesterdays wine suggestive of headaches and lassitude and those good intentions for the future which under the earth form the everlasting pavement of a large estate and upon it usually endure until dinnertime or thereabouts  who will wonder that barbara had a headache or that barbaras mother was disposed to be cross or that she slightly underrated astleys and thought the clown was older than they had taken him to be last night kit was not surprised to hear her say sonot he  he had already had a misgiving that the inconstant actors in that dazzling vision had been doing the same thing the night before last and would do it again that night and the next and for weeks and months to come though he would not be there  such is the difference between yesterday and today  we are all going to the play or coming home from it  however the sun himself is weak when he first rises and gathers strength and courage as the day gets on  by degrees they began to recall circumstances more and more pleasant in their nature until what between talking walking and laughing they reached finchley in such good heart that barbaras mother declared she never felt less tired or in better spirits  and so said kit  barbara had been silent all the way but she said so too  poor little barbara  she was very quiet  they were at home in such good time that kit had rubbed down the pony and made him as spruce as a racehorse before mr garland came down to breakfast which punctual and industrious conduct the old lady and the old gentleman and mr abel highly extolled  at his usual hour or rather at his usual minute and second for he was the soul of punctuality mr abel walked out to be overtaken by the london coach and kit and the old gentleman went to work in the garden  this was not the least pleasant of kits employments  on a fine day they were quite a family party the old lady sitting hard by with her workbasket on a little table the old gentleman digging or pruning or clipping about with a large pair of shears or helping kit in some way or other with great assiduity and whisker looking on from his paddock in placid contemplation of them all  today they were to trim the grapevine so kit mounted halfway up a short ladder and began to snip and hammer away while the old gentleman with a great interest in his proceedings handed up the nails and shreds of cloth as he wanted them  the old lady and whisker looked on as usual  well christopher said mr garland and so you have made a new friend eh  i beg your pardon sir returned kit looking down from the ladder  you have made a new friend i hear from mr abel said the old gentleman at the office  oh  yes sir yes  he behaved very handsome sir  im glad to hear it returned the old gentlemen with a smile  he is disposed to behave more handsomely still though christopher  indeed sir  its very kind in him but i dont want him to im sure said kit hammering stoutly at an obdurate nail  he is rather anxious pursued the old gentleman to have you in his own servicetake care what youre doing or you will fall down and hurt yourself  to have me in his service sir cried kit who had stopped short in his work and faced about on the ladder like some dexterous tumbler why sir i dont think he can be in earnest when he says that  oh  but he is indeed said mr garland  and he has told mr abel so  i never heard of such a thing muttered kit looking ruefully at his master and mistress  i wonder at him that i do  you see christopher said mr garland this is a point of much importance to you and you should understand and consider it in that light  this gentleman is able to give you more money than inot i hope to carry through the various relations of master and servant more kindness and confidence but certainly christopher to give you more money  well said kit after that sir  wait a moment interposed mr garland  that is not all  you were a very faithful servant to your old employers as i understand and should this gentleman recover them as it is his purpose to attempt doing by every means in his power i have no doubt that you being in his service would meet with your reward  besides added the old gentleman with stronger emphasis besides having the pleasure of being again brought into communication with those to whom you seem to be very strongly and disinterestedly attached  you must think of all this christopher and not be rash or hasty in your choice  kit did suffer one twinge one momentary pang in keeping the resolution he had already formed when this last argument passed swiftly into his thoughts and conjured up the realization of all his hopes and fancies  but it was gone in a minute and he sturdily rejoined that the gentleman must look out for somebody else as he did think he might have done at first  he has no right to think that id be led away to go to him sir said kit turning round again after half a minutes hammering  does he think im a fool  he may perhaps christopher if you refuse his offer said mr garland gravely  then let him sir retorted kit what do i care sir what he thinks  why should i care for his thinking sir when i know that i should be a fool and worse than a fool sir to leave the kindest master and mistress that ever was or can be who took me out of the streets a very poor and hungry lad indeedpoorer and hungrier perhaps than even you think for sirto go to him or anybody  if miss nell was to come back maam added kit turning suddenly to his mistress why that would be another thing and perhaps if she wanted me i might ask you now and then to let me work for her when all was done at home but when she comes back i see now that shell be rich as old master always said she would and being a rich young lady what could she want of me  no no added kit shaking his head sorrowfully shell never want me any more and bless her i hope she never may though i should like to see her too  here kit drove a nail into the wall very hardmuch harder than was necessaryand having done so faced about again  theres the pony sir said kitwhisker maam and he knows so well im talking about him that he begins to neigh directly sirwould he let anybody come near him but me maam  heres the garden sir and mr abel maam  would mr abel part with me sir or is there anybody that could be fonder of the garden maam  it would break mothers heart sir and even little jacob would have sense enough to cry his eyes out maam if he thought that mr abel could wish to part with me so soon after having told me only the other day that he hoped we might be together for years to come  there is no telling how long kit might have stood upon the ladder addressing his master and mistress by turns and generally turning towards the wrong person if barbara had not at that moment come running up to say that a messenger from the office had brought a note which with an expression of some surprise at kits oratorical appearance she put into her masters hand  oh said the old gentleman after reading it ask the messenger to walk this way  barbara tripping off to do as she was bid he turned to kit and said that they would not pursue the subject any further and that kit could not be more unwilling to part with them than they would be to part with kit a sentiment which the old lady very generously echoed  at the same time christopher added mr garland glancing at the note in his hand if the gentleman should want to borrow you now and then for an hour or so or even a day or so at a time we must consent to lend you and you must consent to be lentoh here is the young gentleman  how do you do sir  this salutation was addressed to mr chuckster who with his hat extremely on one side and his hair a long way beyond it came swaggering up the walk  hope i see you well sir returned that gentleman  hope i see you well maam  charming box this sir  delicious country to be sure  you want to take kit back with you i find observed mr garland  i have got a chariotcab waiting on purpose replied the clerk  a very spanking grey in that cab sir if youre a judge of horseflesh  declining to inspect the spanking grey on the plea that he was but poorly acquainted with such matters and would but imperfectly appreciate his beauties mr garland invited mr chuckster to partake of a slight repast in the way of lunch  that gentleman readily consenting certain cold viands flanked with ale and wine were speedily prepared for his refreshment  at this repast mr chuckster exerted his utmost abilities to enchant his entertainers and impress them with a conviction of the mental superiority of those who dwelt in town with which view he led the discourse to the small scandal of the day in which he was justly considered by his friends to shine prodigiously  thus he was in a condition to relate the exact circumstances of the difference between the marquis of mizzler and lord bobby which it appeared originated in a disputed bottle of champagne and not in a pigeonpie as erroneously reported in the newspapers neither had lord bobby said to the marquis of mizzler mizzler one of us two tells a lie and im not the man as incorrectly stated by the same authorities but mizzler you know where im to be found and damme sir find me if you want mewhich of course entirely changed the aspect of this interesting question and placed it in a very different light  he also acquainted them with the precise amount of the income guaranteed by the duke of thigsberry to violetta stetta of the italian opera which it appeared was payable quarterly and not halfyearly as the public had been given to understand and which was exclusive and not inclusive as had been monstrously stated of jewellery perfumery hairpowder for five footmen and two daily changes of kidgloves for a page  having entreated the old lady and gentleman to set their minds at rest on these absorbing points for they might rely on his statement being the correct one mr chuckster entertained them with theatrical chitchat and the court circular and so wound up a brilliant and fascinating conversation which he had maintained alone and without any assistance whatever for upwards of threequarters of an hour  and now that the nag has got his wind again said mr chuckster rising in a graceful manner im afraid i must cut my stick  neither mr nor mrs garland offered any opposition to his tearing himself away feeling no doubt that such a man could ill be spared from his proper sphere of action and therefore mr chuckster and kit were shortly afterwards upon their way to town kit being perched upon the box of the cabriolet beside the driver and mr chuckster seated in solitary state inside with one of his boots sticking out at each of the front windows  when they reached the notarys house kit followed into the office and was desired by mr abel to sit down and wait for the gentleman who wanted him had gone out and perhaps might not return for some time this anticipation was strictly verified for kit had had his dinner and his tea and had read all the lighter matter in the lawlist and the postoffice directory and had fallen asleep a great many times before the gentleman whom he had seen before came in which he did at last in a very great hurry  he was closeted with mr witherden for some little time and mr abel had been called in to assist at the conference before kit wondering very much what he was wanted for was summoned to attend them  christopher said the gentleman turning to him directly he entered the room i have found your old master and young mistress  no sir  have you though returned kit his eyes sparkling with delight  where are they sir  how are they sir  are theyare they near here  a long way from here returned the gentleman shaking his head  but i am going away tonight to bring them back and i want you to go with me  me sir cried kit full of joy and surprise  the place said the strange gentleman turning thoughtfully to the notary indicated by this man of the dogs ishow far from heresixty miles  from sixty to seventy  humph  if we travel post all night we shall reach there in good time tomorrow morning  now the only question is as they will not know me and the child god bless her would think that any stranger pursuing them had a design upon her grandfathers libertycan i do better than take this lad whom they both know and will readily remember as an assurance to them of my friendly intentions  certainly not replied the notary  take christopher by all means  i beg your pardon sir said kit who had listened to this discourse with a lengthening countenance but if thats the reason im afraid i should do more harm than goodmiss nell sir she knows me and would trust in me i am sure but old masteri dont know why gentlemen nobody doeswould not bear me in his sight after he had been ill and miss nell herself told me that i must not go near him or let him see me any more  i should spoil all that you were doing if i went im afraid  id give the world to go but you had better not take me sir  another difficulty cried the impetuous gentleman  was ever man so beset as i  is there nobody else that knew them nobody else in whom they had any confidence  solitary as their lives were is there no one person who would serve my purpose  is there christopher said the notary  not one sir replied kityes thoughtheres my mother  did they know her said the single gentleman  know her sir why she was always coming backwards and forwards they were as kind to her as they were to me  bless you sir she expected theyd come back to her house  then where the devil is the woman said the impatient gentleman catching up his hat  why isnt she here  why is that woman always out of the way when she is most wanted  in a word the single gentleman was bursting out of the office bent upon laying violent hands on kits mother forcing her into a postchaise and carrying her off when this novel kind of abduction was with some difficulty prevented by the joint efforts of mr abel and the notary who restrained him by dint of their remonstrances and persuaded him to sound kit upon the probability of her being able and willing to undertake such a journey on so short a notice  this occasioned some doubts on the part of kit and some violent demonstrations on that of the single gentleman and a great many soothing speeches on that of the notary and mr abel  the upshot of the business was that kit after weighing the matter in his mind and considering it carefully promised on behalf of his mother that she should be ready within two hours from that time to undertake the expedition and engaged to produce her in that place in all respects equipped and prepared for the journey before the specified period had expired  having given this pledge which was rather a bold one and not particularly easy of redemption kit lost no time in sallying forth and taking measures for its immediate fulfilment     chapter 41  kit made his way through the crowded streets dividing the stream of people dashing across the busy roadways diving into lanes and alleys and stopping or turning aside for nothing until he came in front of the old curiosity shop when he came to a stand partly from habit and partly from being out of breath  it was a gloomy autumn evening and he thought the old place had never looked so dismal as in its dreary twilight  the windows broken the rusty sashes rattling in their frames the deserted house a dull barrier dividing the glaring lights and bustle of the street into two long lines and standing in the midst cold dark and emptypresented a cheerless spectacle which mingled harshly with the bright prospects the boy had been building up for its late inmates and came like a disappointment or misfortune  kit would have had a good fire roaring up the empty chimneys lights sparkling and shining through the windows people moving briskly to and fro voices in cheerful conversation something in unison with the new hopes that were astir he had not expected that the house would wear any different aspecthad known indeed that it could notbut coming upon it in the midst of eager thoughts and expectations it checked the current in its flow and darkened it with a mournful shadow  kit however fortunately for himself was not learned enough or contemplative enough to be troubled with presages of evil afar off and having no mental spectacles to assist his vision in this respect saw nothing but the dull house which jarred uncomfortably upon his previous thoughts  so almost wishing that he had not passed it though hardly knowing why he hurried on again making up by his increased speed for the few moments he had lost  now if she should be out thought kit as he approached the poor dwelling of his mother and i not able to find her this impatient gentleman would be in a pretty taking  and sure enough theres no light and the doors fast  now god forgive me for saying so but if this is little bethels doing i wish little bethel waswas farther off said kit checking himself and knocking at the door  a second knock brought no reply from within the house but caused a woman over the way to look out and inquire who that was awanting mrs nubbles  me said kit  shes atat little bethel i supposegetting out the name of the obnoxious conventicle with some reluctance and laying a spiteful emphasis upon the words  the neighbour nodded assent  then pray tell me where it is said kit for i have come on a pressing matter and must fetch her out even if she was in the pulpit  it was not very easy to procure a direction to the fold in question as none of the neighbours were of the flock that resorted thither and few knew anything more of it than the name  at last a gossip of mrs nubbless who had accompanied her to chapel on one or two occasions when a comfortable cup of tea had preceded her devotions furnished the needful information which kit had no sooner obtained than he started off again  little bethel might have been nearer and might have been in a straighter road though in that case the reverend gentleman who presided over its congregation would have lost his favourite allusion to the crooked ways by which it was approached and which enabled him to liken it to paradise itself in contradistinction to the parish church and the broad thoroughfare leading thereunto  kit found it at last after some trouble and pausing at the door to take breath that he might enter with becoming decency passed into the chapel  it was not badly named in one respect being in truth a particularly little bethela bethel of the smallest dimensionswith a small number of small pews and a small pulpit in which a small gentleman by trade a shoemaker and by calling a divine was delivering in a by no means small voice a by no means small sermon judging of its dimensions by the condition of his audience which if their gross amount were but small comprised a still smaller number of hearers as the majority were slumbering  among these was kits mother who finding it matter of extreme difficulty to keep her eyes open after the fatigues of last night and feeling their inclination to close strongly backed and seconded by the arguments of the preacher had yielded to the drowsiness that overpowered her and fallen asleep though not so soundly but that she could from time to time utter a slight and almost inaudible groan as if in recognition of the orators doctrines  the baby in her arms was as fast asleep as she and little jacob whose youth prevented him from recognising in this prolonged spiritual nourishment anything half as interesting as oysters was alternately very fast asleep and very wide awake as his inclination to slumber or his terror of being personally alluded to in the discourse gained the mastery over him  and now im here thought kit gliding into the nearest empty pew which was opposite his mothers and on the other side of the little aisle how am i ever to get at her or persuade her to come out  i might as well be twenty miles off  shell never wake till its all over and there goes the clock again  if he would but leave off for a minute or if theyd only sing  but there was little encouragement to believe that either event would happen for a couple of hours to come  the preacher went on telling them what he meant to convince them of before he had done and it was clear that if he only kept to onehalf of his promises and forgot the other he was good for that time at least  in his desperation and restlessness kit cast his eyes about the chapel and happening to let them fall upon a little seat in front of the clerks desk could scarcely believe them when they showed himquilp  he rubbed them twice or thrice but still they insisted that quilp was there and there indeed he was sitting with his hands upon his knees and his hat between them on a little wooden bracket with the accustomed grin on his dirty face and his eyes fixed upon the ceiling he certainly did not glance at kit or at his mother and appeared utterly unconscious of their presence still kit could not help feeling directly that the attention of the sly little fiend was fastened upon them and upon nothing else  but astounded as he was by the apparition of the dwarf among the little bethelites and not free from a misgiving that it was the forerunner of some trouble or annoyance he was compelled to subdue his wonder and to take active measures for the withdrawal of his parent as the evening was now creeping on and the matter grew serious therefore the next time little jacob woke kit set himself to attract his wandering attention and this not being a very difficult task one sneeze effected it he signed to him to rouse his mother  illluck would have it however that just then the preacher in a forcible exposition of one head of his discourse leaned over upon the pulpitdesk so that very little more of him than his legs remained inside and while he made vehement gestures with his right hand and held on with his left stared or seemed to stare straight into little jacobs eyes threatening him by his strained look and attitudeso it appeared to the childthat if he so much as moved a muscle he the preacher would be literally and not figuratively down upon him that instant  in this fearful state of things distracted by the sudden appearance of kit and fascinated by the eyes of the preacher the miserable jacob sat bolt upright wholly incapable of motion strongly disposed to cry but afraid to do so and returning his pastors gaze until his infant eyes seemed starting from their sockets  if i must do it openly i must thought kit  with that he walked softly out of his pew and into his mothers and as mr swiveller would have observed if he had been present collared the baby without speaking a word  hush mother whispered kit  come along with me ive got something to tell you  where am i said mrs nubbles  in this blessed little bethel returned her son peevishly  blessed indeed cried mrs nubbles catching at the word  oh christopher how have i been edified this night  yes yes i know said kit hastily but come along mother everybodys looking at us  dont make a noisebring jacobthats right  stay satan stay cried the preacher as kit was moving off   this gentleman says youre to stay christopher whispered his mother  stay satan stay roared the preacher again  tempt not the woman that doth incline her ear to thee but harken to the voice of him that calleth  he hath a lamb from the fold cried the preacher raising his voice still higher and pointing to the baby  he beareth off a lamb a precious lamb  he goeth about like a wolf in the night season and inveigleth the tender lambs  kit was the besttempered fellow in the world but considering this strong language and being somewhat excited by the circumstances in which he was placed he faced round to the pulpit with the baby in his arms and replied aloud no i dont  hes my brother  hes my brother cried the preacher  he isnt said kit indignantly  how can you say such a thing  and dont call me names if you please what harm have i done  i shouldnt have come to take em away unless i was obliged you may depend upon that  i wanted to do it very quiet but you wouldnt let me  now you have the goodness to abuse satan and them as much as you like sir and to let me alone if you please  so saying kit marched out of the chapel followed by his mother and little jacob and found himself in the open air with an indistinct recollection of having seen the people wake up and look surprised and of quilp having remained throughout the interruption in his old attitude without moving his eyes from the ceiling or appearing to take the smallest notice of anything that passed  oh kit said his mother with her handkerchief to her eyes what have you done  i never can go there againnever  im glad of it mother  what was there in the little bit of pleasure you took last night that made it necessary for you to be lowspirited and sorrowful tonight  thats the way you do  if youre happy or merry ever you come here to say along with that chap that youre sorry for it  more shame for you mother i was going to say  hush dear said mrs nubbles you dont mean what you say i know but youre talking sinfulness  dont mean it  but i do mean it retorted kit  i dont believe mother that harmless cheerfulness and good humour are thought greater sins in heaven than shirtcollars are and i do believe that those chaps are just about as right and sensible in putting down the one as in leaving off the otherthats my belief  but i wont say anything more about it if youll promise not to cry thats all and you take the baby thats a lighter weight and give me little jacob and as we go along which we must do pretty quick ill give you the news i bring which will surprise you a little i can tell you  therethats right  now you look as if youd never seen little bethel in all your life as i hope you never will again and heres the baby and little jacob you get atop of my back and catch hold of me tight round the neck and whenever a little bethel parson calls you a precious lamb or says your brothers one you tell him its the truest things hes said for a twelvemonth and that if hed got a little more of the lamb himself and less of the mintsaucenot being quite so sharp and sour over iti should like him all the better  thats what youve got to say to him jacob  talking on in this way half in jest and half in earnest and cheering up his mother the children and himself by the one simple process of determining to be in a good humour kit led them briskly forward and on the road home he related what had passed at the notarys house and the purpose with which he had intruded on the solemnities of little bethel  his mother was not a little startled on learning what service was required of her and presently fell into a confusion of ideas of which the most prominent were that it was a great honour and dignity to ride in a postchaise and that it was a moral impossibility to leave the children behind  but this objection and a great many others founded on certain articles of dress being at the wash and certain other articles having no existence in the wardrobe of mrs nubbles were overcome by kit who opposed to each and every of them the pleasure of recovering nell and the delight it would be to bring her back in triumph  theres only ten minutes now mother said kit when they reached home  theres a bandbox  throw in what you want and well be off directly  to tell how kit then hustled into the box all sorts of things which could by no remote contingency be wanted and how he left out everything likely to be of the smallest use how a neighbour was persuaded to come and stop with the children and how the children at first cried dismally and then laughed heartily on being promised all kinds of impossible and unheardof toys how kits mother wouldnt leave off kissing them and how kit couldnt make up his mind to be vexed with her for doing it would take more time and room than you and i can spare  so passing over all such matters it is sufficient to say that within a few minutes after the two hours had expired kit and his mother arrived at the notarys door where a postchaise was already waiting  with four horses i declare said kit quite aghast at the preparations  well you are going to do it mother  here she is sir heres my mother  shes quite ready sir  thats well returned the gentleman  now dont be in a flutter maam youll be taken great care of  wheres the box with the new clothing and necessaries for them  here it is said the notary  in with it christopher  all right sir replied kit  quite ready now sir  then come along said the single gentleman  and thereupon he gave his arm to kits mother handed her into the carriage as politely as you please and took his seat beside her  up went the steps bang went the door round whirled the wheels and off they rattled with kits mother hanging out at one window waving a damp pockethandkerchief and screaming out a great many messages to little jacob and the baby of which nobody heard a word  kit stood in the middle of the road and looked after them with tears in his eyesnot brought there by the departure he witnessed but by the return to which he looked forward  they went away he thought on foot with nobody to speak to them or say a kind word at parting and theyll come back drawn by four horses with this rich gentleman for their friend and all their troubles over  shell forget that she taught me to write  whatever kit thought about after this took some time to think of for he stood gazing up the lines of shining lamps long after the chaise had disappeared and did not return into the house until the notary and mr abel who had themselves lingered outside till the sound of the wheels was no longer distinguishable had several times wondered what could possibly detain him     chapter 42  it behoves us to leave kit for a while thoughtful and expectant and to follow the fortunes of little nell resuming the thread of the narrative at the point where it was left some chapters back  in one of those wanderings in the evening time when following the two sisters at a humble distance she felt in her sympathy with them and her recognition in their trials of something akin to her own loneliness of spirit a comfort and consolation which made such moments a time of deep delight though the softened pleasure they yielded was of that kind which lives and dies in tearsin one of those wanderings at the quiet hour of twilight when sky and earth and air and rippling water and sound of distant bells claimed kindred with the emotions of the solitary child and inspired her with soothing thoughts but not of a childs world or its easy joysin one of those rambles which had now become her only pleasure or relief from care light had faded into darkness and evening deepened into night and still the young creature lingered in the gloom feeling a companionship in nature so serene and still when noise of tongues and glare of garish lights would have been solitude indeed  the sisters had gone home and she was alone  she raised her eyes to the bright stars looking down so mildly from the wide worlds of air and gazing on them found new stars burst upon her view and more beyond and more beyond again until the whole great expanse sparkled with shining spheres rising higher and higher in immeasurable space eternal in their numbers as in their changeless and incorruptible existence  she bent over the calm river and saw them shining in the same majestic order as when the dove beheld them gleaming through the swollen waters upon the mountain tops down far below and dead mankind a million fathoms deep  the child sat silently beneath a tree hushed in her very breath by the stillness of the night and all its attendant wonders  the time and place awoke reflection and she thought with a quiet hopeless hope perhaps than resignationon the past and present and what was yet before her  between the old man and herself there had come a gradual separation harder to bear than any former sorrow  every evening and often in the daytime too he was absent alone and although she well knew where he went and whytoo well from the constant drain upon her scanty purse and from his haggard lookshe evaded all inquiry maintained a strict reserve and even shunned her presence  she sat meditating sorrowfully upon this change and mingling it as it were with everything about her when the distant churchclock bell struck nine  rising at the sound she retraced her steps and turned thoughtfully towards the town  she had gained a little wooden bridge which thrown across the stream led into a meadow in her way when she came suddenly upon a ruddy light and looking forward more attentively discerned that it proceeded from what appeared to be an encampment of gipsies who had made a fire in one corner at no great distance from the path and were sitting or lying round it  as she was too poor to have any fear of them she did not alter her course which indeed she could not have done without going a long way round but quickened her pace a little and kept straight on  a movement of timid curiosity impelled her when she approached the spot to glance towards the fire  there was a form between it and her the outline strongly developed against the light which caused her to stop abruptly  then as if she had reasoned with herself and were assured that it could not be or had satisfied herself that it was not that of the person she had supposed she went on again  but at that instant the conversation whatever it was which had been carrying on near this fire was resumed and the tones of the voice that spokeshe could not distinguish wordssounded as familiar to her as her own  she turned and looked back  the person had been seated before but was now in a standing posture and leaning forward on a stick on which he rested both hands  the attitude was no less familiar to her than the tone of voice had been  it was her grandfather  her first impulse was to call to him her next to wonder who his associates could be and for what purpose they were together  some vague apprehension succeeded and yielding to the strong inclination it awakened she drew nearer to the place not advancing across the open field however but creeping towards it by the hedge  in this way she advanced within a few feet of the fire and standing among a few young trees could both see and hear without much danger of being observed  there were no women or children as she had seen in other gipsy camps they had passed in their wayfaring and but one gipsya tall athletic man who stood with his arms folded leaning against a tree at a little distance off looking now at the fire and now under his black eyelashes at three other men who were there with a watchful but halfconcealed interest in their conversation  of these her grandfather was one the others she recognised as the first cardplayers at the publichouse on the eventful night of the stormthe man whom they had called isaac list and his gruff companion  one of the low arched gipsytents common to that people was pitched hard by but it either was or appeared to be empty  well are you going said the stout man looking up from the ground where he was lying at his ease into her grandfathers face  you were in a mighty hurry a minute ago  go if you like  youre your own master i hope  dont vex him returned isaac list who was squatting like a frog on the other side of the fire and had so screwed himself up that he seemed to be squinting all over he didnt mean any offence  you keep me poor and plunder me and make a sport and jest of me besides said the old man turning from one to the other  yell drive me mad among ye  the utter irresolution and feebleness of the greyhaired child contrasted with the keen and cunning looks of those in whose hands he was smote upon the little listeners heart  but she constrained herself to attend to all that passed and to note each look and word  confound you what do you mean said the stout man rising a little and supporting himself on his elbow  keep you poor  youd keep us poor if you could wouldnt you  thats the way with you whining puny pitiful players  when you lose youre martyrs but i dont find that when you win you look upon the other losers in that light  as to plunder cried the fellow raising his voicedamme what do you mean by such ungentlemanly language as plunder eh  the speaker laid himself down again at full length and gave one or two short angry kicks as if in further expression of his unbounded indignation  it was quite plain that he acted the bully and his friend the peacemaker for some particular purpose or rather it would have been to any one but the weak old man for they exchanged glances quite openly both with each other and with the gipsy who grinned his approval of the jest until his white teeth shone again  the old man stood helplessly among them for a little time and then said turning to his assailant  you yourself were speaking of plunder just now you know  dont be so violent with me  you were were you not  not of plundering among present company  honour amongamong gentlemen sir returned the other who seemed to have been very near giving an awkward termination to the sentence  dont be hard upon him jowl said isaac list  hes very sorry for giving offence  therego on with what you were sayinggo on  im a jolly old tenderhearted lamb i am cried mr jowl to be sitting here at my time of life giving advice when i know it wont be taken and that i shall get nothing but abuse for my pains  but thats the way ive gone through life  experience has never put a chill upon my warmheartedness  i tell you hes very sorry dont i remonstrated isaac list and that he wishes youd go on  does he wish it said the other  ay groaned the old man sitting down and rocking himself to and fro go on go on  its in vain to fight with it i cant do it go on  i go on then said jowl where i left off when you got up so quick if youre persuaded that its time for luck to turn as it certainly is and find that you havent means enough to try it and thats where it is for you know yourself that you never have the funds to keep on long enough at a sitting help yourself to what seems put in your way on purpose  borrow it i say and when youre able pay it back again  certainly isaac list struck in if this good lady as keeps the waxworks has money and does keep it in a tin box when she goes to bed and doesnt lock her door for fear of fire it seems a easy thing quite a providence i should call itbut then ive been religiously brought up  you see isaac said his friend growing more eager and drawing himself closer to the old man while he signed to the gipsy not to come between them you see isaac strangers are going in and out every hour of the day nothing would be more likely than for one of these strangers to get under the good ladys bed or lock himself in the cupboard suspicion would be very wide and would fall a long way from the mark no doubt  id give him his revenge to the last farthing he brought whatever the amount was  but could you urged isaac list  is your bank strong enough  strong enough answered the other with assumed disdain  here you sir give me that box out of the straw  this was addressed to the gipsy who crawled into the low tent on all fours and after some rummaging and rustling returned with a cashbox which the man who had spoken opened with a key he wore about his person  do you see this he said gathering up the money in his hand and letting it drop back into the box between his fingers like water do you hear it  do you know the sound of gold  there put it backand dont talk about banks again isaac till youve got one of your own  isaac list with great apparent humility protested that he had never doubted the credit of a gentleman so notorious for his honourable dealing as mr jowl and that he had hinted at the production of the box not for the satisfaction of his doubts for he could have none but with a view to being regaled with a sight of so much wealth which though it might be deemed by some but an unsubstantial and visionary pleasure was to one in his circumstances a source of extreme delight only to be surpassed by its safe depository in his own personal pockets  although mr list and mr jowl addressed themselves to each other it was remarkable that they both looked narrowly at the old man who with his eyes fixed upon the fire sat brooding over it yet listening eagerlyas it seemed from a certain involuntary motion of the head or twitching of the face from time to timeto all they said  my advice said jowl lying down again with a careless air is plaini have given it in fact  i act as a friend  why should i help a man to the means perhaps of winning all i have unless i considered him my friend  its foolish i dare say to be so thoughtful of the welfare of other people but thats my constitution and i cant help it so dont blame me isaac list  i blame you returned the person addressed not for the world mr jowl  i wish i could afford to be as liberal as you and as you say he might pay it back if he wonand if he lost  youre not to take that into consideration at all said jowl  but suppose he did and nothings less likely from all i know of chances why its better to lose other peoples money than ones own i hope  ah cried isaac list rapturously the pleasures of winning  the delight of picking up the moneythe bright shining yellowboysand sweeping em into ones pocket  the deliciousness of having a triumph at last and thinking that one didnt stop short and turn back but went halfway to meet it  thebut youre not going old gentleman  ill do it said the old man who had risen and taken two or three hurried steps away and now returned as hurriedly  ill have it every penny  why thats brave cried isaac jumping up and slapping him on the shoulder and i respect you for having so much young blood left  ha ha ha  joe jowls half sorry he advised you now  weve got the laugh against him  ha ha ha  he gives me my revenge mind said the old man pointing to him eagerly with his shrivelled hand mindhe stakes coin against coin down to the last one in the box be there many or few  remember that  im witness returned isaac  ill see fair between you  i have passed my word said jowl with feigned reluctance and ill keep it  when does this match come off  i wish it was over tonight  i must have the money first said the old man and that ill have tomorrow  why not tonight urged jowl  its late now and i should be flushed and flurried said the old man  it must be softly done  no tomorrow night  then tomorrow be it said jowl  a drop of comfort here  luck to the best man  fill the gipsy produced three tin cups and filled them to the brim with brandy  the old man turned aside and muttered to himself before he drank  her own name struck upon the listeners ear coupled with some wish so fervent that he seemed to breathe it in an agony of supplication  god be merciful to us cried the child within herself and help us in this trying hour  what shall i do to save him  the remainder of their conversation was carried on in a lower tone of voice and was sufficiently concise relating merely to the execution of the project and the best precautions for diverting suspicion  the old man then shook hands with his tempters and withdrew  they watched his bowed and stooping figure as it retreated slowly and when he turned his head to look back which he often did waved their hands or shouted some brief encouragement  it was not until they had seen him gradually diminish into a mere speck upon the distant road that they turned to each other and ventured to laugh aloud  so said jowl warming his hands at the fire its done at last  he wanted more persuading than i expected  its three weeks ago since we first put this in his head  whatll he bring do you think  whatever he brings its halved between us returned isaac list  the other man nodded  we must make quick work of it he said and then cut his acquaintance or we may be suspected  sharps the word  list and the gipsy acquiesced  when they had all three amused themselves a little with their victims infatuation they dismissed the subject as one which had been sufficiently discussed and began to talk in a jargon which the child did not understand  as their discourse appeared to relate to matters in which they were warmly interested however she deemed it the best time for escaping unobserved and crept away with slow and cautious steps keeping in the shadow of the hedges or forcing a path through them or the dry ditches until she could emerge upon the road at a point beyond their range of vision  then she fled homeward as quickly as she could torn and bleeding from the wounds of thorns and briars but more lacerated in mind and threw herself upon her bed distracted  the first idea that flashed upon her mind was flight instant flight dragging him from that place and rather dying of want upon the roadside than ever exposing him again to such terrible temptations then she remembered that the crime was not to be committed until next night and there was the intermediate time for thinking and resolving what to do  then she was distracted with a horrible fear that he might be committing it at that moment with a dread of hearing shrieks and cries piercing the silence of the night with fearful thoughts of what he might be tempted and led on to do if he were detected in the act and had but a woman to struggle with  it was impossible to bear such torture  she stole to the room where the money was opened the door and looked in  god be praised  he was not there and she was sleeping soundly  she went back to her own room and tried to prepare herself for bed but who could sleepsleep who could lie passively down distracted by such terrors  they came upon her more and more strongly yet  half undressed and with her hair in wild disorder she flew to the old mans bedside clasped him by the wrist and roused him from his sleep  whats this he cried starting up in bed and fixing his eyes upon her spectral face  i have had a dreadful dream said the child with an energy that nothing but such terrors could have inspired  a dreadful horrible dream  i have had it once before  it is a dream of greyhaired men like you in darkened rooms by night robbing sleepers of their gold up up  the old man shook in every joint and folded his hands like one who prays  not to me said the child not to meto heaven to save us from such deeds  this dream is too real  i cannot sleep i cannot stay here i cannot leave you alone under the roof where such dreams come up  we must fly  he looked at her as if she were a spiritshe might have been for all the look of earth she hadand trembled more and more  there is no time to lose i will not lose one minute said the child up and away with me  tonight murmured the old man  yes tonight replied the child  tomorrow night will be too late the dream will have come again  nothing but flight can save us  up  the old man rose from his bed his forehead bedewed with the cold sweat of fear and bending before the child as if she had been an angel messenger sent to lead him where she would made ready to follow her she took him by the hand and led him on as they passed the door of the room he had proposed to rob she  shuddered and looked up into his face  what a white face was that and with what a look did he meet hers  she took him to her own chamber and still holding him by the hand as if she feared to lose him for an instant gathered together the little stock she had and hung her basket on her arm  the old man took his wallet from her hands and strapped it on his shouldershis staff too she had brought awayand then she led him forth  through the strait streets and narrow crooked outskirts their trembling feet passed quickly  up the steep hill too crowned by the old grey castle they toiled with rapid steps and had not once looked behind  but as they drew nearer the ruined walls the moon rose in all her gentle glory and from their venerable age garlanded with ivy moss and waving grass the child looked back upon the sleeping town deep in the valleys shade and on the faroff river with its winding track of light and on the distant hills and as she did so she clasped the hand she held less firmly and bursting into tears fell upon the old mans neck     chapter 43  her momentary weakness past the child again summoned the resolution which had until now sustained her and endeavouring to keep steadily in her view the one idea that they were flying from disgrace and crime and that her grandfathers preservation must depend solely on her firmness unaided by one word of advice or any helping hand urged him onward and looked back no more  while he subdued and abashed seemed to crouch before her and to shrink and cower down as if in the presence of some superior creature the child herself was sensible of a new feeling within her which elevated her nature and inspired her with an energy and confidence she had never known  there was no divided responsibility now the whole burden of their two lives had fallen upon her and henceforth she must think and act for both  i have saved him she thought  in all dangers and distresses i will remember that  at any other time the recollection of having deserted the friend who had shown them so much homely kindness without a word of justificationthe thought that they were guilty in appearance of treachery and ingratitudeeven the having parted from the two sisterswould have filled her with sorrow and regret  but now all other considerations were lost in the new uncertainties and anxieties of their wild and wandering life and the very desperation of their condition roused and stimulated her  in the pale moonlight which lent a wanness of its own to the delicate face where thoughtful care already mingled with the winning grace and loveliness of youth the too bright eye the spiritual head the lips that pressed each other with such high resolve and courage of the heart the slight figure firm in its bearing and yet so very weak told their silent tale but told it only to the wind that rustled by which taking up its burden carried perhaps to some mothers pillow faint dreams of childhood fading in its bloom and resting in the sleep that knows no waking  the night crept on apace the moon went down the stars grew pale and dim and morning cold as they slowly approached  then from behind a distant hill the noble sun rose up driving the mists in phantom shapes before it and clearing the earth of their ghostly forms till darkness came again  when it had climbed higher into the sky and there was warmth in its cheerful beams they laid them down to sleep upon a bank hard by some water  but nell retained her grasp upon the old mans arm and long after he was slumbering soundly watched him with untiring eyes  fatigue stole over her at last her grasp relaxed tightened relaxed again and they slept side by side  a confused sound of voices mingling with her dreams awoke her  a man of very uncouth and rough appearance was standing over them and two of his companions were looking on from a long heavy boat which had come close to the bank while they were sleeping  the boat had neither oar nor sail but was towed by a couple of horses who with the rope to which they were harnessed slack and dripping in the water were resting on the path  holloa said the man roughly  whats the matter here  we were only asleep sir said nell  we have been walking all night  a pair of queer travellers to be walking all night observed the man who had first accosted them  one of you is a trifle too old for that sort of work and the other a trifle too young  where are you going  nell faltered and pointed at hazard towards the west upon which the man inquired if she meant a certain town which he named  nell to avoid more questioning said yes that was the place  where have you come from was the next question and this being an easier one to answer nell mentioned the name of the village in which their friend the schoolmaster dwelt as being less likely to be known to the men or to provoke further inquiry  i thought somebody had been robbing and illusing you might be said the man  thats all  good day  returning his salute and feeling greatly relieved by his departure nell looked after him as he mounted one of the horses and the boat went on  it had not gone very far when it stopped again and she saw the men beckoning to her  did you call to me said nell running up to them  you may go with us if you like replied one of those in the boat were going to the same place  the child hesitated for a moment  thinking as she had thought with great trepidation more than once before that the men whom she had seen with her grandfather might perhaps in their eagerness for the booty follow them and regaining their influence over him set hers at nought and that if they went with these men all traces of them must surely be lost at that spot determined to accept the offer  the boat came close to the bank again and before she had had any more time for consideration she and her grandfather were on board and gliding smoothly down the canal  the sun shone pleasantly on the bright water which was sometimes shaded by trees and sometimes open to a wide extent of country intersected by running streams and rich with wooded hills cultivated land and sheltered farms  now and then a village with its modest spire thatched roofs and gableends would peep out from among the trees and more than once a distant town with great church towers looming through its smoke and high factories or workshops rising above the mass of houses would come in view and by the length of time it lingered in the distance show them how slowly they travelled  their way lay for the most part through the low grounds and open plains and except these distant places and occasionally some men working in the fields or lounging on the bridges under which they passed to see them creep along nothing encroached on their monotonous and secluded track  nell was rather disheartened when they stopped at a kind of wharf late in the afternoon to learn from one of the men that they would not reach their place of destination until next day and that if she had no provision with her she had better buy it there  she had but a few pence having already bargained with them for some bread but even of these it was necessary to be very careful as they were on their way to an utterly strange place with no resource whatever  a small loaf and a morsel of cheese therefore were all she could afford and with these she took her place in the boat again and after half an hours delay during which the men were drinking at the publichouse proceeded on the journey  they brought some beer and spirits into the boat with them and what with drinking freely before and again now were soon in a fair way of being quarrelsome and intoxicated  avoiding the small cabin therefore which was very dark and filthy and to which they often invited both her and her grandfather nell sat in the open air with the old man by her side listening to their boisterous hosts with a palpitating heart and almost wishing herself safe on shore again though she should have to walk all night  they were in truth very rugged noisy fellows and quite brutal among themselves though civil enough to their two passengers  thus when a quarrel arose between the man who was steering and his friend in the cabin upon the question who had first suggested the propriety of offering nell some beer and when the quarrel led to a scuffle in which they beat each other fearfully to her inexpressible terror neither visited his displeasure upon her but each contented himself with venting it on his adversary on whom in addition to blows he bestowed a variety of compliments which happily for the child were conveyed in terms to her quite unintelligible  the difference was finally adjusted by the man who had come out of the cabin knocking the other into it head first and taking the helm into his own hands without evincing the least discomposure himself or causing any in his friend who being of a tolerably strong constitution and perfectly inured to such trifles went to sleep as he was with his heels upwards and in a couple of minutes or so was snoring comfortably  by this time it was night again and though the child felt cold being but poorly clad her anxious thoughts were far removed from her own suffering or uneasiness and busily engaged in endeavouring to devise some scheme for their joint subsistence  the same spirit which had supported her on the previous night upheld and sustained her now  her grandfather lay sleeping safely at her side and the crime to which his madness urged him was not committed  that was her comfort  how every circumstance of her short eventful life came thronging into her mind as they travelled on  slight incidents never thought of or remembered until now faces seen once and ever since forgotten words scarcely heeded at the time scenes of a year ago and those of yesterday mixing up and linking themselves together familiar places shaping themselves out in the darkness from things which when approached were of all others the most remote and most unlike them sometimes a strange confusion in her mind relative to the occasion of her being there and the place to which she was going and the people she was with and imagination suggesting remarks and questions which sounded so plainly in her ears that she would start and turn and be almost tempted to replyall the fancies and contradictions common in watching and excitement and restless change of place beset the child  she happened while she was thus engaged to encounter the face of the man on deck in whom the sentimental stage of drunkenness had now succeeded to the boisterous and who taking from his mouth a short pipe quilted over with string for its longer preservation requested that she would oblige him with a song  youve got a very pretty voice a very soft eye and a very strong memory said this gentleman the voice and eye ive got evidence for and the memorys an opinion of my own  and im never wrong  let me hear a song this minute  i dont think i know one sir returned nell  you know fortyseven songs said the man with a gravity which admitted of no altercation on the subject  fortysevens your number let me hear one of emthe best  give me a song this minute  not knowing what might be the consequences of irritating her friend and trembling with the fear of doing so poor nell sang him some little ditty which she had learned in happier times and which was so agreeable to his ear that on its conclusion he in the same peremptory manner requested to be favoured with another to which he was so obliging as to roar a chorus to no particular tune and with no words at all but which amply made up in its amazing energy for its deficiency in other respects  the noise of this vocal performance awakened the other man who staggering upon deck and shaking his late opponent by the hand swore that singing was his pride and joy and chief delight and that he desired no better entertainment  with a third call more imperative than either of the two former nell felt obliged to comply and this time a chorus was maintained not only by the two men together but also by the third man on horseback who being by his position debarred from a nearer participation in the revels of the night roared when his companions roared and rent the very air in this way with little cessation and singing the same songs again and again the tired and exhausted child kept them in good humour all that night and many a cottager who was roused from his soundest sleep by the discordant chorus as it floated away upon the wind hid his head beneath the bedclothes and trembled at the sounds  at length the morning dawned  it was no sooner light than it began to rain heavily  as the child could not endure the intolerable vapours of the cabin they covered her in return for her exertions with some pieces of sailcloth and ends of tarpaulin which sufficed to keep her tolerably dry and to shelter her grandfather besides  as the day advanced the rain increased  at noon it poured down more hopelessly and heavily than ever without the faintest promise of abatement  they had for some time been gradually approaching the place for which they were bound  the water had become thicker and dirtier other barges coming from it passed them frequently the paths of coalash and huts of staring brick marked the vicinity of some great manufacturing town while scattered streets and houses and smoke from distant furnaces indicated that they were already in the outskirts now the clustered roofs and piles of buildings trembling with the working of engines and dimly resounding with their shrieks and throbbings the tall chimneys vomiting forth a black vapour which hung in a dense illfavoured cloud above the housetops and filled the air with gloom the clank of hammers beating upon iron the roar of busy streets and noisy crowds gradually augmenting until all the various sounds blended into one and none was distinguishable for itself announced the termination of their journey  the boat floated into the wharf to which it belonged  the men were occupied directly  the child and her grandfather after waiting in vain to thank them or ask them whither they should go passed through a dirty lane into a crowded street and stood amid its din and tumult and in the pouring rain as strange bewildered and confused as if they had lived a thousand years before and were raised from the dead and placed there by a miracle     chapter 44  the throng of people hurried by in two opposite streams with no symptom of cessation or exhaustion intent upon their own affairs and undisturbed in their business speculations by the roar of carts and waggons laden with clashing wares the slipping of horses feet upon the wet and greasy pavement the rattling of the rain on windows and umbrellatops the jostling of the more impatient passengers and all the noise and tumult of a crowded street in the high tide of its occupation while the two poor strangers stunned and bewildered by the hurry they beheld but had no part in looked mournfully on feeling amidst the crowd a solitude which has no parallel but in the thirst of the shipwrecked mariner who tost to and fro upon the billows of a mighty ocean his red eyes blinded by looking on the water which hems him in on every side has not one drop to cool his burning tongue  they withdrew into a low archway for shelter from the rain and watched the faces of those who passed to find in one among them a ray of encouragement or hope  some frowned some smiled some muttered to themselves some made slight gestures as if anticipating the conversation in which they would shortly be engaged some wore the cunning look of bargaining and plotting some were anxious and eager some slow and dull in some countenances were written gain in others loss  it was like being in the confidence of all these people to stand quietly there looking into their faces as they flitted past  in busy places where each man has an object of his own and feels assured that every other man has his his character and purpose are written broadly in his face  in the public walks and lounges of a town people go to see and to be seen and there the same expression with little variety is repeated a hundred times  the workingday faces come nearer to the truth and let it out more plainly  falling into that kind of abstraction which such a solitude awakens the child continued to gaze upon the passing crowd with a wondering interest amounting almost to a temporary forgetfulness of her own condition  but cold wet hunger want of rest and lack of any place in which to lay her aching head soon brought her thoughts back to the point whence they had strayed  no one passed who seemed to notice them or to whom she durst appeal  after some time they left their place of refuge from the weather and mingled with the concourse  evening came on  they were still wandering up and down with fewer people about them but with the same sense of solitude in their own breasts and the same indifference from all around  the lights in the streets and shops made them feel yet more desolate for with their help night and darkness seemed to come on faster  shivering with the cold and damp ill in body and sick to death at heart the child needed her utmost firmness and resolution even to creep along  why had they ever come to this noisy town when there were peaceful country places in which at least they might have hungered and thirsted with less suffering than in its squalid strife  they were but an atom here in a mountain heap of misery the very sight of which increased their hopelessness and suffering  the child had not only to endure the accumulated hardships of their destitute condition but to bear the reproaches of her grandfather who began to murmur at having been led away from their late abode and demand that they should return to it  being now penniless and no relief or prospect of relief appearing they retraced their steps through the deserted streets and went back to the wharf hoping to find the boat in which they had come and to be allowed to sleep on board that night  but here again they were disappointed for the gate was closed and some fierce dogs barking at their approach obliged them to retreat  we must sleep in the open air tonight dear said the child in a weak voice as they turned away from this last repulse and tomorrow we will beg our way to some quiet part of the country and try to earn our bread in very humble work  why did you bring me here returned the old man fiercely  i cannot bear these close eternal streets  we came from a quiet part  why did you force me to leave it  because i must have that dream i told you of no more said the child with a momentary firmness that lost itself in tears and we must live among poor people or it will come again  dear grandfather you are old and weak i know but look at me  i never will complain if you will not but i have some suffering indeed  ah poor houseless wandering motherless child cried the old man clasping his hands and gazing as if for the first time upon her anxious face her travelstained dress and bruised and swollen feet has all my agony of care brought her to this at last  was i a happy man once and have i lost happiness and all i had for this  if we were in the country now said the child with assumed cheerfulness as they walked on looking about them for a shelter we should find some good old tree stretching out his green arms as if he loved us and nodding and rustling as if he would have us fall asleep thinking of him while he watched  please god we shall be there soontomorrow or next day at the farthestand in the meantime let us think dear that it was a good thing we came here for we are lost in the crowd and hurry of this place and if any cruel people should pursue us they could surely never trace us further  theres comfort in that  and heres a deep old doorwayvery dark but quite dry and warm too for the wind dont blow in herewhats that  uttering a half shriek she recoiled from a black figure which came suddenly out of the dark recess in which they were about to take refuge and stood still looking at them  speak again it said do i know the voice  no replied the child timidly we are strangers and having no money for a nights lodging were going to rest here  there was a feeble lamp at no great distance the only one in the place which was a kind of square yard but sufficient to show how poor and mean it was  to this the figure beckoned them at the same time drawing within its rays as if to show that it had no desire to conceal itself or take them at an advantage  the form was that of a man miserably clad and begrimed with smoke which perhaps by its contrast with the natural colour of his skin made him look paler than he really was  that he was naturally of a very wan and pallid aspect however his hollow cheeks sharp features and sunken eyes no less than a certain look of patient endurance sufficiently testified  his voice was harsh by nature but not brutal and though his face besides possessing the characteristics already mentioned was overshadowed by a quantity of long dark hair its expression was neither ferocious nor bad  how came you to think of resting there he said  or how he added looking more attentively at the child do you come to want a place of rest at this time of night  our misfortunes the grandfather answered are the cause  do you know said the man looking still more earnestly at nell how wet she is and that the damp streets are not a place for her  i know it well god help me he replied  what can i do  the man looked at nell again and gently touched her garments from which the rain was running off in little streams  i can give you warmth he said after a pause nothing else  such lodging as i have is in that house pointing to the doorway from which he had emerged but she is safer and better there than here  the fire is in a rough place but you can pass the night beside it safely if youll trust yourselves to me  you see that red light yonder  they raised their eyes and saw a lurid glare hanging in the dark sky the dull reflection of some distant fire  its not far said the man  shall i take you there  you were going to sleep upon cold bricks i can give you a bed of warm ashesnothing better  without waiting for any further reply than he saw in their looks he took nell in his arms and bade the old man follow  carrying her as tenderly and as easily too as if she had been an infant and showing himself both swift and sure of foot he led the way through what appeared to be the poorest and most wretched quarter of the town and turning aside to avoid the overflowing kennels or running waterspouts but holding his course regardless of such obstructions and making his way straight through them  they had proceeded thus in silence for some quarter of an hour and had lost sight of the glare to which he had pointed in the dark and narrow ways by which they had come when it suddenly burst upon them again streaming up from the high chimney of a building close before them  this is the place he said pausing at a door to put nell down and take her hand  dont be afraid  theres nobody here will harm you  it needed a strong confidence in this assurance to induce them to enter and what they saw inside did not diminish their apprehension and alarm  in a large and lofty building supported by pillars of iron with great black apertures in the upper walls open to the external air echoing to the roof with the beating of hammers and roar of furnaces mingled with the hissing of redhot metal plunged in water and a hundred strange unearthly noises never heard elsewhere in this gloomy place moving like demons among the flame and smoke dimly and fitfully seen flushed and tormented by the burning fires and wielding great weapons a faulty blow from any one of which must have crushed some workmans skull a number of men laboured like giants  others reposing upon heaps of coals or ashes with their faces turned to the black vault above slept or rested from their toil  others again opening the whitehot furnacedoors cast fuel on the flames which came rushing and roaring forth to meet it and licked it up like oil others drew forth with clashing noise upon the ground great sheets of glowing steel emitting an insupportable heat and a dull deep light like that which reddens in the eyes of savage beasts  through these bewildering sights and deafening sounds their conductor led them to where in a dark portion of the building one furnace burnt by night and dayso at least they gathered from the motion of his lips for as yet they could only see him speak not hear him  the man who had been watching this fire and whose task was ended for the present gladly withdrew and left them with their friend who spreading nells little cloak upon a heap of ashes and showing her where she could hang her outerclothes to dry signed to her and the old man to lie down and sleep  for himself he took his station on a rugged mat before the furnacedoor and resting his chin upon his hands watched the flame as it shone through the iron chinks and the white ashes as they fell into their bright hot grave below  the warmth of her bed hard and humble as it was combined with the great fatigue she had undergone soon caused the tumult of the place to fall with a gentler sound upon the childs tired ears and was not long in lulling her to sleep  the old man was stretched beside her and with her hand upon his neck she lay and dreamed  it was yet night when she awoke nor did she know how long or for how short a time she had slept  but she found herself protected both from any cold air that might find its way into the building and from the scorching heat by some of the workmens clothes and glancing at their friend saw that he sat in exactly the same attitude looking with a fixed earnestness of attention towards the fire and keeping so very still that he did not even seem to breathe  she lay in the state between sleeping and waking looking so long at his motionless figure that at length she almost feared he had died as he sat there and softly rising and drawing close to him ventured to whisper in his ear  he moved and glancing from her to the place she had lately occupied as if to assure himself that it was really the child so near him looked inquiringly into her face  i feared you were ill she said  the other men are all in motion and you are so very quiet  they leave me to myself he replied  they know my humour  they laugh at me but dont harm me in it  see yonder therethats my friend  the fire said the child  it has been alive as long as i have the man made answer  we talk and think together all night long  the child glanced quickly at him in her surprise but he had turned his eyes in their former direction and was musing as before  its like a book to me he saidthe only book i ever learned to read and many an old story it tells me  its music for i should know its voice among a thousand and there are other voices in its roar  it has its pictures too  you dont know how many strange faces and different scenes i trace in the redhot coals  its my memory that fire and shows me all my life  the child bending down to listen to his words could not help remarking with what brightened eyes he continued to speak and muse  yes he said with a faint smile it was the same when i was quite a baby and crawled about it till i fell asleep  my father watched it then  had you no mother asked the child  no she was dead  women work hard in these parts  she worked herself to death they told me and as they said so then the fire has gone on saying the same thing ever since  i suppose it was true  i have always believed it  were you brought up here then said the child  summer and winter he replied  secretly at first but when they found it out they let him keep me here  so the fire nursed methe same fire  it has never gone out  you are fond of it said the child  of course i am  he died before it  i saw him fall downjust there where those ashes are burning nowand wondered i remember why it didnt help him  have you been here ever since asked the child  ever since i came to watch it but there was a while between and a very cold dreary while it was  it burned all the time though and roared and leaped when i came back as it used to do in our play days you may guess from looking at me what kind of child i was but for all the difference between us i was a child and when i saw you in the street tonight you put me in mind of myself as i was after he died and made me wish to bring you to the fire  i thought of those old times again when i saw you sleeping by it  you should be sleeping now  lie down again poor child lie down again  with that he led her to her rude couch and covering her with the clothes with which she had found herself enveloped when she woke returned to his seat whence he moved no more unless to feed the furnace but remained motionless as a statue  the child continued to watch him for a little time but soon yielded to the drowsiness that came upon her and in the dark strange place and on the heap of ashes slept as peacefully as if the room had been a palace chamber and the bed a bed of down  when she awoke again broad day was shining through the lofty openings in the walls and stealing in slanting rays but midway down seemed to make the building darker than it had been at night  the clang and tumult were still going on and the remorseless fires were burning fiercely as before for few changes of night and day brought rest or quiet there  her friend parted his breakfasta scanty mess of coffee and some coarse breadwith the child and her grandfather and inquired whither they were going  she told him that they sought some distant country place remote from towns or even other villages and with a faltering tongue inquired what road they would do best to take  i know little of the country he said shaking his head for such as i pass all our lives before our furnace doors and seldom go forth to breathe  but there are such places yonder  and far from here said nell  aye surely  how could they be near us and be green and fresh  the road lies too through miles and miles all lighted up by fires like oursa strange black road and one that would frighten you by night  we are here and must go on said the child boldly for she saw that the old man listened with anxious ears to this account  rough peoplepaths never made for little feet like yoursa dismal blighted wayis there no turning back my child  there is none cried nell pressing forward  if you can direct us do  if not pray do not seek to turn us from our purpose  indeed you do not know the danger that we shun and how right and true we are in flying from it or you would not try to stop us i am sure you would not  god forbid if it is so said their uncouth protector glancing from the eager child to her grandfather who hung his head and bent his eyes upon the ground  ill direct you from the door the best i can  i wish i could do more  he showed them then by which road they must leave the town and what course they should hold when they had gained it  he lingered so long on these instructions that the child with a fervent blessing tore herself away and stayed to hear no more  but before they had reached the corner of the lane the man came running after them and pressing her hand left something in ittwo old battered smokeencrusted penny pieces  who knows but they shone as brightly in the eyes of angels as golden gifts that have been chronicled on tombs  and thus they separated the child to lead her sacred charge farther from guilt and shame the labourer to attach a fresh interest to the spot where his guests had slept and read new histories in his furnace fire     chapter 45  in all their journeying they had never longed so ardently they had never so pined and wearied for the freedom of pure air and open country as now  no not even on that memorable morning when deserting their old home they abandoned themselves to the mercies of a strange world and left all the dumb and senseless things they had known and loved behindnot even then had they so yearned for the fresh solitudes of wood hillside and field as now when the noise and dirt and vapour of the great manufacturing town reeking with lean misery and hungry wretchedness hemmed them in on every side and seemed to shut out hope and render escape impossible  two days and nights thought the child  he said two days and nights we should have to spend among such scenes as these  oh if we live to reach the country once again if we get clear of these dreadful places though it is only to lie down and die with what a grateful heart i shall thank god for so much mercy  with thoughts like this and with some vague design of travelling to a great distance among streams and mountains where only very poor and simple people lived and where they might maintain themselves by very humble helping work in farms free from such terrors as that from which they fledthe child with no resource but the poor mans gift and no encouragement but that which flowed from her own heart and its sense of the truth and right of what she did nerved herself to this last journey and boldly pursued her task  we shall be very slow today dear she said as they toiled painfully through the streets my feet are sore and i have pains in all my limbs from the wet of yesterday  i saw that he looked at us and thought of that when he said how long we should be upon the road  it was a dreary way he told us of returned her grandfather piteously  is there no other road  will you not let me go some other way than this  places lie beyond these said the child firmly where we may live in peace and be tempted to do no harm  we will take the road that promises to have that end and we would not turn out of it if it were a hundred times worse than our fears lead us to expect  we would not dear would we  no replied the old man wavering in his voice no less than in his manner  no  let us go on  i am ready  i am quite ready nell  the child walked with more difficulty than she had led her companion to expect for the pains that racked her joints were of no common severity and every exertion increased them  but they wrung from her no complaint or look of suffering and though the two travellers proceeded very slowly they did proceed  clearing the town in course of time they began to feel that they were fairly on their way  a long suburb of red brick housessome with patches of gardenground where coaldust and factory smoke darkened the shrinking leaves and coarse rank flowers and where the struggling vegetation sickened and sank under the hot breath of kiln and furnace making them by its presence seem yet more blighting and unwholesome than in the town itselfa long flat straggling suburb passed they came by slow degrees upon a cheerless region where not a blade of grass was seen to grow where not a bud put forth its promise in the spring where nothing green could live but on the surface of the stagnant pools which here and there lay idly sweltering by the black roadside  advancing more and more into the shadow of this mournful place its dark depressing influence stole upon their spirits and filled them with a dismal gloom  on every side and far as the eye could see into the heavy distance tall chimneys crowding on each other and presenting that endless repetition of the same dull ugly form which is the horror of oppressive dreams poured out their plague of smoke obscured the light and made foul the melancholy air  on mounds of ashes by the wayside sheltered only by a few rough boards or rotten penthouse roofs strange engines spun and writhed like tortured creatures clanking their iron chains shrieking in their rapid whirl from time to time as though in torment unendurable and making the ground tremble with their agonies  dismantled houses here and there appeared tottering to the earth propped up by fragments of others that had fallen down unroofed windowless blackened desolate but yet inhabited  men women children wan in their looks and ragged in attire tended the engines fed their tributary fire begged upon the road or scowled halfnaked from the doorless houses  then came more of the wrathful monsters whose like they almost seemed to be in their wildness and their untamed air screeching and turning round and round again and still before behind and to the right and left was the same interminable perspective of brick towers never ceasing in their black vomit blasting all things living or inanimate shutting out the face of day and closing in on all these horrors with a dense dark cloud  but nighttime in this dreadful spotnight when the smoke was changed to fire when every chimney spirited up its flame and places that had been dark vaults all day now shone redhot with figures moving to and fro within their blazing jaws and calling to one another with hoarse criesnight when the noise of every strange machine was aggravated by the darkness when the people near them looked wilder and more savage when bands of unemployed labourers paraded the roads or clustered by torchlight round their leaders who told them in stern language of their wrongs and urged them on to frightful cries and threats when maddened men armed with sword and firebrand spurning the tears and prayers of women who would restrain them rushed forth on errands of terror and destruction to work no ruin half so surely as their ownnight when carts came rumbling by filled with rude coffins for contagious disease and death had been busy with the living crops when orphans cried and distracted women shrieked and followed in their wakenight when some called for bread and some for drink to drown their cares and some with tears and some with staggering feet and some with bloodshot eyes went brooding homenight which unlike the night that heaven sends on earth brought with it no peace nor quiet nor signs of blessed sleepwho shall tell the terrors of the night to the young wandering child  and yet she lay down with nothing between her and the sky and with no fear for herself for she was past it now put up a prayer for the poor old man  so very weak and spent she felt so very calm and unresisting that she had no thought of any wants of her own but prayed that god would raise up some friend for him  she tried to recall the way they had come and to look in the direction where the fire by which they had slept last night was burning  she had forgotten to ask the name of the poor man their friend and when she had remembered him in her prayers it seemed ungrateful not to turn one look towards the spot where he was watching  a penny loaf was all they had had that day  it was very little but even hunger was forgotten in the strange tranquillity that crept over her senses  she lay down very gently and with a quiet smile upon her face fell into a slumber  it was not like sleepand yet it must have been or why those pleasant dreams of the little scholar all night long  morning came  much weaker diminished powers even of sight and hearing and yet the child made no complaintperhaps would have made none even if she had not had that inducement to be silent travelling by her side  she felt a hopelessness of their ever being extricated together from that forlorn place a dull conviction that she was very ill perhaps dying but no fear or anxiety  a loathing of food that she was not conscious of until they expended their last penny in the purchase of another loaf prevented her partaking even of this poor repast  her grandfather ate greedily which she was glad to see  their way lay through the same scenes as yesterday with no variety or improvement  there was the same thick air difficult to breathe the same blighted ground the same hopeless prospect the same misery and distress  objects appeared more dim the noise less the path more rugged and uneven for sometimes she stumbled and became roused as it were in the effort to prevent herself from falling  poor child the cause was in her tottering feet  towards the afternoon her grandfather complained bitterly of hunger she approached one of the wretched hovels by the wayside and knocked with her hand upon the door  what would you have here said a gaunt man opening it  charity  a morsel of bread  do you see that returned the man hoarsely pointing to a kind of bundle on the ground  thats a dead child  i and five hundred other men were thrown out of work three months ago  that is my third dead child and last  do you think i have charity to bestow or a morsel of bread to spare  the child recoiled from the door and it closed upon her  impelled by strong necessity she knocked at another a neighbouring one which yielding to the slight pressure of her hand flew open  it seemed that a couple of poor families lived in this hovel for two women each among children of her own occupied different portions of the room  in the centre stood a grave gentleman in black who appeared to have just entered and who held by the arm a boy  here woman he said heres your deaf and dumb son  you may thank me for restoring him to you  he was brought before me this morning charged with theft and with any other boy it would have gone hard i assure you  but as i had compassion on his infirmities and thought he might have learnt no better i have managed to bring him back to you  take more care of him for the future  and wont you give me back my son said the other woman hastily rising and confronting him  wont you give me back my son sir who was transported for the same offence  was he deaf and dumb woman asked the gentleman sternly  was he not sir  you know he was not  he was cried the woman  he was deaf dumb and blind to all that was good and right from his cradle  her boy may have learnt no better where did mine learn better  where could he  who was there to teach him better or where was it to be learnt  peace woman said the gentleman your boy was in possession of all his senses  he was cried the mother and he was the more easy to be led astray because he had them  if you save this boy because he may not know right from wrong why did you not save mine who was never taught the difference  you gentlemen have as good a right to punish her boy that god has kept in ignorance of sound and speech as you have to punish mine that you kept in ignorance yourselves  how many of the girls and boysah men and women toothat are brought before you and you dont pity are deaf and dumb in their minds and go wrong in that state and are punished in that state body and soul while you gentlemen are quarrelling among yourselves whether they ought to learn this or thatbe a just man sir and give me back my son  you are desperate said the gentleman taking out his snuffbox and i am sorry for you  i am desperate returned the woman and you have made me so  give me back my son to work for these helpless children  be a just man sir and as you have had mercy upon this boy give me back my son  the child had seen and heard enough to know that this was not a place at which to ask for alms  she led the old man softly from the door and they pursued their journey  with less and less of hope or strength as they went on but with an undiminished resolution not to betray by any word or sigh her sinking state so long as she had energy to move the child throughout the remainder of that hard day compelled herself to proceed not even stopping to rest as frequently as usual to compensate in some measure for the tardy pace at which she was obliged to walk  evening was drawing on but had not closed in whenstill travelling among the same dismal objectsthey came to a busy town  faint and spiritless as they were its streets were insupportable after humbly asking for relief at some few doors and being repulsed they agreed to make their way out of it as speedily as they could and try if the inmates of any lone house beyond would have more pity on their exhausted state  they were dragging themselves along through the last street and the child felt that the time was close at hand when her enfeebled powers would bear no more  there appeared before them at this juncture going in the same direction as themselves a traveller on foot who with a portmanteau strapped to his back leaned upon a stout stick as he walked and read from a book which he held in his other hand  it was not an easy matter to come up with him and beseech his aid for he walked fast and was a little distance in advance  at length he stopped to look more attentively at some passage in his book animated with a ray of hope the child shot on before her grandfather and going close to the stranger without rousing him by the sound of her footsteps began in a few faint words to implore his help  he turned his head  the child clapped her hands together uttered a wild shriek and fell senseless at his feet     chapter 46  it was the poor schoolmaster  no other than the poor schoolmaster scarcely less moved and surprised by the sight of the child than she had been on recognising him he stood for a moment silent and confounded by this unexpected apparition without even the presence of mind to raise her from the ground  but quickly recovering his selfpossession he threw down his stick and book and dropping on one knee beside her endeavoured by such simple means as occurred to him to restore her to herself while her grandfather standing idly by wrung his hands and implored her with many endearing expressions to speak to him were it only a word  she is quite exhausted said the schoolmaster glancing upward into his face  you have taxed her powers too far friend  she is perishing of want rejoined the old man  i never thought how weak and ill she was till now  casting a look upon him halfreproachful and halfcompassionate the schoolmaster took the child in his arms and bidding the old man gather up her little basket and follow him directly bore her away at his utmost speed  there was a small inn within sight to which it would seem he had been directing his steps when so unexpectedly overtaken  towards this place he hurried with his unconscious burden and rushing into the kitchen and calling upon the company there assembled to make way for gods sake deposited it on a chair before the fire  the company who rose in confusion on the schoolmasters entrance did as people usually do under such circumstances  everybody called for his or her favourite remedy which nobody brought each cried for more air at the same time carefully excluding what air there was by closing round the object of sympathy and all wondered why somebody else didnt do what it never appeared to occur to them might be done by themselves  the landlady however who possessed more readiness and activity than any of them and who had withal a quicker perception of the merits of the case soon came running in with a little hot brandy and water followed by her servantgirl carrying vinegar hartshorn smellingsalts and such other restoratives which being duly administered recovered the child so far as to enable her to thank them in a faint voice and to extend her hand to the poor schoolmaster who stood with an anxious face hard by  without suffering her to speak another word or so much as to stir a finger any more the women straightway carried her off to bed and having covered her up warm bathed her cold feet and wrapped them in flannel they despatched a messenger for the doctor  the doctor who was a rednosed gentleman with a great bunch of seals dangling below a waistcoat of ribbed black satin arrived with all speed and taking his seat by the bedside of poor nell drew out his watch and felt her pulse  then he looked at her tongue then he felt her pulse again and while he did so he eyed the halfemptied wineglass as if in profound abstraction  i should give her said the doctor at length a teaspoonful every now and then of hot brandy and water  why thats exactly what weve done sir said the delighted landlady  i should also observed the doctor who had passed the footbath on the stairs i should also said the doctor in the voice of an oracle put her feet in hot water and wrap them up in flannel  i should likewise said the doctor with increased solemnity give her something light for supperthe wing of a roasted fowl now  why goodness gracious me sir its cooking at the kitchen fire this instant cried the landlady  and so indeed it was for the schoolmaster had ordered it to be put down and it was getting on so well that the doctor might have smelt it if he had tried perhaps he did  you may then said the doctor rising gravely give her a glass of hot mulled port wine if she likes wine  and a toast sir suggested the landlady  ay said the doctor in the tone of a man who makes a dignified concession  and a toastof bread  but be very particular to make it of bread if you please maam  with which parting injunction slowly and portentously delivered the doctor departed leaving the whole house in admiration of that wisdom which tallied so closely with their own  everybody said he was a very shrewd doctor indeed and knew perfectly what peoples constitutions were which there appears some reason to suppose he did  while her supper was preparing the child fell into a refreshing sleep from which they were obliged to rouse her when it was ready  as she evinced extraordinary uneasiness on learning that her grandfather was below stairs and as she was greatly troubled at the thought of their being apart he took his supper with her  finding her still very restless on this head they made him up a bed in an inner room to which he presently retired  the key of this chamber happened by good fortune to be on that side of the door which was in nells room she turned it on him when the landlady had withdrawn and crept to bed again with a thankful heart  the schoolmaster sat for a long time smoking his pipe by the kitchen fire which was now deserted thinking with a very happy face on the fortunate chance which had brought him so opportunely to the childs assistance and parrying as well as in his simple way he could the inquisitive crossexamination of the landlady who had a great curiosity to be made acquainted with every particular of nells life and history  the poor schoolmaster was so openhearted and so little versed in the most ordinary cunning or deceit that she could not have failed to succeed in the first five minutes but that he happened to be unacquainted with what she wished to know and so he told her  the landlady by no means satisfied with this assurance which she considered an ingenious evasion of the question rejoined that he had his reasons of course  heaven forbid that she should wish to pry into the affairs of her customers which indeed were no business of hers who had so many of her own  she had merely asked a civil question and to be sure she knew it would meet with a civil answer  she was quite satisfiedquite  she had rather perhaps that he would have said at once that he didnt choose to be communicative because that would have been plain and intelligible  however she had no right to be offended of course  he was the best judge and had a perfect right to say what he pleased nobody could dispute that for a moment  oh dear no  i assure you my good lady said the mild schoolmaster that i have told you the plain truth  as i hope to be saved i have told you the truth  why then i do believe you are in earnest rejoined the landlady with ready goodhumour and im very sorry i have teazed you  but curiosity you know is the curse of our sex and thats the fact the landlord scratched his head as if he thought the curse sometimes involved the other sex likewise but he was prevented from making any remark to that effect if he had it in contemplation to do so by the schoolmasters rejoinder  you should question me for halfadozen hours at a sitting and welcome and i would answer you patiently for the kindness of heart you have shown tonight if i could he said  as it is please to take care of her in the morning and let me know early how she is and to understand that i am paymaster for the three  so parting with them on most friendly terms not the less cordial perhaps for this last direction the schoolmaster went to his bed and the host and hostess to theirs  the report in the morning was that the child was better but was extremely weak and would at least require a days rest and careful nursing before she could proceed upon her journey  the schoolmaster received this communication with perfect cheerfulness observing that he had a day to sparetwo days for that matterand could very well afford to wait  as the patient was to sit up in the evening he appointed to visit her in her room at a certain hour and rambling out with his book did not return until the hour arrived  nell could not help weeping when they were left alone whereat and at sight of her pale face and wasted figure the simple schoolmaster shed a few tears himself at the same time showing in very energetic language how foolish it was to do so and how very easily it could be avoided if one tried  it makes me unhappy even in the midst of all this kindness said the child to think that we should be a burden upon you  how can i ever thank you  if i had not met you so far from home i must have died and he would have been left alone  well not talk about dying said the schoolmaster and as to burdens i have made my fortune since you slept at my cottage  indeed cried the child joyfully  oh yes returned her friend  i have been appointed clerk and schoolmaster to a village a long way from hereand a long way from the old one as you may supposeat fiveandthirty pounds a year fiveandthirty pounds  i am very glad said the child so very very glad  i am on my way there now resumed the schoolmaster  they allowed me the stagecoachhireoutside stagecoachhire all the way  bless you they grudge me nothing  but as the time at which i am expected there left me ample leisure i determined to walk instead  how glad i am to think i did so  how glad should we be  yes yes said the schoolmaster moving restlessly in his chair certainly thats very true  but youwhere are you going where are you coming from what have you been doing since you left me what had you been doing before  now tell medo tell me  i know very little of the world and perhaps you are better fitted to advise me in its affairs than i am qualified to give advice to you but i am very sincere and i have a reason you have not forgotten it for loving you  i have felt since that time as if my love for him who died had been transferred to you who stood beside his bed  if this he added looking upwards is the beautiful creation that springs from ashes let its peace prosper with me as i deal tenderly and compassionately by this young child  the plain frank kindness of the honest schoolmaster the affectionate earnestness of his speech and manner the truth which was stamped upon his every word and look gave the child a confidence in him which the utmost arts of treachery and dissimulation could never have awakened in her breast  she told him allthat they had no friend or relativethat she had fled with the old man to save him from a madhouse and all the miseries he dreadedthat she was flying now to save him from himselfand that she sought an asylum in some remote and primitive place where the temptation before which he fell would never enter and her late sorrows and distresses could have no place  the schoolmaster heard her with astonishment  this childhe thoughthas this child heroically persevered under all doubts and dangers struggled with poverty and suffering upheld and sustained by strong affection and the consciousness of rectitude alone  and yet the world is full of such heroism  have i yet to learn that the hardest and bestborne trials are those which are never chronicled in any earthly record and are suffered every day  and should i be surprised to hear the story of this child  what more he thought or said matters not  it was concluded that nell and her grandfather should accompany him to the village whither he was bound and that he should endeavour to find them some humble occupation by which they could subsist  we shall be sure to succeed said the schoolmaster heartily  the cause is too good a one to fail  they arranged to proceed upon their journey next evening as a stagewaggon which travelled for some distance on the same road as they must take would stop at the inn to change horses and the driver for a small gratuity would give nell a place inside  a bargain was soon struck when the waggon came and in due time it rolled away with the child comfortably bestowed among the softer packages her grandfather and the schoolmaster walking on beside the driver and the landlady and all the good folks of the inn screaming out their good wishes and farewells  what a soothing luxurious drowsy way of travelling to lie inside that slowlymoving mountain listening to the tinkling of the horses bells the occasional smacking of the carters whip the smooth rolling of the great broad wheels the rattle of the harness the cheery goodnights of passing travellers jogging past on little shortstepped horsesall made pleasantly indistinct by the thick awning which seemed made for lazy listening under till one fell asleep  the very going to sleep still with an indistinct idea as the head jogged to and fro upon the pillow of moving onward with no trouble or fatigue and hearing all these sounds like dreamy music lulling to the sensesand the slow waking up and finding ones self staring out through the breezy curtain halfopened in the front far up into the cold bright sky with its countless stars and downward at the drivers lantern dancing on like its namesake jack of the swamps and marshes and sideways at the dark grim trees and forward at the long bare road rising up up up until it stopped abruptly at a sharp high ridge as if there were no more road and all beyond was skyand the stopping at the inn to bait and being helped out and going into a room with fire and candles and winking very much and being agreeably reminded that the night was cold and anxious for very comforts sake to think it colder than it waswhat a delicious journey was that journey in the waggon  then the going on againso fresh at first and shortly afterwards so sleepy  the waking from a sound nap as the mail came dashing past like a highway comet with gleaming lamps and rattling hoofs and visions of a guard behind standing up to keep his feet warm and of a gentleman in a fur cap opening his eyes and looking wild and stupefiedthe stopping at the turnpike where the man was gone to bed and knocking at the door until he answered with a smothered shout from under the bedclothes in the little room above where the faint light was burning and presently came down nightcapped and shivering to throw the gate wide open and wish all waggons off the road except by day the cold sharp interval between night and morningthe distant streak of light widening and spreading and turning from grey to white and from white to yellow and from yellow to burning redthe presence of day with all its cheerfulness and lifemen and horses at the ploughbirds in the trees and hedges and boys in solitary fields frightening them away with rattles  the coming to a townpeople busy in the markets light carts and chaises round the tavern yard tradesmen standing at their doors men running horses up and down the street for sale pigs plunging and grunting in the dirty distance getting off with long strings at their legs running into clean chemists shops and being dislodged with brooms by prentices the night coach changing horsesthe passengers cheerless cold ugly and discontented with three months growth of hair in one nightthe coachman fresh as from a bandbox and exquisitely beautiful by contrastso much bustle so many things in motion such a variety of incidentswhen was there a journey with so many delights as that journey in the waggon  sometimes walking for a mile or two while her grandfather rode inside and sometimes even prevailing upon the schoolmaster to take her place and lie down to rest nell travelled on very happily until they came to a large town where the waggon stopped and where they spent a night they passed a large church and in the streets were a number of old houses built of a kind of earth or plaster crossed and recrossed in a great many directions with black beams which gave them a remarkable and very ancient look  the doors too were arched and low some with oaken portals and quaint benches where the former inhabitants had sat on summer evenings  the windows were latticed in little diamond panes that seemed to wink and blink upon the passengers as if they were dim of sight  they had long since got clear of the smoke and furnaces except in one or two solitary instances where a factory planted among fields withered the space about it like a burning mountain  when they had passed through this town they entered again upon the country and began to draw near their place of destination  it was not so near however but that they spent another night upon the road not that their doing so was quite an act of necessity but that the schoolmaster when they approached within a few miles of his village had a fidgety sense of his dignity as the new clerk and was unwilling to make his entry in dusty shoes and traveldisordered dress  it was a fine clear autumn morning when they came upon the scene of his promotion and stopped to contemplate its beauties  seeheres the church cried the delighted schoolmaster in a low voice and that old building close beside it is the schoolhouse ill be sworn  fiveandthirty pounds ayear in this beautiful place  they admired everythingthe old grey porch the mullioned windows the venerable gravestones dotting the green churchyard the ancient tower the very weathercock the brown thatched roofs of cottage barn and homestead peeping from among the trees the stream that rippled by the distant watermill the blue welsh mountains far away  it was for such a spot the child had wearied in the dense dark miserable haunts of labour  upon her bed of ashes and amidst the squalid horrors through which they had forced their way visions of such scenesbeautiful indeed but not more beautiful than this sweet realityhad been always present to her mind  they had seemed to melt into a dim and airy distance as the prospect of ever beholding them again grew fainter but as they receded she had loved and panted for them more  i must leave you somewhere for a few minutes said the schoolmaster at length breaking the silence into which they had fallen in their gladness  i have a letter to present and inquiries to make you know  where shall i take you  to the little inn yonder  let us wait here rejoined nell  the gate is open  we will sit in the church porch till you come back  a good place too said the schoolmaster leading the way towards it disencumbering himself of his portmanteau and placing it on the stone seat  be sure that i come back with good news and am not long gone  so the happy schoolmaster put on a brannew pair of gloves which he had carried in a little parcel in his pocket all the way and hurried off full of ardour and excitement  the child watched him from the porch until the intervening foliage hid him from her view and then stepped softly out into the old churchyardso solemn and quiet that every rustle of her dress upon the fallen leaves which strewed the path and made her footsteps noiseless seemed an invasion of its silence  it was a very aged ghostly place the church had been built many hundreds of years ago and had once had a convent or monastery attached for arches in ruins remains of oriel windows and fragments of blackened walls were yet standing while other portions of the old building which had crumbled away and fallen down were mingled with the churchyard earth and overgrown with grass as if they too claimed a buryingplace and sought to mix their ashes with the dust of men  hard by these gravestones of dead years and forming a part of the ruin which some pains had been taken to render habitable in modern times were two small dwellings with sunken windows and oaken doors fast hastening to decay empty and desolate  upon these tenements the attention of the child became exclusively riveted  she knew not why  the church the ruin the antiquated graves had equal claims at least upon a strangers thoughts but from the moment when her eyes first rested on these two dwellings she could turn to nothing else  even when she had made the circuit of the enclosure and returning to the porch sat pensively waiting for their friend she took her station where she could still look upon them and felt as if fascinated towards that spot     chapter 47  kits mother and the single gentlemanupon whose track it is expedient to follow with hurried steps lest this history should be chargeable with inconstancy and the offence of leaving its characters in situations of uncertainty and doubtkits mother and the single gentleman speeding onward in the postchaiseandfour whose departure from the notarys door we have already witnessed soon left the town behind them and struck fire from the flints of the broad highway  the good woman being not a little embarrassed by the novelty of her situation and certain material apprehensions that perhaps by this time little jacob or the baby or both had fallen into the fire or tumbled down stairs or had been squeezed behind doors or had scalded their windpipes in endeavouring to allay their thirst at the spouts of teakettles preserved an uneasy silence and meeting from the window the eyes of turnpikemen omnibusdrivers and others felt in the new dignity of her position like a mourner at a funeral who not being greatly afflicted by the loss of the departed recognizes his everyday acquaintance from the window of the mourning coach but is constrained to preserve a decent solemnity and the appearance of being indifferent to all external objects  to have been indifferent to the companionship of the single gentleman would have been tantamount to being gifted with nerves of steel  never did chaise inclose or horses draw such a restless gentleman as he he never sat in the same position for two minutes together but was perpetually tossing his arms and legs about pulling up the sashes and letting them violently down or thrusting his head out of one window to draw it in again and thrust it out of another  he carried in his pocket too a firebox of mysterious and unknown construction and as sure as ever kits mother closed her eyes so surelywhisk rattle fizzthere was the single gentleman consulting his watch by a flame of fire and letting the sparks fall down among the straw as if there were no such thing as a possibility of himself and kits mother being roasted alive before the boys could stop their horses  whenever they halted to change there he wasout of the carriage without letting down the steps bursting about the innyard like a lighted cracker pulling out his watch by lamplight and forgetting to look at it before he put it up again and in short committing so many extravagances that kits mother was quite afraid of him  then when the horses were to in he came like a harlequin and before they had gone a mile out came the watch and the firebox together and kits mother as wide awake again with no hope of a wink of sleep for that stage  are you comfortable the single gentleman would say after one of these exploits turning sharply round  quite sir thank you  are you sure  ant you cold  it is a little chilly sir kits mother would reply  i knew it cried the single gentleman letting down one of the front glasses  she wants some brandy and water  of course she does  how could i forget it  hallo  stop at the next inn and call out for a glass of hot brandy and water  it was in vain for kits mother to protest that she stood in need of nothing of the kind  the single gentleman was inexorable and whenever he had exhausted all other modes and fashions of restlessness it invariably occurred to him that kits mother wanted brandy and water  in this way they travelled on until near midnight when they stopped to supper for which meal the single gentleman ordered everything eatable that the house contained and because kits mother didnt eat everything at once and eat it all he took it into his head that she must be ill  youre faint said the single gentleman who did nothing himself but walk about the room  i see whats the matter with you maam  youre faint  thank you sir im not indeed  i know you are  im sure of it  i drag this poor woman from the bosom of her family at a minutes notice and she goes on getting fainter and fainter before my eyes  im a pretty fellow  how many children have you got maam  two sir besides kit  boys maam  yes sir  are they christened  only half baptised as yet sir  im godfather to both of em  remember that if you please maam you had better have some mulled wine  i couldnt touch a drop indeed sir  you must said the single gentleman  i see you want it  i ought to have thought of it before  immediately flying to the bell and calling for mulled wine as impetuously as if it had been wanted for instant use in the recovery of some person apparently drowned the single gentleman made kits mother swallow a bumper of it at such a high temperature that the tears ran down her face and then hustled her off to the chaise again wherenot impossibly from the effects of this agreeable sedativeshe soon became insensible to his restlessness and fell fast asleep  nor were the happy effects of this prescription of a transitory nature as notwithstanding that the distance was greater and the journey longer than the single gentleman had anticipated she did not awake until it was broad day and they were clattering over the pavement of a town  this is the place cried her companion letting down all the glasses drive to the waxwork  the boy on the wheeler touched his hat and setting spurs to his horse to the end that they might go in brilliantly all four broke into a smart canter and dashed through the streets with a noise that brought the good folks wondering to their doors and windows and drowned the sober voices of the townclocks as they chimed out halfpast eight they drove up to a door round which a crowd of persons were collected and there stopped  whats this said the single gentleman thrusting out his head  is anything the matter here  a wedding sir a wedding cried several voices  hurrah  the single gentleman rather bewildered by finding himself the centre of this noisy throng alighted with the assistance of one of the postilions and handed out kits mother at sight of whom the populace cried out heres another wedding and roared and leaped for joy  the world has gone mad i think said the single gentleman pressing through the concourse with his supposed bride  stand back here will you and let me knock  anything that makes a noise is satisfactory to a crowd  a score of dirty hands were raised directly to knock for him and seldom has a knocker of equal powers been made to produce more deafening sounds than this particular engine on the occasion in question  having rendered these voluntary services the throng modestly retired a little preferring that the single gentleman should bear their consequences alone  now sir what do you want said a man with a large white bow at his buttonhole opening the door and confronting him with a very stoical aspect  who has been married here my friend said the single gentleman  i have  you and to whom in the devils name  what right have you to ask returned the bridegroom eyeing him from top to toe  what right cried the single gentleman drawing the arm of kits mother more tightly through his own for that good woman evidently had it in contemplation to run away  a right you little dream of  mind good people if this fellow has been marrying a minortut tut that cant be  where is the child you have here my good fellow  you call her nell  where is she  as he propounded this question which kits mother echoed somebody in a room near at hand uttered a great shriek and a stout lady in a white dress came running to the door and supported herself upon the bridegrooms arm  where is she cried this lady  what news have you brought me  what has become of her  the single gentleman started back and gazed upon the face of the late mrs jarley that morning wedded to the philosophic george to the eternal wrath and despair of mr slum the poet with looks of conflicting apprehension disappointment and incredulity  at length he stammered out  i ask you where she is  what do you mean  oh sir cried the bride if you have come here to do her any good why werent you here a week ago  she is notnot dead said the person to whom she addressed herself turning very pale  no not so bad as that  i thank god cried the single gentleman feebly  let me come in  they drew back to admit him and when he had entered closed the door  you see in me good people he said turning to the newlymarried couple one to whom life itself is not dearer than the two persons whom i seek  they would not know me  my features are strange to them but if they or either of them are here take this good woman with you and let them see her first for her they both know  if you deny them from any mistaken regard or fear for them judge of my intentions by their recognition of this person as their old humble friend  i always said it cried the bride i knew she was not a common child  alas sir we have no power to help you for all that we could do has been tried in vain  with that they related to him without disguise or concealment all that they knew of nell and her grandfather from their first meeting with them down to the time of their sudden disappearance adding which was quite true that they had made every possible effort to trace them but without success having been at first in great alarm for their safety as well as on account of the suspicions to which they themselves might one day be exposed in consequence of their abrupt departure  they dwelt upon the old mans imbecility of mind upon the uneasiness the child had always testified when he was absent upon the company he had been supposed to keep and upon the increased depression which had gradually crept over her and changed her both in health and spirits  whether she had missed the old man in the night and knowing or conjecturing whither he had bent his steps had gone in pursuit or whether they had left the house together they had no means of determining  certain they considered it that there was but slender prospect left of hearing of them again and that whether their flight originated with the old man or with the child there was now no hope of their return  to all this the single gentleman listened with the air of a man quite borne down by grief and disappointment  he shed tears when they spoke of the grandfather and appeared in deep affliction  not to protract this portion of our narrative and to make short work of a long story let it be briefly written that before the interview came to a close the single gentleman deemed he had sufficient evidence of having been told the truth and that he endeavoured to force upon the bride and bridegroom an acknowledgment of their kindness to the unfriended child which however they steadily declined accepting  in the end the happy couple jolted away in the caravan to spend their honeymoon in a country excursion and the single gentleman and kits mother stood ruefully before their carriagedoor  where shall we drive you sir said the postboy  you may drive me said the single gentleman to the he was not going to add inn but he added it for the sake of kits mother and to the inn they went  rumours had already got abroad that the little girl who used to show the waxwork was the child of great people who had been stolen from her parents in infancy and had only just been traced  opinion was divided whether she was the daughter of a prince a duke an earl a viscount or a baron but all agreed upon the main fact and that the single gentleman was her father and all bent forward to catch a glimpse though it were only of the tip of his noble nose as he rode away desponding in his fourhorse chaise  what would he have given to know and what sorrow would have been saved if he had only known that at that moment both child and grandfather were seated in the old church porch patiently awaiting the schoolmasters return     chapter 48  popular rumour concerning the single gentleman and his errand travelling from mouth to mouth and waxing stronger in the marvellous as it was bandied aboutfor your popular rumour unlike the rolling stone of the proverb is one which gathers a deal of moss in its wanderings up and downoccasioned his dismounting at the inndoor to be looked upon as an exciting and attractive spectacle which could scarcely be enough admired and drew together a large concourse of idlers who having recently been as it were thrown out of employment by the closing of the waxwork and the completion of the nuptial ceremonies considered his arrival as little else than a special providence and hailed it with demonstrations of the liveliest joy  not at all participating in the general sensation but wearing the depressed and wearied look of one who sought to meditate on his disappointment in silence and privacy the single gentleman alighted and handed out kits mother with a gloomy politeness which impressed the lookerson extremely  that done he gave her his arm and escorted her into the house while several active waiters ran on before as a skirmishing party to clear the way and to show the room which was ready for their reception  any room will do said the single gentleman  let it be near at hand thats all  close here sir if you please to walk this way  would the gentleman like this room said a voice as a little outoftheway door at the foot of the well staircase flew briskly open and a head popped out  hes quite welcome to it  hes as welcome as flowers in may or coals at christmas  would you like this room sir honour me by walking in  do me the favour pray  goodness gracious me cried kits mother falling back in extreme surprise only think of this  she had some reason to be astonished for the person who proffered the gracious invitation was no other than daniel quilp  the little door out of which he had thrust his head was close to the inn larder and there he stood bowing with grotesque politeness as much at his ease as if the door were that of his own house blighting all the legs of mutton and cold roast fowls by his close companionship and looking like the evil genius of the cellars come from underground upon some work of mischief  would you do me the honour said quilp  i prefer being alone replied the single gentleman  oh said quilp  and with that he darted in again with one jerk and clapped the little door to like a figure in a dutch clock when the hour strikes  why it was only last night sir whispered kits mother that i left him in little bethel  indeed said her fellowpassenger  when did that person come here waiter  come down by the nightcoach this morning sir  humph  and when is he going  cant say sir really  when the chambermaid asked him just now if he should want a bed sir he first made faces at her and then wanted to kiss her  beg him to walk this way said the single gentleman  i should be glad to exchange a word with him tell him  beg him to come at once do you hear  the man stared on receiving these instructions for the single gentleman had not only displayed as much astonishment as kits mother at sight of the dwarf but standing in no fear of him had been at less pains to conceal his dislike and repugnance  he departed on his errand however and immediately returned ushering in its object  your servant sir said the dwarf i encountered your messenger halfway  i thought youd allow me to pay my compliments to you  i hope youre well  i hope youre very well  there was a short pause while the dwarf with halfshut eyes and puckered face stood waiting for an answer  receiving none he turned towards his more familiar acquaintance  christophers mother he cried  such a dear lady such a worthy woman so blest in her honest son  how is christophers mother  have change of air and scene improved her  her little family too and christopher  do they thrive  do they flourish  are they growing into worthy citizens eh  making his voice ascend in the scale with every succeeding question mr quilp finished in a shrill squeak and subsided into the panting look which was customary with him and which whether it were assumed or natural had equally the effect of banishing all expression from his face and rendering it as far as it afforded any index to his mood or meaning a perfect blank  mr quilp said the single gentleman  the dwarf put his hand to his great flapped ear and counterfeited the closest attention  we two have met before  surely cried quilp nodding his head  oh surely sir  such an honour and pleasureits both christophers mother its bothis not to be forgotten so soon  by no means  you may remember that the day i arrived in london and found the house to which i drove empty and deserted i was directed by some of the neighbours to you and waited upon you without stopping for rest or refreshment  how precipitate that was and yet what an earnest and vigorous measure said quilp conferring with himself in imitation of his friend mr sampson brass  i found said the single gentleman you most unaccountably in possession of everything that had so recently belonged to another man and that other man who up to the time of your entering upon his property had been looked upon as affluent reduced to sudden beggary and driven from house and home  we had warrant for what we did my good sir rejoined quilp we had our warrant  dont say driven either  he went of his own accordvanished in the night sir  no matter said the single gentleman angrily  he was gone  yes he was gone said quilp with the same exasperating composure no doubt he was gone  the only question was where  and its a question still  now what am i to think said the single gentleman sternly regarding him of you who plainly indisposed to give me any information thennay obviously holding back and sheltering yourself with all kinds of cunning trickery and evasionare dogging my footsteps now  i dogging cried quilp  why are you not returned his questioner fretted into a state of the utmost irritation  were you not a few hours since sixty miles off and in the chapel to which this good woman goes to say her prayers  she was there too i think said quilp still perfectly unmoved  i might say if i was inclined to be rude how do i know but you are dogging my footsteps  yes i was at chapel  what then  ive read in books that pilgrims were used to go to chapel before they went on journeys to put up petitions for their safe return  wise men journeys are very perilousespecially outside the coach  wheels come off horses take fright coachmen drive too fast coaches overturn  i always go to chapel before i start on journeys  its the last thing i do on such occasions indeed  that quilp lied most heartily in this speech it needed no very great penetration to discover although for anything that he suffered to appear in his face voice or manner he might have been clinging to the truth with the quiet constancy of a martyr  in the name of all thats calculated to drive one crazy man said the unfortunate single gentleman have you not for some reason of your own taken upon yourself my errand  dont you know with what object i have come here and if you do know can you throw no light upon it  you think im a conjuror sir replied quilp shrugging up his shoulders  if i was i should tell my own fortuneand make it  ah we have said all we need say i see returned the other throwing himself impatiently upon a sofa  pray leave us if you please  willingly returned quilp  most willingly  christophers mother my good soul farewell  a pleasant journeyback sir  ahem  with these parting words and with a grin upon his features altogether indescribable but which seemed to be compounded of every monstrous grimace of which men or monkeys are capable the dwarf slowly retreated and closed the door behind him  oho he said when he had regained his own room and sat himself down in a chair with his arms akimbo  oho  are you there my friend indeed  chuckling as though in very great glee and recompensing himself for the restraint he had lately put upon his countenance by twisting it into all imaginable varieties of ugliness mr quilp rocking himself to and fro in his chair and nursing his left leg at the same time fell into certain meditations of which it may be necessary to relate the substance  first he reviewed the circumstances which had led to his repairing to that spot which were briefly these  dropping in at mr sampson brasss office on the previous evening in the absence of that gentleman and his learned sister he had lighted upon mr swiveller who chanced at the moment to be sprinkling a glass of warm gin and water on the dust of the law and to be moistening his clay as the phrase goes rather copiously  but as clay in the abstract when too much moistened becomes of a weak and uncertain consistency breaking down in unexpected places retaining impressions but faintly and preserving no strength or steadiness of character so mr swivellers clay having imbibed a considerable quantity of moisture was in a very loose and slippery state insomuch that the various ideas impressed upon it were fast losing their distinctive character and running into each other it is not uncommon for human clay in this condition to value itself above all things upon its great prudence and sagacity and mr swiveller especially prizing himself upon these qualities took occasion to remark that he had made strange discoveries in connection with the single gentleman who lodged above which he had determined to keep within his own bosom and which neither tortures nor cajolery should ever induce him to reveal  of this determination mr quilp expressed his high approval and setting himself in the same breath to goad mr swiveller on to further hints soon made out that the single gentleman had been seen in communication with kit and that this was the secret which was never to be disclosed  possessed of this piece of information mr quilp directly supposed that the single gentleman above stairs must be the same individual who had waited on him and having assured himself by further inquiries that this surmise was correct had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that the intent and object of his correspondence with kit was the recovery of his old client and the child  burning with curiosity to know what proceedings were afoot he resolved to pounce upon kits mother as the person least able to resist his arts and consequently the most likely to be entrapped into such revelations as he sought so taking an abrupt leave of mr swiveller he hurried to her house  the good woman being from home he made inquiries of a neighbour as kit himself did soon afterwards and being directed to the chapel be took himself there in order to waylay her at the conclusion of the service  he had not sat in the chapel more than a quarter of an hour and with his eyes piously fixed upon the ceiling was chuckling inwardly over the joke of his being there at all when kit himself appeared  watchful as a lynx one glance showed the dwarf that he had come on business absorbed in appearance as we have seen and feigning a profound abstraction he noted every circumstance of his behaviour and when he withdrew with his family shot out after him  in fine he traced them to the notarys house learnt the destination of the carriage from one of the postilions and knowing that a fast nightcoach started for the same place at the very hour which was on the point of striking from a street hard by darted round to the coachoffice without more ado and took his seat upon the roof  after passing and repassing the carriage on the road and being passed and repassed by it sundry times in the course of the night according as their stoppages were longer or shorter or their rate of travelling varied they reached the town almost together  quilp kept the chaise in sight mingled with the crowd learnt the single gentlemans errand and its failure and having possessed himself of all that it was material to know hurried off reached the inn before him had the interview just now detailed and shut himself up in the little room in which he hastily reviewed all these occurrences  you are there are you my friend he repeated greedily biting his nails  i am suspected and thrown aside and kits the confidential agent is he  i shall have to dispose of him i fear  if we had come up with them this morning he continued after a thoughtful pause i was ready to prove a pretty good claim  i could have made my profit but for these canting hypocrites the lad and his mother i could get this fiery gentleman as comfortably into my net as our old friendour mutual friend ha haand chubby rosy nell  at the worst its a golden opportunity not to be lost  let us find them first and ill find means of draining you of some of your superfluous cash sir while there are prison bars and bolts and locks to keep your friend or kinsman safely  i hate your virtuous people said the dwarf throwing off a bumper of brandy and smacking his lips ah i hate em every one  this was not a mere empty vaunt but a deliberate avowal of his real sentiments for mr quilp who loved nobody had by little and little come to hate everybody nearly or remotely connected with his ruined clientthe old man himself because he had been able to deceive him and elude his vigilancethe child because she was the object of mrs quilps commiseration and constant selfreproachthe single gentleman because of his unconcealed aversion to himselfkit and his mother most mortally for the reasons shown  above and beyond that general feeling of opposition to them which would have been inseparable from his ravenous desire to enrich himself by these altered circumstances daniel quilp hated them every one  in this amiable mood mr quilp enlivened himself and his hatreds with more brandy and then changing his quarters withdrew to an obscure alehouse under cover of which seclusion he instituted all possible inquiries that might lead to the discovery of the old man and his grandchild  but all was in vain  not the slightest trace or clue could be obtained  they had left the town by night no one had seen them go no one had met them on the road the driver of no coach cart or waggon had seen any travellers answering their description nobody had fallen in with them or heard of them  convinced at last that for the present all such attempts were hopeless he appointed two or three scouts with promises of large rewards in case of their forwarding him any intelligence and returned to london by next days coach  it was some gratification to mr quilp to find as he took his place upon the roof that kits mother was alone inside from which circumstance he derived in the course of the journey much cheerfulness of spirit inasmuch as her solitary condition enabled him to terrify her with many extraordinary annoyances such as hanging over the side of the coach at the risk of his life and staring in with his great goggle eyes which seemed in hers the more horrible from his face being upside down dodging her in this way from one window to another getting nimbly down whenever they changed horses and thrusting his head in at the window with a dismal squint which ingenious tortures had such an effect upon mrs nubbles that she was quite unable for the time to resist the belief that mr quilp did in his own person represent and embody that evil power who was so vigorously attacked at little bethel and who by reason of her backslidings in respect of astleys and oysters was now frolicsome and rampant  kit having been apprised by letter of his mothers intended return was waiting for her at the coachoffice and great was his surprise when he saw leering over the coachmans shoulder like some familiar demon invisible to all eyes but his the wellknown face of quilp  how are you christopher croaked the dwarf from the coachtop  all right christopher  mothers inside  why how did he come here mother whispered kit  i dont know how he came or why my dear rejoined mrs nubbles dismounting with her sons assistance but he has been a terrifying of me out of my seven senses all this blessed day  he has cried kit  you wouldnt believe it that you wouldnt replied his mother but dont say a word to him for i really dont believe hes human  hush dont turn round as if i was talking of him but hes a squinting at me now in the full blaze of the coachlamp quite awful  in spite of his mothers injunction kit turned sharply round to look mr quilp was serenely gazing at the stars quite absorbed in celestial contemplation  oh hes the artfullest creetur cried mrs nubbles  but come away dont speak to him for the world  yes i will mother  what nonsense  i say sir  mr quilp affected to start and looked smilingly round  you let my mother alone will you said kit  how dare you tease a poor lone woman like her making her miserable and melancholy as if she hadnt got enough to make her so without you  ant you ashamed of yourself you little monster  monster said quilp inwardly with a smile  ugliest dwarf that could be seen anywhere for a pennymonsterah  you show her any of your impudence again resumed kit shouldering the bandbox and i tell you what mr quilp i wont bear with you any more  you have no right to do it im sure we never interfered with you  this isnt the first time and if ever you worry or frighten her again youll oblige me though i should be very sorry to do it on account of your size to beat you  quilp said not a word in reply but walking so close to kit as to bring his eyes within two or three inches of his face looked fixedly at him retreated a little distance without averting his gaze approached again again withdrew and so on for halfadozen times like a head in a phantasmagoria  kit stood his ground as if in expectation of an immediate assault but finding that nothing came of these gestures snapped his fingers and walked away his mother dragging him off as fast as she could and even in the midst of his news of little jacob and the baby looking anxiously over her shoulder to see if quilp were following     chapter 49  kits mother might have spared herself the trouble of looking back so often for nothing was further from mr quilps thoughts than any intention of pursuing her and her son or renewing the quarrel with which they had parted  he went his way whistling from time to time some fragments of a tune and with a face quite tranquil and composed jogged pleasantly towards home entertaining himself as he went with visions of the fears and terrors of mrs quilp who having received no intelligence of him for three whole days and two nights and having had no previous notice of his absence was doubtless by that time in a state of distraction and constantly fainting away with anxiety and grief  this facetious probability was so congenial to the dwarfs humour and so exquisitely amusing to him that he laughed as he went along until the tears ran down his cheeks and more than once when he found himself in a byestreet vented his delight in a shrill scream which greatly terrifying any lonely passenger who happened to be walking on before him expecting nothing so little increased his mirth and made him remarkably cheerful and lighthearted  in this happy flow of spirits mr quilp reached tower hill when gazing up at the window of his own sittingroom he thought he descried more light than is usual in a house of mourning  drawing nearer and listening attentively he could hear several voices in earnest conversation among which he could distinguish not only those of his wife and motherinlaw but the tongues of men  ha cried the jealous dwarf whats this  do they entertain visitors while im away  a smothered cough from above was the reply  he felt in his pockets for his latchkey but had forgotten it  there was no resource but to knock at the door  a light in the passage said quilp peeping through the keyhole  a very soft knock and by your leave my lady i may yet steal upon you unawares  soho  a very low and gentle rap received no answer from within  but after a second application to the knocker no louder than the first the door was softly opened by the boy from the wharf whom quilp instantly gagged with one hand and dragged into the street with the other  youll throttle me master whispered the boy  let go will you  whos up stairs you dog retorted quilp in the same tone  tell me and dont speak above your breath or ill choke you in good earnest  the boy could only point to the window and reply with a stifled giggle expressive of such intense enjoyment that quilp clutched him by the throat and might have carried his threat into execution or at least have made very good progress towards that end but for the boys nimbly extricating himself from his grasp and fortifying himself behind the nearest post at which after some fruitless attempts to catch him by the hair of the head his master was obliged to come to a parley  will you answer me said quilp  whats going on above  you wont let one speak replied the boy  theyha ha hathey think youreyoure dead  ha ha ha  dead cried quilp relaxing into a grim laugh himself  no  do they  do they really you dog  they think youreyoure drowned replied the boy who in his malicious nature had a strong infusion of his master  you was last seen on the brink of the wharf and they think you tumbled over  ha ha  the prospect of playing the spy under such delicious circumstances and of disappointing them all by walking in alive gave more delight to quilp than the greatest stroke of good fortune could possibly have inspired him with  he was no less tickled than his hopeful assistant and they both stood for some seconds grinning and gasping and wagging their heads at each other on either side of the post like an unmatchable pair of chinese idols  not a word said quilp making towards the door on tiptoe  not a sound not so much as a creaking board or a stumble against a cobweb drowned eh mrs quilp  drowned  so saying he blew out the candle kicked off his shoes and groped his way up stairs leaving his delighted young friend in an ecstasy of summersets on the pavement  the bedroomdoor on the staircase being unlocked mr quilp slipped in and planted himself behind the door of communication between that chamber and the sittingroom which standing ajar to render both more airy and having a very convenient chink of which he had often availed himself for purposes of espial and had indeed enlarged with his pocketknife enabled him not only to hear but to see distinctly what was passing  applying his eye to this convenient place he descried mr brass seated at the table with pen ink and paper and the casebottle of rumhis own casebottle and his own particular jamaicaconvenient to his hand with hot water fragrant lemons white lump sugar and all things fitting from which choice materials sampson by no means insensible to their claims upon his attention had compounded a mighty glass of punch reeking hot which he was at that very moment stirring up with a teaspoon and contemplating with looks in which a faint assumption of sentimental regret struggled but weakly with a bland and comfortable joy  at the same table with both her elbows upon it was mrs jiniwin no longer sipping other peoples punch feloniously with teaspoons but taking deep draughts from a jorum of her own while her daughternot exactly with ashes on her head or sackcloth on her back but preserving a very decent and becoming appearance of sorrow neverthelesswas reclining in an easy chair and soothing her grief with a smaller allowance of the same glib liquid  there were also present a couple of waterside men bearing between them certain machines called drags even these fellows were accommodated with a stiff glass apiece and as they drank with a great relish and were naturally of a rednosed pimplefaced convivial look their presence rather increased than detracted from that decided appearance of comfort which was the great characteristic of the party  if i could poison that dear old ladys rum and water murmured quilp id die happy  ah said mr brass breaking the silence and raising his eyes to the ceiling with a sigh who knows but he may be looking down upon us now who knows but he may be surveying of us fromfrom somewheres or another and contemplating us with a watchful eye  oh lor  here mr brass stopped to drink half his punch and then resumed looking at the other half as he spoke with a dejected smile  i can almost fancy said the lawyer shaking his head that i see his eye glistening down at the very bottom of my liquor  when shall we look upon his like again  never never one minute we are hereholding his tumbler before his eyesthe next we are theregulping down its contents and striking himself emphatically a little below the chestin the silent tomb  to think that i should be drinking his very rum  it seems like a dream  with the view no doubt of testing the reality of his position mr brass pushed his tumbler as he spoke towards mrs jiniwin for the purpose of being replenished and turned towards the attendant mariners  the search has been quite unsuccessful then  quite master  but i should say that if he turns up anywhere hell come ashore somewhere about grinidge tomorrow at ebb tide eh mate  the other gentleman assented observing that he was expected at the hospital and that several pensioners would be ready to receive him whenever he arrived  then we have nothing for it but resignation said mr brass nothing but resignation and expectation  it would be a comfort to have his body it would be a dreary comfort  oh beyond a doubt assented mrs jiniwin hastily if we once had that we should be quite sure  with regard to the descriptive advertisement said sampson brass taking up his pen  it is a melancholy pleasure to recall his traits respecting his legs now  crooked certainly said mrs jiniwin  do you think they were crooked said brass in an insinuating tone  i think i see them now coming up the street very wide apart in nankeen pantaloons a little shrunk and without straps  ah what a vale of tears we live in do we say crooked  i think they were a little so observed mrs quilp with a sob  legs crooked said brass writing as he spoke  large head short body legs crooked  very crooked suggested mrs jiniwin  well not say very crooked maam said brass piously  let us not bear hard upon the weaknesses of the deceased  he is gone maam to where his legs will never come in questionwe will content ourselves with crooked mrs jiniwin  i thought you wanted the truth said the old lady  thats all  bless your eyes how i love you muttered quilp  there she goes again  nothing but punch  this is an occupation said the lawyer laying down his pen and emptying his glass which seems to bring him before my eyes like the ghost of hamlets father in the very clothes that he wore on workadays  his coat his waistcoat his shoes and stockings his trousers his hat his wit and humour his pathos and his umbrella all come before me like visions of my youth  his linen said mr brass smiling fondly at the wall his linen which was always of a particular colour for such was his whim and fancyhow plain i see his linen now  you had better go on sir said mrs jiniwin impatiently  true maam true cried mr brass  our faculties must not freeze with grief  ill trouble you for a little more of that maam  a question now arises with relation to his nose  flat said mrs jiniwin  aquiline cried quilp thrusting in his head and striking the feature with his fist  aquiline you hag  do you see it  do you call this flat  do you  eh  oh capital capital shouted brass from the mere force of habit excellent  how very good he is  hes a most remarkable manso extremely whimsical  such an amazing power of taking people by surprise  quilp paid no regard whatever to these compliments nor to the dubious and frightened look into which the lawyer gradually subsided nor to the shrieks of his wife and motherinlaw nor to the latters running from the room nor to the formers fainting away  keeping his eye fixed on sampson brass he walked up to the table and beginning with his glass drank off the contents and went regularly round until he had emptied the other two when he seized the casebottle and hugging it under his arm surveyed him with a most extraordinary leer  not yet sampson said quilp  not just yet  oh very good indeed cried brass recovering his spirits a little ha ha ha  oh exceedingly good  theres not another man alive who could carry it off like that  a most difficult position to carry off but he has such a flow of goodhumour such an amazing flow  good night said the dwarf nodding expressively  good night sir good night cried the lawyer retreating backwards towards the door  this is a joyful occasion indeed extremely joyful ha ha ha oh very rich very rich indeed remarkably so  waiting until mr brasss ejaculations died away in the distance for he continued to pour them out all the way down stairs quilp advanced towards the two men who yet lingered in a kind of stupid amazement  have you been dragging the river all day gentlemen said the dwarf holding the door open with great politeness  and yesterday too master  dear me youve had a deal of trouble  pray consider everything yours that you find upon theupon the body  good night  the men looked at each other but had evidently no inclination to argue the point just then and shuffled out of the room  the speedy clearance effected quilp locked the doors and still embracing the casebottle with shruggedup shoulders and folded arms stood looking at his insensible wife like a dismounted nightmare     chapter 50  matrimonial differences are usually discussed by the parties concerned in the form of dialogue in which the lady bears at least her full half share  those of mr and mrs quilp however were an exception to the general rule the remarks which they occasioned being limited to a long soliloquy on the part of the gentleman with perhaps a few deprecatory observations from the lady not extending beyond a trembling monosyllable uttered at long intervals and in a very submissive and humble tone  on the present occasion mrs quilp did not for a long time venture even on this gentle defence but when she had recovered from her faintingfit sat in a tearful silence meekly listening to the reproaches of her lord and master  of these mr quilp delivered himself with the utmost animation and rapidity and with so many distortions of limb and feature that even his wife although tolerably well accustomed to his proficiency in these respects was wellnigh beside herself with alarm  but the jamaica rum and the joy of having occasioned a heavy disappointment by degrees cooled mr quilps wrath which from being at savage heat dropped slowly to the bantering or chuckling point at which it steadily remained  so you thought i was dead and gone did you said quilp  you thought you were a widow eh  ha ha ha you jade  indeed quilp returned his wife  im very sorry  who doubts it cried the dwarf  you very sorry to be sure you are who doubts that youre very sorry  i dont mean sorry that you have come home again alive and well said his wife but sorry that i should have been led into such a belief  i am glad to see you quilp indeed i am  in truth mrs quilp did seem a great deal more glad to behold her lord than might have been expected and did evince a degree of interest in his safety which all things considered was rather unaccountable upon quilp however this circumstance made no impression farther than as it moved him to snap his fingers close to his wifes eyes with divers grins of triumph and derision  how could you go away so long without saying a word to me or letting me hear of you or know anything about you asked the poor little woman sobbing  how could you be so cruel quilp  how could i be so cruel cruel cried the dwarf  because i was in the humour  im in the humour now  i shall be cruel when i like  im going away again  not again  yes again  im going away now  im off directly  i mean to go and live wherever the fancy seizes meat the wharfat the countinghouseand be a jolly bachelor  you were a widow in anticipation  damme screamed the dwarf ill be a bachelor in earnest  you cant be serious quilp sobbed his wife  i tell you said the dwarf exulting in his project that ill be a bachelor a devilmaycare bachelor and ill have my bachelors hall at the countinghouse and at such times come near it if you dare  and mind too that i dont pounce in upon you at unseasonable hours again for ill be a spy upon you and come and go like a mole or a weazel tom scottwheres tom scott  here i am master cried the voice of the boy as quilp threw up the window  wait there you dog returned the dwarf to carry a bachelors portmanteau  pack it up mrs quilp  knock up the dear old lady to help knock her up  halloa there  halloa  with these exclamations mr quilp caught up the poker and hurrying to the door of the good ladys sleepingcloset beat upon it therewith until she awoke in inexpressible terror thinking that her amiable soninlaw surely intended to murder her in justification of the legs she had slandered  impressed with this idea she was no sooner fairly awake than she screamed violently and would have quickly precipitated herself out of the window and through a neighbouring skylight if her daughter had not hastened in to undeceive her and implore her assistance  somewhat reassured by her account of the service she was required to render mrs jiniwin made her appearance in a flannel dressinggown and both mother and daughter trembling with terror and coldfor the night was now far advancedobeyed mr quilps directions in submissive silence  prolonging his preparations as much as possible for their greater comfort that eccentric gentleman superintended the packing of his wardrobe and having added to it with his own hands a plate knife and fork spoon teacup and saucer and other small household matters of that nature strapped up the portmanteau took it on his shoulders and actually marched off without another word and with the casebottle which he had never once put down still tightly clasped under his arm  consigning his heavier burden to the care of tom scott when he reached the street taking a dram from the bottle for his own encouragement and giving the boy a rap on the head with it as a small taste for himself quilp very deliberately led the way to the wharf and reached it at between three and four oclock in the morning  snug said quilp when he had groped his way to the wooden countinghouse and opened the door with a key he carried about with him  beautifully snug  call me at eight you dog  with no more formal leavetaking or explanation he clutched the portmanteau shut the door on his attendant and climbing on the desk and rolling himself up as round as a hedgehog in an old boatcloak fell fast asleep  being roused in the morning at the appointed time and roused with difficulty after his late fatigues quilp instructed tom scott to make a fire in the yard of sundry pieces of old timber and to prepare some coffee for breakfast for the better furnishing of which repast he entrusted him with certain small moneys to be expended in the purchase of hot rolls butter sugar yarmouth bloaters and other articles of housekeeping so that in a few minutes a savoury meal was smoking on the board  with this substantial comfort the dwarf regaled himself to his hearts content and being highly satisfied with this free and gipsy mode of life which he had often meditated as offering whenever he chose to avail himself of it an agreeable freedom from the restraints of matrimony and a choice means of keeping mrs quilp and her mother in a state of incessant agitation and suspense bestirred himself to improve his retreat and render it more commodious and comfortable  with this view he issued forth to a place hard by where seastores were sold purchased a secondhand hammock and had it slung in seamanlike fashion from the ceiling of the countinghouse  he also caused to be erected in the same mouldy cabin an old ships stove with a rusty funnel to carry the smoke through the roof and these arrangements completed surveyed them with ineffable delight  ive got a countryhouse like robinson crusoe said the dwarf ogling the accommodations a solitary sequestered desolateisland sort of spot where i can be quite alone when i have business on hand and be secure from all spies and listeners  nobody near me here but rats and they are fine stealthy secret fellows  i shall be as merry as a grig among these gentry  ill look out for one like christopher and poison himha ha ha  business thoughbusinesswe must be mindful of business in the midst of pleasure and the time has flown this morning i declare  enjoining tom scott to await his return and not to stand upon his head or throw a summerset or so much as walk upon his hands meanwhile on pain of lingering torments the dwarf threw himself into a boat and crossing to the other side of the river and then speeding away on foot reached mr swivellers usual house of entertainment in bevis marks just as that gentleman sat down alone to dinner in its dusky parlour  dick said the dwarf thrusting his head in at the door my pet my pupil the apple of my eye hey hey  oh youre there are you returned mr swiveller how are you  hows dick retorted quilp  hows the cream of clerkship eh  why rather sour sir replied mr swiveller  beginning to border upon cheesiness in fact  whats the matter said the dwarf advancing  has sally proved unkind  of all the girls that are so smart theres none like eh dick  certainly not replied mr swiveller eating his dinner with great gravity none like her  shes the sphynx of private life is sally b  youre out of spirits said quilp drawing up a chair  whats the matter  the law dont agree with me returned dick  it isnt moist enough and theres too much confinement  i have been thinking of running away  bah said the dwarf  where would you run to dick  i dont know returned mr swiveller  towards highgate i suppose perhaps the bells might strike up turn again swiveller lord mayor of london whittingtons name was dick  i wish cats were scarcer  quilp looked at his companion with his eyes screwed up into a comical expression of curiosity and patiently awaited his further explanation upon which however mr swiveller appeared in no hurry to enter as he ate a very long dinner in profound silence finally pushed away his plate threw himself back into his chair folded his arms and stared ruefully at the fire in which some ends of cigars were smoking on their own account and sending up a fragrant odour  perhaps youd like a bit of cakesaid dick at last turning to the dwarf  youre quite welcome to it  you ought to be for its of your making  what do you mean said quilp  mr swiveller replied by taking from his pocket a small and very greasy parcel slowly unfolding it and displaying a little slab of plumcake extremely indigestible in appearance and bordered with a paste of white sugar an inch and a half deep  what should you say this was demanded mr swiveller  it looks like bridecake replied the dwarf grinning  and whose should you say it was inquired mr swiveller rubbing the pastry against his nose with a dreadful calmness  whose  not  yes said dick the same  you neednt mention her name  theres no such name now  her name is cheggs now sophy cheggs  yet loved i as man never loved that hadnt wooden legs and my heart my heart is breaking for the love of sophy cheggs  with this extemporary adaptation of a popular ballad to the distressing circumstances of his own case mr swiveller folded up the parcel again beat it very flat between the palms of his hands thrust it into his breast buttoned his coat over it and folded his arms upon the whole  now i hope youre satisfied sir said dick and i hope freds satisfied  you went partners in the mischief and i hope you like it this is the triumph i was to have is it  its like the old countrydance of that name where there are two gentlemen to one lady and one has her and the other hasnt but comes limping up behind to make out the figure  but its destiny and mines a crusher  disguising his secret joy in mr swivellers defeat daniel quilp adopted the surest means of soothing him by ringing the bell and ordering in a supply of rosy wine that is to say of its usual representative which he put about with great alacrity calling upon mr swiveller to pledge him in various toasts derisive of cheggs and eulogistic of the happiness of single men  such was their impression on mr swiveller coupled with the reflection that no man could oppose his destiny that in a very short space of time his spirits rose surprisingly and he was enabled to give the dwarf an account of the receipt of the cake which it appeared had been brought to bevis marks by the two surviving miss wackleses in person and delivered at the office door with much giggling and joyfulness  ha said quilp  it will be our turn to giggle soon  and that reminds meyou spoke of young trentwhere is he  mr swiveller explained that his respectable friend had recently accepted a responsible situation in a locomotive gaminghouse and was at that time absent on a professional tour among the adventurous spirits of great britain  thats unfortunate said the dwarf for i came in fact to ask you about him  a thought has occurred to me dick your friend over the way  which friend  in the first floor  yes  your friend in the first floor dick may know him  no he dont said mr swiveller shaking his head  dont  no because he has never seen him rejoined quilp but if we were to bring them together who knows dick but fred properly introduced would serve his turn almost as well as little nell or her grandfatherwho knows but it might make the young fellows fortune and through him yours eh  why the fact is you see said mr swiveller that they have been brought together  have been cried the dwarf looking suspiciously at his companion through whose means through mine said dick slightly confused didnt i mention it to you the last time you called over yonder  you know you didnt returned the dwarf  i believe youre right said dick  no  i didnt i recollect  oh yes i brought em together that very day  it was freds suggestion  and what came of it  why instead of my friends bursting into tears when he knew who fred was embracing him kindly and telling him that he was his grandfather or his grandmother in disguise which we fully expected he flew into a tremendous passion called him all manner of names said it was in a great measure his fault that little nell and the old gentleman had ever been brought to poverty didnt hint at our taking anything to drink andand in short rather turned us out of the room than otherwise  thats strange said the dwarf musing  so we remarked to each other at the time returned dick coolly but quite true  quilp was plainly staggered by this intelligence over which he brooded for some time in moody silence often raising his eyes to mr swivellers face and sharply scanning its expression  as he could read in it however no additional information or anything to lead him to believe he had spoken falsely and as mr swiveller left to his own meditations sighed deeply and was evidently growing maudlin on the subject of mrs cheggs the dwarf soon broke up the conference and took his departure leaving the bereaved one to his melancholy ruminations  have been brought together eh said the dwarf as he walked the streets alone  my friend has stolen a march upon me  it led him to nothing and therefore is no great matter save in the intention  im glad he has lost his mistress  ha ha  the blockhead mustnt leave the law at present  im sure of him where he is whenever i want him for my own purposes and besides hes a good unconscious spy on brass and tells in his cups all that he sees and hears  youre useful to me dick and cost nothing but a little treating now and then  i am not sure that it may not be worth while before long to take credit with the stranger dick by discovering your designs upon the child but for the present well remain the best friends in the world with your good leave  pursuing these thoughts and gasping as he went along after his own peculiar fashion mr quilp once more crossed the thames and shut himself up in his bachelors hall which by reason of its newlyerected chimney depositing the smoke inside the room and carrying none of it off was not quite so agreeable as more fastidious people might have desired  such inconveniences however instead of disgusting the dwarf with his new abode rather suited his humour so after dining luxuriously from the publichouse he lighted his pipe and smoked against the chimney until nothing of him was visible through the mist but a pair of red and highly inflamed eyes with sometimes a dim vision of his head and face as in a violent fit of coughing he slightly stirred the smoke and scattered the heavy wreaths by which they were obscured  in the midst of this atmosphere which must infallibly have smothered any other man mr quilp passed the evening with great cheerfulness solacing himself all the time with the pipe and the casebottle and occasionally entertaining himself with a melodious howl intended for a song but bearing not the faintest resemblance to any scrap of any piece of music vocal or instrumental ever invented by man  thus he amused himself until nearly midnight when he turned into his hammock with the utmost satisfaction  the first sound that met his ears in the morningas he half opened his eyes and finding himself so unusually near the ceiling entertained a drowsy idea that he must have been transformed into a fly or bluebottle in the course of the nightwas that of a stifled sobbing and weeping in the room  peeping cautiously over the side of his hammock he descried mrs quilp to whom after contemplating her for some time in silence he communicated a violent start by suddenly yelling outhalloa  oh quilp cried his poor little wife looking up  how you frightened me  i meant to you jade returned the dwarf  what do you want here im dead ant i  oh please come home do come home said mrs quilp sobbing well never do so any more quilp and after all it was only a mistake that grew out of our anxiety  out of your anxiety grinned the dwarf  yes i know thatout of your anxiety for my death  i shall come home when i please i tell you  i shall come home when i please and go when i please  ill be a will o the wisp now here now there dancing about you always starting up when you least expect me and keeping you in a constant state of restlessness and irritation  will you begone  mrs quilp durst only make a gesture of entreaty  i tell you no cried the dwarf  no  if you dare to come here again unless youre sent for ill keep watchdogs in the yard thatll growl and biteill have mantraps cunningly altered and improved for catching womenill have spring guns that shall explode when you tread upon the wires and blow you into little pieces  will you begone  do forgive me  do come back said his wife earnestly  nooooo roared quilp  not till my own good time and then ill return again as often as i choose and be accountable to nobody for my goings or comings  you see the door there  will you go  mr quilp delivered this last command in such a very energetic voice and moreover accompanied it with such a sudden gesture indicative of an intention to spring out of his hammock and nightcapped as he was bear his wife home again through the public streets that she sped away like an arrow  her worthy lord stretched his neck and eyes until she had crossed the yard and then not at all sorry to have had this opportunity of carrying his point and asserting the sanctity of his castle fell into an immoderate fit of laughter and laid himself down to sleep again     chapter 51  the bland and openhearted proprietor of bachelors hall slept on amidst the congenial accompaniments of rain mud dirt damp fog and rats until late in the day when summoning his valet tom scott to assist him to rise and to prepare breakfast he quitted his couch and made his toilet  this duty performed and his repast ended he again betook himself to bevis marks  this visit was not intended for mr swiveller but for his friend and employer mr sampson brass  both gentlemen however were from home nor was the life and light of law miss sally at her post either  the fact of their joint desertion of the office was made known to all comers by a scrap of paper in the handwriting of mr swiveller which was attached to the bellhandle and which giving the reader no clue to the time of day when it was first posted furnished him with the rather vague and unsatisfactory information that that gentleman would return in an hour  theres a servant i suppose said the dwarf knocking at the housedoor  shell do  after a sufficiently long interval the door was opened and a small voice immediately accosted him with oh please will you leave a card or message  eh said the dwarf looking down it was something quite new to him upon the small servant  to this the child conducting her conversation as upon the occasion of her first interview with mr swiveller again replied oh please will you leave a card or message  ill write a note said the dwarf pushing past her into the office and mind your master has it directly he comes home  so mr quilp climbed up to the top of a tall stool to write the note and the small servant carefully tutored for such emergencies looked on with her eyes wide open ready if he so much as abstracted a wafer to rush into the street and give the alarm to the police  as mr quilp folded his note which was soon written being a very short one he encountered the gaze of the small servant  he looked at her long and earnestly  how are you said the dwarf moistening a wafer with horrible grimaces  the small servant perhaps frightened by his looks returned no audible reply but it appeared from the motion of her lips that she was inwardly repeating the same form of expression concerning the note or message  do they use you ill here  is your mistress a tartar said quilp with a chuckle  in reply to the last interrogation the small servant with a look of infinite cunning mingled with fear screwed up her mouth very tight and round and nodded violently  whether there was anything in the peculiar slyness of her action which fascinated mr quilp or anything in the expression of her features at the moment which attracted his attention for some other reason or whether it merely occurred to him as a pleasant whim to stare the small servant out of countenance certain it is that he planted his elbows square and firmly on the desk and squeezing up his cheeks with his hands looked at her fixedly  where do you come from he said after a long pause stroking his chin  i dont know  whats your name  nothing  nonsense retorted quilp  what does your mistress call you when she wants you  a little devil said the child  she added in the same breath as if fearful of any further questioning but please will you leave a card or message  these unusual answers might naturally have provoked some more inquiries  quilp however without uttering another word withdrew his eyes from the small servant stroked his chin more thoughtfully than before and then bending over the note as if to direct it with scrupulous and hairbreadth nicety looked at her covertly but very narrowly from under his bushy eyebrows  the result of this secret survey was that he shaded his face with his hands and laughed slyly and noiselessly until every vein in it was swollen almost to bursting pulling his hat over his brow to conceal his mirth and its effects he tossed the letter to the child and hastily withdrew  once in the street moved by some secret impulse he laughed and held his sides and laughed again and tried to peer through the dusty area railings as if to catch another glimpse of the child until he was quite tired out  at last he travelled back to the wilderness which was within rifleshot of his bachelor retreat and ordered tea in the wooden summerhouse that afternoon for three persons an invitation to miss sally brass and her brother to partake of that entertainment at that place having been the object both of his journey and his note  it was not precisely the kind of weather in which people usually take tea in summerhouses far less in summerhouses in an advanced state of decay and overlooking the slimy banks of a great river at low water nevertheless it was in this choice retreat that mr quilp ordered a cold collation to be prepared and it was beneath its cracked and leaky roof that he in due course of time received mr sampson and his sister sally  youre fond of the beauties of nature said quilp with a grin  is this charming brass  is it unusual unsophisticated primitive  its delightful indeed sir replied the lawyer  cool said quilp  nnot particularly so i think sir rejoined brass with his teeth chattering in his head  perhaps a little damp and agueish said quilp  just damp enough to be cheerful sir rejoined brass  nothing more sir nothing more  and sally said the delighted dwarf  does she like it  shell like it better returned that strongminded lady when she has tea so let us have it and dont bother  sweet sally cried quilp extending his arms as if about to embrace her  gentle charming overwhelming sally  hes a very remarkable man indeed soliloquised mr brass  hes quite a troubadour you know quite a troubadour  these complimentary expressions were uttered in a somewhat absent and distracted manner for the unfortunate lawyer besides having a bad cold in his head had got wet in coming and would have willingly borne some pecuniary sacrifice if he could have shifted his present raw quarters to a warm room and dried himself at a fire  quilp howeverwho beyond the gratification of his demon whims owed sampson some acknowledgment of the part he had played in the mourning scene of which he had been a hidden witness marked these symptoms of uneasiness with a delight past all expression and derived from them a secret joy which the costliest banquet could never have afforded him  it is worthy of remark too as illustrating a little feature in the character of miss sally brass that although on her own account she would have borne the discomforts of the wilderness with a very ill grace and would probably indeed have walked off before the tea appeared she no sooner beheld the latent uneasiness and misery of her brother than she developed a grim satisfaction and began to enjoy herself after her own manner  though the wet came stealing through the roof and trickling down upon their heads miss brass uttered no complaint but presided over the tea equipage with imperturbable composure  while mr quilp in his uproarious hospitality seated himself upon an empty beerbarrel vaunted the place as the most beautiful and comfortable in the three kingdoms and elevating his glass drank to their next merrymeeting in that jovial spot and mr brass with the rain plashing down into his teacup made a dismal attempt to pluck up his spirits and appear at his ease and tom scott who was in waiting at the door under an old umbrella exulted in his agonies and bade fair to split his sides with laughing while all this was passing miss sally brass unmindful of the wet which dripped down upon her own feminine person and fair apparel sat placidly behind the teaboard erect and grizzly contemplating the unhappiness of her brother with a mind at ease and content in her amiable disregard of self to sit there all night witnessing the torments which his avaricious and grovelling nature compelled him to endure and forbade him to resent  and this it must be observed or the illustration would be incomplete although in a business point of view she had the strongest sympathy with mr sampson and would have been beyond measure indignant if he had thwarted their client in any one respect  in the height of his boisterous merriment mr quilp having on some pretence dismissed his attendant sprite for the moment resumed his usual manner all at once dismounted from his cask and laid his hand upon the lawyers sleeve  a word said the dwarf before we go farther  sally harkee for a minute  miss sally drew closer as if accustomed to business conferences with their host which were the better for not having air  business said the dwarf glancing from brother to sister  very private business  lay your heads together when youre by yourselves  certainly sir returned brass taking out his pocketbook and pencil  ill take down the heads if you please sir  remarkable documents added the lawyer raising his eyes to the ceiling most remarkable documents  he states his points so clearly that its a treat to have em  i dont know any act of parliament thats equal to him in clearness  i shall deprive you of a treat said quilp  put up your book  we dont want any documents  so  theres a lad named kit  miss sally nodded implying that she knew of him  kit said mr sampsonkit  ha ive heard the name before but i dont exactly call to mindi dont exactly  youre as slow as a tortoise and more thickheaded than a rhinoceros returned his obliging client with an impatient gesture  hes extremely pleasant cried the obsequious sampson  his acquaintance with natural history too is surprising  quite a buffoon quite  there is no doubt that mr brass intended some compliment or other and it has been argued with show of reason that he would have said buffon but made use of a superfluous vowel  be this as it may quilp gave him no time for correction as he performed that office himself by more than tapping him on the head with the handle of his umbrella  dont lets have any wrangling said miss sally staying his hand ive showed you that i know him and thats enough  shes always foremost said the dwarf patting her on the back and looking contemptuously at sampson  i dont like kit sally  nor i rejoined miss brass  nor i said sampson  why thats right cried quilp  half our work is done already this kit is one of your honest people one of your fair characters a prowling prying hound a hypocrite a doublefaced whitelivered sneaking spy a crouching cur to those that feed and coax him and a barking yelping dog to all besides  fearfully eloquent cried brass with a sneeze  quite appalling  come to the point said miss sally and dont talk so much  right again exclaimed quilp with another contemptuous look at sampson always foremost  i say sally he is a yelping insolent dog to all besides and most of all to me  in short i owe him a grudge thats enough sir said sampson  no its not enough sir sneered quilp will you hear me out besides that i owe him a grudge on that account he thwarts me at this minute and stands between me and an end which might otherwise prove a golden one to us all  apart from that i repeat that he crosses my humour and i hate him  now you know the lad and can guess the rest devise your own means of putting him out of my way and execute them shall it be done  it shall sir said sampson  then give me your hand retorted quilp  sally girl yours  i rely as much or more on you than him  tom scott comes back  lantern pipes more grog and a jolly night of it  no other word was spoken no other look exchanged which had the slightest reference to this the real occasion of their meeting  the trio were well accustomed to act together and were linked to each other by ties of mutual interest and advantage and nothing more was needed  resuming his boisterous manner with the same ease with which he had thrown it off quilp was in an instant the same uproarious reckless little savage he had been a few seconds before  it was ten oclock at night before the amiable sally supported her beloved and loving brother from the wilderness by which time he needed the utmost support her tender frame could render his walk being from some unknown reason anything but steady and his legs constantly doubling up in unexpected places  overpowered notwithstanding his late prolonged slumbers by the fatigues of the last few days the dwarf lost no time in creeping to his dainty house and was soon dreaming in his hammock  leaving him to visions in which perhaps the quiet figures we quitted in the old church porch were not without their share be it our task to rejoin them as they sat and watched     chapter 52  after a long time the schoolmaster appeared at the wicketgate of the churchyard and hurried towards them tingling in his hand as he came along a bundle of rusty keys  he was quite breathless with pleasure and haste when he reached the porch and at first could only point towards the old building which the child had been contemplating so earnestly  you see those two old houses he said at last  yes surely replied nell  i have been looking at them nearly all the time you have been away  and you would have looked at them more curiously yet if you could have guessed what i have to tell you said her friend  one of those houses is mine  without saying any more or giving the child time to reply the schoolmaster took her hand and his honest face quite radiant with exultation led her to the place of which he spoke  they stopped before its low arched door  after trying several of the keys in vain the schoolmaster found one to fit the huge lock which turned back creaking and admitted them into the house  the room into which they entered was a vaulted chamber once nobly ornamented by cunning architects and still retaining in its beautiful groined roof and rich stone tracery choice remnants of its ancient splendour  foliage carved in the stone and emulating the mastery of natures hand yet remained to tell how many times the leaves outside had come and gone while it lived on unchanged  the broken figures supporting the burden of the chimneypiece though mutilated were still distinguishable for what they had beenfar different from the dust withoutand showed sadly by the empty hearth like creatures who had outlived their kind and mourned their own too slow decay  in some old timefor even change was old in that old placea wooden partition had been constructed in one part of the chamber to form a sleepingcloset into which the light was admitted at the same period by a rude window or rather niche cut in the solid wall  this screen together with two seats in the broad chimney had at some forgotten date been part of the church or convent for the oak hastily appropriated to its present purpose had been little altered from its former shape and presented to the eye a pile of fragments of rich carving from old monkish stalls  an open door leading to a small room or cell dim with the light that came through leaves of ivy completed the interior of this portion of the ruin  it was not quite destitute of furniture  a few strange chairs whose arms and legs looked as though they had dwindled away with age a table the very spectre of its race a great old chest that had once held records in the church with other quaintlyfashioned domestic necessaries and store of firewood for the winter were scattered around and gave evident tokens of its occupation as a dwellingplace at no very distant time  the child looked around her with that solemn feeling with which we contemplate the work of ages that have become but drops of water in the great ocean of eternity  the old man had followed them but they were all three hushed for a space and drew their breath softly as if they feared to break the silence even by so slight a sound  it is a very beautiful place said the child in a low voice  i almost feared you thought otherwise returned the schoolmaster you shivered when we first came in as if you felt it cold or gloomy  it was not that said nell glancing round with a slight shudder indeed i cannot tell you what it was but when i saw the outside from the church porch the same feeling came over me  it is its being so old and grey perhaps  a peaceful place to live in dont you think so said her friend  oh yes rejoined the child clasping her hands earnestly  a quiet happy placea place to live and learn to die in she would have said more but that the energy of her thoughts caused her voice to falter and come in trembling whispers from her lips   a place to live and learn to live and gather health of mind and body in said the schoolmaster for this old house is yours  ours cried the child  ay returned the schoolmaster gaily for many a merry year to come i hope  i shall be a close neighbouronly next doorbut this house is yours  having now disburdened himself of his great surprise the schoolmaster sat down and drawing nell to his side told her how he had learnt that ancient tenement had been occupied for a very long time by an old person nearly a hundred years of age who kept the keys of the church opened and closed it for the services and showed it to strangers how she had died not many weeks ago and nobody had yet been found to fill the office how learning all this in an interview with the sexton who was confined to his bed by rheumatism he had been bold to make mention of his fellowtraveller which had been so favourably received by that high authority that he had taken courage acting on his advice to propound the matter to the clergyman  in a word the result of his exertions was that nell and her grandfather were to be carried before the lastnamed gentleman next day and his approval of their conduct and appearance reserved as a matter of form that they were already appointed to the vacant post  theres a small allowance of money said the schoolmaster  it is not much but still enough to live upon in this retired spot  by clubbing our funds together we shall do bravely no fear of that  heaven bless and prosper you sobbed the child  amen my dear returned her friend cheerfully and all of us as it will and has in leading us through sorrow and trouble to this tranquil life  but we must look at my house now  come  they repaired to the other tenement tried the rusty keys as before at length found the right one and opened the wormeaten door  it led into a chamber vaulted and old like that from which they had come but not so spacious and having only one other little room attached it was not difficult to divine that the other house was of right the schoolmasters and that he had chosen for himself the least commodious in his care and regard for them  like the adjoining habitation it held such old articles of furniture as were absolutely necessary and had its stack of firewood  to make these dwellings as habitable and full of comfort as they could was now their pleasant care  in a short time each had its cheerful fire glowing and crackling on the hearth and reddening the pale old wall with a hale and healthy blush  nell busily plying her needle repaired the tattered windowhangings drew together the rents that time had worn in the threadbare scraps of carpet and made them whole and decent  the schoolmaster swept and smoothed the ground before the door trimmed the long grass trained the ivy and creeping plants which hung their drooping heads in melancholy neglect and gave to the outer walls a cheery air of home  the old man sometimes by his side and sometimes with the child lent his aid to both went here and there on little patient services and was happy  neighbours too as they came from work proffered their help or sent their children with such small presents or loans as the strangers needed most  it was a busy day and night came on and found them wondering that there was yet so much to do and that it should be dark so soon  they took their supper together in the house which may be henceforth called the childs and when they had finished their meal drew round the fire and almost in whisperstheir hearts were too quiet and glad for loud expressiondiscussed their future plans  before they separated the schoolmaster read some prayers aloud and then full of gratitude and happiness they parted for the night  at that silent hour when her grandfather was sleeping peacefully in his bed and every sound was hushed the child lingered before the dying embers and thought of her past fortunes as if they had been a dream and she only now awoke  the glare of the sinking flame reflected in the oaken panels whose carved tops were dimly seen in the dusky roofthe aged walls where strange shadows came and went with every flickering of the firethe solemn presence within of that decay which falls on senseless things the most enduring in their nature and without and round about on every side of deathfilled her with deep and thoughtful feelings but with none of terror or alarm  a change had been gradually stealing over her in the time of her loneliness and sorrow  with failing strength and heightening resolution there had sprung up a purified and altered mind there had grown in her bosom blessed thoughts and hopes which are the portion of few but the weak and drooping  there were none to see the frail perishable figure as it glided from the fire and leaned pensively at the open casement none but the stars to look into the upturned face and read its history  the old church bell rang out the hour with a mournful sound as if it had grown sad from so much communing with the dead and unheeded warning to the living the fallen leaves rustled the grass stirred upon the graves all else was still and sleeping  some of those dreamless sleepers lay close within the shadow of the churchtouching the wall as if they clung to it for comfort and protection  others had chosen to lie beneath the changing shade of trees others by the path that footsteps might come near them others among the graves of little children  some had desired to rest beneath the very ground they had trodden in their daily walks some where the setting sun might shine upon their beds some where its light would fall upon them when it rose  perhaps not one of the imprisoned souls had been able quite to separate itself in living thought from its old companion  if any had it had still felt for it a love like that which captives have been known to bear towards the cell in which they have been long confined and even at parting hung upon its narrow bounds affectionately  it was long before the child closed the window and approached her bed again something of the same sensation as beforean involuntary chilla momentary feeling akin to fearbut vanishing directly and leaving no alarm behind  again too dreams of the little scholar of the roof opening and a column of bright faces rising far away into the sky as she had seen in some old scriptural picture once and looking down on her asleep  it was a sweet and happy dream  the quiet spot outside seemed to remain the same saving that there was music in the air and a sound of angels wings  after a time the sisters came there hand in hand and stood among the graves  and then the dream grew dim and faded  with the brightness and joy of morning came the renewal of yesterdays labours the revival of its pleasant thoughts the restoration of its energies cheerfulness and hope  they worked gaily in ordering and arranging their houses until noon and then went to visit the clergyman  he was a simplehearted old gentleman of a shrinking subdued spirit accustomed to retirement and very little acquainted with the world which he had left many years before to come and settle in that place his wife had died in the house in which he still lived and he had long since lost sight of any earthly cares or hopes beyond it  he received them very kindly and at once showed an interest in nell asking her name and age her birthplace the circumstances which had led her there and so forth  the schoolmaster had already told her story  they had no other friends or home to leave he said and had come to share his fortunes  he loved the child as though she were his own  well well said the clergyman  let it be as you desire  she is very young old in adversity and trial sir replied the schoolmaster  god help her  let her rest and forget them said the old gentleman but an old church is a dull and gloomy place for one so young as you my child  oh no sir returned nell  i have no such thoughts indeed  i would rather see her dancing on the green at nights said the old gentleman laying his hand upon her head and smiling sadly than have her sitting in the shadow of our mouldering arches  you must look to this and see that her heart does not grow heavy among these solemn ruins  your request is granted friend  after more kind words they withdrew and repaired to the childs house where they were yet in conversation on their happy fortune when another friend appeared  this was a little old gentleman who lived in the parsonagehouse and had resided there so they learnt soon afterwards ever since the death of the clergymans wife which had happened fifteen years before  he had been his college friend and always his close companion in the first shock of his grief he had come to console and comfort him and from that time they had never parted company  the little old gentleman was the active spirit of the place the adjuster of all differences the promoter of all merrymakings the dispenser of his friends bounty and of no small charity of his own besides the universal mediator comforter and friend  none of the simple villagers had cared to ask his name or when they knew it to store it in their memory  perhaps from some vague rumour of his college honours which had been whispered abroad on his first arrival perhaps because he was an unmarried unencumbered gentleman he had been called the bachelor the name pleased him or suited him as well as any other and the bachelor he had ever since remained  and the bachelor it was it may be added who with his own hands had laid in the stock of fuel which the wanderers had found in their new habitation  the bachelor thento call him by his usual appellationlifted the latch showed his little round mild face for a moment at the door and stepped into the room like one who was no stranger to it  you are mr marton the new schoolmaster he said greeting nells kind friend  i am sir  you come well recommended and i am glad to see you  i should have been in the way yesterday expecting you but i rode across the country to carry a message from a sick mother to her daughter in service some miles off and have but just now returned  this is our young churchkeeper  you are not the less welcome friend for her sake or for this old mans nor the worse teacher for having learnt humanity she has been ill sir very lately said the schoolmaster in answer to the look with which their visitor regarded nell when he had kissed her cheek  yes yes  i know she has he rejoined  there have been suffering and heartache here  indeed there have sir  the little old gentleman glanced at the grandfather and back again at the child whose hand he took tenderly in his and held  you will be happier here he said we will try at least to make you so  you have made great improvements here already  are they the work of your hands  yes sir  we may make some othersnot better in themselves but with better means perhaps said the bachelor  let us see now let us see  nell accompanied him into the other little rooms and over both the houses in which he found various small comforts wanting which he engaged to supply from a certain collection of odds and ends he had at home and which must have been a very miscellaneous and extensive one as it comprehended the most opposite articles imaginable  they all came however and came without loss of time for the little old gentleman disappearing for some five or ten minutes presently returned laden with old shelves rugs blankets and other household gear and followed by a boy bearing a similar load  these being cast on the floor in a promiscuous heap yielded a quantity of occupation in arranging erecting and putting away the superintendence of which task evidently afforded the old gentleman extreme delight and engaged him for some time with great briskness and activity  when nothing more was left to be done he charged the boy to run off and bring his schoolmates to be marshalled before their new master and solemnly reviewed  as good a set of fellows marton as youd wish to see he said turning to the schoolmaster when the boy was gone but i dont let em know i think so  that wouldnt do at all  the messenger soon returned at the head of a long row of urchins great and small who being confronted by the bachelor at the house door fell into various convulsions of politeness clutching their hats and caps squeezing them into the smallest possible dimensions and making all manner of bows and scrapes which the little old gentleman contemplated with excessive satisfaction and expressed his approval of by a great many nods and smiles  indeed his approbation of the boys was by no means so scrupulously disguised as he had led the schoolmaster to suppose inasmuch as it broke out in sundry loud whispers and confidential remarks which were perfectly audible to them every one  this first boy schoolmaster said the bachelor is john owen a lad of good parts sir and frank honest temper but too thoughtless too playful too lightheaded by far  that boy my good sir would break his neck with pleasure and deprive his parents of their chief comfortand between ourselves when you come to see him at hare and hounds taking the fence and ditch by the fingerpost and sliding down the face of the little quarry youll never forget it its beautiful  john owen having been thus rebuked and being in perfect possession of the speech aside the bachelor singled out another boy  now look at that lad sir said the bachelor  you see that fellow richard evans his name is sir  an amazing boy to learn blessed with a good memory and a ready understanding and moreover with a good voice and ear for psalmsinging in which he is the best among us yet sir that boy will come to a bad end hell never die in his bed hes always falling asleep in sermontimeand to tell you the truth mr marton i always did the same at his age and feel quite certain that it was natural to my constitution and i couldnt help it  this hopeful pupil edified by the above terrible reproval the bachelor turned to another  but if we talk of examples to be shunned said he if we come to boys that should be a warning and a beacon to all their fellows heres the one and i hope you wont spare him  this is the lad sir this one with the blue eyes and light hair  this is a swimmer sir this fellowa diver lord save us  this is a boy sir who had a fancy for plunging into eighteen feet of water with his clothes on and bringing up a blind mans dog who was being drowned by the weight of his chain and collar while his master stood wringing his hands upon the bank bewailing the loss of his guide and friend  i sent the boy two guineas anonymously sir added the bachelor in his peculiar whisper directly i heard of it but never mention it on any account for he hasnt the least idea that it came from me  having disposed of this culprit the bachelor turned to another and from him to another and so on through the whole array laying for their wholesome restriction within due bounds the same cutting emphasis on such of their propensities as were dearest to his heart and were unquestionably referrable to his own precept and example thoroughly persuaded in the end that he had made them miserable by his severity he dismissed them with a small present and an admonition to walk quietly home without any leapings scufflings or turnings out of the way which injunction he informed the schoolmaster in the same audible confidence he did not think he could have obeyed when he was a boy had his life depended on it  hailing these little tokens of the bachelors disposition as so many assurances of his own welcome course from that time the schoolmaster parted from him with a light heart and joyous spirits and deemed himself one of the happiest men on earth  the windows of the two old houses were ruddy again that night with the reflection of the cheerful fires that burnt within and the bachelor and his friend pausing to look upon them as they returned from their evening walk spoke softly together of the beautiful child and looked round upon the churchyard with a sigh     chapter 53  nell was stirring early in the morning and having discharged her household tasks and put everything in order for the good schoolmaster though sorely against his will for he would have spared her the pains took down from its nail by the fireside a little bundle of keys with which the bachelor had formally invested her on the previous day and went out alone to visit the old church  the sky was serene and bright the air clear perfumed with the fresh scent of newly fallen leaves and grateful to every sense  the neighbouring stream sparkled and rolled onward with a tuneful sound the dew glistened on the green mounds like tears shed by good spirits over the dead  some young children sported among the tombs and hid from each other with laughing faces  they had an infant with them and had laid it down asleep upon a childs grave in a little bed of leaves  it was a new gravethe restingplace perhaps of some little creature who meek and patient in its illness had often sat and watched them and now seemed to their minds scarcely changed  she drew near and asked one of them whose grave it was  the child answered that that was not its name it was a gardenhis brothers it was greener he said than all the other gardens and the birds loved it better because he had been used to feed them  when he had done speaking he looked at her with a smile and kneeling down and nestling for a moment with his cheek against the turf bounded merrily away  she passed the church gazing upward at its old tower went through the wicket gate and so into the village  the old sexton leaning on a crutch was taking the air at his cottage door and gave her good morrow  you are better said the child stopping to speak with him  ay surely returned the old man  im thankful to say much better  you will be quite well soon  with heavens leave and a little patience  but come in come in the old man limped on before and warning her of the downward step which he achieved himself with no small difficulty led the way into his little cottage  it is but one room you see  there is another up above but the stair has got harder to climb o late years and i never use it  im thinking of taking to it again next summer though  the child wondered how a greyheaded man like himone of his trade toocould talk of time so easily  he saw her eyes wandering to the tools that hung upon the wall and smiled  i warrant now he said that you think all those are used in making graves  indeed i wondered that you wanted so many  and well you might  i am a gardener  i dig the ground and plant things that are to live and grow  my works dont all moulder away and rot in the earth  you see that spade in the centre  the very old oneso notched and worn  yes  thats the sextons spade and its a wellused one as you see were healthy people here but it has done a power of work  if it could speak now that spade it would tell you of many an unexpected job that it and i have done together but i forget em for my memorys a poor onethats nothing new he added hastily  it always was  there are flowers and shrubs to speak to your other work said the child  oh yes  and tall trees  but they are not so separate from the sextons labours as you think  no  not in my mind and recollectionsuch as it is said the old man indeed they often help it  for say that i planted such a tree for such a man  there it stands to remind me that he died  when i look at its broad shadow and remember what it was in his time it helps me to the age of my other work and i can tell you pretty nearly when i made his grave  but it may remind you of one who is still alive said the child  of twenty that are dead in connexion with that one who lives then rejoined the old man wife husband parents brothers sisters children friendsa score at least  so it happens that the sextons spade gets worn and battered  i shall need a new onenext summer  the child looked quickly towards him thinking that he jested with his age and infirmity but the unconscious sexton was quite in earnest  ah he said after a brief silence  people never learn  they never learn  its only we who turn up the ground where nothing grows and everything decays who think of such things as thesewho think of them properly i mean  you have been into the church  i am going there now the child replied  theres an old well there said the sexton right underneath the belfry a deep dark echoing well  forty year ago you had only to let down the bucket till the first knot in the rope was free of the windlass and you heard it splashing in the cold dull water  by little and little the water fell away so that in ten year after that a second knot was made and you must unwind so much rope or the bucket swung tight and empty at the end  in ten years time the water fell again and a third knot was made  in ten years more the well dried up and now if you lower the bucket till your arms are tired and let out nearly all the cord youll hear it of a sudden clanking and rattling on the ground below with a sound of being so deep and so far down that your heart leaps into your mouth and you start away as if you were falling in  a dreadful place to come on in the dark exclaimed the child who had followed the old mans looks and words until she seemed to stand upon its brink  what is it but a grave said the sexton  what else  and which of our old folks knowing all this thought as the spring subsided of their own failing strength and lessening life  not one  are you very old yourself asked the child involuntarily  i shall be seventyninenext summer  you still work when you are well  work  to be sure  you shall see my gardens hereabout  look at the window there  i made and have kept that plot of ground entirely with my own hands  by this time next year i shall hardly see the sky the boughs will have grown so thick  i have my winter work at night besides  he opened as he spoke a cupboard close to where he sat and produced some miniature boxes carved in a homely manner and made of old wood  some gentlefolks who are fond of ancient days and what belongs to them he said like to buy these keepsakes from our church and ruins sometimes i make them of scraps of oak that turn up here and there sometimes of bits of coffins which the vaults have long preserved  see herethis is a little chest of the last kind clasped at the edges with fragments of brass plates that had writing on em once though it would be hard to read it now  i havent many by me at this time of year but these shelves will be fullnext summer  the child admired and praised his work and shortly afterwards departed thinking as she went how strange it was that this old man drawing from his pursuits and everything around him one stern moral never contemplated its application to himself and while he dwelt upon the uncertainty of human life seemed both in word and deed to deem himself immortal  but her musings did not stop here for she was wise enough to think that by a good and merciful adjustment this must be human nature and that the old sexton with his plans for next summer was but a type of all mankind  full of these meditations she reached the church  it was easy to find the key belonging to the outer door for each was labelled on a scrap of yellow parchment  its very turning in the lock awoke a hollow sound and when she entered with a faltering step the echoes that it raised in closing made her start  if the peace of the simple village had moved the child more strongly because of the dark and troubled ways that lay beyond and through which she had journeyed with such failing feet what was the deep impression of finding herself alone in that solemn building where the very light coming through sunken windows seemed old and grey and the air redolent of earth and mould seemed laden with decay purified by time of all its grosser particles and sighing through arch and aisle and clustered pillars like the breath of ages gone  here was the broken pavement worn so long ago by pious feet that time stealing on the pilgrims steps had trodden out their track and left but crumbling stones  here were the rotten beam the sinking arch the sapped and mouldering wall the lowly trench of earth the stately tomb on which no epitaph remainedallmarble stone iron wood and dustone common monument of ruin  the best work and the worst the plainest and the richest the stateliest and the least imposingboth of heavens work and mansall found one common level here and told one common tale  some part of the edifice had been a baronial chapel and here were effigies of warriors stretched upon their beds of stone with folded handscrosslegged those who had fought in the holy warsgirded with their swords and cased in armour as they had lived  some of these knights had their own weapons helmets coats of mail hanging upon the walls hard by and dangling from rusty hooks  broken and dilapidated as they were they yet retained their ancient form and something of their ancient aspect  thus violent deeds live after men upon the earth and traces of war and bloodshed will survive in mournful shapes long after those who worked the desolation are but atoms of earth themselves  the child sat down in this old silent place among the stark figures on the tombsthey made it more quiet there than elsewhere to her fancyand gazing round with a feeling of awe tempered with a calm delight felt that now she was happy and at rest  she took a bible from the shelf and read then laying it down thought of the summer days and the bright springtime that would comeof the rays of sun that would fall in aslant upon the sleeping formsof the leaves that would flutter at the window and play in glistening shadows on the pavementof the songs of birds and growth of buds and blossoms out of doorsof the sweet air that would steal in and gently wave the tattered banners overhead  what if the spot awakened thoughts of death  die who would it would still remain the same these sights and sounds would still go on as happily as ever  it would be no pain to sleep amidst them  she left the chapelvery slowly and often turning back to gaze againand coming to a low door which plainly led into the tower opened it and climbed the winding stair in darkness save where she looked down through narrow loopholes on the place she had left or caught a glimmering vision of the dusty bells  at length she gained the end of the ascent and stood upon the turret top  oh the glory of the sudden burst of light the freshness of the fields and woods stretching away on every side and meeting the bright blue sky the cattle grazing in the pasturage the smoke that coming from among the trees seemed to rise upward from the green earth the children yet at their gambols down belowall everything so beautiful and happy  it was like passing from death to life it was drawing nearer heaven  the children were gone when she emerged into the porch and locked the door  as she passed the schoolhouse she could hear the busy hum of voices  her friend had begun his labours only on that day  the noise grew louder and looking back she saw the boys come trooping out and disperse themselves with merry shouts and play  its a good thing thought the child i am very glad they pass the church  and then she stopped to fancy how the noise would sound inside and how gently it would seem to die away upon the ear  again that day yes twice again she stole back to the old chapel and in her former seat read from the same book or indulged the same quiet train of thought  even when it had grown dusk and the shadows of coming night made it more solemn still the child remained like one rooted to the spot and had no fear or thought of stirring  they found her there at last and took her home  she looked pale but very happy until they separated for the night and then as the poor schoolmaster stooped down to kiss her cheek he thought he felt a tear upon his face     chapter 54  the bachelor among his various occupations found in the old church a constant source of interest and amusement  taking that pride in it which men conceive for the wonders of their own little world he had made its history his study and many a summer day within its walls and many a winters night beside the parsonage fire had found the bachelor still poring over and adding to his goodly store of tale and legend  as he was not one of those rough spirits who would strip fair truth of every little shadowy vestment in which time and teeming fancies love to array herand some of which become her pleasantly enough serving like the waters of her well to add new graces to the charms they half conceal and half suggest and to awaken interest and pursuit rather than languor and indifferenceas unlike this stern and obdurate class he loved to see the goddess crowned with those garlands of wild flowers which tradition wreathes for her gentle wearing and which are often freshest in their homeliest shapeshe trod with a light step and bore with a light hand upon the dust of centuries unwilling to demolish any of the airy shrines that had been raised above it if any good feeling or affection of the human heart were hiding thereabouts thus in the case of an ancient coffin of rough stone supposed for many generations to contain the bones of a certain baron who after ravaging with cut and thrust and plunder in foreign lands came back with a penitent and sorrowing heart to die at home but which had been lately shown by learned antiquaries to be no such thing as the baron in question so they contended had died hard in battle gnashing his teeth and cursing with his latest breaththe bachelor stoutly maintained that the old tale was the true one that the baron repenting him of the evil had done great charities and meekly given up the ghost and that if ever baron went to heaven that baron was then at peace  in like manner when the aforesaid antiquaries did argue and contend that a certain secret vault was not the tomb of a greyhaired lady who had been hanged and drawn and quartered by glorious queen bess for succouring a wretched priest who fainted of thirst and hunger at her door the bachelor did solemnly maintain against all comers that the church was hallowed by the said poor ladys ashes that her remains had been collected in the night from four of the citys gates and thither in secret brought and there deposited and the bachelor did further being highly excited at such times deny the glory of queen bess and assert the immeasurably greater glory of the meanest woman in her realm who had a merciful and tender heart  as to the assertion that the flat stone near the door was not the grave of the miser who had disowned his only child and left a sum of money to the church to buy a peal of bells the bachelor did readily admit the same and that the place had given birth to no such man  in a word he would have had every stone and plate of brass the monument only of deeds whose memory should survive  all others he was willing to forget  they might be buried in consecrated ground but he would have had them buried deep and never brought to light again  it was from the lips of such a tutor that the child learnt her easy task  already impressed beyond all telling by the silent building and the peaceful beauty of the spot in which it stoodmajestic age surrounded by perpetual youthit seemed to her when she heard these things sacred to all goodness and virtue  it was another world where sin and sorrow never came a tranquil place of rest where nothing evil entered  when the bachelor had given her in connection with almost every tomb and flat gravestone some history of its own he took her down into the old crypt now a mere dull vault and showed her how it had been lighted up in the time of the monks and how amid lamps depending from the roof and swinging censers exhaling scented odours and habits glittering with gold and silver and pictures and precious stuffs and jewels all flashing and glistening through the low arches the chaunt of aged voices had been many a time heard there at midnight in old days while hooded figures knelt and prayed around and told their rosaries of beads  thence he took her above ground again and showed her high up in the old walls small galleries where the nuns had been wont to glide alongdimly seen in their dark dresses so far offor to pause like gloomy shadows listening to the prayers  he showed her too how the warriors whose figures rested on the tombs had worn those rotting scraps of armour up abovehow this had been a helmet and that a shield and that a gauntletand how they had wielded the great twohanded swords and beaten men down with yonder iron mace all that he told the child she treasured in her mind and sometimes when she awoke at night from dreams of those old times and rising from her bed looked out at the dark church she almost hoped to see the windows lighted up and hear the organs swell and sound of voices on the rushing wind  the old sexton soon got better and was about again  from him the child learnt many other things though of a different kind  he was not able to work but one day there was a grave to be made and he came to overlook the man who dug it  he was in a talkative mood and the child at first standing by his side and afterwards sitting on the grass at his feet with her thoughtful face raised towards his began to converse with him  now the man who did the sextons duty was a little older than he though much more active  but he was deaf and when the sexton who peradventure on a pinch might have walked a mile with great difficulty in halfadozen hours exchanged a remark with him about his work the child could not help noticing that he did so with an impatient kind of pity for his infirmity as if he were himself the strongest and heartiest man alive  im sorry to see there is this to do said the child when she approached  i heard of no one having died  she lived in another hamlet my dear returned the sexton  three mile away  was she young  yeyes said the sexton not more than sixtyfour i think  david was she more than sixtyfour  david who was digging hard heard nothing of the question  the sexton as he could not reach to touch him with his crutch and was too infirm to rise without assistance called his attention by throwing a little mould upon his red nightcap  whats the matter now said david looking up  how old was becky morgan asked the sexton  becky morgan repeated david  yes replied the sexton adding in a half compassionate half irritable tone which the old man couldnt hear youre getting very deaf davy very deaf to be sure  the old man stopped in his work and cleansing his spade with a piece of slate he had by him for the purposeand scraping off in the process the essence of heaven knows how many becky morgansset himself to consider the subject  let me think quoth he  i saw last night what they had put upon the coffinwas it seventynine  no no said the sexton  ah yes it was though returned the old man with a sigh  for i remember thinking she was very near our age  yes it was seventynine  are you sure you didnt mistake a figure davy asked the sexton with signs of some emotion  what said the old man  say that again  hes very deaf  hes very deaf indeed cried the sexton petulantly are you sure youre right about the figures  oh quite replied the old man  why not  hes exceedingly deaf muttered the sexton to himself  i think hes getting foolish  the child rather wondered what had led him to this belief as to say the truth the old man seemed quite as sharp as he and was infinitely more robust  as the sexton said nothing more just then however she forgot it for the time and spoke again  you were telling me she said about your gardening  do you ever plant things here  in the churchyard returned the sexton not i  i have seen some flowers and little shrubs about the child rejoined there are some over there you see  i thought they were of your rearing though indeed they grow but poorly  they grow as heaven wills said the old man and it kindly ordains that they shall never flourish here  i do not understand you  why this it is said the sexton  they mark the graves of those who had very tender loving friends  i was sure they did the child exclaimed  i am very glad to know they do  aye returned the old man but stay  look at them  see how they hang their heads and droop and wither  do you guess the reason  no the child replied  because the memory of those who lie below passes away so soon  at first they tend them morning noon and night they soon begin to come less frequently from once a day to once a week from once a week to once a month then at long and uncertain intervals then not at all such tokens seldom flourish long  i have known the briefest summer flowers outlive them  i grieve to hear it said the child  ah so say the gentlefolks who come down here to look about them returned the old man shaking his head but i say otherwise  its a pretty custom you have in this part of the country they say to me sometimes to plant the graves but its melancholy to see these things all withering or dead i crave their pardon and tell them that as i take it tis a good sign for the happiness of the living  and so it is  its nature  perhaps the mourners learn to look to the blue sky by day and to the stars by night and to think that the dead are there and not in graves said the child in an earnest voice  perhaps so replied the old man doubtfully  it may be  whether it be as i believe it is or no thought the child within herself ill make this place my garden  it will be no harm at least to work here day by day and pleasant thoughts will come of it i am sure  her glowing cheek and moistened eye passed unnoticed by the sexton who turned towards old david and called him by his name  it was plain that becky morgans age still troubled him though why the child could scarcely understand  the second or third repetition of his name attracted the old mans attention  pausing from his work he leant on his spade and put his hand to his dull ear  did you call he said  i have been thinking davy replied the sexton that she he pointed to the grave must have been a deal older than you or me  seventynine answered the old man with a shake of the head i tell you that i saw it  saw it replied the sexton aye but davy women dont always tell the truth about their age  thats true indeed said the other old man with a sudden sparkle in his eye  she might have been older  im sure she must have been  why only think how old she looked  you and i seemed but boys to her  she did look old rejoined david  youre right  she did look old  call to mind how old she looked for many a long long year and say if she could be but seventynine at lastonly our age said the sexton  five year older at the very least cried the other  five retorted the sexton  ten  good eightynine  i call to mind the time her daughter died  she was eightynine if she was a day and tries to pass upon us now for ten year younger  oh  human vanity  the other old man was not behindhand with some moral reflections on this fruitful theme and both adduced a mass of evidence of such weight as to render it doubtfulnot whether the deceased was of the age suggested but whether she had not almost reached the patriarchal term of a hundred  when they had settled this question to their mutual satisfaction the sexton with his friends assistance rose to go  its chilly sitting here and i must be carefultill the summer he said as he prepared to limp away  what asked old david  hes very deaf poor fellow cried the sexton  goodbye ah said old david looking after him  hes failing very fast  he ages every day  and so they parted each persuaded that the other had less life in him than himself and both greatly consoled and comforted by the little fiction they had agreed upon respecting becky morgan whose decease was no longer a precedent of uncomfortable application and would be no business of theirs for half a score of years to come  the child remained for some minutes watching the deaf old man as he threw out the earth with his shovel and often stopping to cough and fetch his breath still muttered to himself with a kind of sober chuckle that the sexton was wearing fast  at length she turned away and walking thoughtfully through the churchyard came unexpectedly upon the schoolmaster who was sitting on a green grave in the sun reading  nell here he said cheerfully as he closed his book  it does me good to see you in the air and light  i feared you were again in the church where you so often are  feared replied the child sitting down beside him  is it not a good place  yes yes said the schoolmaster  but you must be gay sometimesnay dont shake your head and smile so sadly  not sadly if you knew my heart  do not look at me as if you thought me sorrowful  there is not a happier creature on earth than i am now  full of grateful tenderness the child took his hand and folded it between her own  its gods will she said when they had been silent for some time  what  all this she rejoined all this about us  but which of us is sad now  you see that i am smiling  and so am i said the schoolmaster smiling to think how often we shall laugh in this same place  were you not talking yonder  yesthe child rejoined  of something that has made you sorrowful  there was a long pause  what was it said the schoolmaster tenderly  come  tell me what it was  i rather grievei do rather grieve to think said the child bursting into tears that those who die about us are so soon forgotten  and do you think said the schoolmaster marking the glance she had thrown around that an unvisited grave a withered tree a faded flower or two are tokens of forgetfulness or cold neglect  do you think there are no deeds far away from here in which these dead may be best remembered  nell nell there may be people busy in the world at this instant in whose good actions and good thoughts these very gravesneglected as they look to usare the chief instruments  tell me no more said the child quickly  tell me no more  i feel i know it  how could i be unmindful of it when i thought of you  there is nothing cried her friend no nothing innocent or good that dies and is forgotten  let us hold to that faith or none  an infant a prattling child dying in its cradle will live again in the better thoughts of those who loved it and will play its part through them in the redeeming actions of the world though its body be burnt to ashes or drowned in the deepest sea  there is not an angel added to the host of heaven but does its blessed work on earth in those that loved it here  forgotten oh if the good deeds of human creatures could be traced to their source how beautiful would even death appear for how much charity mercy and purified affection would be seen to have their growth in dusty graves  yes said the child it is the truth i know it is  who should feel its force so much as i in whom your little scholar lives again  dear dear good friend if you knew the comfort you have given me  the poor schoolmaster made her no answer but bent over her in silence for his heart was full  they were yet seated in the same place when the grandfather approached  before they had spoken many words together the church clock struck the hour of school and their friend withdrew  a good man said the grandfather looking after him a kind man surely he will never harm us nell  we are safe here at last eh  we will never go away from here  the child shook her head and smiled  she needs rest said the old man patting her cheek too paletoo pale  she is not like what she was  when asked the child  ha said the old man to be surewhen  how many weeks ago  could i count them on my fingers  let them rest though theyre better gone much better dear replied the child  we will forget them or if we ever call them to mind it shall be only as some uneasy dream that has passed away  hush said the old man motioning hastily to her with his hand and looking over his shoulder no more talk of the dream and all the miseries it brought  there are no dreams here  tis a quiet place and they keep away  let us never think about them lest they should pursue us again  sunken eyes and hollow cheekswet cold and famineand horrors before them all that were even worsewe must forget such things if we would be tranquil here  thank heaven inwardly exclaimed the child for this most happy change  i will be patient said the old man humble very thankful and obedient if you will let me stay  but do not hide from me do not steal away alone let me keep beside you  indeed i will be very true and faithful nell  i steal away alone why that replied the child with assumed gaiety would be a pleasant jest indeed  see here dear grandfather well make this place our gardenwhy not  it is a very good oneand tomorrow well begin and work together side by side  it is a brave thought cried her grandfather  mind darlingwe begin tomorrow  who so delighted as the old man when they next day began their labour who so unconscious of all associations connected with the spot as he they plucked the long grass and nettles from the tombs thinned the poor shrubs and roots made the turf smooth and cleared it of the leaves and weeds  they were yet in the ardour of their work when the child raising her head from the ground over which she bent observed that the bachelor was sitting on the stile close by watching them in silence  a kind office said the little gentleman nodding to nell as she curtseyed to him  have you done all that this morning  it is very little sir returned the child with downcast eyes to what we mean to do  good work good work said the bachelor  but do you only labour at the graves of children and young people  we shall come to the others in good time sir replied nell turning her head aside and speaking softly  it was a slight incident and might have been design or accident or the childs unconscious sympathy with youth  but it seemed to strike upon her grandfather though he had not noticed it before  he looked in  hurried manner at the graves then anxiously at the child then pressed her to his side and bade her stop to rest  something he had long forgotten appeared to struggle faintly in his mind  it did not pass away as weightier things had done but came uppermost again and yet again and many times that day and often afterwards  once while they were yet at work the child seeing that he often turned and looked uneasily at her as though he were trying to resolve some painful doubts or collect some scattered thoughts urged him to tell the reason  but he said it was nothingnothingand laying her head upon his arm patted her fair cheek with his hand and muttered that she grew stronger every day and would be a woman soon     chapter 55  from that time there sprung up in the old mans mind a solicitude about the child which never slept or left him  there are chords in the human heartstrange varying stringswhich are only struck by accident which will remain mute and senseless to appeals the most passionate and earnest and respond at last to the slightest casual touch  in the most insensible or childish minds there is some train of reflection which art can seldom lead or skill assist but which will reveal itself as great truths have done by chance and when the discoverer has the plainest end in view  from that time the old man never for a moment forgot the weakness and devotion of the child from the time of that slight incident he who had seen her toiling by his side through so much difficulty and suffering and had scarcely thought of her otherwise than as the partner of miseries which he felt severely in his own person and deplored for his own sake at least as much as hers awoke to a sense of what he owed her and what those miseries had made her  never no never once in one unguarded moment from that time to the end did any care for himself any thought of his own comfort any selfish consideration or regard distract his thoughts from the gentle object of his love  he would follow her up and down waiting till she should tire and lean upon his armhe would sit opposite to her in the chimneycorner content to watch and look until she raised her head and smiled upon him as of oldhe would discharge by stealth those household duties which tasked her powers too heavilyhe would rise in the cold dark nights to listen to her breathing in her sleep and sometimes crouch for hours by her bedside only to touch her hand  he who knows all can only know what hopes and fears and thoughts of deep affection were in that one disordered brain and what a change had fallen on the poor old man  sometimesweeks had crept on thenthe child exhausted though with little fatigue would pass whole evenings on a couch beside the fire  at such times the schoolmaster would bring in books and read to her aloud and seldom an evening passed but the bachelor came in and took his turn of reading  the old man sat and listenedwith little understanding for the words but with his eyes fixed upon the childand if she smiled or brightened with the story he would say it was a good one and conceive a fondness for the very book  when in their evening talk the bachelor told some tale that pleased her as his tales were sure to do the old man would painfully try to store it in his mind nay when the bachelor left them he would sometimes slip out after him and humbly beg that he would tell him such a part again that he might learn to win a smile from nell  but these were rare occasions happily for the child yearned to be out of doors and walking in her solemn garden  parties too would come to see the church and those who came speaking to others of the child sent more so even at that season of the year they had visitors almost daily  the old man would follow them at a little distance through the building listening to the voice he loved so well and when the strangers left and parted from nell he would mingle with them to catch up fragments of their conversation or he would stand for the same purpose with his grey head uncovered at the gate as they passed through  they always praised the child her sense and beauty and he was proud to hear them  but what was that so often added which wrung his heart and made him sob and weep alone in some dull corner  alas even careless strangersthey who had no feeling for her but the interest of the momentthey who would go away and forget next week that such a being livedeven they saw iteven they pitied hereven they bade him good day compassionately and whispered as they passed  the people of the village too of whom there was not one but grew to have a fondness for poor nell even among them there was the same feeling a tenderness towards hera compassionate regard for her increasing every day  the very schoolboys lighthearted and thoughtless as they were even they cared for her  the roughest among them was sorry if he missed her in the usual place upon his way to school and would turn out of the path to ask for her at the latticed window  if she were sitting in the church they perhaps might peep in softly at the open door but they never spoke to her unless she rose and went to speak to them  some feeling was abroad which raised the child above them all  so when sunday came  they were all poor country people in the church for the castle in which the old family had lived was an empty ruin and there were none but humble folks for seven miles around  there as elsewhere they had an interest in nell  they would gather round her in the porch before and after service young children would cluster at her skirts and aged men and women forsake their gossips to give her kindly greeting  none of them young or old thought of passing the child without a friendly word  many who came from three or four miles distant brought her little presents the humblest and rudest had good wishes to bestow  she had sought out the young children whom she first saw playing in the churchyard  one of thesehe who had spoken of his brotherwas her little favourite and friend and often sat by her side in the church or climbed with her to the towertop  it was his delight to help her or to fancy that he did so and they soon became close companions  it happened that as she was reading in the old spot by herself one day this child came running in with his eyes full of tears and after holding her from him and looking at her eagerly for a moment clasped his little arms passionately about her neck  what now said nell soothing him  what is the matter  she is not one yet cried the boy embracing her still more closely no no  not yet  she looked at him wonderingly and putting his hair back from his face and kissing him asked what he meant  you must not be one dear nell cried the boy  we cant see them they never come to play with us or talk to us  be what you are  you are better so  i do not understand you said the child  tell me what you mean  why they say replied the boy looking up into her face that you will be an angel before the birds sing again  but you wont be will you  dont leave us nell though the sky is bright  do not leave us  the child dropped her head and put her hands before her face  she cannot bear the thought cried the boy exulting through his tears  you will not go  you know how sorry we should be  dear nell tell me that youll stay amongst us  oh  pray pray tell me that you will  the little creature folded his hands and knelt down at her feet  only look at me nell said the boy and tell me that youll stop and then i shall know that they are wrong and will cry no more  wont you say yes nell  still the drooping head and hidden face and the child quite silentsave for her sobs  after a time pursued the boy trying to draw away her hand the kind angels will be glad to think that you are not among them and that you stayed here to be with us  willy went away to join them but if he had known how i should miss him in our little bed at night he never would have left me i am sure  yet the child could make him no answer and sobbed as though her heart were bursting  why would you go dear nell  i know you would not be happy when you heard that we were crying for your loss  they say that willy is in heaven now and that its always summer there and yet im sure he grieves when i lie down upon his garden bed and he cannot turn to kiss me  but if you do go nell said the boy caressing her and pressing his face to hers be fond of him for my sake  tell him how i love him still and how much i loved you and when i think that you two are together and are happy ill try to bear it and never give you pain by doing wrongindeed i never will  the child suffered him to move her hands and put them round his neck there was a tearful silence but it was not long before she looked upon him with a smile and promised him in a very gentle quiet voice that she would stay and be his friend as long as heaven would let her  he clapped his hands for joy and thanked her many times and being charged to tell no person what had passed between them gave her an earnest promise that he never would  nor did he so far as the child could learn but was her quiet companion in all her walks and musings and never again adverted to the theme which he felt had given her pain although he was unconscious of its cause  something of distrust lingered about him still for he would often come even in the dark evenings and call in a timid voice outside the door to know if she were safe within and being answered yes and bade to enter would take his station on a low stool at her feet and sit there patiently until they came to seek and take him home  sure as the morning came it found him lingering near the house to ask if she were well and morning noon or night go where she would he would forsake his playmates and his sports to bear her company  and a good little friend he is too said the old sexton to her once when his elder brother diedelder seems a strange word for he was only seven years oldi remember this one took it sorely to heart  the child thought of what the schoolmaster had told her and felt how its truth was shadowed out even in this infant  it has given him something of a quiet way i think said the old man though for that he is merry enough at times  id wager now that you and he have been listening by the old well  indeed we have not the child replied  i have been afraid to go near it for i am not often down in that part of the church and do not know the ground  come down with me said the old man  i have known it from a boy come  they descended the narrow steps which led into the crypt and paused among the gloomy arches in a dim and murky spot  this is the place said the old man  give me your hand while you throw back the cover lest you should stumble and fall in  i am too oldi mean rheumaticto stoop myself  a black and dreadful place exclaimed the child  look in said the old man pointing downward with his finger  the child complied and gazed down into the pit  it looks like a grave itself said the old man  it does replied the child  i have often had the fancy said the sexton that it might have been dug at first to make the old place more gloomy and the old monks more religious  its to be closed up and built over  the child still stood looking thoughtfully into the vault  we shall see said the sexton on what gay heads other earth will have closed when the light is shut out from here  god knows  theyll close it up next spring  the birds sing again in spring thought the child as she leaned at her casement window and gazed at the declining sun  spring a beautiful and happy time     chapter 56  a day or two after the quilp teaparty at the wilderness mr swiveller walked into sampson brasss office at the usual hour and being alone in that temple of probity placed his hat upon the desk and taking from his pocket a small parcel of black crape applied himself to folding and pinning the same upon it after the manner of a hatband having completed the construction of this appendage he surveyed his work with great complacency and put his hat on againvery much over one eye to increase the mournfulness of the effect  these arrangements perfected to his entire satisfaction he thrust his hands into his pockets and walked up and down the office with measured steps  it has always been the same with me said mr swiveller always twas ever thusfrom childhoods hour ive seen my fondest hopes decay i never loved a tree or flower but twas the first to fade away i never nursed a dear gazelle to glad me with its soft black eye but when it came to know me well and love me it was sure to marry a marketgardener  overpowered by these reflections mr swiveller stopped short at the clients chair and flung himself into its open arms  and this said mr swiveller with a kind of bantering composure is life i believe  oh certainly  why not  im quite satisfied  i shall wear added richard taking off his hat again and looking hard at it as if he were only deterred by pecuniary considerations from spurning it with his foot i shall wear this emblem of womans perfidy in remembrance of her with whom i shall never again thread the windings of the mazy whom i shall never more pledge in the rosy who during the short remainder of my existence will murder the balmy  ha ha ha  it may be necessary to observe lest there should appear any incongruity in the close of this soliloquy that mr swiveller did not wind up with a cheerful hilarious laugh which would have been undoubtedly at variance with his solemn reflections but that being in a theatrical mood he merely achieved that performance which is designated in melodramas laughing like a fiendfor it seems that your fiends always laugh in syllables and always in three syllables never more nor less which is a remarkable property in such gentry and one worthy of remembrance  the baleful sounds had hardly died away and mr swiveller was still sitting in a very grim state in the clients chair when there came a ringor if we may adapt the sound to his then humour a knellat the office bell  opening the door with all speed he beheld the expressive countenance of mr chuckster between whom and himself a fraternal greeting ensued  youre devilish early at this pestiferous old slaughterhouse said that gentleman poising himself on one leg and shaking the other in an easy manner  rather returned dick  rather retorted mr chuckster with that air of graceful trifling which so well became him  i should think so  why my good feller do you know what oclock it ishalfpast nine am in the morning  wont you come in said dick  all alone  swiveller solus  tis now the witching  hour of night  when churchyards yawn  and graves give up their dead  at the end of this quotation in dialogue each gentleman struck an attitude and immediately subsiding into prose walked into the office such morsels of enthusiasm are common among the glorious apollos and were indeed the links that bound them together and raised them above the cold dull earth  well and how are you my buck said mr chuckster taking a stool  i was forced to come into the city upon some little private matters of my own and couldnt pass the corner of the street without looking in but upon my soul i didnt expect to find you  it is so everlastingly early  mr swiveller expressed his acknowledgments and it appearing on further conversation that he was in good health and that mr chuckster was in the like enviable condition both gentlemen in compliance with a solemn custom of the ancient brotherhood to which they belonged joined in a fragment of the popular duet of alls well with a long shake at the end  and whats the news said richard  the towns as flat my dear feller replied mr chuckster as the surface of a dutch oven  theres no news  bythebye that lodger of yours is a most extraordinary person  he quite eludes the most vigorous comprehension you know  never was such a feller  what has he been doing now said dick  by jove sir returned mr chuckster taking out an oblong snuffbox the lid whereof was ornamented with a foxs head curiously carved in brass that man is an unfathomable  sir that man has made friends with our articled clerk  theres no harm in him but he is so amazingly slow and soft  now if he wanted a friend why couldnt he have one that knew a thing or two and could do him some good by his manners and conversation  i have my faults sir said mr chuckster  no no interposed mr swiveller  oh yes i have i have my faults no man knows his faults better than i know mine  but said mr chuckster im not meek  my worst enemiesevery man has his enemies sir and i have minenever accused me of being meek  and i tell you what sir if i hadnt more of these qualities that commonly endear man to man than our articled clerk has id steal a cheshire cheese tie it round my neck and drown myself  id die degraded as i had lived  i would upon my honour  mr chuckster paused rapped the foxs head exactly on the nose with the knuckle of the forefinger took a pinch of snuff and looked steadily at mr swiveller as much as to say that if he thought he was going to sneeze he would find himself mistaken  not contented sir said mr chuckster with making friends with abel he has cultivated the acquaintance of his father and mother since he came home from that wildgoose chase he has been there actually been there  he patronises young snobby besides youll find sir that hell be constantly coming backwards and forwards to this place yet i dont suppose that beyond the common forms of civility he has ever exchanged halfadozen words with me  now upon my soul you know said mr chuckster shaking his head gravely as men are wont to do when they consider things are going a little too far this is altogether such a lowminded affair that if i didnt feel for the governor and know that he could never get on without me i should be obliged to cut the connection  i should have no alternative  mr swiveller who sat on another stool opposite to his friend stirred the fire in an excess of sympathy but said nothing  as to young snob sir pursued mr chuckster with a prophetic look youll find hell turn out bad  in our profession we know something of human nature and take my word for it that the feller that came back to work out that shilling will show himself one of these days in his true colours  hes a low thief sir  he must be  mr chuckster being roused would probably have pursued this subject further and in more emphatic language but for a tap at the door which seeming to announce the arrival of somebody on business caused him to assume a greater appearance of meekness than was perhaps quite consistent with his late declaration  mr swiveller hearing the same sound caused his stool to revolve rapidly on one leg until it brought him to his desk into which having forgotten in the sudden flurry of his spirits to part with the poker he thrust it as he cried come in  who should present himself but that very kit who had been the theme of mr chucksters wrath  never did man pluck up his courage so quickly or look so fierce as mr chuckster when he found it was he  mr swiveller stared at him for a moment and then leaping from his stool and drawing out the poker from its place of concealment performed the broadsword exercise with all the cuts and guards complete in a species of frenzy  is the gentleman at home said kit rather astonished by this uncommon reception  before mr swiveller could make any reply mr chuckster took occasion to enter his indignant protest against this form of inquiry which he held to be of a disrespectful and snobbish tendency inasmuch as the inquirer seeing two gentlemen then and there present should have spoken of the other gentleman or rather for it was not impossible that the object of his search might be of inferior quality should have mentioned his name leaving it to his hearers to determine his degree as they thought proper  mr chuckster likewise remarked that he had some reason to believe this form of address was personal to himself and that he was not a man to be trifled withas certain snobs whom he did not more particularly mention or describe might find to their cost  i mean the gentleman upstairs said kit turning to richard swiveller  is he at home  why rejoined dick  because if he is i have a letter for him  from whom said dick  from mr garland  oh said dick with extreme politeness  then you may hand it over sir  and if youre to wait for an answer sir you may wait in the passage sir which is an airy and wellventilated apartment sir  thank you returned kit  but i am to give it to himself if you please  the excessive audacity of this retort so overpowered mr chuckster and so moved his tender regard for his friends honour that he declared if he were not restrained by official considerations he must certainly have annihilated kit upon the spot a resentment of the affront which he did consider under the extraordinary circumstances of aggravation attending it could but have met with the proper sanction and approval of a jury of englishmen who he had no doubt would have returned a verdict of justifiable homicide coupled with a high testimony to the morals and character of the avenger  mr swiveller without being quite so hot upon the matter was rather shamed by his friends excitement and not a little puzzled how to act kit being quite cool and goodhumoured when the single gentleman was heard to call violently down the stairs  didnt i see somebody for me come in cried the lodger  yes sir replied dick  certainly sir  then where is he roared the single gentleman  hes here sir rejoined mr swiveller  now young man dont you hear youre to go upstairs  are you deaf  kit did not appear to think it worth his while to enter into any altercation but hurried off and left the glorious apollos gazing at each other in silence  didnt i tell you so said mr chuckster  what do you think of that  mr swiveller being in the main a goodnatured fellow and not perceiving in the conduct of kit any villany of enormous magnitude scarcely knew what answer to return  he was relieved from his perplexity however by the entrance of mr sampson and his sister sally at sight of whom mr chuckster precipitately retired  mr brass and his lovely companion appeared to have been holding a consultation over their temperate breakfast upon some matter of great interest and importance  on the occasion of such conferences they generally appeared in the office some half an hour after their usual time and in a very smiling state as though their late plots and designs had tranquillised their minds and shed a light upon their toilsome way  in the present instance they seemed particularly gay miss sallys aspect being of a most oily kind and mr brass rubbing his hands in an exceedingly jocose and lighthearted manner  well mr richard said brass  how are we this morning  are we pretty fresh and cheerful sireh mr richard  pretty well sir replied dick  thats well said brass  ha ha  we should be as gay as larks mr richardwhy not  its a pleasant world we live in sir a very pleasant world  there are bad people in it mr richard but if there were no bad people there would be no good lawyers  ha ha  any letters by the post this morning mr richard  mr swiveller answered in the negative  ha said brass no matter  if theres little business today therell be more tomorrow  a contented spirit mr richard is the sweetness of existence  anybody been here sir  only my friendreplied dick  may we neer want a  friend brass chimed in quickly or a bottle to give him  ha ha thats the way the song runs isnt it  a very good song mr richard very good  i like the sentiment of it  ha ha  your friends the young man from witherdens office i thinkyesmay we neer want a nobody else at all been mr richard  only somebody to the lodger replied mr swiveller  oh indeed cried brass  somebody to the lodger eh  ha ha  may we neer want a friend or a  somebody to the lodger eh mr richard  yes said dick a little disconcerted by the excessive buoyancy of spirits which his employer displayed  with him now  with him now cried brass ha ha  there let em be merry and free toor rul rol le  eh mr richard  ha ha  oh certainly replied dick  and who said brass shuffling among his papers who is the lodgers visitornot a lady visitor i hope eh mr richard  the morals of the marks you know sirwhen lovely women stoops to follyand all thateh mr richard  another young man who belongs to witherdens too or half belongs there returned richard  kit they call him  kit eh said brass  strange namename of a dancingmasters fiddle eh mr richard  ha ha  kits there is he  oh  dick looked at miss sally wondering that she didnt check this uncommon exuberance on the part of mr sampson but as she made no attempt to do so and rather appeared to exhibit a tacit acquiescence in it he concluded that they had just been cheating somebody and receiving the bill  will you have the goodness mr richard said brass taking a letter from his desk just to step over to peckham rye with that  theres no answer but its rather particular and should go by hand  charge the office with your coachhire back you know dont spare the office get as much out of it as you canclerks mottoeh mr richard  ha ha  mr swiveller solemnly doffed the aquatic jacket put on his coat took down his hat from its peg pocketed the letter and departed  as soon as he was gone up rose miss sally brass and smiling sweetly at her brother who nodded and smote his nose in return withdrew also  sampson brass was no sooner left alone than he set the officedoor wide open and establishing himself at his desk directly opposite so that he could not fail to see anybody who came downstairs and passed out at the street door began to write with extreme cheerfulness and assiduity humming as he did so in a voice that was anything but musical certain vocal snatches which appeared to have reference to the union between church and state inasmuch as they were compounded of the evening hymn and god save the king  thus the attorney of bevis marks sat and wrote and hummed for a long time except when he stopped to listen with a very cunning face and hearing nothing went on humming louder and writing slower than ever  at length in one of these pauses he heard his lodgers door opened and shut and footsteps coming down the stairs  then mr brass left off writing entirely and with his pen in his hand hummed his very loudest shaking his head meanwhile from side to side like a man whose whole soul was in the music and smiling in a manner quite seraphic  it was towards this moving spectacle that the staircase and the sweet sounds guided kit on whose arrival before his door mr brass stopped his singing but not his smiling and nodded affably at the same time beckoning to him with his pen  kit said mr brass in the pleasantest way imaginable how do you do  kit being rather shy of his friend made a suitable reply and had his hand upon the lock of the street door when mr brass called him softly back  you are not to go if you please kit said the attorney in a mysterious and yet businesslike way  you are to step in here if you please  dear me dear me  when i look at you said the lawyer quitting his stool and standing before the fire with his back towards it i am reminded of the sweetest little face that ever my eyes beheld  i remember your coming there twice or thrice when we were in possession  ah kit my dear fellow gentleman in my profession have such painful duties to perform sometimes that you neednt envy usyou neednt indeed  i dont sir said kit though it isnt for the like of me to judge  our only consolation kit pursued the lawyer looking at him in a sort of pensive abstraction is that although we cannot turn away the wind we can soften it we can temper it if i may say so to the shorn lambs  shorn indeed thought kit  pretty close but he didnt say so  on that occasion kit said mr brass on that occasion that i have just alluded to i had a hard battle with mr quilp for mr quilp is a very hard man to obtain them the indulgence they had  it might have cost me a client  but suffering virtue inspired me and i prevailed  hes not so bad after all thought honest kit as the attorney pursed up his lips and looked like a man who was struggling with his better feelings  i respect you kit said brass with emotion  i saw enough of your conduct at that time to respect you though your station is humble and your fortune lowly  it isnt the waistcoat that i look at  it is the heart  the checks in the waistcoat are but the wires of the cage but the heart is the bird  ah  how many sich birds are perpetually moulting and putting their beaks through the wires to peck at all mankind  this poetic figure which kit took to be in a special allusion to his own checked waistcoat quite overcame him mr brasss voice and manner added not a little to its effect for he discoursed with all the mild austerity of a hermit and wanted but a cord round the waist of his rusty surtout and a skull on the chimneypiece to be completely set up in that line of business  well well said sampson smiling as good men smile when they compassionate their own weakness or that of their fellowcreatures this is wide of the bullseye  youre to take that if you please as he spoke he pointed to a couple of halfcrowns on the desk  kit looked at the coins and then at sampson and hesitated  for yourself said brass  from  no matter about the person they came from replied the lawyer  say me if you like  we have eccentric friends overhead kit and we mustnt ask questions or talk too muchyou understand  youre to take them thats all and between you and me i dont think theyll be the last youll have to take from the same place  i hope not  good bye kit  good bye  with many thanks and many more selfreproaches for having on such slight grounds suspected one who in their very first conversation turned out such a different man from what he had supposed kit took the money and made the best of his way home  mr brass remained airing himself at the fire and resumed his vocal exercise and his seraphic smile simultaneously  may i come in said miss sally peeping  oh yes you may come in returned her brother  ahem coughed miss brass interrogatively  why yes returned sampson i should say as good as done     chapter 57  mr chucksters indignant apprehensions were not without foundation certainly the friendship between the single gentleman and mr garland was not suffered to cool but had a rapid growth and flourished exceedingly  they were soon in habits of constant intercourse and communication and the single gentleman labouring at this time under a slight attack of illnessthe consequence most probably of his late excited feelings and subsequent disappointmentfurnished a reason for their holding yet more frequent correspondence so that some one of the inmates of abel cottage finchley came backwards and forwards between that place and bevis marks almost every day  as the pony had now thrown off all disguise and without any mincing of the matter or beating about the bush sturdily refused to be driven by anybody but kit it generally happened that whether old mr garland came or mr abel kit was of the party  of all messages and inquiries kit was in right of his position the bearer thus it came about that while the single gentleman remained indisposed kit turned into bevis marks every morning with nearly as much regularity as the general postman  mr sampson brass who no doubt had his reasons for looking sharply about him soon learnt to distinguish the ponys trot and the clatter of the little chaise at the corner of the street  whenever the sound reached his ears he would immediately lay down his pen and fall to rubbing his hands and exhibiting the greatest glee  ha ha he would cry  heres the pony again  most remarkable pony extremely docile eh mr richard eh sir  dick would return some matterofcourse reply and mr brass standing on the bottom rail of his stool so as to get a view of the street over the top of the windowblind would take an observation of the visitors  the old gentleman again he would exclaim a very prepossessing old gentleman mr richardcharming countenance sirextremely calmbenevolence in every feature sir  he quite realises my idea of king lear as he appeared when in possession of his kingdom mr richardthe same good humour the same white hair and partial baldness the same liability to be imposed upon  ah  a sweet subject for contemplation sir very sweet  then mr garland having alighted and gone upstairs sampson would nod and smile to kit from the window and presently walk out into the street to greet him when some such conversation as the following would ensue  admirably groomed kitmr brass is patting the ponydoes you great creditamazingly sleek and bright to be sure  he literally looks as if he had been varnished all over  kit touches his hat smiles pats the pony himself and expresses his conviction that mr brass will not find many like him  a beautiful animal indeed cries brass  sagacious too  bless you replies kit he knows what you say to him as well as a christian does  does he indeed cries brass who has heard the same thing in the same place from the same person in the same words a dozen times but is paralysed with astonishment notwithstanding  dear me  i little thought the first time i saw him sir says kit pleased with the attorneys strong interest in his favourite that i should come to be as intimate with him as i am now  ah rejoins mr brass brimfull of moral precepts and love of virtue a charming subject of reflection for you very charming  a subject of proper pride and congratulation christopher  honesty is the best policyi always find it so myself  i lost fortyseven pound ten by being honest this morning  but its all gain its gain  mr brass slyly tickles his nose with his pen and looks at kit with the water standing in his eyes  kit thinks that if ever there was a good man who belied his appearance that man is sampson brass  a man says sampson who loses fortyseven pound ten in one morning by his honesty is a man to be envied  if it had been eighty pound the luxuriousness of feeling would have been increased  every pound lost would have been a hundredweight of happiness gained  the still small voice christopher cries brass smiling and tapping himself on the bosom is asinging comic songs within me and all is happiness and joy  kit is so improved by the conversation and finds it go so completely home to his feelings that he is considering what he shall say when mr garland appears  the old gentleman is helped into the chaise with great obsequiousness by mr sampson brass and the pony after shaking his head several times and standing for three or four minutes with all his four legs planted firmly on the ground as if he had made up his mind never to stir from that spot but there to live and die suddenly darts off without the smallest notice at the rate of twelve english miles an hour  then mr brass and his sister who has joined him at the door exchange an odd kind of smilenot at all a pleasant one in its expressionand return to the society of mr richard swiveller who during their absence has been regaling himself with various feats of pantomime and is discovered at his desk in a very flushed and heated condition violently scratching out nothing with half a penknife  whenever kit came alone and without the chaise it always happened that sampson brass was reminded of some mission calling mr swiveller if not to peckham rye again at all events to some pretty distant place from which he could not be expected to return for two or three hours or in all probability a much longer period as that gentleman was not to say the truth renowned for using great expedition on such occasions but rather for protracting and spinning out the time to the very utmost limit of possibility  mr swiveller out of sight miss sally immediately withdrew  mr brass would then set the officedoor wide open hum his old tune with great gaiety of heart and smile seraphically as before  kit coming downstairs would be called in entertained with some moral and agreeable conversation perhaps entreated to mind the office for an instant while mr brass stepped over the way and afterwards presented with one or two halfcrowns as the case might be  this occurred so often that kit nothing doubting but that they came from the single gentleman who had already rewarded his mother with great liberality could not enough admire his generosity and bought so many cheap presents for her and for little jacob and for the baby and for barbara to boot that one or other of them was having some new trifle every day of their lives  while these acts and deeds were in progress in and out of the office of sampson brass richard swiveller being often left alone therein began to find the time hang heavy on his hands  for the better preservation of his cheerfulness therefore and to prevent his faculties from rusting he provided himself with a cribbageboard and pack of cards and accustomed himself to play at cribbage with a dummy for twenty thirty or sometimes even fifty thousand pounds aside besides many hazardous bets to a considerable amount  as these games were very silently conducted notwithstanding the magnitude of the interests involved mr swiveller began to think that on those evenings when mr and miss brass were out and they often went out now he heard a kind of snorting or hardbreathing sound in the direction of the door which it occurred to him after some reflection must proceed from the small servant who always had a cold from damp living  looking intently that way one night he plainly distinguished an eye gleaming and glistening at the keyhole and having now no doubt that his suspicions were correct he stole softly to the door and pounced upon her before she was aware of his approach  oh i didnt mean any harm indeed upon my word i didnt cried the small servant struggling like a much larger one  its so very dull downstairs please dont you tell upon me please dont  tell upon you said dick  do you mean to say you were looking through the keyhole for company  yes upon my word i was replied the small servant  how long have you been cooling your eye there said dick  oh ever since you first began to play them cards and long before  vague recollections of several fantastic exercises with which he had refreshed himself after the fatigues of business and to all of which no doubt the small servant was a party rather disconcerted mr swiveller but he was not very sensitive on such points and recovered himself speedily  wellcome inhe said after a little consideration  heresit down and ill teach you how to play  oh i durstnt do it rejoined the small servant miss sally ud kill me if she knowd i come up here  have you got a fire downstairs said dick  a very little one replied the small servant  miss sally couldnt kill me if she knowd i went down there so ill come said richard putting the cards into his pocket  why how thin you are  what do you mean by it  it aint my fault  could you eat any bread and meat said dick taking down his hat yes  ah i thought so  did you ever taste beer i had a sip of it once said the small servant  heres a state of things cried mr swiveller raising his eyes to the ceiling  she never tasted itit cant be tasted in a sip  why how old are you  i dont know  mr swiveller opened his eyes very wide and appeared thoughtful for a moment then bidding the child mind the door until he came back vanished straightway  presently he returned followed by the boy from the publichouse who bore in one hand a plate of bread and beef and in the other a great pot filled with some very fragrant compound which sent forth a grateful steam and was indeed choice purl made after a particular recipe which mr swiveller had imparted to the landlord at a period when he was deep in his books and desirous to conciliate his friendship  relieving the boy of his burden at the door and charging his little companion to fasten it to prevent surprise mr swiveller followed her into the kitchen  there said richard putting the plate before her  first of all clear that off and then youll see whats next  the small servant needed no second bidding and the plate was soon empty  next said dick handing the purl take a pull at that but moderate your transports you know for youre not used to it  well is it good  oh isnt it said the small servant  mr swiveller appeared gratified beyond all expression by this reply and took a long draught himself steadfastly regarding his companion while he did so  these preliminaries disposed of he applied himself to teaching her the game which she soon learnt tolerably well being both sharpwitted and cunning  now said mr swiveller putting two sixpences into a saucer and trimming the wretched candle when the cards had been cut and dealt those are the stakes  if you win you get em all  if i win i get em  to make it seem more real and pleasant i shall call you the marchioness do you hear  the small servant nodded  then marchioness said mr swiveller fire away  the marchioness holding her cards very tight in both hands considered which to play and mr swiveller assuming the gay and fashionable air which such society required took another pull at the tankard and waited for her lead     chapter 58  mr swiveller and his partner played several rubbers with varying success until the loss of three sixpences the gradual sinking of the purl and the striking of ten oclock combined to render that gentleman mindful of the flight of time and the expediency of withdrawing before mr sampson and miss sally brass returned  with which object in view marchioness said mr swiveller gravely i shall ask your ladyships permission to put the board in my pocket and to retire from the presence when i have finished this tankard merely observing marchioness that since life like a river is flowing i care not how fast it rolls on maam on while such purl on the bank still is growing and such eyes light the waves as they run  marchioness your health  you will excuse my wearing my hat but the palace is damp and the marble floor isif i may be allowed the expressionsloppy  as a precaution against this latter inconvenience mr swiveller had been sitting for some time with his feet on the hob in which attitude he now gave utterance to these apologetic observations and slowly sipped the last choice drops of nectar  the baron sampsono brasso and his fair sister are you tell me at the play said mr swiveller leaning his left arm heavily upon the table and raising his voice and his right leg after the manner of a theatrical bandit  the marchioness nodded  ha said mr swiveller with a portentous frown  tis well marchionessbut no matter  some wine there  ho he illustrated these melodramatic morsels by handing the tankard to himself with great humility receiving it haughtily drinking from it thirstily and smacking his lips fiercely  the small servant who was not so well acquainted with theatrical conventionalities as mr swiveller having indeed never seen a play or heard one spoken of except by chance through chinks of doors and in other forbidden places was rather alarmed by demonstrations so novel in their nature and showed her concern so plainly in her looks that mr swiveller felt it necessary to discharge his brigand manner for one more suitable to private life as he asked  do they often go where glory waits em and leave you here  oh yes i believe you they do returned the small servant  miss sallys such a oneer for that she is  such a what said dick  such a oneer returned the marchioness  after a moments reflection mr swiveller determined to forego his responsible duty of setting her right and to suffer her to talk on as it was evident that her tongue was loosened by the purl and her opportunities for conversation were not so frequent as to render a momentary check of little consequence  they sometimes go to see mr quilp said the small servant with a shrewd look they go to a many places bless you  is mr brass a wunner said dick  not half what miss sally is he isnt replied the small servant shaking her head  bless you hed never do anything without her  oh  he wouldnt wouldnt he said dick  miss sally keeps him in such order said the small servant he always asks her advice he does and he catches it sometimes  bless you you wouldnt believe how much he catches it  i suppose said dick that they consult together a good deal and talk about a great many peopleabout me for instance sometimes eh marchioness  the marchioness nodded amazingly  complimentary said mr swiveller  the marchioness changed the motion of her head which had not yet left off nodding and suddenly began to shake it from side to side with a vehemence which threatened to dislocate her neck  humph dick muttered  would it be any breach of confidence marchioness to relate what they say of the humble individual who has now the honour to  miss sally says youre a funny chap replied his friend  well marchioness said mr swiveller thats not uncomplimentary merriment marchioness is not a bad or a degrading quality  old king cole was himself a merry old soul if we may put any faith in the pages of history  but she says pursued his companion that you ant to be trusted  why really marchioness said mr swiveller thoughtfully several ladies and gentlemennot exactly professional persons but tradespeople maam tradespeoplehave made the same remark  the obscure citizen who keeps the hotel over the way inclined strongly to that opinion tonight when i ordered him to prepare the banquet  its a popular prejudice marchioness and yet i am sure i dont know why for i have been trusted in my time to a considerable amount and i can safely say that i never forsook my trust until it deserted menever mr brass is of the same opinion i suppose  his friend nodded again with a cunning look which seemed to hint that mr brass held stronger opinions on the subject than his sister and seeming to recollect herself added imploringly but dont you ever tell upon me or i shall be beat to death  marchioness said mr swiveller rising the word of a gentleman is as good as his bondsometimes better as in the present case where his bond might prove but a doubtful sort of security  i am your friend and i hope we shall play many more rubbers together in this same saloon  but marchioness added richard stopping in his way to the door and wheeling slowly round upon the small servant who was following with the candle it occurs to me that you must be in the constant habit of airing your eye at keyholes to know all this  i only wanted replied the trembling marchioness to know where the key of the safe was hid that was all and i wouldnt have taken much if i had found itonly enough to squench my hunger  you didnt find it then said dick  but of course you didnt or youd be plumper  good night marchioness  fare thee well and if for ever then for ever fare thee welland put up the chain marchioness in case of accidents  with this parting injunction mr swiveller emerged from the house and feeling that he had by this time taken quite as much to drink as promised to be good for his constitution purl being a rather strong and heady compound wisely resolved to betake himself to his lodgings and to bed at once  homeward he went therefore and his apartments for he still retained the plural fiction being at no great distance from the office he was soon seated in his own bedchamber where having pulled off one boot and forgotten the other he fell into deep cogitation  this marchioness said mr swiveller folding his arms is a very extraordinary personsurrounded by mysteries ignorant of the taste of beer unacquainted with her own name which is less remarkable and taking a limited view of society through the keyholes of doorscan these things be her destiny or has some unknown person started an opposition to the decrees of fate  it is a most inscrutable and unmitigated staggerer  when his meditations had attained this satisfactory point he became aware of his remaining boot of which with unimpaired solemnity he proceeded to divest himself shaking his head with exceeding gravity all the time and sighing deeply  these rubbers said mr swiveller putting on his nightcap in exactly the same style as he wore his hat remind me of the matrimonial fireside  cheggss wife plays cribbage allfours likewise  she rings the changes on em now  from sport to sport they hurry her to banish her regrets and when they win a smile from her they think that she forgetsbut she dont  by this time i should say added richard getting his left cheek into profile and looking complacently at the reflection of a very little scrap of whisker in the lookingglass by this time i should say the iron has entered into her soul  it serves her right  melting from this stern and obdurate into the tender and pathetic mood mr swiveller groaned a little walked wildly up and down and even made a show of tearing his hair which however he thought better of and wrenched the tassel from his nightcap instead  at last undressing himself with a gloomy resolution he got into bed  some men in his blighted position would have taken to drinking but as mr swiveller had taken to that before he only took on receiving the news that sophy wackles was lost to him for ever to playing the flute thinking after mature consideration that it was a good sound dismal occupation not only in unison with his own sad thoughts but calculated to awaken a fellowfeeling in the bosoms of his neighbours in pursuance of this resolution he now drew a little table to his bedside and arranging the light and a small oblong musicbook to the best advantage took his flute from its box and began to play most mournfully  the air was away with melancholya composition which when it is played very slowly on the flute in bed with the further disadvantage of being performed by a gentleman but imperfectly acquainted with the instrument who repeats one note a great many times before he can find the next has not a lively effect  yet for half the night or more mr swiveller lying sometimes on his back with his eyes upon the ceiling and sometimes half out of bed to correct himself by the book played this unhappy tune over and over again never leaving off save for a minute or two at a time to take breath and soliloquise about the marchioness and then beginning again with renewed vigour  it was not until he had quite exhausted his several subjects of meditation and had breathed into the flute the whole sentiment of the purl down to its very dregs and had nearly maddened the people of the house and at both the next doors and over the waythat he shut up the musicbook extinguished the candle and finding himself greatly lightened and relieved in his mind turned round and fell asleep  he awoke in the morning much refreshed and having taken half an hours exercise at the flute and graciously received a notice to quit from his landlady who had been in waiting on the stairs for that purpose since the dawn of day repaired to bevis marks where the beautiful sally was already at her post bearing in her looks a radiance mild as that which beameth from the virgin moon  mr swiveller acknowledged her presence by a nod and exchanged his coat for the aquatic jacket which usually took some time fitting on for in consequence of a tightness in the sleeves it was only to be got into by a series of struggles  this difficulty overcome he took his seat at the desk  i sayquoth miss brass abruptly breaking silence you havent seen a silver pencilcase this morning have you  i didnt meet many in the street rejoined mr swiveller  i saw onea stout pencilcase of respectable appearancebut as he was in company with an elderly penknife and a young toothpick with whom he was in earnest conversation i felt a delicacy in speaking to him  no but have you returned miss brass  seriously you know  what a dull dog you must be to ask me such a question seriously said mr swiveller  havent i this moment come  well all i know is replied miss sally that its not to be found and that it disappeared one day this week when i left it on the desk  halloa thought richard i hope the marchioness hasnt been at work here  there was a knife too said miss sally of the same pattern  they were given to me by my father years ago and are both gone  you havent missed anything yourself have you  mr swiveller involuntarily clapped his hands to the jacket to be quite sure that it was a jacket and not a skirted coat and having satisfied himself of the safety of this his only moveable in bevis marks made answer in the negative  its a very unpleasant thing dick said miss brass pulling out the tin box and refreshing herself with a pinch of snuff but between you and mebetween friends you know for if sammy knew it i should never hear the last of itsome of the officemoney too that has been left about has gone in the same way  in particular i have missed three halfcrowns at three different times  you dont mean that cried dick  be careful what you say old boy for this is a serious matter  are you quite sure  is there no mistake  it is so and there cant be any mistake at all rejoined miss brass emphatically  then by jove thought richard laying down his pen i am afraid the marchioness is done for  the more he discussed the subject in his thoughts the more probable it appeared to dick that the miserable little servant was the culprit when he considered on what a spare allowance of food she lived how neglected and untaught she was and how her natural cunning had been sharpened by necessity and privation he scarcely doubted it  and yet he pitied her so much and felt so unwilling to have a matter of such gravity disturbing the oddity of their acquaintance that he thought and thought truly that rather than receive fifty pounds down he would have the marchioness proved innocent  while he was plunged in very profound and serious meditation upon this theme miss sally sat shaking her head with an air of great mystery and doubt when the voice of her brother sampson carolling a cheerful strain was heard in the passage and that gentleman himself beaming with virtuous smiles appeared  mr richard sir good morning  here we are again sir entering upon another day with our bodies strengthened by slumber and breakfast and our spirits fresh and flowing  here we are mr richard rising with the sun to run our little courseour course of duty sirand like him to get through our days work with credit to ourselves and advantage to our fellowcreatures  a charming reflection sir very charming  while he addressed his clerk in these words mr brass was somewhat ostentatiously engaged in minutely examining and holding up against the light a fivepound bank note which he had brought in in his hand  mr richard not receiving his remarks with anything like enthusiasm his employer turned his eyes to his face and observed that it wore a troubled expression  youre out of spirits sir said brass  mr richard sir we should fall to work cheerfully and not in a despondent state  it becomes us mr richard sir to  here the chaste sarah heaved a loud sigh  dear me said mr sampson you too  is anything the matter  mr richard sir  dick glancing at miss sally saw that she was making signals to him to acquaint her brother with the subject of their recent conversation as his own position was not a very pleasant one until the matter was set at rest one way or other he did so and miss brass plying her snuffbox at a most wasteful rate corroborated his account  the countenance of sampson fell and anxiety overspread his features instead of passionately bewailing the loss of his money as miss sally had expected he walked on tiptoe to the door opened it looked outside shut it softly returned on tiptoe and said in a whisper  this is a most extraordinary and painful circumstancemr richard sir a most painful circumstance  the fact is that i myself have missed several small sums from the desk of late and have refrained from mentioning it hoping that accident would discover the offender but it has not done soit has not done so  sallymr richard sirthis is a particularly distressing affair  as sampson spoke he laid the banknote upon the desk among some papers in an absent manner and thrust his hands into his pockets richard swiveller pointed to it and admonished him to take it up  no mr richard sir rejoined brass with emotion i will not take it up  i will let it lie there sir  to take it up mr richard sir would imply a doubt of you and in you sir i have unlimited confidence  we will let it lie there sir if you please and we will not take it up by any means  with that mr brass patted him twice or thrice on the shoulder in a most friendly manner and entreated him to believe that he had as much faith in his honesty as he had in his own  although at another time mr swiveller might have looked upon this as a doubtful compliment he felt it under the thenexisting circumstances a great relief to be assured that he was not wrongfully suspected when he had made a suitable reply mr brass wrung him by the hand and fell into a brown study as did miss sally likewise  richard too remained in a thoughtful state fearing every moment to hear the marchioness impeached and unable to resist the conviction that she must be guilty  when they had severally remained in this condition for some minutes miss sally all at once gave a loud rap upon the desk with her clenched fist and cried ive hit itas indeed she had and chipped a piece out of it too but that was not her meaning  well cried brass anxiously  go on will you  why replied his sister with an air of triumph hasnt there been somebody always coming in and out of this office for the last three or four weeks hasnt that somebody been left alone in it sometimesthanks to you and do you mean to tell me that that somebody isnt the thief  what somebody blustered brass  why what do you call himkit  mr garlands young man  to be sure  never cried brass  never  ill not hear of it  dont tell mesaid sampson shaking his head and working with both his hands as if he were clearing away ten thousand cobwebs  ill never believe it of him  never  i say repeated miss brass taking another pinch of snuff that hes the thief  i say returned sampson violently that he is not  what do you mean  how dare you  are characters to be whispered away like this do you know that hes the honestest and faithfullest fellow that ever lived and that he has an irreproachable good name  come in come in  these last words were not addressed to miss sally though they partook of the tone in which the indignant remonstrances that preceded them had been uttered  they were addressed to some person who had knocked at the officedoor and they had hardly passed the lips of mr brass when this very kit himself looked in  is the gentleman upstairs sir if you please  yes kit said brass still fired with an honest indignation and frowning with knotted brows upon his sister yes kit he is  i am glad to see you kit i am rejoiced to see you  look in again as you come downstairs kit  that lad a robber cried brass when he had withdrawn with that frank and open countenance  id trust him with untold gold  mr richard sir have the goodness to step directly to wrasp and cos in broad street and inquire if they have had instructions to appear in carkem and painter  that lad a robber sneered sampson flushed and heated with his wrath  am i blind deaf silly do i know nothing of human nature when i see it before me  kit a robber  bah  flinging this final interjection at miss sally with immeasurable scorn and contempt sampson brass thrust his head into his desk as if to shut the base world from his view and breathed defiance from under its halfclosed lid     chapter 59  when kit having discharged his errand came downstairs from the single gentlemans apartment after the lapse of a quarter of an hour or so mr sampson brass was alone in the office  he was not singing as usual nor was he seated at his desk  the open door showed him standing before the fire with his back towards it and looking so very strange that kit supposed he must have been suddenly taken ill  is anything the matter sir said kit  matter cried brass  no  why anything the matter  you are so very pale said kit that i should hardly have known you  pooh pooh mere fancy cried brass stooping to throw up the cinders never better kit never better in all my life  merry too  ha ha hows our friend abovestairs eh  a great deal better said kit  im glad to hear it rejoined brass thankful i may say  an excellent gentlemanworthy liberal generous gives very little troublean admirable lodger  ha ha  mr garlandhes well i hope kitand the ponymy friend my particular friend you know  ha ha  kit gave a satisfactory account of all the little household at abel cottage  mr brass who seemed remarkably inattentive and impatient mounted on his stool and beckoning him to come nearer took him by the buttonhole  i have been thinking kit said the lawyer that i could throw some little emoluments in your mothers wayyou have a mother i think  if i recollect right you told me  oh yes sir yes certainly  a widow i think an industrious widow  a harderworking woman or a better mother never lived sir  ah cried brass  thats affecting truly affecting  a poor widow struggling to maintain her orphans in decency and comfort is a delicious picture of human goodnessput down your hat kit  thank you sir i must be going directly  put it down while you stay at any rate said brass taking it from him and making some confusion among the papers in finding a place for it on the desk  i was thinking kit that we have often houses to let for people we are concerned for and matters of that sort  now you know were obliged to put people into those houses to take care of emvery often undeserving people that we cant depend upon  whats to prevent our having a person that we can depend upon and enjoying the delight of doing a good action at the same time  i say whats to prevent our employing this worthy woman your mother  what with one job and another theres lodgingand good lodging toopretty well all the year round rent free and a weekly allowance besides kit that would provide her with a great many comforts she dont at present enjoy  now what do you think of that  do you see any objection  my only desire is to serve you kit therefore if you do say so freely  as brass spoke he moved the hat twice or thrice and shuffled among the papers again as if in search of something  how can i see any objection to such a kind offer sir replied kit with his whole heart  i dont know how to thank you sir i dont indeed  why then said brass suddenly turning upon him and thrusting his face close to kits with such a repulsive smile that the latter even in the very height of his gratitude drew back quite startled  why then its done  kit looked at him in some confusion  done i say added sampson rubbing his hands and veiling himself again in his usual oily manner  ha ha and so you shall find kit so you shall find  but dear me said brass what a time mr richard is gone  a sad loiterer to be sure  will you mind the office one minute while i run upstairs  only one minute  ill not detain you an instant longer on any account kit  talking as he went mr brass bustled out of the office and in a very short time returned  mr swiveller came back almost at the same instant and as kit was leaving the room hastily to make up for lost time miss brass herself encountered him in the doorway  oh sneered sally looking after him as she entered  there goes your pet sammy eh  ah  there he goes replied brass  my pet if you please  an honest fellow mr richard sira worthy fellow indeed  hem coughed miss brass  i tell you you aggravating vagabond said the angry sampson that id stake my life upon his honesty  am i never to hear the last of this  am i always to be baited and beset by your mean suspicions have you no regard for true merit you malignant fellow  if you come to that id sooner suspect your honesty than his  miss sally pulled out the tin snuffbox and took a long slow pinch regarding her brother with a steady gaze all the time  she drives me wild mr richard sir said brass she exasperates me beyond all bearing  i am heated and excited sir i know i am  these are not business manners sir nor business looks but she carries me out of myself  why dont you leave him alone said dick  because she cant sir retorted brass because to chafe and vex me is a part of her nature sir and she will and must do it or i dont believe shed have her health  but never mind said brass never mind  ive carried my point  ive shown my confidence in the lad  he has minded the office again  ha ha  ugh you viper  the beautiful virgin took another pinch and put the snuffbox in her pocket still looking at her brother with perfect composure  he has minded the office again said brass triumphantly he has had my confidence and he shall continue to have it hewhy wheres the  what have you lost inquired mr swiveller  dear me said brass slapping all his pockets one after another and looking into his desk and under it and upon it and wildly tossing the papers about the note mr richard sir the fivepound notewhat can have become of it  i laid it down heregod bless me  what cried miss sally starting up clapping her hands and scattering the papers on the floor  gone  now whos right  now whos got it  never mind five poundswhats five pounds  hes honest you know quite honest  it would be mean to suspect him dont run after him  no no not for the world  is it really gone though said dick looking at brass with a face as pale as his own  upon my word mr richard sir replied the lawyer feeling in all his pockets with looks of the greatest agitation i fear this is a black business  its certainly gone sir  whats to be done  dont run after him said miss sally taking more snuff  dont run after him on any account  give him time to get rid of it you know it would be cruel to find him out  mr swiveller and sampson brass looked from miss sally to each other in a state of bewilderment and then as by one impulse caught up their hats and rushed out into the streetdarting along in the middle of the road and dashing aside all obstructions as though they were running for their lives  it happened that kit had been running too though not so fast and having the start of them by some few minutes was a good distance ahead  as they were pretty certain of the road he must have taken however and kept on at a great pace they came up with him at the very moment when he had taken breath and was breaking into a run again  stop cried sampson laying his hand on one shoulder while mr swiveller pounced upon the other  not so fast sir  youre in a hurry  yes i am said kit looking from one to the other in great surprise  iican hardly believe it panted sampson but something of value is missing from the office  i hope you dont know what  know what good heaven mr brass cried kit trembling from head to foot you dont suppose  no no rejoined brass quickly i dont suppose anything  dont say i said you did  youll come back quietly i hope  of course i will returned kit  why not  to be sure said brass  why not  i hope there may turn out to be no why not  if you knew the trouble ive been in this morning through taking your part christopher youd be sorry for it  and i am sure youll be sorry for having suspected me sir replied kit  come  let us make haste back  certainly cried brass the quicker the better  mr richardhave the goodness sir to take that arm  ill take this one  its not easy walking three abreast but under these circumstances it must be done sir theres no help for it  kit did turn from white to red and from red to white again when they secured him thus and for a moment seemed disposed to resist  but quickly recollecting himself and remembering that if he made any struggle he would perhaps be dragged by the collar through the public streets he only repeated with great earnestness and with the tears standing in his eyes that they would be sorry for thisand suffered them to lead him off  while they were on the way back mr swiveller upon whom his present functions sat very irksomely took an opportunity of whispering in his ear that if he would confess his guilt even by so much as a nod and promise not to do so any more he would connive at his kicking sampson brass on the shins and escaping up a court but kit indignantly rejecting this proposal mr richard had nothing for it but to hold him tight until they reached bevis marks and ushered him into the presence of the charming sarah who immediately took the precaution of locking the door  now you know said brass if this is a case of innocence it is a case of that description christopher where the fullest disclosure is the best satisfaction for everybody  therefore if youll consent to an examination he demonstrated what kind of examination he meant by turning back the cuffs of his coat it will be a comfortable and pleasant thing for all parties  search me said kit proudly holding up his arms  but mind siri know youll be sorry for this to the last day of your life  it is certainly a very painful occurrence said brass with a sigh as he dived into one of kits pockets and fished up a miscellaneous collection of small articles very painful  nothing here mr richard sir all perfectly satisfactory  nor here sir  nor in the waistcoat mr richard nor in the coat tails  so far i am rejoiced i am sure  richard swiveller holding kits hat in his hand was watching the proceedings with great interest and bore upon his face the slightest possible indication of a smile as brass shutting one of his eyes looked with the other up the inside of one of the poor fellows sleeves as if it were a telescopewhen sampson turning hastily to him bade him search the hat  heres a handkerchief said dick  no harm in that sir rejoined brass applying his eye to the other sleeve and speaking in the voice of one who was contemplating an immense extent of prospect  no harm in a handkerchief sir whatever the faculty dont consider it a healthy custom i believe mr richard to carry ones handkerchief in ones hati have heard that it keeps the head too warmbut in every other point of view its being there is extremely satisfactoryextremely so  an exclamation at once from richard swiveller miss sally and kit himself cut the lawyer short  he turned his head and saw dick standing with the banknote in his hand  in the hat cried brass in a sort of shriek  under the handkerchief and tucked beneath the lining said dick aghast at the discovery  mr brass looked at him at his sister at the walls at the ceiling at the flooreverywhere but at kit who stood quite stupefied and motionless  and this cried sampson clasping his hands is the world that turns upon its own axis and has lunar influences and revolutions round heavenly bodies and various games of that sort  this is human natur is it  oh natur natur  this is the miscreant that i was going to benefit with all my little arts and that even now i feel so much for as to wish to let him go  but added mr brass with greater fortitude i am myself a lawyer and bound to set an example in carrying the laws of my happy country into effect  sally my dear forgive me and catch hold of him on the other side  mr richard sir have the goodness to run and fetch a constable  the weakness is past and over sir and moral strength returns  a constable sir if you please     chapter 60  kit stood as one entranced with his eyes opened wide and fixed upon the ground regardless alike of the tremulous hold which mr brass maintained on one side of his cravat and of the firmer grasp of miss sally upon the other although this latter detention was in itself no small inconvenience as that fascinating woman besides screwing her knuckles inconveniently into his throat from time to time had fastened upon him in the first instance with so tight a grip that even in the disorder and distraction of his thoughts he could not divest himself of an uneasy sense of choking  between the brother and sister he remained in this posture quite unresisting and passive until mr swiveller returned with a police constable at his heels  this functionary being of course well used to such scenes looking upon all kinds of robbery from petty larceny up to housebreaking or ventures on the highway as matters in the regular course of business and regarding the perpetrators in the light of so many customers coming to be served at the wholesale and retail shop of criminal law where he stood behind the counter received mr brasss statement of facts with about as much interest and surprise as an undertaker might evince if required to listen to a circumstantial account of the last illness of a person whom he was called in to wait upon professionally and took kit into custody with a decent indifference  we had better said this subordinate minister of justice get to the office while theres a magistrate sitting  i shall want you to come along with us mr brass and the he looked at miss sally as if in some doubt whether she might not be a griffin or other fabulous monster  the lady eh said sampson  ah replied the constable  yesthe lady  likewise the young man that found the property  mr richard sir said brass in a mournful voice  a sad necessity but the altar of our country sir  youll have a hackneycoach i suppose interrupted the constable holding kit whom his other captors had released carelessly by the arm a little above the elbow  be so good as send for one will you  but hear me speak a word cried kit raising his eyes and looking imploringly about him  hear me speak a word  i am no more guilty than any one of you  upon my soul i am not  i a thief  oh mr brass you know me better  i am sure you know me better  this is not right of you indeed  i give you my word constable said brass  but here the constable interposed with the constitutional principle words be blowed observing that words were but spoonmeat for babes and sucklings and that oaths were the food for strong men  quite true constable assented brass in the same mournful tone strictly correct  i give you my oath constable that down to a few minutes ago when this fatal discovery was made i had such confidence in that lad that id have trusted him witha hackneycoach mr richard sir youre very slow sir  who is there that knows me cried kit that would not trust me that does not ask anybody whether they have ever doubted me whether i have ever wronged them of a farthing  was i ever once dishonest when i was poor and hungry and is it likely i would begin now  oh consider what you do  how can i meet the kindest friends that ever human creature had with this dreadful charge upon me  mr brass rejoined that it would have been well for the prisoner if he had thought of that before and was about to make some other gloomy observations when the voice of the single gentleman was heard demanding from abovestairs what was the matter and what was the cause of all that noise and hurry  kit made an involuntary start towards the door in his anxiety to answer for himself but being speedily detained by the constable had the agony of seeing sampson brass run out alone to tell the story in his own way  and he can hardly believe it either said sampson when he returned nor nobody will  i wish i could doubt the evidence of my senses but their depositions are unimpeachable  its of no use crossexamining my eyes cried sampson winking and rubbing them they stick to their first account and will  now sarah i hear the coach in the marks get on your bonnet and well be off  a sad errand a moral funeral quite  mr brass said kit  do me one favour  take me to mr witherdens first  sampson shook his head irresolutely  do said kit  my masters there  for heavens sake take me there first  well i dont know stammered brass who perhaps had his reasons for wishing to show as fair as possible in the eyes of the notary  how do we stand in point of time constable eh  the constable who had been chewing a straw all this while with great philosophy replied that if they went away at once they would have time enough but that if they stood shillyshallying there any longer they must go straight to the mansion house and finally expressed his opinion that that was where it was and that was all about it  mr richard swiveller having arrived inside the coach and still remaining immoveable in the most commodious corner with his face to the horses mr brass instructed the officer to remove his prisoner and declared himself quite ready  therefore the constable still holding kit in the same manner and pushing him on a little before him so as to keep him at about threequarters of an arms length in advance which is the professional mode thrust him into the vehicle and followed himself  miss sally entered next and there being now four inside sampson brass got upon the box and made the coachman drive on  still completely stunned by the sudden and terrible change which had taken place in his affairs kit sat gazing out of the coach window almost hoping to see some monstrous phenomenon in the streets which might give him reason to believe he was in a dream  alas  everything was too real and familiar the same succession of turnings the same houses the same streams of people running side by side in different directions upon the pavement the same bustle of carts and carriages in the road the same wellremembered objects in the shop windows a regularity in the very noise and hurry which no dream ever mirrored dreamlike as the story was it was true  he stood charged with robbery the note had been found upon him though he was innocent in thought and deed and they were carrying him back a prisoner  absorbed in these painful ruminations thinking with a drooping heart of his mother and little jacob feeling as though even the consciousness of innocence would be insufficient to support him in the presence of his friends if they believed him guilty and sinking in hope and courage more and more as they drew nearer to the notarys poor kit was looking earnestly out of the window observant of nothingwhen all at once as though it had been conjured up by magic he became aware of the face of quilp  and what a leer there was upon the face  it was from the open window of a tavern that it looked out and the dwarf had so spread himself over it with his elbows on the windowsill and his head resting on both his hands that what between this attitude and his being swoln with suppressed laughter he looked puffed and bloated into twice his usual breadth  mr brass on recognising him immediately stopped the coach  as it came to a halt directly opposite to where he stood the dwarf pulled off his hat and saluted the party with a hideous and grotesque politeness  aha he cried  where now brass where now sally with you too  sweet sally  and dick  pleasant dick  and kit honest kit  hes extremely cheerful said brass to the coachman  very much so ah sira sad business  never believe in honesty any more sir  why not returned the dwarf  why not you rogue of a lawyer why not  banknote lost in our office sir said brass shaking his head found in his hat sirhe previously left alone thereno mistake at all sirchain of evidence completenot a link wanting  what cried the dwarf leaning half his body out of window  kit a thief  kit a thief  ha ha ha  why hes an uglierlooking thief than can be seen anywhere for a penny  eh kiteh  ha ha ha  have you taken kit into custody before he had time and opportunity to beat me eh kit eh  and with that he burst into a yell of laughter manifestly to the great terror of the coachman and pointed to a dyers pole hard by where a dangling suit of clothes bore some resemblance to a man upon a gibbet  is it coming to that kit cried the dwarf rubbing his hands violently  ha ha ha ha  what a disappointment for little jacob and for his darling mother  let him have the bethel minister to comfort and console him brass  eh kit eh  drive on coachey drive on  bye bye kit all good go with you keep up your spirits my love to the garlandsthe dear old lady and gentleman  say i inquired after em will you  blessings on em on you and on everybody kit  blessings on all the world  with such good wishes and farewells poured out in a rapid torrent until they were out of hearing quilp suffered them to depart and when he could see the coach no longer drew in his head and rolled upon the ground in an ecstacy of enjoyment  when they reached the notarys which they were not long in doing for they had encountered the dwarf in a bye street at a very little distance from the house mr brass dismounted and opening the coach door with a melancholy visage requested his sister to accompany him into the office with the view of preparing the good people within for the mournful intelligence that awaited them  miss sally complying he desired mr swiveller to accompany them  so into the office they went mr sampson and his sister arminarm and mr swiveller following alone  the notary was standing before the fire in the outer office talking to mr abel and the elder mr garland while mr chuckster sat writing at the desk picking up such crumbs of their conversation as happened to fall in his way  this posture of affairs mr brass observed through the glassdoor as he was turning the handle and seeing that the notary recognised him he began to shake his head and sigh deeply while that partition yet divided them  sir said sampson taking off his hat and kissing the two forefingers of his right hand beaver glove my name is brassbrass of bevis marks sir  i have had the honour and pleasure sir of being concerned against you in some little testamentary matters  how do you do sir  my clerk will attend to any business you may have come upon mr brass said the notary turning away  thank you sir said brass thank you i am sure  allow me sir to introduce my sisterquite one of us sir although of the weaker sexof great use in my business sir i assure you  mr richard sir have the goodness to come foward if you pleaseno really said brass stepping between the notary and his private office towards which he had begun to retreat and speaking in the tone of an injured man really sir i must under favour request a word or two with you indeed  mr brass said the other in a decided tone i am engaged  you see that i am occupied with these gentlemen  if you will communicate your business to mr chuckster yonder you will receive every attention  gentlemen said brass laying his right hand on his waistcoat and looking towards the father and son with a smooth smilegentlemen i appeal to youreally gentlemenconsider i beg of you  i am of the law  i am styled gentleman by act of parliament  i maintain the title by the annual payment of twelve pound sterling for a certificate i am not one of your players of music stage actors writers of books or painters of pictures who assume a station that the laws of their country dont recognise  i am none of your strollers or vagabonds  if any man brings his action against me he must describe me as a gentleman or his action is null and void  i appeal to youis this quite respectful  really gentlemen  well will you have the goodness to state your business then mr brass said the notary  sir rejoined brass i will  ah mr witherden you little know thebut i will not be tempted to travel from the point sir i believe the name of one of these gentlemen is garland  of both said the notary  indeed rejoined brass cringing excessively  but i might have known that from the uncommon likeness  extremely happy i am sure to have the honour of an introduction to two such gentlemen although the occasion is a most painful one  one of you gentlemen has a servant called kit  both replied the notary  two kits said brass smiling  dear me  one kit sir returned mr witherden angrily who is employed by both gentlemen  what of him  this of him sir rejoined brass dropping his voice impressively that young man sir that i have felt unbounded and unlimited confidence in and always behaved to as if he was my equalthat young man has this morning committed a robbery in my office and been taken almost in the fact  this must be some falsehood cried the notary  it is not possible said mr abel  ill not believe one word of it exclaimed the old gentleman  mr brass looked mildly round upon them and rejoined  mr witherden sir your words are actionable and if i was a man of low and mean standing who couldnt afford to be slandered i should proceed for damages  howsever sir being what i am i merely scorn such expressions  the honest warmth of the other gentleman i respect and im truly sorry to be the messenger of such unpleasant news  i shouldnt have put myself in this painful position i assure you but that the lad himself desired to be brought here in the first instance and i yielded to his prayers  mr chuckster sir will you have the goodness to tap at the window for the constable thats waiting in the coach  the three gentlemen looked at each other with blank faces when these words were uttered and mr chuckster doing as he was desired and leaping off his stool with something of the excitement of an inspired prophet whose foretellings had in the fulness of time been realised held the door open for the entrance of the wretched captive  such a scene as there was when kit came in and bursting into the rude eloquence with which truth at length inspired him called heaven to witness that he was innocent and that how the property came to be found upon him he knew not  such a confusion of tongues before the circumstances were related and the proofs disclosed  such a dead silence when all was told and his three friends exchanged looks of doubt and amazement  is it not possible said mr witherden after a long pause that this note may have found its way into the hat by some accidentsuch as the removal of papers on the desk for instance  but this was clearly shown to be quite impossible  mr swiveller though an unwilling witness could not help proving to demonstration from the position in which it was found that it must have been designedly secreted  its very distressing said brass immensely distressing i am sure when he comes to be tried i shall be very happy to recommend him to mercy on account of his previous good character  i did lose money before certainly but it doesnt quite follow that he took it  the presumptions against himstrongly against himbut were christians i hope  i suppose said the constable looking round that no gentleman here can give evidence as to whether hes been flush of money of late do you happen to know sir  he has had money from time to time certainly returned mr garland to whom the man had put the question  but that as he always told me was given him by mr brass himself  yes to be sure said kit eagerly  you can bear me out in that sir  eh cried brass looking from face to face with an expression of stupid amazement  the money you know the halfcrowns that you gave mefrom the lodger said kit  oh dear me cried brass shaking his head and frowning heavily this is a bad case i find a very bad case indeed  what  did you give him no money on account of anybody sir asked mr garland with great anxiety  i give him money sir returned sampson  oh come you know this is too barefaced  constable my good fellow we had better be going  what shrieked kit  does he deny that he did ask him somebody pray  ask him to tell you whether he did or not  did you sir asked the notary  i tell you what gentlemen replied brass in a very grave manner hell not serve his case this way and really if you feel any interest in him you had better advise him to go upon some other tack did i sir  of course i never did  gentlemen cried kit on whom a light broke suddenly master mr abel mr witherden every one of youhe did it  what i have done to offend him i dont know but this is a plot to ruin me  mind gentlemen its a plot and whatever comes of it i will say with my dying breath that he put that note in my hat himself  look at him gentlemen see how he changes colour  which of us looks the guilty personhe or i  you hear him gentlemen said brass smiling you hear him  now does this case strike you as assuming rather a black complexion or does it not  is it at all a treacherous case do you think or is it one of mere ordinary guilt  perhaps gentlemen if he had not said this in your presence and i had reported it youd have held this to be impossible likewise eh  with such pacific and bantering remarks did mr brass refute the foul aspersion on his character but the virtuous sarah moved by stronger feelings and having at heart perhaps a more jealous regard for the honour of her family flew from her brothers side without any previous intimation of her design and darted at the prisoner with the utmost fury  it would undoubtedly have gone hard with kits face but that the wary constable foreseeing her design drew him aside at the critical moment and thus placed mr chuckster in circumstances of some jeopardy for that gentleman happening to be next the object of miss brasss wrath and rage being like love and fortune blind was pounced upon by the fair enslaver and had a false collar plucked up by the roots and his hair very much dishevelled before the exertions of the company could make her sensible of her mistake  the constable taking warning by this desperate attack and thinking perhaps that it would be more satisfactory to the ends of justice if the prisoner were taken before a magistrate whole rather than in small pieces led him back to the hackneycoach without more ado and moreover insisted on miss brass becoming an outside passenger to which proposal the charming creature after a little angry discussion yielded her consent and so took her brother sampsons place upon the box mr brass with some reluctance agreeing to occupy her seat inside these arrangements perfected they drove to the justiceroom with all speed followed by the notary and his two friends in another coach  mr chuckster alone was left behindgreatly to his indignation for he held the evidence he could have given relative to kits returning to work out the shilling to be so very material as bearing upon his hypocritical and designing character that he considered its suppression little better than a compromise of felony  at the justiceroom they found the single gentleman who had gone straight there and was expecting them with desperate impatience  but not fifty single gentlemen rolled into one could have helped poor kit who in half an hour afterwards was committed for trial and was assured by a friendly officer on his way to prison that there was no occasion to be cast down for the sessions would soon be on and he would in all likelihood get his little affair disposed of and be comfortably transported in less than a fortnight     chapter 61  let moralists and philosophers say what they may it is very questionable whether a guilty man would have felt half as much misery that night as kit did being innocent  the world being in the constant commission of vast quantities of injustice is a little too apt to comfort itself with the idea that if the victim of its falsehood and malice have a clear conscience he cannot fail to be sustained under his trials and somehow or other to come right at last in which case say they who have hunted him down though we certainly dont expect itnobody will be better pleased than we  whereas the world would do well to reflect that injustice is in itself to every generous and properly constituted mind an injury of all others the most insufferable the most torturing and the most hard to bear and that many clear consciences have gone to their account elsewhere and many sound hearts have broken because of this very reason the knowledge of their own deserts only aggravating their sufferings and rendering them the less endurable  the world however was not in fault in kits case  but kit was innocent and knowing this and feeling that his best friends deemed him guiltythat mr and mrs garland would look upon him as a monster of ingratitudethat barbara would associate him with all that was bad and criminalthat the pony would consider himself forsakenand that even his own mother might perhaps yield to the strong appearances against him and believe him to be the wretch he seemedknowing and feeling all this he experienced at first an agony of mind which no words can describe and walked up and down the little cell in which he was locked up for the night almost beside himself with grief  even when the violence of these emotions had in some degree subsided and he was beginning to grow more calm there came into his mind a new thought the anguish of which was scarcely less  the childthe bright star of the simple fellows lifeshe who always came back upon him like a beautiful dreamwho had made the poorest part of his existence the happiest and bestwho had ever been so gentle and considerate and goodif she were ever to hear of this what would she think  as this idea occurred to him the walls of the prison seemed to melt away and the old place to reveal itself in their stead as it was wont to be on winter nightsthe fireside the little supper table the old mans hat and coat and stickthe halfopened door leading to her little roomthey were all there  and nell herself was there and heboth laughing heartily as they had often doneand when he had got as far as this kit could go no farther but flung himself upon his poor bedstead and wept  it was a long night which seemed as though it would have no end but he slept too and dreamedalways of being at liberty and roving about now with one person and now with another but ever with a vague dread of being recalled to prison not that prison but one which was in itself a dim ideanot of a place but of a care and sorrow of something oppressive and always present and yet impossible to define at last the morning dawned and there was the jail itselfcold black and dreary and very real indeed  he was left to himself however and there was comfort in that  he had liberty to walk in a small paved yard at a certain hour and learnt from the turnkey who came to unlock his cell and show him where to wash that there was a regular time for visiting every day and that if any of his friends came to see him he would be fetched down to the grate  when he had given him this information and a tin porringer containing his breakfast the man locked him up again and went clattering along the stone passage opening and shutting a great many other doors and raising numberless loud echoes which resounded through the building for a long time as if they were in prison too and unable to get out  this turnkey had given him to understand that he was lodged like some few others in the jail apart from the mass of prisoners because he was not supposed to be utterly depraved and irreclaimable and had never occupied apartments in that mansion before  kit was thankful for this indulgence and sat reading the church catechism very attentively though he had known it by heart from a little child until he heard the key in the lock and the man entered again  now then he said come on  where to sir asked kit  the man contented himself by briefly replying wisitors and taking him by the arm in exactly the same manner as the constable had done the day before led him through several winding ways and strong gates into a passage where he placed him at a grating and turned upon his heel  beyond this grating at the distance of about four or five feet was another exactly like it  in the space between sat a turnkey reading a newspaper and outside the further railing kit saw with a palpitating heart his mother with the baby in her arms barbaras mother with her neverfailing umbrella and poor little jacob staring in with all his might as though he were looking for the bird or the wild beast and thought the men were mere accidents with whom the bars could have no possible concern  but when little jacob saw his brother and thrusting his arms between the rails to hug him found that he came no nearer but still stood afar off with his head resting on the arm by which he held to one of the bars he began to cry most piteously whereupon kits mother and barbaras mother who had restrained themselves as much as possible burst out sobbing and weeping afresh  poor kit could not help joining them and not one of them could speak a word  during this melancholy pause the turnkey read his newspaper with a waggish look he had evidently got among the facetious paragraphs until happening to take his eyes off for an instant as if to get by dint of contemplation at the very marrow of some joke of a deeper sort than the rest it appeared to occur to him for the first time that somebody was crying  now ladies ladies he said looking round with surprise id advise you not to waste time like this  its allowanced here you know  you mustnt let that child make that noise either  its against all rules  im his poor mother sirsobbed mrs nubbles curtseying humbly and this is his brother sir  oh dear me dear me  well replied the turnkey folding his paper on his knee so as to get with greater convenience at the top of the next column  it cant be helped you know  he aint the only one in the same fix  you mustnt make a noise about it  with that he went on reading  the man was not unnaturally cruel or hardhearted  he had come to look upon felony as a kind of disorder like the scarlet fever or erysipelas some people had itsome hadntjust as it might be  oh my darling kit said his mother whom barbaras mother had charitably relieved of the baby that i should see my poor boy here  you dont believe that i did what they accuse me of mother dear cried kit in a choking voice  i believe it exclaimed the poor woman i that never knew you tell a lie or do a bad action from your cradlethat have never had a moments sorrow on your account except it was the poor meals that you have taken with such good humour and content that i forgot how little there was when i thought how kind and thoughtful you were though you were but a childi believe it of the son thats been a comfort to me from the hour of his birth until this time and that i never laid down one night in anger with  i believe it of you kit  why then thank god said kit clutching the bars with an earnestness that shook them and i can bear it mother  come what may i shall always have one drop of happiness in my heart when i think that you said that  at this the poor woman fell acrying again and barbaras mother too and little jacob whose disjointed thoughts had by this time resolved themselves into a pretty distinct impression that kit couldnt go out for a walk if he wanted and that there were no birds lions tigers or other natural curiosities behind those barsnothing indeed but a caged brotheradded his tears to theirs with as little noise as possible  kits mother drying her eyes and moistening them poor soul more than she dried them now took from the ground a small basket and submissively addressed herself to the turnkey saying would he please to listen to her for a minute  the turnkey being in the very crisis and passion of a joke motioned to her with his hand to keep silent one minute longer for her life  nor did he remove his hand into its former posture but kept it in the same warning attitude until he had finished the paragraph when he paused for a few seconds with a smile upon his face as who should say this editor is a comical bladea funny dog and then asked her what she wanted  i have brought him a little something to eat said the good woman if you please sir might he have it  yeshe may have it  theres no rule against that  give it to me when you go and ill take care he has it  no but if you please sirdont be angry with me siri am his mother and you had a mother onceif i might only see him eat a little bit i should go away so much more satisfied that he was all comfortable  and again the tears of kits mother burst forth and of barbaras mother and of little jacob  as to the baby it was crowing and laughing with its mightunder the idea apparently that the whole scene had been invented and got up for its particular satisfaction  the turnkey looked as if he thought the request a strange one and rather out of the common way but nevertheless he laid down his paper and coming round where kits mother stood took the basket from her and after inspecting its contents handed it to kit and went back to his place  it may be easily conceived that the prisoner had no great appetite but he sat down on the ground and ate as hard as he could while at every morsel he put into his mouth his mother sobbed and wept afresh though with a softened grief that bespoke the satisfaction the sight afforded her  while he was thus engaged kit made some anxious inquiries about his employers and whether they had expressed any opinion concerning him but all he could learn was that mr abel had himself broken the intelligence to his mother with great kindness and delicacy late on the previous night but had himself expressed no opinion of his innocence or guilt  kit was on the point of mustering courage to ask barbaras mother about barbara when the turnkey who had conducted him reappeared a second turnkey appeared behind his visitors and the third turnkey with the newspaper cried times upadding in the same breath now for the next party and then plunging deep into his newspaper again  kit was taken off in an instant with a blessing from his mother and a scream from little jacob ringing in his ears  as he was crossing the next yard with the basket in his hand under the guidance of his former conductor another officer called to them to stop and came up with a pint pot of porter in his hand  this is christopher nubbles isnt it that come in last night for felony said the man  his comrade replied that this was the chicken in question  then heres your beer said the other man to christopher  what are you looking at  there ant a discharge in it  i beg your pardon said kit  who sent it me  why your friend replied the man  youre to have it every day he says  and so you will if he pays for it  my friend repeated kit  youre all abroad seemingly returned the other man  theres his letter  take hold  kit took it and when he was locked up again read as follows  drink of this cup youll find theres a spell in its every drop gainst the ills of mortality  talk of the cordial that sparkled for helen  her cup was a fiction but this is reality barclay and cosif they ever send it in a flat state complain to the governor  yours r s  r s said kit after some consideration  it must be mr richard swiveller  well its very kind of him and i thank him heartily     chapter 62  a faint light twinkling from the window of the countinghouse on quilps wharf and looking inflamed and red through the nightfog as though it suffered from it like an eye forewarned mr sampson brass as he approached the wooden cabin with a cautious step that the excellent proprietor his esteemed client was inside and probably waiting with his accustomed patience and sweetness of temper the fulfilment of the appointment which now brought mr brass within his fair domain  a treacherous place to pick ones steps in of a dark night muttered sampson as he stumbled for the twentieth time over some stray lumber and limped in pain  i believe that boy strews the ground differently every day on purpose to bruise and maim one unless his master does it with his own hands which is more than likely  i hate to come to this place without sally  shes more protection than a dozen men  as he paid this compliment to the merit of the absent charmer mr brass came to a halt looking doubtfully towards the light and over his shoulder  whats he about i wonder murmured the lawyer standing on tiptoe and endeavouring to obtain a glimpse of what was passing inside which at that distance was impossibledrinking i supposemaking himself more fiery and furious and heating his malice and mischievousness till they boil  im always afraid to come here by myself when his accounts a pretty large one  i dont believe hed mind throttling me and dropping me softly into the river when the tide was at its strongest any more than hed mind killing a ratindeed i dont know whether he wouldnt consider it a pleasant joke  hark  now hes singing  mr quilp was certainly entertaining himself with vocal exercise but it was rather a kind of chant than a song being a monotonous repetition of one sentence in a very rapid manner with a long stress upon the last word which he swelled into a dismal roar  nor did the burden of this performance bear any reference to love or war or wine or loyalty or any other the standard topics of song but to a subject not often set to music or generally known in ballads the words being thesethe worthy magistrate after remarking that the prisoner would find some difficulty in persuading a jury to believe his tale committed him to take his trial at the approaching sessions and directed the customary recognisances to be entered into for the prosecution  every time he came to this concluding word and had exhausted all possible stress upon it quilp burst into a shriek of laughter and began again  hes dreadfully imprudent muttered brass after he had listened to two or three repetitions of the chant  horribly imprudent  i wish he was dumb  i wish he was deaf  i wish he was blind  hang him cried brass as the chant began again  i wish he was dead  giving utterance to these friendly aspirations in behalf of his client mr sampson composed his face into its usual state of smoothness and waiting until the shriek came again and was dying away went up to the wooden house and knocked at the door  come in cried the dwarf  how do you do tonight sir said sampson peeping in  ha ha ha how do you do sir  oh dear me how very whimsical  amazingly whimsical to be sure  come in you fool returned the dwarf and dont stand there shaking your head and showing your teeth  come in you false witness you perjurer you suborner of evidence come in  he has the richest humour cried brass shutting the door behind him the most amazing vein of comicality  but isnt it rather injudicious sir  what demanded quilp  what judas  judas cried brass  he has such extraordinary spirits  his humour is so extremely playful  judas  oh yesdear me how very good  ha ha ha all this time sampson was rubbing his hands and staring with ludicrous surprise and dismay at a great goggleeyed bluntnosed figurehead of some old ship which was reared up against the wall in a corner near the stove looking like a goblin or hideous idol whom the dwarf worshipped  a mass of timber on its head carved into the dim and distant semblance of a cocked hat together with a representation of a star on the left breast and epaulettes on the shoulders denoted that it was intended for the effigy of some famous admiral but without those helps any observer might have supposed it the authentic portrait of a distinguished merman or great seamonster  being originally much too large for the apartment which it was now employed to decorate it had been sawn short off at the waist  even in this state it reached from floor to ceiling and thrusting itself forward with that excessively wideawake aspect and air of somewhat obtrusive politeness by which figureheads are usually characterised seemed to reduce everything else to mere pigmy proportions  do you know it said the dwarf watching sampsons eyes  do you see the likeness  eh said brass holding his head on one side and throwing it a little back as connoisseurs do  now i look at it again i fancy i see ayes there certainly is something in the smile that reminds me ofand yet upon my word i  now the fact was that sampson having never seen anything in the smallest degree resembling this substantial phantom was much perplexed being uncertain whether mr quilp considered it like himself and had therefore bought it for a family portrait or whether he was pleased to consider it as the likeness of some enemy  he was not very long in doubt for while he was surveying it with that knowing look which people assume when they are contemplating for the first time portraits which they ought to recognise but dont the dwarf threw down the newspaper from which he had been chanting the words already quoted and seizing a rusty iron bar which he used in lieu of poker dealt the figure such a stroke on the nose that it rocked again  is it like kitis it his picture his image his very self cried the dwarf aiming a shower of blows at the insensible countenance and covering it with deep dimples  is it the exact model and counterpart of the dogis itis itis it  and with every repetition of the question he battered the great image until the perspiration streamed down his face with the violence of the exercise  although this might have been a very comical thing to look at from a secure gallery as a bullfight is found to be a comfortable spectacle by those who are not in the arena and a house on fire is better than a play to people who dont live near it there was something in the earnestness of mr quilps manner which made his legal adviser feel that the countinghouse was a little too small and a deal too lonely for the complete enjoyment of these humours  therefore he stood as far off as he could while the dwarf was thus engaged whimpering out but feeble applause and when quilp left off and sat down again from pure exhaustion approached with more obsequiousness than ever  excellent indeed cried brass  he he  oh very good sir  you know said sampson looking round as if in appeal to the bruised animal hes quite a remarkable manquite  sit down said the dwarf  i bought the dog yesterday  ive been screwing gimlets into him and sticking forks in his eyes and cutting my name on him  i mean to burn him at last  ha ha cried brass  extremely entertaining indeed  come here said quilp beckoning him to draw near  whats injudicious hey  nothing sirnothing  scarcely worth mentioning sir but i thought that songadmirably humorous in itself you knowwas perhaps rather  yes said quilp rather what  just bordering or as one may say remotely verging upon the confines of injudiciousness perhaps sir returned brass looking timidly at the dwarfs cunning eyes which were turned towards the fire and reflected its red light  why inquired quilp without looking up  why you know sir returned brass venturing to be more familiar the fact is sir that any allusion to these little combinings together of friends for objects in themselves extremely laudable but which the law terms conspiracies areyou take me sirbest kept snug and among friends you know  eh said quilp looking up with a perfectly vacant countenance what do you mean  cautious exceedingly cautious very right and proper cried brass nodding his head  mum sir even heremy meaning sir exactly  your meaning exactly you brazen scarecrowwhats your meaning retorted quilp  why do you talk to me of combining together  do i combine  do i know anything about your combinings  no no sircertainly not not by any means returned brass  if you so wink and nod at me said the dwarf looking about him as if for his poker ill spoil the expression of your monkeys face i will dont put yourself out of the way i beg sir rejoined brass checking himself with great alacrity  youre quite right sir quite right  i shouldnt have mentioned the subject sir  its much better not to  youre quite right sir  let us change it if you please you were asking sir sally told me about our lodger  he has not returned sir  no said quilp heating some rum in a little saucepan and watching it to prevent its boiling over  why not  why sir returned brass hedear me mr quilp sir  whats the matter said the dwarf stopping his hand in the act of carrying the saucepan to his mouth  you have forgotten the water sir said brass  andexcuse me sirbut its burning hot  deigning no other than a practical answer to this remonstrance mr quilp raised the hot saucepan to his lips and deliberately drank off all the spirit it contained which might have been in quantity about half a pint and had been but a moment before when he took it off the fire bubbling and hissing fiercely  having swallowed this gentle stimulant and shaken his fist at the admiral he bade mr brass proceed  but first said quilp with his accustomed grin have a drop yourselfa nice dropa good warm fiery drop  why sir replied brass if there was such a thing as a mouthful of water that could be got without trouble  theres no such thing to be had here cried the dwarf  water for lawyers  melted lead and brimstone you mean nice hot blistering pitch and tarthats the thing for themeh brass eh  ha ha ha laughed mr brass  oh very biting and yet its like being tickledtheres a pleasure in it too sir  drink that said the dwarf who had by this time heated some more toss it off dont leave any heeltap scorch your throat and be happy  the wretched sampson took a few short sips of the liquor which immediately distilled itself into burning tears and in that form came rolling down his cheeks into the pipkin again turning the colour of his face and eyelids to a deep red and giving rise to a violent fit of coughing in the midst of which he was still heard to declare with the constancy of a martyr that it was beautiful indeed  while he was yet in unspeakable agonies the dwarf renewed their conversation  the lodger said quilp what about him he is still sir returned brass with intervals of coughing stopping with the garland family  he has only been home once sir since the day of the examination of that culprit  he informed mr richard sir that he couldnt bear the house after what had taken place that he was wretched in it and that he looked upon himself as being in a certain kind of way the cause of the occurrencea very excellent lodger sir i hope we may not lose him  yah cried the dwarf  never thinking of anybody but yourselfwhy dont you retrench thenscrape up hoard economise eh  why sir replied brass upon my word i think sarahs as good an economiser as any going  i do indeed mr quilp  moisten your clay wet the other eye drink man cried the dwarf you took a clerk to oblige me  delighted sir i am sure at any time replied sampson  yes sir i did  then now you may discharge him said quilp  theres a means of retrenchment for you at once  discharge mr richard sir cried brass  have you more than one clerk you parrot that you ask the question yes  upon my word sir said brass i wasnt prepared for this  how could you be sneered the dwarf when i wasnt  how often am i to tell you that i brought him to you that i might always have my eye on him and know where he wasand that i had a plot a scheme a little quiet piece of enjoyment afoot of which the very cream and essence was that this old man and grandchild who have sunk underground i think should be while he and his precious friend believed them rich in reality as poor as frozen rats  i quite understood that sir rejoined brass  thoroughly  well sir retorted quilp and do you understand now that theyre not poorthat they cant be if they have such men as your lodger searching for them and scouring the country far and wide  of course i do sir said sampson  of course you do retorted the dwarf viciously snapping at his words  of course do you understand then that its no matter what comes of this fellow of course do you understand that for any other purpose hes no man for me nor for you  i have frequently said to sarah sir returned brass that he was of no use at all in the business  you cant put any confidence in him sir  if youll believe me ive found that fellow in the commonest little matters of the office that have been trusted to him blurting out the truth though expressly cautioned  the aggravation of that chap sir has exceeded anything you can imagine it has indeed nothing but the respect and obligation i owe to you sir  as it was plain that sampson was bent on a complimentary harangue unless he received a timely interruption mr quilp politely tapped him on the crown of his head with the little saucepan and requested that he would be so obliging as to hold his peace  practical sir practical said brass rubbing the place and smiling but still extremely pleasantimmensely so  hearken to me will you returned quilp or ill be a little more pleasant presently  theres no chance of his comrade and friend returning  the scamp has been obliged to fly as i learn for some knavery and has found his way abroad  let him rot there  certainly sir  quite properforcible cried brass glancing at the admiral again as if he made a third in company  extremely forcible  i hate him said quilp between his teeth and have always hated him for family reasons  besides he was an intractable ruffian otherwise he would have been of use  this fellow is pigeonhearted and lightheaded  i dont want him any longer  let him hang or drownstarvego to the devil  by all means sir returned brass  when would you wish him sir toha hato make that little excursion  when this trials over said quilp  as soon as thats ended send him about his business  it shall be done sir returned brass by all means  it will be rather a blow to sarah sir but she has all her feelings under control  ah mr quilp i often think sir if it had only pleased providence to bring you and sarah together in earlier life what blessed results would have flowed from such a union  you never saw our dear father sira charming gentleman  sarah was his pride and joy sir  he would have closed his eyes in bliss would foxey mr quilp if he could have found her such a partner  you esteem her sir  i love her croaked the dwarf  youre very good sir returned brass i am sure  is there any other order sir that i can take a note of besides this little matter of mr richard  none replied the dwarf seizing the saucepan  let us drink the lovely sarah  if we could do it in something sir that wasnt quite boiling suggested brass humbly perhaps it would be better  i think it will be more agreeable to sarahs feelings when she comes to hear from me of the honour you have done her if she learns it was in liquor rather cooler than the last sir  but to these remonstrances mr quilp turned a deaf ear  sampson brass who was by this time anything but sober being compelled to take further draughts of the same strong bowl found that instead of at all contributing to his recovery they had the novel effect of making the countinghouse spin round and round with extreme velocity and causing the floor and ceiling to heave in a very distressing manner  after a brief stupor he awoke to a consciousness of being partly under the table and partly under the grate  this position not being the most comfortable one he could have chosen for himself he managed to stagger to his feet and holding on by the admiral looked round for his host  mr brasss first impression was that his host was gone and had left him there aloneperhaps locked him in for the night  a strong smell of tobacco however suggested a new train of ideas he looked upward and saw that the dwarf was smoking in his hammock  good bye sir cried brass faintly  good bye sir  wont you stop all night said the dwarf peeping out  do stop all night  i couldnt indeed sir replied brass who was almost dead from nausea and the closeness of the room  if youd have the goodness to show me a light so that i may see my way across the yard sir  quilp was out in an instant not with his legs first or his head first or his arms first but bodilyaltogether  to be sure he said taking up a lantern which was now the only light in the place  be careful how you go my dear friend  be sure to pick your way among the timber for all the rusty nails are upwards theres a dog in the lane  he bit a man last night and a woman the night before and last tuesday he killed a childbut that was in play dont go too near him  which side of the road is he sir asked brass in great dismay  he lives on the right hand said quilp but sometimes he hides on the left ready for a spring  hes uncertain in that respect  mind you take care of yourself  ill never forgive you if you dont theres the light outnever mindyou know the waystraight on quilp had slily shaded the light by holding it against his breast and now stood chuckling and shaking from head to foot in a rapture of delight as he heard the lawyer stumbling up the yard and now and then falling heavily down  at length however he got quit of the place and was out of hearing  the dwarf shut himself up again and sprang once more into his hammock     chapter 63  the professional gentleman who had given kit the consolatory piece of information relative to the settlement of his trifle of business at the old bailey and the probability of its being very soon disposed of turned out to be quite correct in his prognostications  in eight days time the sessions commenced  in one day afterwards the grand jury found a true bill against christopher nubbles for felony and in two days from that finding the aforesaid christopher nubbles was called upon to plead guilty or not guilty to an indictment for that he the said christopher did feloniously abstract and steal from the dwellinghouse and office of one sampson brass gentleman one bank note for five pounds issued by the governor and company of the bank of england in contravention of the statutes in that case made and provided and against the peace of our sovereign lord the king his crown and dignity  to this indictment christopher nubbles in a low and trembling voice pleaded not guilty and here let those who are in the habit of forming hasty judgments from appearances and who would have had christopher if innocent speak out very strong and loud observe that confinement and anxiety will subdue the stoutest hearts and that to one who has been close shut up though it be only for ten or eleven days seeing but stone walls and a very few stony faces the sudden entrance into a great hall filled with life is a rather disconcerting and startling circumstance  to this it must be added that life in a wig is to a large class of people much more terrifying and impressive than life with its own head of hair and if in addition to these considerations there be taken into account kits natural emotion on seeing the two mr garlands and the little notary looking on with pale and anxious faces it will perhaps seem matter of no very great wonder that he should have been rather out of sorts and unable to make himself quite at home  although he had never seen either of the mr garlands or mr witherden since the time of his arrest he had been given to understand that they had employed counsel for him  therefore when one of the gentlemen in wigs got up and said i am for the prisoner my lord kit made him a bow and when another gentleman in a wig got up and said and im against him my lord kit trembled very much and bowed to him too and didnt he hope in his own heart that his gentleman was a match for the other gentleman and would make him ashamed of himself in no time  the gentleman who was against him had to speak first and being in dreadfully good spirits for he had in the last trial very nearly procured the acquittal of a young gentleman who had had the misfortune to murder his father he spoke up you may be sure telling the jury that if they acquitted this prisoner they must expect to suffer no less pangs and agonies than he had told the other jury they would certainly undergo if they convicted that prisoner  and when he had told them all about the case and that he had never known a worse case he stopped a little while like a man who had something terrible to tell them and then said that he understood an attempt would be made by his learned friend and here he looked sideways at kits gentleman to impeach the testimony of those immaculate witnesses whom he should call before them but he did hope and trust that his learned friend would have a greater respect and veneration for the character of the prosecutor than whom as he well knew there did not exist and never had existed a more honourable member of that most honourable profession to which he was attached  and then he said did the jury know bevis marks  and if they did know bevis marks as he trusted for their own character they did did they know the historical and elevating associations connected with that most remarkable spot  did they believe that a man like brass could reside in a place like bevis marks and not be a virtuous and most upright character  and when he had said a great deal to them on this point he remembered that it was an insult to their understandings to make any remarks on what they must have felt so strongly without him and therefore called sampson brass into the witnessbox straightway  then up comes mr brass very brisk and fresh and having bowed to the judge like a man who has had the pleasure of seeing him before and who hopes he has been pretty well since their last meeting folds his arms and looks at his gentleman as much as to say here i amfull of evidencetap me  and the gentleman does tap him presently and with great discretion too drawing off the evidence by little and little and making it run quite clear and bright in the eyes of all present then kits gentleman takes him in hand but can make nothing of him and after a great many very long questions and very short answers mr sampson brass goes down in glory  to him succeeds sarah who in like manner is easy to be managed by mr brasss gentleman but very obdurate to kits  in short kits gentleman can get nothing out of her but a repetition of what she has said before only a little stronger this time as against his client and therefore lets her go in some confusion  then mr brasss gentleman calls richard swiveller and richard swiveller appears accordingly  now mr brasss gentleman has it whispered in his ear that this witness is disposed to be friendly to the prisonerwhich to say the truth he is rather glad to hear as his strength is considered to lie in what is familiarly termed badgering  wherefore he begins by requesting the officer to be quite sure that this witness kisses the book then goes to work at him tooth and nail  mr swiveller says this gentleman to dick when he had told his tale with evident reluctance and a desire to make the best of it pray sir where did you dine yesterdaywhere did i dine yesterdayaye sir where did you dine yesterdaywas it near here siroh to be sureyesjust over the wayto be sure  yes  just over the way repeats mr brasss gentleman with a glance at the courtalone siri beg your pardon says mr swiveller who has not caught the questionalone sir repeats mr brasss gentleman in a voice of thunder did you dine alone  did you treat anybody sir comeoh yes to be sureyes i did says mr swiveller with a smilehave the goodness to banish a levity sir which is very illsuited to the place in which you stand though perhaps you have reason to be thankful that its only that place says mr brasss gentleman with a nod of the head insinuating that the dock is mr swivellers legitimate sphere of action and attend to me  you were waiting about here yesterday in expectation that this trial was coming on  you dined over the way you treated somebody  now was that somebody brother to the prisoner at the barmr swiveller is proceeding to explainyes or no sir cries mr brasss gentlemanbut will you allow meyes or no siryes it was butyes it was cries the gentleman taking him up short  and a very pretty witness you are  down sits mr brasss gentleman  kits gentleman not knowing how the matter really stands is afraid to pursue the subject  richard swiveller retires abashed  judge jury and spectators have visions of his lounging about with an illlooking largewhiskered dissolute young fellow of six feet high  the reality is little jacob with the calves of his legs exposed to the open air and himself tied up in a shawl  nobody knows the truth everybody believes a falsehood and all because of the ingenuity of mr brasss gentleman  then come the witnesses to character and here mr brasss gentleman shines again  it turns out that mr garland has had no character with kit no recommendation of him but from his own mother and that he was suddenly dismissed by his former master for unknown reasons  really mr garland says mr brasss gentleman for a person who has arrived at your time of life you are to say the least of it singularly indiscreet i think  the jury think so too and find kit guilty  he is taken off humbly protesting his innocence  the spectators settle themselves in their places with renewed attention for there are several female witnesses to be examined in the next case and it has been rumoured that mr brasss gentleman will make great fun in crossexamining them for the prisoner  kits mother poor woman is waiting at the grate below stairs accompanied by barbaras mother who honest soul never does anything but cry and hold the baby and a sad interview ensues  the newspaperreading turnkey has told them all  he dont think it will be transportation for life because theres time to prove the good character yet and that is sure to serve him  he wonders what he did it for  he never did it cries kits mother  well says the turnkey i wont contradict you  its all one now whether he did it or not  kits mother can reach his hand through the bars and she clasps it god and those to whom he has given such tenderness only know in how much agony  kit bids her keep a good heart and under pretence of having the children lifted up to kiss him prays barbaras mother in a whisper to take her home  some friend will rise up for us mother cried kit i am sure  if not now before long  my innocence will come out mother and i shall be brought back again i feel confidence in that  you must teach little jacob and the baby how all this was for if they thought i had ever been dishonest when they grew old enough to understand it would break my heart to know it if i was thousands of miles awayoh is there no good gentleman here who will take care of her  the hand slips out of his for the poor creature sinks down upon the earth insensible  richard swiveller comes hastily up elbows the bystanders out of the way takes her after some trouble in one arm after the manner of theatrical ravishers and nodding to kit and commanding barbaras mother to follow for he has a coach waiting bears her swiftly off  well richard took her home  and what astonishing absurdities in the way of quotation from song and poem he perpetrated on the road no man knows  he took her home and stayed till she was recovered and having no money to pay the coach went back in state to bevis marks bidding the driver for it was saturday night wait at the door while he went in for change  mr richard sir said brass cheerfully good evening  monstrous as kits tale had appeared at first mr richard did that night half suspect his affable employer of some deep villany  perhaps it was but the misery he had just witnessed which gave his careless nature this impulse but be that as it may it was very strong upon him and he said in as few words as possible what he wanted  money cried brass taking out his purse  ha ha  to be sure mr richard to be sure sir  all men must live  you havent change for a fivepound note have you sir  no returned dick shortly  oh said brass heres the very sum  that saves trouble  youre very welcome im suremr richard sir dick who had by this time reached the door turned round  you neednt said brass trouble yourself to come back any more sir  eh  you see mr richard said brass thrusting his hands in his pockets and rocking himself to and fro on his stool the fact is that a man of your abilities is lost sir quite lost in our dry and mouldy line its terrible drudgeryshocking  i should say now that the stage or theor the army mr richardor something very superior in the licensed victualling waywas the kind of thing that would call out the genius of such a man as you  i hope youll look in to see us now and then  sally sir will be delighted im sure  shes extremely sorry to lose you mr richard but a sense of her duty to society reconciles her  an amazing creature that sir  youll find the money quite correct i think  theres a cracked window sir but ive not made any deduction on that account  whenever we part with friends mr richard let us part liberally  a delightful sentiment sir  to all these rambling observations mr swiveller answered not one word but returning for the aquatic jacket rolled it into a tight round ball looking steadily at brass meanwhile as if he had some intention of bowling him down with it  he only took it under his arm however and marched out of the office in profound silence  when he had closed the door he reopened it stared in again for a few moments with the same portentous gravity and nodding his head once in a slow and ghostlike manner vanished  he paid the coachman and turned his back on bevis marks big with great designs for the comforting of kits mother and the aid of kit himself  but the lives of gentlemen devoted to such pleasures as richard swiveller are extremely precarious  the spiritual excitement of the last fortnight working upon a system affected in no slight degree by the spirituous excitement of some years proved a little too much for him  that very night mr richard was seized with an alarming illness and in twentyfour hours was stricken with a raging fever     chapter 64  tossing to and fro upon his hot uneasy bed tormented by a fierce thirst which nothing could appease unable to find in any change of posture a moments peace or ease and rambling ever through deserts of thought where there was no restingplace no sight or sound suggestive of refreshment or repose nothing but a dull eternal weariness with no change but the restless shiftings of his miserable body and the weary wandering of his mind constant still to one everpresent anxietyto a sense of something left undone of some fearful obstacle to be surmounted of some carking care that would not be driven away and which haunted the distempered brain now in this form now in that always shadowy and dim but recognisable for the same phantom in every shape it took darkening every vision like an evil conscience and making slumber horriblein these slow tortures of his dread disease the unfortunate richard lay wasting and consuming inch by inch until at last when he seemed to fight and struggle to rise up and to be held down by devils he sank into a deep sleep and dreamed no more  he awoke  with a sensation of most blissful rest better than sleep itself he began gradually to remember something of these sufferings and to think what a long night it had been and whether he had not been delirious twice or thrice  happening in the midst of these cogitations to raise his hand he was astonished to find how heavy it seemed and yet how thin and light it really was  still he felt indifferent and happy and having no curiosity to pursue the subject remained in the same waking slumber until his attention was attracted by a cough  this made him doubt whether he had locked his door last night and feel a little surprised at having a companion in the room still he lacked energy to follow up this train of thought and unconsciously fell in a luxury of repose to staring at some green stripes on the bedfurniture and associating them strangely with patches of fresh turf while the yellow ground between made gravelwalks and so helped out a long perspective of trim gardens  he was rambling in imagination on these terraces and had quite lost himself among them indeed when he heard the cough once more  the walks shrunk into stripes again at the sound and raising himself a little in the bed and holding the curtain open with one hand he looked out  the same room certainly and still by candlelight but with what unbounded astonishment did he see all those bottles and basins and articles of linen airing by the fire and suchlike furniture of a sick chamberall very clean and neat but all quite different from anything he had left there when he went to bed  the atmosphere too filled with a cool smell of herbs and vinegar the floor newly sprinkled thethe what  the marchioness  yes playing cribbage with herself at the table  there she sat intent upon her game coughing now and then in a subdued manner as if she feared to disturb himshuffling the cards cutting dealing playing counting pegginggoing through all the mysteries of cribbage as if she had been in full practice from her cradle  mr swiveller contemplated these things for a short time and suffering the curtain to fall into its former position laid his head on the pillow again  im dreaming thought richard thats clear  when i went to bed my hands were not made of eggshells and now i can almost see through em  if this is not a dream i have woke up by mistake in an arabian night instead of a london one  but i have no doubt im asleep  not the least  here the small servant had another cough  very remarkable thought mr swiveller  i never dreamt such a real cough as that before  i dont know indeed that i ever dreamt either a cough or a sneeze  perhaps its part of the philosophy of dreams that one never does  theres anotherand anotheri sayim dreaming rather fast  for the purpose of testing his real condition mr swiveller after some reflection pinched himself in the arm  queerer still he thought  i came to bed rather plump than otherwise and now theres nothing to lay hold of  ill take another survey  the result of this additional inspection was to convince mr swiveller that the objects by which he was surrounded were real and that he saw them beyond all question with his waking eyes  its an arabian night thats what it is said richard  im in damascus or grand cairo  the marchioness is a genie and having had a wager with another genie about who is the handsomest young man alive and the worthiest to be the husband of the princess of china has brought me away room and all to compare us together  perhaps said mr swiveller turning languidly round on his pillow and looking on that side of his bed which was next the wall the princess may be stillno shes gone  not feeling quite satisfied with this explanation as even taking it to be the correct one it still involved a little mystery and doubt mr swiveller raised the curtain again determined to take the first favourable opportunity of addressing his companion  an occasion presented itself  the marchioness dealt turned up a knave and omitted to take the usual advantage upon which mr swiveller called out as loud as he couldtwo for his heels  the marchioness jumped up quickly and clapped her hands  arabian night certainly thought mr swiveller they always clap their hands instead of ringing the bell  now for the two thousand black slaves with jars of jewels on their heads  it appeared however that she had only clapped her hands for joy for directly afterward she began to laugh and then to cry declaring not in choice arabic but in familiar english that she was so glad she didnt know what to do  marchioness said mr swiveller thoughtfully be pleased to draw nearer  first of all will you have the goodness to inform me where i shall find my voice and secondly what has become of my flesh  the marchioness only shook her head mournfully and cried again whereupon mr swiveller being very weak felt his own eyes affected likewise  i begin to infer from your manner and these appearances marchioness said richard after a pause and smiling with a trembling lip that i have been ill  you just have replied the small servant wiping her eyes  and havent you been a talking nonsense  oh said dick  very ill marchioness have i been  dead all but replied the small servant  i never thought youd get better  thank heaven you have  mr swiveller was silent for a long while  by and bye he began to talk again inquiring how long he had been there  three weeks tomorrow replied the servant  three what said dick  weeks returned the marchioness emphatically three long slow weeks  the bare thought of having been in such extremity caused richard to fall into another silence and to lie flat down again at his full length  the marchioness having arranged the bedclothes more comfortably and felt that his hands and forehead were quite coola discovery that filled her with delightcried a little more and then applied herself to getting tea ready and making some thin dry toast  while she was thus engaged mr swiveller looked on with a grateful heart very much astonished to see how thoroughly at home she made herself and attributing this attention in its origin to sally brass whom in his own mind he could not thank enough  when the marchioness had finished her toasting she spread a clean cloth on a tray and brought him some crisp slices and a great basin of weak tea with which she said the doctor had left word he might refresh himself when he awoke  she propped him up with pillows if not as skilfully as if she had been a professional nurse all her life at least as tenderly and looked on with unutterable satisfaction while the patientstopping every now and then to shake her by the handtook his poor meal with an appetite and relish which the greatest dainties of the earth under any other circumstances would have failed to provoke  having cleared away and disposed everything comfortably about him again she sat down at the table to take her own tea  marchioness said mr swiveller hows sally  the small servant screwed her face into an expression of the very uttermost entanglement of slyness and shook her head  what havent you seen her lately said dick  seen her cried the small servant  bless you ive run away  mr swiveller immediately laid himself down again quite flat and so remained for about five minutes  by slow degrees he resumed his sitting posture after that lapse of time and inquired  and where do you live marchioness  live cried the small servant  here  oh said mr swiveller  and with that he fell down flat again as suddenly as if he had been shot  thus he remained motionless and bereft of speech until she had finished her meal put everything in its place and swept the hearth when he motioned her to bring a chair to the bedside and being propped up again opened a farther conversation  and so said dick you have run away  yes said the marchioness and theyve been a tizing of me  beeni beg your pardon said dickwhat have they been doing  been a tizing of metizing you knowin the newspapers rejoined the marchioness  aye aye said dick advertising  the small servant nodded and winked  her eyes were so red with waking and crying that the tragic muse might have winked with greater consistency  and so dick felt  tell me said he how it was that you thought of coming here  why you see returned the marchioness when you was gone i hadnt any friend at all because the lodger he never come back and i didnt know where either him or you was to be found you know  but one morning when i was  was near a keyhole suggested mr swiveller observing that she faltered  well then said the small servant nodding when i was near the office keyholeas you see me through you knowi heard somebody saying that she lived here and was the lady whose house you lodged at and that you was took very bad and wouldnt nobody come and take care of you  mr brass he says its no business of mine he says and miss sally she says hes a funny chap but its no business of mine and the lady went away and slammed the door to when she went out i can tell you  so i run away that night and come here and told em you was my brother and they believed me and ive been here ever since  this poor little marchioness has been wearing herself to death cried dick  no i havent she returned not a bit of it  dont you mind about me  i like sitting up and ive often had a sleep bless you in one of them chairs  but if you could have seen how you tried to jump out o winder and if you could have heard how you used to keep on singing and making speeches you wouldnt have believed itim so glad youre better mr liverer  liverer indeed said dick thoughtfully  its well i am a liverer i strongly suspect i should have died marchioness but for you  at this point mr swiveller took the small servants hand in his again and being as we have seen but poorly might in struggling to express his thanks have made his eyes as red as hers but that she quickly changed the theme by making him lie down and urging him to keep very quiet  the doctor she told him said you was to be kept quite still and there was to be no noise nor nothing  now take a rest and then well talk again  ill sit by you you know  if you shut your eyes perhaps youll go to sleep  youll be all the better for it if you do  the marchioness in saying these words brought a little table to the bedside took her seat at it and began to work away at the concoction of some cooling drink with the address of a score of chemists richard swiveller being indeed fatigued fell into a slumber and waking in about half an hour inquired what time it was  just gone half after six replied his small friend helping him to sit up again  marchioness said richard passing his hand over his forehead and turning suddenly round as though the subject but that moment flashed upon him what has become of kit  he had been sentenced to transportation for a great many years she said  has he gone asked dickhis motherhow is shewhat has become of her  his nurse shook her head and answered that she knew nothing about them  but if i thought said she very slowly that youd keep quiet and not put yourself into another fever i could tell youbut i wont now  yes do said dick  it will amuse me  oh would it though rejoined the small servant with a horrified look  i know better than that  wait till youre better and then ill tell you   dick looked very earnestly at his little friend and his eyes being large and hollow from illness assisted the expression so much that she was quite frightened and besought him not to think any more about it  what had already fallen from her however had not only piqued his curiosity but seriously alarmed him wherefore he urged her to tell him the worst at once  oh theres no worst in it said the small servant  it hasnt anything to do with you  has it anything to do withis it anything you heard through chinks or keyholesand that you were not intended to hear asked dick in a breathless state  yes replied the small servant  inin bevis marks pursued dick hastily  conversations between brass and sally  yes cried the small servant again  richard swiveller thrust his lank arm out of bed and gripping her by the wrist and drawing her close to him bade her out with it and freely too or he would not answer for the consequences being wholly unable to endure the state of excitement and expectation  she seeing that he was greatly agitated and that the effects of postponing her revelation might be much more injurious than any that were likely to ensue from its being made at once promised compliance on condition that the patient kept himself perfectly quiet and abstained from starting up or tossing about  but if you begin to do that said the small servant ill leave off and so i tell you  you cant leave off till you have gone on said dick  and do go on theres a darling  speak sister speak  pretty polly say  oh tell me when and tell me where pray marchioness i beseech you  unable to resist these fervent adjurations which richard swiveller poured out as passionately as if they had been of the most solemn and tremendous nature his companion spoke thus  well  before i run away i used to sleep in the kitchenwhere we played cards you know  miss sally used to keep the key of the kitchen door in her pocket and she always come down at night to take away the candle and rake out the fire  when she had done that she left me to go to bed in the dark locked the door on the outside put the key in her pocket again and kept me locked up till she come down in the morningvery early i can tell youand let me out  i was terrible afraid of being kept like this because if there was a fire i thought they might forget me and only take care of themselves you know  so whenever i see an old rusty key anywhere i picked it up and tried if it would fit the door and at last i found in the dust cellar a key that did fit it  here mr swiveller made a violent demonstration with his legs  but the small servant immediately pausing in her talk he subsided again and pleading a momentary forgetfulness of their compact entreated her to proceed  they kept me very short said the small servant  oh you cant think how short they kept me  so i used to come out at night after theyd gone to bed and feel about in the dark for bits of biscuit or sangwitches that youd left in the office or even pieces of orange peel to put into cold water and make believe it was wine  did you ever taste orange peel and water  mr swiveller replied that he had never tasted that ardent liquor and once more urged his friend to resume the thread of her narrative  if you make believe very much its quite nice said the small servant but if you dont you know it seems as if it would bear a little more seasoning certainly  well sometimes i used to come out after theyd gone to bed and sometimes before you know and one or two nights before there was all that precious noise in the officewhen the young man was took i meani come upstairs while mr brass and miss sally was asittin at the office fire and i tell you the truth that i come to listen again about the key of the safe  mr swiveller gathered up his knees so as to make a great cone of the bedclothes and conveyed into his countenance an expression of the utmost concern  but the small servant pausing and holding up her finger the cone gently disappeared though the look of concern did not  there was him and her said the small servant asittin by the fire and talking softly together  mr brass says to miss sally upon my word he says its a dangerous thing and it might get us into a world of trouble and i dont half like it she saysyou know her wayshe says youre the chickenesthearted feeblest faintest man i ever see and i think she says that i ought to have been the brother and you the sister  isnt quilp she says our principal support he certainly is says mr brass and ant we she says constantly ruining somebody or other in the way of business we certainly are says mr brass  then does it signify she says about ruining this kit when quilp desires it it certainly does not signify says mr brass  then they whispered and laughed for a long time about there being no danger if it was well done and then mr brass pulls out his pocketbook and says well he says here it isquilps own fivepound note  well agree that way then he says kits coming tomorrow morning i know  while hes upstairs youll get out of the way and ill clear off mr richard  having kit alone ill hold him in conversation and put this property in his hat  ill manage so besides he says that mr richard shall find it there and be the evidence  and if that dont get christopher out of mr quilps way and satisfy mr quilps grudges he says the devils in it miss sally laughed and said that was the plan and as they seemed to be moving away and i was afraid to stop any longer i went downstairs againthere  the small servant had gradually worked herself into as much agitation as mr swiveller and therefore made no effort to restrain him when he sat up in bed and hastily demanded whether this story had been told to anybody  how could it be replied his nurse  i was almost afraid to think about it and hoped the young man would be let off  when i heard em say they had found him guilty of what he didnt do you was gone and so was the lodgerthough i think i should have been frightened to tell him even if hed been there  ever since i come here youve been out of your senses and what would have been the good of telling you then  marchioness said mr swiveller plucking off his nightcap and flinging it to the other end of the room if youll do me the favour to retire for a few minutes and see what sort of a night it is ill get up  you mustnt think of such a thing cried his nurse  i must indeed said the patient looking round the room whereabouts are my clothes  oh im so gladyou havent got any replied the marchioness  maam said mr swiveller in great astonishment  ive been obliged to sell them every one to get the things that was ordered for you  but dont take on about that urged the marchioness as dick fell back upon his pillow  youre too weak to stand indeed  i am afraid said richard dolefully that youre right  what ought i to do what is to be done  it naturally occurred to him on very little reflection that the first step to take would be to communicate with one of the mr garlands instantly  it was very possible that mr abel had not yet left the office  in as little time as it takes to tell it the small servant had the address in pencil on a piece of paper a verbal description of father and son which would enable her to recognise either without difficulty and a special caution to be shy of mr chuckster in consequence of that gentlemans known antipathy to kit  armed with these slender powers she hurried away commissioned to bring either old mr garland or mr abel bodily to that apartment  i suppose said dick as she closed the door slowly and peeped into the room again to make sure that he was comfortable i suppose theres nothing leftnot so much as a waistcoat even  no nothing  its embarrassing said mr swiveller in case of fireeven an umbrella would be somethingbut you did quite right dear marchioness i should have died without you     chapter 65  it was well for the small servant that she was of a sharp quick nature or the consequence of sending her out alone from the very neighbourhood in which it was most dangerous for her to appear would probably have been the restoration of miss sally brass to the supreme authority over her person  not unmindful of the risk she ran however the marchioness no sooner left the house than she dived into the first dark byway that presented itself and without any present reference to the point to which her journey tended made it her first business to put two good miles of brick and mortar between herself and bevis marks  when she had accomplished this object she began to shape her course for the notarys office to whichshrewdly inquiring of applewomen and oystersellers at streetcorners rather than in lighted shops or of welldressed people at the hazard of attracting noticeshe easily procured a direction  as carrierpigeons on being first let loose in a strange place beat the air at random for a short time before darting off towards the spot for which they are designed so did the marchioness flutter round and round until she believed herself in safety and then bear swiftly down upon the port for which she was bound  she had no bonnetnothing on her head but a great cap which in some old time had been worn by sally brass whose taste in headdresses was as we have seen peculiarand her speed was rather retarded than assisted by her shoes which being extremely large and slipshod flew off every now and then and were difficult to find again among the crowd of passengers  indeed the poor little creature experienced so much trouble and delay from having to grope for these articles of dress in mud and kennel and suffered in these researches so much jostling pushing squeezing and bandying from hand to hand that by the time she reached the street in which the notary lived she was fairly worn out and exhausted and could not refrain from tears  but to have got there at last was a great comfort especially as there were lights still burning in the office window and therefore some hope that she was not too late  so the marchioness dried her eyes with the backs of her hands and stealing softly up the steps peeped in through the glass door  mr chuckster was standing behind the lid of his desk making such preparations towards finishing off for the night as pulling down his wristbands and pulling up his shirtcollar settling his neck more gracefully in his stock and secretly arranging his whiskers by the aid of a little triangular bit of looking glass  before the ashes of the fire stood two gentlemen one of whom she rightly judged to be the notary and the other who was buttoning his greatcoat and was evidently about to depart immediately mr abel garland  having made these observations the small spy took counsel with herself and resolved to wait in the street until mr abel came out as there would be then no fear of having to speak before mr chuckster and less difficulty in delivering her message  with this purpose she slipped out again and crossing the road sat down upon a doorstep just opposite  she had hardly taken this position when there came dancing up the street with his legs all wrong and his head everywhere by turns a pony  this pony had a little phaeton behind him and a man in it but neither man nor phaeton seemed to embarrass him in the least as he reared up on his hind legs or stopped or went on or stood still again or backed or went sideways without the smallest reference to themjust as the fancy seized him and as if he were the freest animal in creation  when they came to the notarys door the man called out in a very respectful manner woa thenintimating that if he might venture to express a wish it would be that they stopped there  the pony made a moments pause but as if it occurred to him that to stop when he was required might be to establish an inconvenient and dangerous precedent he immediately started off again rattled at a fast trot to the street corner wheeled round came back and then stopped of his own accord  oh youre a precious creatur said the manwho didnt venture by the bye to come out in his true colours until he was safe on the pavement  i wish i had the rewarding of youi do  what has he been doing said mr abel tying a shawl round his neck as he came down the steps  hes enough to fret a mans heart out replied the hostler  he is the most wicious rascalwoa then will you  hell never stand still if you call him names said mr abel getting in and taking the reins  hes a very good fellow if you know how to manage him  this is the first time he has been out this long while for he has lost his old driver and wouldnt stir for anybody else till this morning  the lamps are right are they  thats well  be here to take him tomorrow if you please  good night  and after one or two strange plunges quite of his own invention the pony yielded to mr abels mildness and trotted gently off  all this time mr chuckster had been standing at the door and the small servant had been afraid to approach  she had nothing for it now therefore but to run after the chaise and to call to mr abel to stop being out of breath when she came up with it she was unable to make him hear  the case was desperate for the pony was quickening his pace  the marchioness hung on behind for a few moments and feeling that she could go no farther and must soon yield clambered by a vigorous effort into the hinder seat and in so doing lost one of the shoes for ever  mr abel being in a thoughtful frame of mind and having quite enough to do to keep the pony going went jogging on without looking round little dreaming of the strange figure that was close behind him until the marchioness having in some degree recovered her breath and the loss of her shoe and the novelty of her position uttered close into his ear the wordsi say sir  he turned his head quickly enough then and stopping the pony cried with some trepidation god bless me what is this  dont be frightened sir replied the still panting messenger  oh ive run such a way after you  what do you want with me said mr abel  how did you come here  i got in behind replied the marchioness  oh please drive on sirdont stopand go towards the city will you  and oh do please make haste because its of consequence  theres somebody wants to see you there  he sent me to say would you come directly and that he knowed all about kit and could save him yet and prove his innocence  what do you tell me child  the truth upon my word and honour i do  but please to drive on quick please  ive been such a time gone hell think im lost  mr abel involuntarily urged the pony forward  the pony impelled by some secret sympathy or some new caprice burst into a great pace and neither slackened it nor indulged in any eccentric performances until they arrived at the door of mr swivellers lodging where marvellous to relate he consented to stop when mr abel checked him  see  its the room up there said the marchioness pointing to one where there was a faint light  come  mr abel who was one of the simplest and most retiring creatures in existence and naturally timid withal hesitated for he had heard of people being decoyed into strange places to be robbed and murdered under circumstances very like the present and for anything he knew to the contrary by guides very like the marchioness  his regard for kit however overcame every other consideration  so entrusting whisker to the charge of a man who was lingering hard by in expectation of the job he suffered his companion to take his hand and to lead him up the dark and narrow stairs  he was not a little surprised to find himself conducted into a dimlylighted sick chamber where a man was sleeping tranquilly in bed  ant it nice to see him lying there so quiet said his guide in an earnest whisper  oh youd say it was if you had only seen him two or three days ago  mr abel made no answer and to say the truth kept a long way from the bed and very near the door  his guide who appeared to understand his reluctance trimmed the candle and taking it in her hand approached the bed  as she did so the sleeper started up and he recognised in the wasted face the features of richard swiveller  why how is this said mr abel kindly as he hurried towards him you have been ill  very replied dick  nearly dead  you might have chanced to hear of your richard on his bier but for the friend i sent to fetch you another shake of the hand marchioness if you please  sit down sir  mr abel seemed rather astonished to hear of the quality of his guide and took a chair by the bedside  i have sent for you sir said dickbut she told you on what account  she did  i am quite bewildered by all this  i really dont know what to say or think replied mr abel  youll say that presently retorted dick  marchioness take a seat on the bed will you  now tell this gentleman all that you told me and be particular  dont you speak another word sir  the story was repeated it was in effect exactly the same as before without any deviation or omission  richard swiveller kept his eyes fixed on his visitor during its narration and directly it was concluded took the word again  you have heard it all and youll not forget it  im too giddy and too queer to suggest anything but you and your friends will know what to do  after this long delay every minute is an age  if ever you went home fast in your life go home fast tonight  dont stop to say one word to me but go  she will be found here whenever shes wanted and as to me youre pretty sure to find me at home for a week or two there are more reasons than one for that  marchioness a light  if you lose another minute in looking at me sir ill never forgive you  mr abel needed no more remonstrance or persuasion  he was gone in an instant and the marchioness returning from lighting him downstairs reported that the pony without any preliminary objection whatever had dashed away at full gallop  thats right said dick and hearty of him and i honour him from this time  but get some supper and a mug of beer for i am sure you must be tired  do have a mug of beer  it will do me as much good to see you take it as if i might drink it myself  nothing but this assurance could have prevailed upon the small nurse to indulge in such a luxury  having eaten and drunk to mr swivellers extreme contentment given him his drink and put everything in neat order she wrapped herself in an old coverlet and lay down upon the rug before the fire  mr swiveller was by that time murmuring in his sleep strew then oh strew a bed of rushes  here will we stay till morning blushes  good night marchioness     chapter 66  on awaking in the morning richard swiveller became conscious by slow degrees of whispering voices in his room  looking out between the curtains he espied mr garland mr abel the notary and the single gentleman gathered round the marchioness and talking to her with great earnestness but in very subdued tonesfearing no doubt to disturb him  he lost no time in letting them know that this precaution was unnecessary and all four gentlemen directly approached his bedside  old mr garland was the first to stretch out his hand and inquire how he felt  dick was about to answer that he felt much better though still as weak as need be when his little nurse pushing the visitors aside and pressing up to his pillow as if in jealousy of their interference set his breakfast before him and insisted on his taking it before he underwent the fatigue of speaking or of being spoken to  mr swiveller who was perfectly ravenous and had had all night amazingly distinct and consistent dreams of mutton chops double stout and similar delicacies felt even the weak tea and dry toast such irresistible temptations that he consented to eat and drink on one condition  and that is said dick returning the pressure of mr garlands hand that you answer me this question truly before i take a bit or drop is it too late  for completing the work you began so well last night returned the old gentleman  no  set your mind at rest on that point  it is not i assure you  comforted by this intelligence the patient applied himself to his food with a keen appetite though evidently not with a greater zest in the eating than his nurse appeared to have in seeing him eat  the manner of this meal was thismr swiveller holding the slice of toast or cup of tea in his left hand and taking a bite or drink as the case might be constantly kept in his right one palm of the marchioness tight locked and to shake or even to kiss this imprisoned hand he would stop every now and then in the very act of swallowing with perfect seriousness of intention and the utmost gravity  as often as he put anything into his mouth whether for eating or drinking the face of the marchioness lighted up beyond all description but whenever he gave her one or other of these tokens of recognition her countenance became overshadowed and she began to sob  now whether she was in her laughing joy or in her crying one the marchioness could not help turning to the visitors with an appealing look which seemed to say you see this fellowcan i help thisand they being thus made as it were parties to the scene as regularly answered by another look no  certainly not  this dumbshow taking place during the whole time of the invalids breakfast and the invalid himself pale and emaciated performing no small part in the same it may be fairly questioned whether at any meal where no word good or bad was spoken from beginning to end so much was expressed by gestures in themselves so slight and unimportant  at lengthand to say the truth before very longmr swiveller had despatched as much toast and tea as in that stage of his recovery it was discreet to let him have  but the cares of the marchioness did not stop here for disappearing for an instant and presently returning with a basin of fair water she laved his face and hands brushed his hair and in short made him as spruce and smart as anybody under such circumstances could be made and all this in as brisk and businesslike a manner as if he were a very little boy and she his grownup nurse  to these various attentions mr swiveller submitted in a kind of grateful astonishment beyond the reach of language  when they were at last brought to an end and the marchioness had withdrawn into a distant corner to take her own poor breakfast cold enough by that time he turned his face away for some few moments and shook hands heartily with the air  gentlemen said dick rousing himself from this pause and turning round again youll excuse me  men who have been brought so low as i have been are easily fatigued  i am fresh again now and fit for talking  were short of chairs here among other trifles but if youll do me the favour to sit upon the bed  what can we do for you said mr garland kindly  if you could make the marchioness yonder a marchioness in real sober earnest returned dick id thank you to get it done offhand but as you cant and as the question is not what you will do for me but what you will do for somebody else who has a better claim upon you pray sir let me know what you intend doing  its chiefly on that account that we have come just now said the single gentleman for you will have another visitor presently  we feared you would be anxious unless you knew from ourselves what steps we intended to take and therefore came to you before we stirred in the matter  gentlemen returned dick i thank you  anybody in the helpless state that you see me in is naturally anxious  dont let me interrupt you sir  then you see my good fellow said the single gentleman that while we have no doubt whatever of the truth of this disclosure which has so providentially come to light  meaning hers said dick pointing towards the marchioness  meaning hers of course  while we have no doubt of that or that a proper use of it would procure the poor lads immediate pardon and liberation we have a great doubt whether it would by itself enable us to reach quilp the chief agent in this villany  i should tell you that this doubt has been confirmed into something very nearly approaching certainty by the best opinions we have been enabled in this short space of time to take upon the subject  youll agree with us that to give him even the most distant chance of escape if we could help it would be monstrous  you say with us no doubt if somebody must escape let it be any one but he  yes returned dick certainly  that is if somebody mustbut upon my word im unwilling that anybody should  since laws were made for every degree to curb vice in others as well as in meand so forth you knowdoesnt it strike you in that light  the single gentleman smiled as if the light in which mr swiveller had put the question were not the clearest in the world and proceeded to explain that they contemplated proceeding by stratagem in the first instance and that their design was to endeavour to extort a confession from the gentle sarah  when she finds how much we know and how we know it he said and that she is clearly compromised already we are not without strong hopes that we may be enabled through her means to punish the other two effectually  if we could do that she might go scotfree for aught i cared  dick received this project in anything but a gracious manner representing with as much warmth as he was then capable of showing that they would find the old buck meaning sarah more difficult to manage than quilp himselfthat for any tampering terrifying or cajolery she was a very unpromising and unyielding subjectthat she was of a kind of brass not easily melted or moulded into shapein short that they were no match for her and would be signally defeated but it was in vain to urge them to adopt some other course  the single gentleman has been described as explaining their joint intentions but it should have been written that they all spoke together that if any one of them by chance held his peace for a moment he stood gasping and panting for an opportunity to strike in again in a word that they had reached that pitch of impatience and anxiety where men can neither be persuaded nor reasoned with and that it would have been as easy to turn the most impetuous wind that ever blew as to prevail on them to reconsider their determination  so after telling mr swiveller how they had not lost sight of kits mother and the children how they had never once even lost sight of kit himself but had been unremitting in their endeavours to procure a mitigation of his sentence how they had been perfectly distracted between the strong proofs of his guilt and their own fading hopes of his innocence and how he richard swiveller might keep his mind at rest for everything should be happily adjusted between that time and nightafter telling him all this and adding a great many kind and cordial expressions personal to himself which it is unnecessary to recite mr garland the notary and the single gentleman took their leaves at a very critical time or richard swiveller must assuredly have been driven into another fever whereof the results might have been fatal  mr abel remained behind very often looking at his watch and at the room door until mr swiveller was roused from a short nap by the settingdown on the landingplace outside as from the shoulders of a porter of some giant load which seemed to shake the house and made the little physic bottles on the mantelshelf ring again  directly this sound reached his ears mr abel started up and hobbled to the door and opened it and behold there stood a strong man with a mighty hamper which being hauled into the room and presently unpacked disgorged such treasures as tea and coffee and wine and rusks and oranges and grapes and fowls ready trussed for boiling and calvesfoot jelly and arrowroot and sago and other delicate restoratives that the small servant who had never thought it possible that such things could be except in shops stood rooted to the spot in her one shoe with her mouth and eyes watering in unison and her power of speech quite gone  but not so mr abel or the strong man who emptied the hamper big as it was in a twinkling and not so the nice old lady who appeared so suddenly that she might have come out of the hamper too it was quite large enough and who bustling about on tiptoe and without noisenow here now there now everywhere at oncebegan to fill out the jelly in teacups and to make chicken broth in small saucepans and to peel oranges for the sick man and to cut them up in little pieces and to ply the small servant with glasses of wine and choice bits of everything until more substantial meat could be prepared for her refreshment  the whole of which appearances were so unexpected and bewildering that mr swiveller when he had taken two oranges and a little jelly and had seen the strong man walk off with the empty basket plainly leaving all that abundance for his use and benefit was fain to lie down and fall asleep again from sheer inability to entertain such wonders in his mind  meanwhile the single gentleman the notary and mr garland repaired to a certain coffeehouse and from that place indited and sent a letter to miss sally brass requesting her in terms mysterious and brief to favour an unknown friend who wished to consult her with her company there as speedily as possible  the communication performed its errand so well that within ten minutes of the messengers return and report of its delivery miss brass herself was announced  pray maam said the single gentleman whom she found alone in the room take a chair  miss brass sat herself down in a very stiff and frigid state and seemedas indeed she wasnot a little astonished to find that the lodger and her mysterious correspondent were one and the same person  you did not expect to see me said the single gentleman  i didnt think much about it returned the beauty  i supposed it was business of some kind or other  if its about the apartments of course youll give my brother regular notice you knowor money thats very easily settled  youre a responsible party and in such a case lawful money and lawful notice are pretty much the same  i am obliged to you for your good opinion retorted the single gentleman and quite concur in these sentiments  but that is not the subject on which i wish to speak with you  oh said sally  then just state the particulars will you  i suppose its professional business  why it is connected with the law certainly  very well returned miss brass  my brother and i are just the same i can take any instructions or give you any advice  as there are other parties interested besides myself said the single gentleman rising and opening the door of an inner room we had better confer together  miss brass is here gentlemen mr garland and the notary walked in looking very grave and drawing up two chairs one on each side of the single gentleman formed a kind of fence round the gentle sarah and penned her into a corner  her brother sampson under such circumstances would certainly have evinced some confusion or anxiety but sheall composurepulled out the tin box and calmly took a pinch of snuff  miss brass said the notary taking the word at this crisis we professional people understand each other and when we choose can say what we have to say in very few words  you advertised a runaway servant the other day  well returned miss sally with a sudden flush overspreading her features what of that  she is found maam said the notary pulling out his pockethandkerchief with a flourish  she is found  who found her demanded sarah hastily  we did maamwe three  only last night or you would have heard from us before  and now i have heard from you said miss brass folding her arms as though she were about to deny something to the death what have you got to say  something you have got into your heads about her of course  prove it will youthats all  prove it  you have found her you say  i can tell you if you dont know it that you have found the most artful lying pilfering devilish little minx that was ever bornhave you got her here she added looking sharply round  no she is not here at present returned the notary  but she is quite safe  ha cried sally twitching a pinch of snuff out of her box as spitefully as if she were in the very act of wrenching off the small servants nose she shall be safe enough from this time i warrant you  i hope so replied the notary  did it occur to you for the first time when you found she had run away that there were two keys to your kitchen door  miss sally took another pinch and putting her head on one side looked at her questioner with a curious kind of spasm about her mouth but with a cunning aspect of immense expression  two keys repeated the notary one of which gave her the opportunities of roaming through the house at nights when you supposed her fast locked up and of overhearing confidential consultationsamong others that particular conference to be described today before a justice which you will have an opportunity of hearing her relate that conference which you and mr brass held together on the night before that most unfortunate and innocent young man was accused of robbery by a horrible device of which i will only say that it may be characterised by the epithets which you have applied to this wretched little witness and by a few stronger ones besides  sally took another pinch  although her face was wonderfully composed it was apparent that she was wholly taken by surprise and that what she had expected to be taxed with in connection with her small servant was something very different from this  come come miss brass said the notary you have great command of feature but you feel i see that by a chance which never entered your imagination this base design is revealed and two of its plotters must be brought to justice  now you know the pains and penalties you are liable to and so i need not dilate upon them but i have a proposal to make to you  you have the honour of being sister to one of the greatest scoundrels unhung and if i may venture to say so to a lady you are in every respect quite worthy of him  but connected with you two is a third party a villain of the name of quilp the prime mover of the whole diabolical device who i believe to be worse than either for his sake miss brass do us the favour to reveal the whole history of this affair  let me remind you that your doing so at our instance will place you in a safe and comfortable positionyour present one is not desirableand cannot injure your brother for against him and you we have quite sufficient evidence as you hear already  i will not say to you that we suggest this course in mercy for to tell you the truth we do not entertain any regard for you but it is a necessity to which we are reduced and i recommend it to you as a matter of the very best policy  time said mr witherden pulling out his watch in a business like this is exceedingly precious  favour us with your decision as speedily as possible maam  with a smile upon her face and looking at each of the three by turns miss brass took two or three more pinches of snuff and having by this time very little left travelled round and round the box with her forefinger and thumb scraping up another  having disposed of this likewise and put the box carefully in her pocket she said  i am to accept or reject at once am i  yes said mr witherden  the charming creature was opening her lips to speak in reply when the door was hastily opened too and the head of sampson brass was thrust into the room  excuse me said the gentleman hastily  wait a bit  so saying and quite indifferent to the astonishment his presence occasioned he crept in shut the door kissed his greasy glove as servilely as if it were the dust and made a most abject bow  sarah said brass hold your tongue if you please and let me speak gentlemen if i could express the pleasure it gives me to see three such men in a happy unity of feeling and concord of sentiment i think you would hardly believe me  but though i am unfortunatenay gentlemen criminal if we are to use harsh expressions in a company like thisstill i have my feelings like other men  i have heard of a poet who remarked that feelings were the common lot of all  if he could have been a pig gentlemen and have uttered that sentiment he would still have been immortal  if youre not an idiot said miss brass harshly hold your peace  sarah my dear returned her brother thank you  but i know what i am about my love and will take the liberty of expressing myself accordingly  mr witherden sir your handkerchief is hanging out of your pocketwould you allow me to  as mr brass advanced to remedy this accident the notary shrunk from him with an air of disgust  brass who over and above his usual prepossessing qualities had a scratched face a green shade over one eye and a hat grievously crushed stopped short and looked round with a pitiful smile  he shuns me said sampson even when i would as i may say heap coals of fire upon his head  well  ah but i am a falling house and the rats if i may be allowed the expression in reference to a gentleman i respect and love beyond everything fly from me gentlemenregarding your conversation just now i happened to see my sister on her way here and wondering where she could be going to and beingmay i venture to saynaturally of a suspicious turn followed her  since then i have been listening  if youre not mad interposed miss sally stop there and say no more  sarah my dear rejoined brass with undiminished politeness i thank you kindly but will still proceed  mr witherden sir as we have the honour to be members of the same professionto say nothing of that other gentleman having been my lodger and having partaken as one may say of the hospitality of my roofi think you might have given me the refusal of this offer in the first instance  i do indeed  now my dear sir cried brass seeing that the notary was about to interrupt him suffer me to speak i beg  mr witherden was silent and brass went on  if you will do me the favour he said holding up the green shade and revealing an eye most horribly discoloured to look at this you will naturally inquire in your own minds how did i get it  if you look from that to my face you will wonder what could have been the cause of all these scratches  and if from them to my hat how it came into the state in which you see it  gentlemen said brass striking the hat fiercely with his clenched hand to all these questions i answerquilp  the three gentlemen looked at each other but said nothing  i say pursued brass glancing aside at his sister as though he were talking for her information and speaking with a snarling malignity in violent contrast to his usual smoothness that i answer to all these questionsquilpquilp who deludes me into his infernal den and takes a delight in looking on and chuckling while i scorch and burn and bruise and maim myselfquilp who never once no never once in all our communications together has treated me otherwise than as a dogquilp whom i have always hated with my whole heart but never so much as lately  he gives me the cold shoulder on this very matter as if he had had nothing to do with it instead of being the first to propose it  i cant trust him  in one of his howling raving blazing humours i believe hed let it out if it was murder and never think of himself so long as he could terrify me  now said brass picking up his hat again and replacing the shade over his eye and actually crouching down in the excess of his servility what does all this lead towhat should you say it led me to gentlemencould you guess at all near the mark  nobody spoke  brass stood smirking for a little while as if he had propounded some choice conundrum and then said  to be short with you then it leads me to this  if the truth has come out as it plainly has in a manner that theres no standing up againstand a very sublime and grand thing is truth gentlemen in its way though like other sublime and grand things such as thunderstorms and that were not always over and above glad to see iti had better turn upon this man than let this man turn upon me  its clear to me that i am done for  therefore if anybody is to split i had better be the person and have the advantage of it  sarah my dear comparatively speaking youre safe  i relate these circumstances for my own profit  with that mr brass in a great hurry revealed the whole story bearing as heavily as possible on his amiable employer and making himself out to be rather a saintlike and holy character though subjecthe acknowledgedto human weaknesses  he concluded thus  now gentlemen i am not a man who does things by halves  being in for a penny i am ready as the saying is to be in for a pound  you must do with me what you please and take me where you please  if you wish to have this in writing well reduce it into manuscript immediately  you will be tender with me i am sure  i am quite confident you will be tender with me  you are men of honour and have feeling hearts  i yielded from necessity to quilp for though necessity has no law she has her lawyers  i yield to you from necessity too from policy besides and because of feelings that have been a pretty long time working within me  punish quilp gentlemen weigh heavily upon him  grind him down  tread him under foot  he has done as much by me for many and many a day  having now arrived at the conclusion of his discourse sampson checked the current of his wrath kissed his glove again and smiled as only parasites and cowards can  and this said miss brass raising her head with which she had hitherto sat resting on her hands and surveying him from head to foot with a bitter sneer this is my brother is it  this is my brother that i have worked and toiled for and believed to have had something of the man in him  sarah my dear returned sampson rubbing his hands feebly you disturb our friends  besides youyoure disappointed sarah and not knowing what you say expose yourself  yes you pitiful dastard retorted the lovely damsel i understand you  you feared that i should be beforehand with you  but do you think that i would have been enticed to say a word  id have scorned it if they had tried and tempted me for twenty years  he he simpered brass who in his deep debasement really seemed to have changed sexes with his sister and to have made over to her any spark of manliness he might have possessed  you think so sarah you think so perhaps but you would have acted quite different my good fellow  you will not have forgotten that it was a maxim with foxeyour revered father gentlemenalways suspect everybody thats the maxim to go through life with  if you were not actually about to purchase your own safety when i showed myself i suspect youd have done it by this time  and therefore ive done it myself and spared you the trouble as well as the shame  the shame gentlemen added brass allowing himself to be slightly overcome if there is any is mine  its better that a female should be spared it  with deference to the better opinion of mr brass and more particularly to the authority of his great ancestor it may be doubted with humility whether the elevating principle laid down by the latter gentleman and acted upon by his descendant is always a prudent one or attended in practice with the desired results  this is beyond question a bold and presumptuous doubt inasmuch as many distinguished characters called men of the world longheaded customers knowing dogs shrewd fellows capital hands at business and the like have made and do daily make this axiom their polar star and compass still the doubt may be gently insinuated  and in illustration it may be observed that if mr brass not being oversuspicious had without prying and listening left his sister to manage the conference on their joint behalf or prying and listening had not been in such a mighty hurry to anticipate her which he would not have been but for his distrust and jealousy he would probably have found himself much better off in the end  thus it will always happen that these men of the world who go through it in armour defend themselves from quite as much good as evil to say nothing of the inconvenience and absurdity of mounting guard with a microscope at all times and of wearing a coat of mail on the most innocent occasions  the three gentlemen spoke together apart for a few moments  at the end of their consultation which was very brief the notary pointed to the writing materials on the table and informed mr brass that if he wished to make any statement in writing he had the opportunity of doing so  at the same time he felt bound to tell him that they would require his attendance presently before a justice of the peace and that in what he did or said he was guided entirely by his own discretion  gentlemen said brass drawing off his glove and crawling in spirit upon the ground before them i will justify the tenderness with which i know i shall be treated and as without tenderness i should now that this discovery has been made stand in the worst position of the three you may depend upon it i will make a clean breast  mr witherden sir a kind of faintness is upon my spiritsif you would do me the favour to ring the bell and order up a glass of something warm and spicy i shall notwithstanding what has passed have a melancholy pleasure in drinking your good health  i had hoped said brass looking round with a mournful smile to have seen you three gentlemen one day or another with your legs under the mahogany in my humble parlour in the marks  but hopes are fleeting  dear me  mr brass found himself so exceedingly affected at this point that he could say or do nothing more until some refreshment arrived  having partaken of it pretty freely for one in his agitated state he sat down to write  the lovely sarah now with her arms folded and now with her hands clasped behind her paced the room with manly strides while her brother was thus employed and sometimes stopped to pull out her snuffbox and bite the lid  she continued to pace up and down until she was quite tired and then fell asleep on a chair near the door  it has been since supposed with some reason that this slumber was a sham or feint as she contrived to slip away unobserved in the dusk of the afternoon  whether this was an intentional and waking departure or a somnambulistic leavetaking and walking in her sleep may remain a subject of contention but on one point and indeed the main one all parties are agreed  in whatever state she walked away she certainly did not walk back again  mention having been made of the dusk of the afternoon it will be inferred that mr brasss task occupied some time in the completion  it was not finished until evening but being done at last that worthy person and the three friends adjourned in a hackneycoach to the private office of a justice who giving mr brass a warm reception and detaining him in a secure place that he might insure to himself the pleasure of seeing him on the morrow dismissed the others with the cheering assurance that a warrant could not fail to be granted next day for the apprehension of mr quilp and that a proper application and statement of all the circumstances to the secretary of state who was fortunately in town would no doubt procure kits free pardon and liberation without delay  and now indeed it seemed that quilps malignant career was drawing to a close and that retribution which often travels slowlyespecially when heaviesthad tracked his footsteps with a sure and certain scent and was gaining on him fast  unmindful of her stealthy tread her victim holds his course in fancied triumph  still at his heels she comes and once afoot is never turned aside  their business ended the three gentlemen hastened back to the lodgings of mr swiveller whom they found progressing so favourably in his recovery as to have been able to sit up for half an hour and to have conversed with cheerfulness  mrs garland had gone home some time since but mr abel was still sitting with him  after telling him all they had done the two mr garlands and the single gentleman as if by some previous understanding took their leaves for the night leaving the invalid alone with the notary and the small servant  as you are so much better said mr witherden sitting down at the bedside i may venture to communicate to you a piece of news which has come to me professionally  the idea of any professional intelligence from a gentleman connected with legal matters appeared to afford richard anything but a pleasing anticipation  perhaps he connected it in his own mind with one or two outstanding accounts in reference to which he had already received divers threatening letters  his countenance fell as he replied  certainly sir  i hope its not anything of a very disagreeable nature though  if i thought it so i should choose some better time for communicating it replied the notary  let me tell you first that my friends who have been here today know nothing of it and that their kindness to you has been quite spontaneous and with no hope of return  it may do a thoughtless careless man good to know that  dick thanked him and said he hoped it would  i have been making some inquiries about you said mr witherden little thinking that i should find you under such circumstances as those which have brought us together  you are the nephew of rebecca swiveller spinster deceased of cheselbourne in dorsetshire  deceased cried dick  deceased  if you had been another sort of nephew you would have come into possession so says the will and i see no reason to doubt it of fiveandtwenty thousand pounds  as it is you have fallen into an annuity of one hundred and fifty pounds a year but i think i may congratulate you even upon that  sir said dick sobbing and laughing together you may  for please god well make a scholar of the poor marchioness yet  and she shall walk in silk attire and siller have to spare or may i never rise from this bed again     chapter 67  unconscious of the proceedings faithfully narrated in the last chapter and little dreaming of the mine which had been sprung beneath him for to the end that he should have no warning of the business afoot the profoundest secrecy was observed in the whole transaction mr quilp remained shut up in his hermitage undisturbed by any suspicion and extremely well satisfied with the result of his machinations  being engaged in the adjustment of some accountsan occupation to which the silence and solitude of his retreat were very favourablehe had not strayed from his den for two whole days  the third day of his devotion to this pursuit found him still hard at work and little disposed to stir abroad  it was the day next after mr brasss confession and consequently that which threatened the restriction of mr quilps liberty and the abrupt communication to him of some very unpleasant and unwelcome facts having no intuitive perception of the cloud which lowered upon his house the dwarf was in his ordinary state of cheerfulness and when he found he was becoming too much engrossed by business with a due regard to his health and spirits he varied its monotonous routine with a little screeching or howling or some other innocent relaxation of that nature  he was attended as usual by tom scott who sat crouching over the fire after the manner of a toad and from time to time when his masters back was turned imitating his grimaces with a fearful exactness  the figurehead had not yet disappeared but remained in its old place  the face horribly seared by the frequent application of the redhot poker and further ornamented by the insertion in the tip of the nose of a tenpenny nail yet smiled blandly in its less lacerated parts and seemed like a sturdy martyr to provoke its tormentor to the commission of new outrages and insults  the day in the highest and brightest quarters of the town was damp dark cold and gloomy  in that low and marshy spot the fog filled every nook and corner with a thick dense cloud  every object was obscure at one or two yards distance  the warning lights and fires upon the river were powerless beneath this pall and but for a raw and piercing chillness in the air and now and then the cry of some bewildered boatman as he rested on his oars and tried to make out where he was the river itself might have been miles away  the mist though sluggish and slow to move was of a keenly searching kind  no muffling up in furs and broadcloth kept it out  it seemed to penetrate into the very bones of the shrinking wayfarers and to rack them with cold and pains  everything was wet and clammy to the touch the warm blaze alone defied it and leaped and sparkled merrily  it was a day to be at home crowding about the fire telling stories of travellers who had lost their way in such weather on heaths and moors and to love a warm hearth more than ever  the dwarfs humour as we know was to have a fireside to himself and when he was disposed to be convivial to enjoy himself alone  by no means insensible to the comfort of being within doors he ordered tom scott to pile the little stove with coals and dismissing his work for that day determined to be jovial  to this end he lighted up fresh candles and heaped more fuel on the fire and having dined off a beefsteak which he cooked himself in somewhat of a savage and canniballike manner brewed a great bowl of hot punch lighted his pipe and sat down to spend the evening  at this moment a low knocking at the cabindoor arrested his attention  when it had been twice or thrice repeated he softly opened the little window and thrusting his head out demanded who was there  only me quilp replied a womans voice  only you cried the dwarf stretching his neck to obtain a better view of his visitor  and what brings you here you jade  how dare you approach the ogres castle eh  i have come with some news rejoined his spouse  dont be angry with me  is it good news pleasant news news to make a man skip and snap his fingers said the dwarf  is the dear old lady dead  i dont know what news it is or whether its good or bad rejoined his wife  then shes alive said quilp and theres nothing the matter with her  go home again you bird of evil note go home i have brought a letter cried the meek little woman  toss it in at the window here and go your ways said quilp interrupting her or ill come out and scratch you  no but please quilpdo hear me speak urged his submissive wife in tears  please do  speak then growled the dwarf with a malicious grin  be quick and short about it  speak will you  it was left at our house this afternoon said mrs quilp trembling by a boy who said he didnt know from whom it came but that it was given to him to leave and that he was told to say it must be brought on to you directly for it was of the very greatest consequencebut please she added as her husband stretched out his hand for it please let me in  you dont know how wet and cold i am or how many times i have lost my way in coming here through this thick fog  let me dry myself at the fire for five minutes  ill go away directly you tell me to quilp  upon my word i will  her amiable husband hesitated for a few moments but bethinking himself that the letter might require some answer of which she could be the bearer closed the window opened the door and bade her enter mrs quilp obeyed right willingly and kneeling down before the fire to warm her hands delivered into his a little packet  im glad youre wet said quilp snatching it and squinting at her im glad youre cold  im glad you lost your way  im glad your eyes are red with crying  it does my heart good to see your little nose so pinched and frosty  oh quilp sobbed his wife  how cruel it is of you  did she think i was dead said quilp wrinkling his face into a most extraordinary series of grimaces  did she think she was going to have all the money and to marry somebody she liked  ha ha ha  did she  these taunts elicited no reply from the poor little woman who remained on her knees warming her hands and sobbing to mr quilps great delight  but just as he was contemplating her and chuckling excessively he happened to observe that tom scott was delighted too wherefore that he might have no presumptuous partner in his glee the dwarf instantly collared him dragged him to the door and after a short scuffle kicked him into the yard  in return for this mark of attention tom immediately walked upon his hands to the window andif the expression be allowablelooked in with his shoes besides rattling his feet upon the glass like a banshee upside down  as a matter of course mr quilp lost no time in resorting to the infallible poker with which after some dodging and lying in ambush he paid his young friend one or two such unequivocal compliments that he vanished precipitately and left him in quiet possession of the field  so  that little job being disposed of said the dwarf coolly ill read my letter  humph he muttered looking at the direction  i ought to know this writing  beautiful sally  opening it he read in a fair round legal hand as follows  sammy has been practised upon and has broken confidence  it has all come out  you had better not be in the way for strangers are going to call upon you  they have been very quiet as yet because they mean to surprise you  dont lose time  i didnt  i am not to be found anywhere  if i was you i wouldnt either  s b late of b m  to describe the changes that passed over quilps face as he read this letter halfadozen times would require some new language such for power of expression as was never written read or spoken  for a long time he did not utter one word but after a considerable interval during which mrs quilp was almost paralysed with the alarm his looks engendered he contrived to gasp out  if i had him here  if i only had him here  oh quilp said his wife whats the matter  who are you angry with  i should drown him said the dwarf not heeding her  too easy a death too short too quickbut the river runs close at hand  oh if i had him here just to take him to the brink coaxingly and pleasantlyholding him by the buttonholejoking with himand with a sudden push to send him splashing down  drowning men come to the surface three times they say  ah  to see him those three times and mock him as his face came bobbing upoh what a rich treat that would be  quilp stammered his wife venturing at the same time to touch him on the shoulder what has gone wrong  she was so terrified by the relish with which he pictured this pleasure to himself that she could scarcely make herself intelligible  such a bloodless cur said quilp rubbing his hands very slowly and pressing them tight together  i thought his cowardice and servility were the best guarantee for his keeping silence  oh brass brassmy dear good affectionate faithful complimentary charming friendif i only had you here  his wife who had retreated lest she should seem to listen to these mutterings ventured to approach him again and was about to speak when he hurried to the door and called tom scott who remembering his late gentle admonition deemed it prudent to appear immediately  there said the dwarf pulling him in  take her home  dont come here tomorrow for this place will be shut up  come back no more till you hear from me or see me  do you mind  tom nodded sulkily and beckoned mrs quilp to lead the way  as for you said the dwarf addressing himself to her ask no questions about me make no search for me say nothing concerning me i shall not be dead mistress and thatll comfort you  hell take care of you  but quilp  what is the matter  where are you going  do say something more  ill say that said the dwarf seizing her by the arm and do that too which undone and unsaid would be best for you unless you go directly  has anything happened cried his wife  oh  do tell me that  yes snarled the dwarf  no  what matter which  i have told you what to do  woe betide you if you fail to do it or disobey me by a hairs breadth  will you go  i am going ill go directly but faltered his wife answer me one question first  has this letter any connexion with dear little nell i must ask you thati must indeed quilp  you cannot think what days and nights of sorrow i have had through having once deceived that child  i dont know what harm i may have brought about but great or little i did it for you quilp  my conscience misgave me when i did it  do answer me this question if you please  the exasperated dwarf returned no answer but turned round and caught up his usual weapon with such vehemence that tom scott dragged his charge away by main force and as swiftly as he could  it was well he did so for quilp who was nearly mad with rage pursued them to the neighbouring lane and might have prolonged the chase but for the dense mist which obscured them from his view and appeared to thicken every moment  it will be a good night for travelling anonymously he said as he returned slowly being pretty well breathed with his run  stay  we may look better here  this is too hospitable and free  by a great exertion of strength he closed the two old gates which were deeply sunken in the mud and barred them with a heavy beam  that done he shook his matted hair from about his eyes and tried themstrong and fast  the fence between this wharf and the next is easily climbed said the dwarf when he had taken these precautions  theres a back lane too from there  that shall be my way out  a man need know his road well to find it in this lovely place tonight  i need fear no unwelcome visitors while this lasts i think  almost reduced to the necessity of groping his way with his hands it had grown so dark and the fog had so much increased he returned to his lair and after musing for some time over the fire busied himself in preparations for a speedy departure  while he was collecting a few necessaries and cramming them into his pockets he never once ceased communing with himself in a low voice or unclenched his teeth which he had ground together on finishing miss brasss note  oh sampson he muttered good worthy creatureif i could but hug you  if i could only fold you in my arms and squeeze your ribs as i could squeeze them if i once had you tightwhat a meeting there would be between us  if we ever do cross each other again sampson well have a greeting not easily to be forgotten trust me  this time sampson this moment when all had gone on so well was so nicely chosen  it was so thoughtful of you so penitent so good  oh if we were face to face in this room again my whitelivered man of law how well contented one of us would be  there he stopped and raising the bowl of punch to his lips drank a long deep draught as if it were fair water and cooling to his parched mouth  setting it down abruptly and resuming his preparations he went on with his soliloquy  theres sally he said with flashing eyes the woman has spirit determination purposewas she asleep or petrified  she could have stabbed himpoisoned him safely  she might have seen this coming on why does she give me notice when its too late  when he sat thereyonder there over therewith his white face and red head and sickly smile why didnt i know what was passing in his heart  it should have stopped beating that night if i had been in his secret or there are no drugs to lull a man to sleep or no fire to burn him  another draught from the bowl and cowering over the fire with a ferocious aspect he muttered to himself again  and this like every other trouble and anxiety i have had of late times springs from that old dotard and his darling childtwo wretched feeble wanderers  ill be their evil genius yet  and you sweet kit honest kit virtuous innocent kit look to yourself  where i hate i bite  i hate you my darling fellow with good cause and proud as you are tonight ill have my turn  whats that  a knocking at the gate he had closed  a loud and violent knocking then a pause as if those who knocked had stopped to listen  then the noise again more clamorous and importunate than before  so soon said the dwarf  and so eager  i am afraid i shall disappoint you  its well im quite prepared  sally i thank you  as he spoke he extinguished the candle  in his impetuous attempts to subdue the brightness of the fire he overset the stove which came tumbling forward and fell with a crash upon the burning embers it had shot forth in its descent leaving the room in pitchy darkness  the noise at the gate still continuing he felt his way to the door and stepped into the open air  at that moment the knocking ceased  it was about eight oclock but the dead of the darkest night would have been as noonday in comparison with the thick cloud which then rested upon the earth and shrouded everything from view  he darted forward for a few paces as if into the mouth of some dim yawning cavern then thinking he had gone wrong changed the direction of his steps then stood still not knowing where to turn  if they would knock again said quilp trying to peer into the gloom by which he was surrounded the sound might guide me  come  batter the gate once more  he stood listening intently but the noise was not renewed  nothing was to be heard in that deserted place but at intervals the distant barkings of dogs  the sound was far awaynow in one quarter now answered in anothernor was it any guide for it often came from shipboard as he knew  if i could find a wall or fence said the dwarf stretching out his arms and walking slowly on i should know which way to turn  a good black devils night this to have my dear friend here  if i had but that wish it might for anything i cared never be day again  as the word passed his lips he staggered and felland next moment was fighting with the cold dark water  for all its bubbling up and rushing in his ears he could hear the knocking at the gate againcould hear a shout that followed itcould recognise the voice  for all his struggling and plashing he could understand that they had lost their way and had wandered back to the point from which they started that they were all but looking on while he was drowned that they were close at hand but could not make an effort to save him that he himself had shut and barred them out  he answered the shoutwith a yell which seemed to make the hundred fires that danced before his eyes tremble and flicker as if a gust of wind had stirred them  it was of no avail  the strong tide filled his throat and bore him on upon its rapid current  another mortal struggle and he was up again beating the water with his hands and looking out with wild and glaring eyes that showed him some black object he was drifting close upon  the hull of a ship  he could touch its smooth and slippery surface with his hand  one loud cry nowbut the resistless water bore him down before he could give it utterance and driving him under it carried away a corpse  it toyed and sported with its ghastly freight now bruising it against the slimy piles now hiding it in mud or long rank grass now dragging it heavily over rough stones and gravel now feigning to yield it to its own element and in the same action luring it away until tired of the ugly plaything it flung it on a swampa dismal place where pirates had swung in chains through many a wintry nightand left it there to bleach  and there it lay alone  the sky was red with flame and the water that bore it there had been tinged with the sullen light as it flowed along the place the deserted carcass had left so recently a living man was now a blazing ruin  there was something of the glare upon its face the hair stirred by the damp breeze played in a kind of mockery of deathsuch a mockery as the dead man himself would have delighted in when aliveabout its head and its dress fluttered idly in the night wind     chapter 68  lighted rooms bright fires cheerful faces the music of glad voices words of love and welcome warm hearts and tears of happinesswhat a change is this  but it is to such delights that kit is hastening they are awaiting him he knows  he fears he will die of joy before he gets among them  they have prepared him for this all day  he is not to be carried off tomorrow with the rest they tell him first  by degrees they let him know that doubts have arisen that inquiries are to be made and perhaps he may be pardoned after all  at last the evening being come they bring him to a room where some gentlemen are assembled  foremost among them is his good old master who comes and takes him by the hand he hears that his innocence is established and that he is pardoned he cannot see the speaker but he turns towards the voice and in trying to answer falls down insensible  they recover him again and tell him he must be composed and bear this like a man  somebody says he must think of his poor mother  it is because he does think of her so much that the happy news had overpowered him  they crowd about him and tell him that the truth has gone abroad and that all the town and country ring with sympathy for his misfortunes  he has no ears for this  his thoughts as yet have no wider range than home  does she know it  what did she say who told her  he can speak of nothing else  they make him drink a little wine and talk kindly to him for a while until he is more collected and can listen and thank them  he is free to go  mr garland thinks if he feels better it is time they went away  the gentlemen cluster round him and shake hands with him  he feels very grateful to them for the interest they have in him and for the kind promises they make but the power of speech is gone again and he has much ado to keep his feet even though leaning on his masters arm  as they come through the dismal passages some officers of the jail who are in waiting there congratulate him in their rough way on his release  the newsmonger is of the number but his manner is not quite heartythere is something of surliness in his compliments  he looks upon kit as an intruder as one who has obtained admission to that place on false pretences who has enjoyed a privilege without being duly qualified  he may be a very good sort of young man he thinks but he has no business there and the sooner he is gone the better  the last door shuts behind them  they have passed the outer wall and stand in the open airin the street he has so often pictured to himself when hemmed in by the gloomy stones and which has been in all his dreams  it seems wider and more busy than it used to be  the night is bad and yet how cheerful and gay in his eyes  one of the gentlemen in taking leave of him pressed some money into his hand he has not counted it but when they have gone a few paces beyond the box for poor prisoners he hastily returns and drops it in  mr garland has a coach waiting in a neighbouring street and taking kit inside with him bids the man drive home  at first they can only travel at a foot pace and then with torches going on before because of the heavy fog  but as they get farther from the river and leave the closer portions of the town behind they are able to dispense with this precaution and to proceed at a brisker rate  on the road hard galloping would be too slow for kit but when they are drawing near their journeys end he begs they may go more slowly and when the house appears in sight that they may stoponly for a minute or two to give him time to breathe  but there is no stopping then for the old gentleman speaks stoutly to him the horses mend their pace and they are already at the gardengate  next minute they are at the door  there is a noise of tongues and tread of feet inside  it opens  kit rushes in and finds his mother clinging round his neck  and there too is the ever faithful barbaras mother still holding the baby as if she had never put it down since that sad day when they little hoped to have such joy as thisthere she is heaven bless her crying her eyes out and sobbing as never woman sobbed before and there is little barbarapoor little barbara so much thinner and so much paler and yet so very prettytrembling like a leaf and supporting herself against the wall and there is mrs garland neater and nicer than ever fainting away stone dead with nobody to help her and there is mr abel violently blowing his nose and wanting to embrace everybody and there is the single gentleman hovering round them all and constant to nothing for an instant and there is that good dear thoughtful little jacob sitting all alone by himself on the bottom stair with his hands on his knees like an old man roaring fearfully without giving any trouble to anybody and each and all of them are for the time clean out of their wits and do jointly and severally commit all manner of follies  and even when the rest have in some measure come to themselves again and can find words and smiles barbarathat softhearted gentle foolish little barbarais suddenly missed and found to be in a swoon by herself in the back parlour from which swoon she falls into hysterics and from which hysterics into a swoon again and is indeed so bad that despite a mortal quantity of vinegar and cold water she is hardly a bit better at last than she was at first  then kits mother comes in and says will he come and speak to her and kit says yes and goes and he says in a kind voice barbara and barbaras mother tells her that its only kit and barbara says with her eyes closed all the time oh but is it him indeed and barbaras mother says to be sure it is my dear theres nothing the matter now  and in further assurance that hes safe and sound kit speaks to her again and then barbara goes off into another fit of laughter and then into another fit of crying and then barbaras mother and kits mother nod to each other and pretend to scold herbut only to bring her to herself the faster bless youand being experienced matrons and acute at perceiving the first dawning symptoms of recovery they comfort kit with the assurance that shell do now and so dismiss him to the place from whence he came  well  in that place which is the next room there are decanters of wine and all that sort of thing set out as grand as if kit and his friends were firstrate company and there is little jacob walking as the popular phrase is into a homemade plumcake at a most surprising pace and keeping his eye on the figs and oranges which are to follow and making the best use of his time you may believe  kit no sooner comes in than that single gentleman never was such a busy gentleman charges all the glassesbumpersand drinks his health and tells him he shall never want a friend while he lives and so does mr garland and so does mrs garland and so does mr abel  but even this honour and distinction is not all for the single gentleman forthwith pulls out of his pocket a massive silver watchgoing hard and right to half a secondand upon the back of this watch is engraved kits name with flourishes all over and in short it is kits watch bought expressly for him and presented to him on the spot  you may rest assured that mr and mrs garland cant help hinting about their present in store and that mr abel tells outright that he has his and that kit is the happiest of the happy  there is one friend he has not seen yet and as he cannot be conveniently introduced into the family circle by reason of his being an ironshod quadruped kit takes the first opportunity of slipping away and hurrying to the stable  the moment he lays his hand upon the latch the pony neighs the loudest ponys greeting before he has crossed the threshold the pony is capering about his loose box for he brooks not the indignity of a halter mad to give him welcome and when kit goes up to caress and pat him the pony rubs his nose against his coat and fondles him more lovingly than ever pony fondled man  it is the crowning circumstance of his earnest heartfelt reception and kit fairly puts his arm round whiskers neck and hugs him  but how comes barbara to trip in there and how smart she is again she has been at her glass since she recovered  how comes barbara in the stable of all places in the world  why since kit has been away the pony would take his food from nobody but her and barbara you see not dreaming that christopher was there and just looking in to see that everything was right has come upon him unawares  blushing little barbara  it may be that kit has caressed the pony enough it may be that there are even better things to caress than ponies  he leaves him for barbara at any rate and hopes she is better  yes  barbara is a great deal better  she is afraidand here barbara looks down and blushes morethat he must have thought her very foolish  not at all says kit  barbara is glad of that and coughshemjust the slightest cough possiblenot more than that  what a discreet pony when he chooses  he is as quiet now as if he were of marble  he has a very knowing look but that he always has  we have hardly had time to shake hands barbara says kit  barbara gives him hers  why she is trembling now  foolish fluttering barbara  arms length  the length of an arm is not much  barbaras was not a long arm by any means and besides she didnt hold it out straight but bent a little  kit was so near her when they shook hands that he could see a small tiny tear yet trembling on an eyelash  it was natural that he should look at it unknown to barbara  it was natural that barbara should raise her eyes unconsciously and find him out was it natural that at that instant without any previous impulse or design kit should kiss barbara  he did it whether or no  barbara said for shame but let him do it tootwice  he might have done it thrice but the pony kicked up his heels and shook his head as if he were suddenly taken with convulsions of delight and barbara being frightened ran awaynot straight to where her mother and kits mother were though lest they should see how red her cheeks were and should ask her why  sly little barbara  when the first transports of the whole party had subsided and kit and his mother and barbara and her mother with little jacob and the baby to boot had had their suppers togetherwhich there was no hurrying over for they were going to stop there all nightmr garland called kit to him and taking him into a room where they could be alone told him that he had something yet to say which would surprise him greatly kit looked so anxious and turned so pale on hearing this that the old gentleman hastened to add he would be agreeably surprised and asked him if he would be ready next morning for a journey  for a journey sir cried kit  in company with me and my friend in the next room  can you guess its purpose  kit turned paler yet and shook his head  oh yes  i think you do already said his master  try  kit murmured something rather rambling and unintelligible but he plainly pronounced the words miss nell three or four timesshaking his head while he did so as if he would add that there was no hope of that  but mr garland instead of saying try again as kit had made sure he would told him very seriously that he had guessed right  the place of their retreat is indeed discovered he said at last and that is our journeys end  kit faltered out such questions as where was it and how had it been found and how long since and was she well and happy  happy she is beyond all doubt said mr garland  and well ii trust she will be soon  she has been weak and ailing as i learn but she was better when i heard this morning and they were full of hope sit you down and you shall hear the rest  scarcely venturing to draw his breath kit did as he was told  mr garland then related to him how he had a brother of whom he would remember to have heard him speak and whose picture taken when he was a young man hung in the best room and how this brother lived a long way off in a countryplace with an old clergyman who had been his early friend  how although they loved each other as brothers should they had not met for many years but had communicated by letter from time to time always looking forward to some period when they would take each other by the hand once more and still letting the present time steal on as it was the habit for men to do and suffering the future to melt into the past  how this brother whose temper was very mild and quiet and retiringsuch as mr abelswas greatly beloved by the simple people among whom he dwelt who quite revered the bachelor for so they called him and had every one experienced his charity and benevolence  how even those slight circumstances had come to his knowledge very slowly and in course of years for the bachelor was one of those whose goodness shuns the light and who have more pleasure in discovering and extolling the good deeds of others than in trumpeting their own be they never so commendable  how for that reason he seldom told them of his village friends but how for all that his mind had become so full of two among thema child and an old man to whom he had been very kindthat in a letter received a few days before he had dwelt upon them from first to last and had told such a tale of their wandering and mutual love that few could read it without being moved to tears  how he the recipient of that letter was directly led to the belief that these must be the very wanderers for whom so much search had been made and whom heaven had directed to his brothers care  how he had written for such further information as would put the fact beyond all doubt how it had that morning arrived had confirmed his first impression into a certainty and was the immediate cause of that journey being planned which they were to take tomorrow  in the meantime said the old gentleman rising and laying his hand on kits shoulder you have a great need of rest for such a day as this would wear out the strongest man  good night and heaven send our journey may have a prosperous ending     chapter 69  kit was no sluggard next morning but springing from his bed some time before day began to prepare for his welcome expedition  the hurry of spirits consequent upon the events of yesterday and the unexpected intelligence he had heard at night had troubled his sleep through the long dark hours and summoned such uneasy dreams about his pillow that it was rest to rise  but had it been the beginning of some great labour with the same end in viewhad it been the commencement of a long journey to be performed on foot in that inclement season of the year to be pursued under very privation and difficulty and to be achieved only with great distress fatigue and sufferinghad it been the dawn of some painful enterprise certain to task his utmost powers of resolution and endurance and to need his utmost fortitude but only likely to end if happily achieved in good fortune and delight to nellkits cheerful zeal would have been as highly roused kits ardour and impatience would have been at least the same  nor was he alone excited and eager  before he had been up a quarter of an hour the whole house were astir and busy  everybody hurried to do something towards facilitating the preparations  the single gentleman it is true could do nothing himself but he overlooked everybody else and was more locomotive than anybody  the work of packing and making ready went briskly on and by daybreak every preparation for the journey was completed  then kit began to wish they had not been quite so nimble for the travellingcarriage which had been hired for the occasion was not to arrive until nine oclock and there was nothing but breakfast to fill up the intervening blank of one hour and a half yes there was though  there was barbara  barbara was busy to be sure but so much the betterkit could help her and that would pass away the time better than any means that could be devised  barbara had no objection to this arrangement and kit tracking out the idea which had come upon him so suddenly overnight began to think that surely barbara was fond of him and surely he was fond of barbara  now barbara if the truth must be toldas it must and ought to bebarbara seemed of all the little household to take least pleasure in the bustle of the occasion and when kit in the openness of his heart told her how glad and overjoyed it made him barbara became more downcast still and seemed to have even less pleasure in it than before  you have not been home so long christopher said barbaraand it is impossible to tell how carelessly she said ityou have not been home so long that you need to be glad to go away again i should think  but for such a purpose returned kit  to bring back miss nell  to see her again  only think of that  i am so pleased too to think that you will see her barbara at last  barbara did not absolutely say that she felt no gratification on this point but she expressed the sentiment so plainly by one little toss of her head that kit was quite disconcerted and wondered in his simplicity why she was so cool about it  youll say she has the sweetest and beautifullest face you ever saw i know said kit rubbing his hands  im sure youll say that  barbara tossed her head again  whats the matter barbara said kit  nothing cried barbara  and barbara poutednot sulkily or in an ugly manner but just enough to make her look more cherrylipped than ever  there is no school in which a pupil gets on so fast as that in which kit became a scholar when he gave barbara the kiss  he saw what barbara meant nowhe had his lesson by heart all at onceshe was the bookthere it was before him as plain as print  barbara said kit youre not cross with me  oh dear no  why should barbara be cross  and what right had she to be cross  and what did it matter whether she was cross or not  who minded her  why i do said kit  of course i do  barbara didnt see why it was of course at all  kit was sure she must  would she think again  certainly barbara would think again  no she didnt see why it was of course  she didnt understand what christopher meant  and besides she was sure they wanted her up stairs by this time and she must go indeed  no but barbara said kit detaining her gently let us part friends  i was always thinking of you in my troubles  i should have been a great deal more miserable than i was if it hadnt been for you  goodness gracious how pretty barbara was when she colouredand when she trembled like a little shrinking bird  i am telling you the truth barbara upon my word but not half so strong as i could wish said kit  when i want you to be pleased to see miss nell its only because i like you to be pleased with what pleases methats all  as to her barbara i think i could almost die to do her service but you would think so too if you knew her as i do i am sure you would  barbara was touched and sorry to have appeared indifferent  i have been used you see said kit to talk and think of her almost as if she was an angel  when i look forward to meeting her again i think of her smiling as she used to do and being glad to see me and putting out her hand and saying its my own old kit or some such words as thoselike what she used to say  i think of seeing her happy and with friends about her and brought up as she deserves and as she ought to be  when i think of myself its as her old servant and one that loved her dearly as his kind good gentle mistress and who would have goneyes and still would gothrough any harm to serve her  once i couldnt help being afraid that if she came back with friends about her she might forget or be ashamed of having known a humble lad like me and so might speak coldly which would have cut me barbara deeper than i can tell  but when i came to think again i felt sure that i was doing her wrong in this and so i went on as i did at first hoping to see her once more just as she used to be hoping this and remembering what she was has made me feel as if i would always try to please her and always be what i should like to seem to her if i was still her servant  if im the better for thatand i dont think im the worsei am grateful to her for it and love and honour her the more  thats the plain honest truth dear barbara upon my word it is  little barbara was not of a wayward or capricious nature and being full of remorse melted into tears  to what more conversation this might have led we need not stop to inquire for the wheels of the carriage were heard at that moment and being followed by a smart ring at the garden gate caused the bustle in the house which had laid dormant for a short time to burst again into tenfold life and vigour  simultaneously with the travelling equipage arrived mr chuckster in a hackney cab with certain papers and supplies of money for the single gentleman into whose hands he delivered them  this duty discharged he subsided into the bosom of the family and entertaining himself with a strolling or peripatetic breakfast watched with genteel indifference the process of loading the carriage  snobbys in this i see sir he said to mr abel garland  i thought he wasnt in the last trip because it was expected that his presence wouldnt be acceptable to the ancient buffalo  to whom sir demanded mr abel  to the old gentleman returned mr chuckster slightly abashed  our client prefers to take him now said mr abel drily  there is no longer any need for that precaution as my fathers relationship to a gentleman in whom the objects of his search have full confidence will be a sufficient guarantee for the friendly nature of their errand  ah thought mr chuckster looking out of window anybody but me snobby before me of course  he didnt happen to take that particular fivepound note but i have not the smallest doubt that hes always up to something of that sort  i always said it long before this came out  devilish pretty girl that  pon my soul an amazing little creature  barbara was the subject of mr chucksters commendations and as she was lingering near the carriage all being now ready for its departure that gentleman was suddenly seized with a strong interest in the proceedings which impelled him to swagger down the garden and take up his position at a convenient ogling distance  having had great experience of the sex and being perfectly acquainted with all those little artifices which find the readiest road to their hearts mr chuckster on taking his ground planted one hand on his hip and with the other adjusted his flowing hair  this is a favourite attitude in the polite circles and accompanied with a graceful whistling has been known to do immense execution  such however is the difference between town and country that nobody took the smallest notice of this insinuating figure the wretches being wholly engaged in bidding the travellers farewell in kissing hands to each other waving handkerchiefs and the like tame and vulgar practices  for now the single gentleman and mr garland were in the carriage and the postboy was in the saddle and kit well wrapped and muffled up was in the rumble behind and mrs garland was there and mr abel was there and kits mother was there and little jacob was there and barbaras mother was visible in remote perspective nursing the everwakeful baby and all were nodding beckoning curtseying or crying out good bye with all the energy they could express  in another minute the carriage was out of sight and mr chuckster remained alone on the spot where it had lately been with a vision of kit standing up in the rumble waving his hand to barbara and of barbara in the full light and lustre of his eyeshis eyeschucksterschuckster the successfulon whom ladies of quality had looked with favour from phaetons in the parks on sundayswaving hers to kit  how mr chuckster entranced by this monstrous fact stood for some time rooted to the earth protesting within himself that kit was the prince of felonious characters and very emperor or great mogul of snobs and how he clearly traced this revolting circumstance back to that old villany of the shilling are matters foreign to our purpose which is to track the rolling wheels and bear the travellers company on their cold bleak journey  it was a bitter day  a keen wind was blowing and rushed against them fiercely bleaching the hard ground shaking the white frost from the trees and hedges and whirling it away like dust  but little cared kit for weather  there was a freedom and freshness in the wind as it came howling by which let it cut never so sharp was welcome  as it swept on with its cloud of frost bearing down the dry twigs and boughs and withered leaves and carrying them away pellmell it seemed as though some general sympathy had got abroad and everything was in a hurry like themselves  the harder the gusts the better progress they appeared to make  it was a good thing to go struggling and fighting forward vanquishing them one by one to watch them driving up gathering strength and fury as they came along to bend for a moment as they whistled past and then to look back and see them speed away their hoarse noise dying in the distance and the stout trees cowering down before them  all day long it blew without cessation  the night was clear and starlight but the wind had not fallen and the cold was piercing sometimestowards the end of a long stagekit could not help wishing it were a little warmer but when they stopped to change horses and he had had a good run and what with that and the bustle of paying the old postilion and rousing the new one and running to and fro again until the horses were put to he was so warm that the blood tingled and smarted in his fingers endsthen he felt as if to have it one degree less cold would be to lose half the delight and glory of the journey and up he jumped again right cheerily singing to the merry music of the wheels as they rolled away and leaving the townspeople in their warm beds pursued their course along the lonely road  meantime the two gentlemen inside who were little disposed to sleep beguiled the time with conversation  as both were anxious and expectant it naturally turned upon the subject of their expedition on the manner in which it had been brought about and on the hopes and fears they entertained respecting it  of the former they had many of the latter fewnone perhaps beyond that indefinable uneasiness which is inseparable from suddenly awakened hope and protracted expectation  in one of the pauses of their discourse and when half the night had worn away the single gentleman who had gradually become more and more silent and thoughtful turned to his companion and said abruptly  are you a good listener  like most other men i suppose returned mr garland smiling  i can be if i am interested and if not interested i should still try to appear so  why do you ask  i have a short narrative on my lips rejoined his friend and will try you with it  it is very brief  pausing for no reply he laid his hand on the old gentlemans sleeve and proceeded thus  there were once two brothers who loved each other dearly  there was a disparity in their agessome twelve years  i am not sure but they may insensibly have loved each other the better for that reason  wide as the interval between them was however they became rivals too soon the deepest and strongest affection of both their hearts settled upon one object  the youngestthere were reasons for his being sensitive and watchfulwas the first to find this out  i will not tell you what misery he underwent what agony of soul he knew how great his mental struggle was  he had been a sickly child  his brother patient and considerate in the midst of his own high health and strength had many and many a day denied himself the sports he loved to sit beside his couch telling him old stories till his pale face lighted up with an unwonted glow to carry him in his arms to some green spot where he could tend the poor pensive boy as he looked upon the bright summer day and saw all nature healthy but himself to be in any way his fond and faithful nurse  i may not dwell on all he did to make the poor weak creature love him or my tale would have no end  but when the time of trial came the younger brothers heart was full of those old days  heaven strengthened it to repay the sacrifices of inconsiderate youth by one of thoughtful manhood  he left his brother to be happy  the truth never passed his lips and he quitted the country hoping to die abroad  the elder brother married her  she was in heaven before long and left him with an infant daughter  if you have seen the picturegallery of any one old family you will remember how the same face and figureoften the fairest and slightest of them allcome upon you in different generations and how you trace the same sweet girl through a long line of portraitsnever growing old or changingthe good angel of the raceabiding by them in all reversesredeeming all their sins  in this daughter the mother lived again  you may judge with what devotion he who lost that mother almost in the winning clung to this girl her breathing image  she grew to womanhood and gave her heart to one who could not know its worth  well  her fond father could not see her pine and droop  he might be more deserving than he thought him  he surely might become so with a wife like her  he joined their hands and they were married  through all the misery that followed this union through all the cold neglect and undeserved reproach through all the poverty he brought upon her through all the struggles of their daily life too mean and pitiful to tell but dreadful to endure she toiled on in the deep devotion of her spirit and in her better nature as only women can her means and substance wasted her father nearly beggared by her husbands hand and the hourly witness for they lived now under one roof of her illusage and unhappinessshe never but for him bewailed her fate  patient and upheld by strong affection to the last she died a widow of some three weeks date leaving to her fathers care two orphans one a son of ten or twelve years old the other a girlsuch another infant childthe same in helplessness in age in form in featureas she had been herself when her young mother died  the elder brother grandfather to these two children was now a broken man crushed and borne down less by the weight of years than by the heavy hand of sorrow  with the wreck of his possessions he began to tradein pictures first and then in curious ancient things  he had entertained a fondness for such matters from a boy and the tastes he had cultivated were now to yield him an anxious and precarious subsistence  the boy grew like his father in mind and person the girl so like her mother that when the old man had her on his knee and looked into her mild blue eyes he felt as if awakening from a wretched dream and his daughter were a little child again  the wayward boy soon spurned the shelter of his roof and sought associates more congenial to his taste the old man and the child dwelt alone together  it was then when the love of two dead people who had been nearest and dearest to his heart was all transferred to this slight creature when her face constantly before him reminded him from hour to hour of the too early change he had seen in such anotherof all the sufferings he had watched and known and all his child had undergone when the young mans profligate and hardened course drained him of money as his fathers had and even sometimes occasioned them temporary privation and distress it was then that there began to beset him and to be ever in his mind a gloomy dread of poverty and want  he had no thought for himself in this  his fear was for the child  it was a spectre in his house and haunted him night and day  the younger brother had been a traveller in many countries and had made his pilgrimage through life alone  his voluntary banishment had been misconstrued and he had borne not without pain reproach and slight for doing that which had wrung his heart and cast a mournful shadow on his path  apart from this communication between him and the elder was difficult and uncertain and often failed still it was not so wholly broken off but that he learntwith long blanks and gaps between each interval of informationall that i have told you now  then dreams of their young happy lifehappy to him though laden with pain and early carevisited his pillow yet oftener than before and every night a boy again he was at his brothers side  with the utmost speed he could exert he settled his affairs converted into money all the goods he had and with honourable wealth enough for both with open heart and hand with limbs that trembled as they bore him on with emotion such as men can hardly bear and live arrived one evening at his brothers door  the narrator whose voice had faltered lately stopped  the rest said mr garland pressing his hand after a pause i know  yes rejoined his friend we may spare ourselves the sequel  you know the poor result of all my search  even when by dint of such inquiries as the utmost vigilance and sagacity could set on foot we found they had been seen with two poor travelling showmenand in time discovered the men themselvesand in time the actual place of their retreat even then we were too late  pray god we are not too late again  we cannot be said mr garland  this time we must succeed  i have believed and hoped so returned the other  i try to believe and hope so still  but a heavy weight has fallen on my spirits my good friend and the sadness that gathers over me will yield to neither hope nor reason  that does not surprise me said mr garland it is a natural consequence of the events you have recalled of this dreary time and place and above all of this wild and dismal night  a dismal night indeed  hark how the wind is howling     chapter 70  day broke and found them still upon their way  since leaving home they had halted here and there for necessary refreshment and had frequently been delayed especially in the night time by waiting for fresh horses  they had made no other stoppages but the weather continued rough and the roads were often steep and heavy  it would be night again before they reached their place of destination  kit all bluff and hardened with the cold went on manfully and having enough to do to keep his blood circulating to picture to himself the happy end of this adventurous journey and to look about him and be amazed at everything had little spare time for thinking of discomforts  though his impatience and that of his fellowtravellers rapidly increased as the day waned the hours did not stand still  the short daylight of winter soon faded away and it was dark again when they had yet many miles to travel  as it grew dusk the wind fell its distant moanings were more low and mournful and as it came creeping up the road and rattling covertly among the dry brambles on either hand it seemed like some great phantom for whom the way was narrow whose garments rustled as it stalked along  by degrees it lulled and died away and then it came on to snow  the flakes fell fast and thick soon covering the ground some inches deep and spreading abroad a solemn stillness  the rolling wheels were noiseless and the sharp ring and clatter of the horses hoofs became a dull muffled tramp  the life of their progress seemed to be slowly hushed and something deathlike to usurp its place  shading his eyes from the falling snow which froze upon their lashes and obscured his sight kit often tried to catch the earliest glimpse of twinkling lights denoting their approach to some not distant town he could descry objects enough at such times but none correctly  now a tall church spire appeared in view which presently became a tree a barn a shadow on the ground thrown on it by their own bright lamps now there were horsemen footpassengers carriages going on before or meeting them in narrow ways which when they were close upon them turned to shadows too  a wall a ruin a sturdy gable end would rise up in the road and when they were plunging headlong at it would be the road itself  strange turnings too bridges and sheets of water appeared to start up here and there making the way doubtful and uncertain and yet they were on the same bare road and these things like the others as they were passed turned into dim illusions  he descended slowly from his seatfor his limbs were numbedwhen they arrived at a lone postinghouse and inquired how far they had to go to reach their journeys end  it was a late hour in such byplaces and the people were abed but a voice answered from an upper window ten miles  the ten minutes that ensued appeared an hour but at the end of that time a shivering figure led out the horses they required and after another brief delay they were again in motion  it was a crosscountry road full after the first three or four miles of holes and cartruts which being covered by the snow were so many pitfalls to the trembling horses and obliged them to keep a footpace  as it was next to impossible for men so much agitated as they were by this time to sit still and move so slowly all three got out and plodded on behind the carriage  the distance seemed interminable and the walk was most laborious  as each was thinking within himself that the driver must have lost his way a church bell close at hand struck the hour of midnight and the carriage stopped  it had moved softly enough but when it ceased to crunch the snow the silence was as startling as if some great noise had been replaced by perfect stillness  this is the place gentlemen said the driver dismounting from his horse and knocking at the door of a little inn  halloa  past twelve oclock is the dead of night here  the knocking was loud and long but it failed to rouse the drowsy inmates  all continued dark and silent as before  they fell back a little and looked up at the windows which were mere black patches in the whitened house front  no light appeared  the house might have been deserted or the sleepers dead for any air of life it had about it  they spoke together with a strange inconsistency in whispers unwilling to disturb again the dreary echoes they had just now raised  let us go on said the younger brother and leave this good fellow to wake them if he can  i cannot rest until i know that we are not too late  let us go on in the name of heaven  they did so leaving the postilion to order such accommodation as the house afforded and to renew his knocking  kit accompanied them with a little bundle which he had hung in the carriage when they left home and had not forgotten sincethe bird in his old cagejust as she had left him  she would be glad to see her bird he knew  the road wound gently downward  as they proceeded they lost sight of the church whose clock they had heard and of the small village clustering round it  the knocking which was now renewed and which in that stillness they could plainly hear troubled them  they wished the man would forbear or that they had told him not to break the silence until they returned  the old church tower clad in a ghostly garb of pure cold white again rose up before them and a few moments brought them close beside it  a venerable buildinggrey even in the midst of the hoary landscape  an ancient sundial on the belfry wall was nearly hidden by the snowdrift and scarcely to be known for what it was  time itself seemed to have grown dull and old as if no day were ever to displace the melancholy night  a wicket gate was close at hand but there was more than one path across the churchyard to which it led and uncertain which to take they came to a stand again  the village streetif street that could be called which was an irregular cluster of poor cottages of many heights and ages some with their fronts some with their backs and some with gable ends towards the road with here and there a signpost or a shed encroaching on the pathwas close at hand  there was a faint light in a chamber window not far off and kit ran towards that house to ask their way  his first shout was answered by an old man within who presently appeared at the casement wrapping some garment round his throat as a protection from the cold and demanded who was abroad at that unseasonable hour wanting him  tis hard weather this he grumbled and not a night to call me up in  my trade is not of that kind that i need be roused from bed  the business on which folks want me will keep cold especially at this season  what do you want  i would not have roused you if i had known you were old and ill said kit  old repeated the other peevishly  how do you know i am old  not so old as you think friend perhaps  as to being ill you will find many young people in worse case than i am  mores the pity that it should be sonot that i should be strong and hearty for my years i mean but that they should be weak and tender  i ask your pardon though said the old man if i spoke rather rough at first  my eyes are not good at nightthats neither age nor illness they never wereand i didnt see you were a stranger  i am sorry to call you from your bed said kit but those gentlemen you may see by the churchyard gate are strangers too who have just arrived from a long journey and seek the parsonagehouse  you can direct us  i should be able to answered the old man in a trembling voice for come next summer i have been sexton here good fifty years  the right hand path friend is the roadthere is no ill news for our good gentleman i hope  kit thanked him and made him a hasty answer in the negative he was turning back when his attention was caught by the voice of a child looking up he saw a very little creature at a neighbouring window  what is that cried the child earnestly  has my dream come true pray speak to me whoever that is awake and up  poor boy said the sexton before kit could answer how goes it darling has my dream come true exclaimed the child again in a voice so fervent that it might have thrilled to the heart of any listener  but no that can never be  how could it beoh how could it  i guess his meaning said the sexton  to bed again poor boy  ay cried the child in a burst of despair  i knew it could never be i felt too sure of that before i asked  but all tonight and last night too it was the same  i never fall asleep but that cruel dream comes back  try to sleep again said the old man soothingly  it will go in time  no no i would rather that it staidcruel as it is i would rather that it staid rejoined the child  i am not afraid to have it in my sleep but i am so sadso very very sad  the old man blessed him the child in tears replied good night and kit was again alone  he hurried back moved by what he had heard though more by the childs manner than by anything he had said as his meaning was hidden from him  they took the path indicated by the sexton and soon arrived before the parsonage wall  turning round to look about them when they had got thus far they saw among some ruined buildings at a distance one single solitary light  it shone from what appeared to be an old oriel window and being surrounded by the deep shadows of overhanging walls sparkled like a star  bright and glimmering as the stars above their heads lonely and motionless as they it seemed to claim some kindred with the eternal lamps of heaven and to burn in fellowship with them  what light is that said the younger brother  it is surely said mr garland in the ruin where they live  i see no other ruin hereabouts  they cannot returned the brother hastily be waking at this late hour  kit interposed directly and begged that while they rang and waited at the gate they would let him make his way to where this light was shining and try to ascertain if any people were about  obtaining the permission he desired he darted off with breathless eagerness and still carrying the birdcage in his hand made straight towards the spot  it was not easy to hold that pace among the graves and at another time he might have gone more slowly or round by the path  unmindful of all obstacles however he pressed forward without slackening his speed and soon arrived within a few yards of the window  he approached as softly as he could and advancing so near the wall as to brush the whitened ivy with his dress listened  there was no sound inside  the church itself was not more quiet  touching the glass with his cheek he listened again  no  and yet there was such a silence all around that he felt sure he could have heard even the breathing of a sleeper if there had been one there  a strange circumstance a light in such a place at that time of night with no one near it  a curtain was drawn across the lower portion of the window and he could not see into the room  but there was no shadow thrown upon it from within  to have gained a footing on the wall and tried to look in from above would have been attended with some dangercertainly with some noise and the chance of terrifying the child if that really were her habitation  again and again he listened again and again the same wearisome blank  leaving the spot with slow and cautious steps and skirting the ruin for a few paces he came at length to a door  he knocked  no answer but there was a curious noise inside  it was difficult to determine what it was  it bore a resemblance to the low moaning of one in pain but it was not that being far too regular and constant  now it seemed a kind of song now a wailseemed that is to his changing fancy for the sound itself was never changed or checked  it was unlike anything he had ever heard and in its tone there was something fearful chilling and unearthly  the listeners blood ran colder now than ever it had done in frost and snow but he knocked again  there was no answer and the sound went on without any interruption  he laid his hand softly upon the latch and put his knee against the door  it was secured on the inside but yielded to the pressure and turned upon its hinges  he saw the glimmering of a fire upon the old walls and entered     chapter 71  the dull red glow of a wood firefor no lamp or candle burnt within the roomshowed him a figure seated on the hearth with its back towards him bending over the fitful light  the attitude was that of one who sought the heat  it was and yet was not  the stooping posture and the cowering form were there but no hands were stretched out to meet the grateful warmth no shrug or shiver compared its luxury with the piercing cold outside  with limbs huddled together head bowed down arms crossed upon the breast and fingers tightly clenched it rocked to and fro upon its seat without a moments pause accompanying the action with the mournful sound he had heard  the heavy door had closed behind him on his entrance with a crash that made him start  the figure neither spoke nor turned to look nor gave in any other way the faintest sign of having heard the noise  the form was that of an old man his white head akin in colour to the mouldering embers upon which he gazed  he and the failing light and dying fire the timeworn room the solitude the wasted life and gloom were all in fellowship  ashes and dust and ruin  kit tried to speak and did pronounce some words though what they were he scarcely knew  still the same terrible low cry went onstill the same rocking in the chairthe same stricken figure was there unchanged and heedless of his presence  he had his hand upon the latch when something in the formdistinctly seen as one log broke and fell and as it fell blazed uparrested it  he returned to where he had stood beforeadvanced a paceanotheranother still  another and he saw the face  yes changed as it was he knew it well  master he cried stooping on one knee and catching at his hand dear master  speak to me  the old man turned slowly towards him and muttered in a hollow voice  this is anotherhow many of these spirits there have been tonight  no spirit master  no one but your old servant  you know me now i am sure  miss nellwhere is shewhere is she  they all say that cried the old man  they all ask the same question  a spirit  where is she demanded kit  oh tell me but thatbut that dear master  she is asleepyonderin there  thank god  aye  thank god returned the old man  i have prayed to him many and many and many a livelong night when she has been asleep he knows  hark  did she call  i heard no voice  you did  you hear her now  do you tell me that you dont hear that  he started up and listened again  nor that he cried with a triumphant smile can any body know that voice so well as i  hush  hush motioning to him to be silent he stole away into another chamber  after a short absence during which he could be heard to speak in a softened soothing tone he returned bearing in his hand a lamp  she is still asleep he whispered  you were right  she did not callunless she did so in her slumber  she has called to me in her sleep before now sir as i have sat by watching i have seen her lips move and have known though no sound came from them that she spoke of me  i feared the light might dazzle her eyes and wake her so i brought it here  he spoke rather to himself than to the visitor but when he had put the lamp upon the table he took it up as if impelled by some momentary recollection or curiosity and held it near his face  then as if forgetting his motive in the very action he turned away and put it down again  she is sleeping soundly he said but no wonder  angel hands have strewn the ground deep with snow that the lightest footstep may be lighter yet and the very birds are dead that they may not wake her she used to feed them sir  though never so cold and hungry the timid things would fly from us  they never flew from her  again he stopped to listen and scarcely drawing breath listened for a long long time  that fancy past he opened an old chest took out some clothes as fondly as if they had been living things and began to smooth and brush them with his hand  why dost thou lie so idle there dear nell he murmured when there are bright red berries out of doors waiting for thee to pluck them why dost thou lie so idle there when thy little friends come creeping to the door crying where is nellsweet nelland sob and weep because they do not see thee  she was always gentle with children the wildest would do her biddingshe had a tender way with them indeed she had  kit had no power to speak  his eyes were filled with tears  her little homely dressher favourite cried the old man pressing it to his breast and patting it with his shrivelled hand  she will miss it when she wakes  they have hid it here in sport but she shall have itshe shall have it  i would not vex my darling for the wide worlds riches  see herethese shoeshow worn they areshe kept them to remind her of our last long journey  you see where the little feet went bare upon the ground  they told me afterwards that the stones had cut and bruised them  she never told me that  no no god bless her and i have remembered since she walked behind me sir that i might not see how lame she wasbut yet she had my hand in hers and seemed to lead me still  he pressed them to his lips and having carefully put them back again went on communing with himselflooking wistfully from time to time towards the chamber he had lately visited  she was not wont to be a lieabed but she was well then  we must have patience  when she is well again she will rise early as she used to do and ramble abroad in the healthy morning time  i often tried to track the way she had gone but her small footstep left no print upon the dewy ground to guide me  who is that  shut the door quickhave we not enough to do to drive away that marble cold and keep her warm  the door was indeed opened for the entrance of mr garland and his friend accompanied by two other persons  these were the schoolmaster and the bachelor  the former held a light in his hand  he had it seemed but gone to his own cottage to replenish the exhausted lamp at the moment when kit came up and found the old man alone  he softened again at sight of these two friends and laying aside the angry mannerif to anything so feeble and so sad the term can be appliedin which he had spoken when the door opened resumed his former seat and subsided by little and little into the old action and the old dull wandering sound  of the strangers he took no heed whatever  he had seen them but appeared quite incapable of interest or curiosity  the younger brother stood apart  the bachelor drew a chair towards the old man and sat down close beside him  after a long silence he ventured to speak  another night and not in bed he said softly i hoped you would be more mindful of your promise to me  why do you not take some rest  sleep has left me returned the old man  it is all with her  it would pain her very much to know that you were watching thus said the bachelor  you would not give her pain  i am not so sure of that if it would only rouse her  she has slept so very long  and yet i am rash to say so  it is a good and happy sleepeh  indeed it is returned the bachelor  indeed indeed it is  thats welland the waking faltered the old man  happy too  happier than tongue can tell or heart of man conceive  they watched him as he rose and stole on tiptoe to the other chamber where the lamp had been replaced  they listened as he spoke again within its silent walls  they looked into the faces of each other and no mans cheek was free from tears  he came back whispering that she was still asleep but that he thought she had moved  it was her hand he saida littlea very very littlebut he was pretty sure she had moved itperhaps in seeking his  he had known her do that before now though in the deepest sleep the while  and when he had said this he dropped into his chair again and clasping his hands above his head uttered a cry never to be forgotten  the poor schoolmaster motioned to the bachelor that he would come on the other side and speak to him  they gently unlocked his fingers which he had twisted in his grey hair and pressed them in their own  he will hear me said the schoolmaster i am sure  he will hear either me or you if we beseech him  she would at all times  i will hear any voice she liked to hear cried the old man  i love all she loved  i know you do returned the schoolmaster  i am certain of it think of her think of all the sorrows and afflictions you have shared together of all the trials and all the peaceful pleasures you have jointly known  i do  i do  i think of nothing else  i would have you think of nothing else tonightof nothing but those things which will soften your heart dear friend and open it to old affections and old times  it is so that she would speak to you herself and in her name it is that i speak now  you do well to speak softly said the old man  we will not wake her  i should be glad to see her eyes again and to see her smile there is a smile upon her young face now but it is fixed and changeless  i would have it come and go  that shall be in heavens good time  we will not wake her  let us not talk of her in her sleep but as she used to be when you were journeying together far awayas she was at home in the old house from which you fled togetheras she was in the old cheerful time said the schoolmaster  she was always cheerfulvery cheerful cried the old man looking steadfastly at him  there was ever something mild and quiet about her i remember from the first but she was of a happy nature  we have heard you say pursued the schoolmaster that in this and in all goodness she was like her mother  you can think of and remember her  he maintained his steadfast look but gave no answer  or even one before her said the bachelor  it is many years ago and affliction makes the time longer but you have not forgotten her whose death contributed to make this child so dear to you even before you knew her worth or could read her heart  say that you could carry back your thoughts to very distant daysto the time of your early lifewhen unlike this fair flower you did not pass your youth alone say that you could remember long ago another child who loved you dearly you being but a child yourself  say that you had a brother long forgotten long unseen long separated from you who now at last in your utmost need came back to comfort and console you  to be to you what you were once to him cried the younger falling on his knee before him to repay your old affection brother dear by constant care solicitude and love to be at your right hand what he has never ceased to be when oceans rolled between us to call to witness his unchanging truth and mindfulness of bygone days whole years of desolation  give me but one word of recognition brotherand neverno never in the brightest moment of our youngest days when poor silly boys we thought to pass our lives togetherhave we been half as dear and precious to each other as we shall be from this time hence  the old man looked from face to face and his lips moved but no sound came from them in reply  if we were knit together then pursued the younger brother what will be the bond between us now  our love and fellowship began in childhood when life was all before us and will be resumed when we have proved it and are but children at the last  as many restless spirits who have hunted fortune fame or pleasure through the world retire in their decline to where they first drew breath vainly seeking to be children once again before they die so we less fortunate than they in early life but happier in its closing scenes will set up our rest again among our boyish haunts and going home with no hope realised that had its growth in manhoodcarrying back nothing that we brought away but our old yearnings to each othersaving no fragment from the wreck of life but that which first endeared itmay be indeed but children as at first  and even he added in an altered voice even if what i dread to name has come to passeven if that be so or is to be which heaven forbid and spare usstill dear brother we are not apart and have that comfort in our great affliction  by little and little the old man had drawn back towards the inner chamber while these words were spoken  he pointed there as he replied with trembling lips  you plot among you to wean my heart from her  you never will do thatnever while i have life  i have no relative or friend but heri never hadi never will have  she is all in all to me  it is too late to part us now  waving them off with his hand and calling softly to her as he went he stole into the room  they who were left behind drew close together and after a few whispered wordsnot unbroken by emotion or easily utteredfollowed him  they moved so gently that their footsteps made no noise but there were sobs from among the group and sounds of grief and mourning  for she was dead  there upon her little bed she lay at rest  the solemn stillness was no marvel now  she was dead  no sleep so beautiful and calm so free from trace of pain so fair to look upon  she seemed a creature fresh from the hand of god and waiting for the breath of life not one who had lived and suffered death  her couch was dressed with here and there some winter berries and green leaves gathered in a spot she had been used to favour  when i die put near me something that has loved the light and had the sky above it always  those were her words  she was dead  dear gentle patient noble nell was dead  her little birda poor slight thing the pressure of a finger would have crushedwas stirring nimbly in its cage and the strong heart of its child mistress was mute and motionless for ever  where were the traces of her early cares her sufferings and fatigues all gone  sorrow was dead indeed in her but peace and perfect happiness were born imaged in her tranquil beauty and profound repose  and still her former self lay there unaltered in this change  yes the old fireside had smiled upon that same sweet face it had passed like a dream through haunts of misery and care at the door of the poor schoolmaster on the summer evening before the furnace fire upon the cold wet night at the still bedside of the dying boy there had been the same mild lovely look  so shall we know the angels in their majesty after death  the old man held one languid arm in his and had the small hand tight folded to his breast for warmth  it was the hand she had stretched out to him with her last smilethe hand that had led him on through all their wanderings  ever and anon he pressed it to his lips then hugged it to his breast again murmuring that it was warmer now and as he said it he looked in agony to those who stood around as if imploring them to help her  she was dead and past all help or need of it  the ancient rooms she had seemed to fill with life even while her own was waning fastthe garden she had tendedthe eyes she had gladdenedthe noiseless haunts of many a thoughtful hourthe paths she had trodden as it were but yesterdaycould know her never more  it is not said the schoolmaster as he bent down to kiss her on the cheek and gave his tears free vent it is not on earth that heavens justice ends  think what earth is compared with the world to which her young spirit has winged its early flight and say if one deliberate wish expressed in solemn terms above this bed could call her back to life which of us would utter it     chapter 72  when morning came and they could speak more calmly on the subject of their grief they heard how her life had closed  she had been dead two days  they were all about her at the time knowing that the end was drawing on  she died soon after daybreak they had read and talked to her in the earlier portion of the night but as the hours crept on she sunk to sleep  they could tell by what she faintly uttered in her dreams that they were of her journeyings with the old man they were of no painful scenes but of people who had helped and used them kindly for she often said god bless you with great fervour  waking she never wandered in her mind but once and that was of beautiful music which she said was in the air  god knows it may have been  opening her eyes at last from a very quiet sleep she begged that they would kiss her once again  that done she turned to the old man with a lovely smile upon her facesuch they said as they had never seen and never could forgetand clung with both her arms about his neck they did not know that she was dead at first  she had spoken very often of the two sisters who she said were like dear friends to her  she wished they could be told how much she thought about them and how she had watched them as they walked together by the river side at night  she would like to see poor kit she had often said of late  she wished there was somebody to take her love to kit  and even then she never thought or spoke about him but with something of her old clear merry laugh  for the rest she had never murmured or complained but with a quiet mind and manner quite unalteredsave that she every day became more earnest and more grateful to themfaded like the light upon a summers evening  the child who had been her little friend came there almost as soon as it was day with an offering of dried flowers which he begged them to lay upon her breast  it was he who had come to the window overnight and spoken to the sexton and they saw in the snow traces of small feet where he had been lingering near the room in which she lay before he went to bed  he had a fancy it seemed that they had left her there alone and could not bear the thought  he told them of his dream again and that it was of her being restored to them just as she used to be  he begged hard to see her saying that he would be very quiet and that they need not fear his being alarmed for he had sat alone by his young brother all day long when he was dead and had felt glad to be so near him  they let him have his wish and indeed he kept his word and was in his childish way a lesson to them all  up to that time the old man had not spoken onceexcept to heror stirred from the bedside  but when he saw her little favourite he was moved as they had not seen him yet and made as though he would have him come nearer  then pointing to the bed he burst into tears for the first time and they who stood by knowing that the sight of this child had done him good left them alone together  soothing him with his artless talk of her the child persuaded him to take some rest to walk abroad to do almost as he desired him  and when the day came on which must remove her in her earthly shape from earthly eyes for ever he led him away that he might not know when she was taken from him  they were to gather fresh leaves and berries for her bed  it was sundaya bright clear wintry afternoonand as they traversed the village street those who were walking in their path drew back to make way for them and gave them a softened greeting  some shook the old man kindly by the hand some stood uncovered while he tottered by and many cried god help him as he passed along  neighbour said the old man stopping at the cottage where his young guides mother dwelt how is it that the folks are nearly all in black today  i have seen a mourning ribbon or a piece of crape on almost every one  she could not tell the woman said  why you yourselfyou wear the colour too he said  windows are closed that never used to be by day  what does this mean  again the woman said she could not tell  we must go back said the old man hurriedly  we must see what this is  no no cried the child detaining him  remember what you promised our way is to the old green lane where she and i so often were and where you found us more than once making those garlands for her garden  do not turn back  where is she now said the old man  tell me that  do you not know returned the child  did we not leave her but just now  true  true  it was her we leftwas it  he pressed his hand upon his brow looked vacantly round and as if impelled by a sudden thought crossed the road and entered the sextons house  he and his deaf assistant were sitting before the fire  both rose up on seeing who it was  the child made a hasty sign to them with his hand  it was the action of an instant but that and the old mans look were quite enough  do youdo you bury any one today he said eagerly  no no  who should we bury sir returned the sexton  aye who indeed  i say with you who indeed  it is a holiday with us good sir returned the sexton mildly  we have no work to do today  why then ill go where you will said the old man turning to the child  youre sure of what you tell me  you would not deceive me  i am changed even in the little time since you last saw me  go thy ways with him sir cried the sexton and heaven be with ye both  i am quite ready said the old man meekly  come boy come and so submitted to be led away  and now the bellthe bell she had so often heard by night and day and listened to with solemn pleasure almost as a living voicerung its remorseless toll for her so young so beautiful so good decrepit age and vigorous life and blooming youth and helpless infancy poured forthon crutches in the pride of strength and health in the full blush of promise in the mere dawn of lifeto gather round her tomb  old men were there whose eyes were dim and senses failinggrandmothers who might have died ten years ago and still been oldthe deaf the blind the lame the palsied the living dead in many shapes and forms to see the closing of that early grave what was the death it would shut in to that which still could crawl and creep above it  along the crowded path they bore her now pure as the newlyfallen snow that covered it whose day on earth had been as fleeting  under the porch where she had sat when heaven in its mercy brought her to that peaceful spot she passed again and the old church received her in its quiet shade  they carried her to one old nook where she had many and many a time sat musing and laid their burden softly on the pavement  the light streamed on it through the coloured windowa window where the boughs of trees were ever rustling in the summer and where the birds sang sweetly all day long  with every breath of air that stirred among those branches in the sunshine some trembling changing light would fall upon her grave  earth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust  many a young hand dropped in its little wreath many a stifled sob was heard  someand they were not a fewknelt down  all were sincere and truthful in their sorrow  the service done the mourners stood apart and the villagers closed round to look into the grave before the pavementstone should be replaced  one called to mind how he had seen her sitting on that very spot and how her book had fallen on her lap and she was gazing with a pensive face upon the sky  another told how he had wondered much that one so delicate as she should be so bold how she had never feared to enter the church alone at night but had loved to linger there when all was quiet and even to climb the tower stair with no more light than that of the moon rays stealing through the loopholes in the thick old wall  a whisper went about among the oldest that she had seen and talked with angels and when they called to mind how she had looked and spoken and her early death some thought it might be so indeed thus coming to the grave in little knots and glancing down and giving place to others and falling off in whispering groups of three or four the church was cleared in time of all but the sexton and the mourning friends  they saw the vault covered and the stone fixed down  then when the dusk of evening had come on and not a sound disturbed the sacred stillness of the placewhen the bright moon poured in her light on tomb and monument on pillar wall and arch and most of all it seemed to them upon her quiet gravein that calm time when outward things and inward thoughts teem with assurances of immortality and worldly hopes and fears are humbled in the dust before themthen with tranquil and submissive hearts they turned away and left the child with god  oh it is hard to take to heart the lesson that such deaths will teach but let no man reject it for it is one that all must learn and is a mighty universal truth  when death strikes down the innocent and young for every fragile form from which he lets the panting spirit free a hundred virtues rise in shapes of mercy charity and love to walk the world and bless it  of every tear that sorrowing mortals shed on such green graves some good is born some gentler nature comes  in the destroyers steps there spring up bright creations that defy his power and his dark path becomes a way of light to heaven  it was late when the old man came home  the boy had led him to his own dwelling under some pretence on their way back and rendered drowsy by his long ramble and late want of rest he had sunk into a deep sleep by the fireside  he was perfectly exhausted and they were careful not to rouse him  the slumber held him a long time and when he at length awoke the moon was shining  the younger brother uneasy at his protracted absence was watching at the door for his coming when he appeared in the pathway with his little guide  he advanced to meet them and tenderly obliging the old man to lean upon his arm conducted him with slow and trembling steps towards the house  he repaired to her chamber straight  not finding what he had left there he returned with distracted looks to the room in which they were assembled  from that he rushed into the schoolmasters cottage calling her name  they followed close upon him and when he had vainly searched it brought him home  with such persuasive words as pity and affection could suggest they prevailed upon him to sit among them and hear what they should tell him  then endeavouring by every little artifice to prepare his mind for what must come and dwelling with many fervent words upon the happy lot to which she had been removed they told him at last the truth the moment it had passed their lips he fell down among them like a murdered man  for many hours they had little hope of his surviving but grief is strong and he recovered  if there be any who have never known the blank that follows deaththe weary voidthe sense of desolation that will come upon the strongest minds when something familiar and beloved is missed at every turnthe connection between inanimate and senseless things and the object of recollection when every household god becomes a monument and every room a graveif there be any who have not known this and proved it by their own experience they can never faintly guess how for many days the old man pined and moped away the time and wandered here and there as seeking something and had no comfort  whatever power of thought or memory he retained was all bound up in her  he never understood or seemed to care to understand about his brother  to every endearment and attention he continued listless  if they spoke to him on this or any other themesave onehe would hear them patiently for awhile then turn away and go on seeking as before  on that one theme which was in his and all their minds it was impossible to touch  dead  he could not hear or bear the word  the slightest hint of it would throw him into a paroxysm like that he had had when it was first spoken  in what hope he lived no man could tell but that he had some hope of finding her againsome faint and shadowy hope deferred from day to day and making him from day to day more sick and sore at heartwas plain to all  they bethought them of a removal from the scene of this last sorrow of trying whether change of place would rouse or cheer him  his brother sought the advice of those who were accounted skilful in such matters and they came and saw him  some of the number staid upon the spot conversed with him when he would converse and watched him as he wandered up and down alone and silent  move him where they might they said he would ever seek to get back there  his mind would run upon that spot  if they confined him closely and kept a strict guard upon him they might hold him prisoner but if he could by any means escape he would surely wander back to that place or die upon the road  the boy to whom he had submitted at first had no longer any influence with him  at times he would suffer the child to walk by his side or would even take such notice of his presence as giving him his hand or would stop to kiss his cheek or pat him on the head  at other times he would entreat himnot unkindlyto be gone and would not brook him near  but whether alone or with this pliant friend or with those who would have given him at any cost or sacrifice some consolation or some peace of mind if happily the means could have been devised he was at all times the samewith no love or care for anything in lifea brokenhearted man  at length they found one day that he had risen early and with his knapsack on his back his staff in hand her own straw hat and little basket full of such things as she had been used to carry was gone  as they were making ready to pursue him far and wide a frightened schoolboy came who had seen him but a moment before sitting in the churchupon her grave he said  they hastened there and going softly to the door espied him in the attitude of one who waited patiently  they did not disturb him then but kept a watch upon him all that day  when it grew quite dark he rose and returned home and went to bed murmuring to himself she will come tomorrow  upon the morrow he was there again from sunrise until night and still at night he laid him down to rest and murmured she will come tomorrow  and thenceforth every day and all day long he waited at her grave for her  how many pictures of new journeys over pleasant country of restingplaces under the free broad sky of rambles in the fields and woods and paths not often troddenhow many tones of that one wellremembered voice how many glimpses of the form the fluttering dress the hair that waved so gaily in the windhow many visions of what had been and what he hoped was yet to berose up before him in the old dull silent church  he never told them what he thought or where he went  he would sit with them at night pondering with a secret satisfaction they could see upon the flight that he and she would take before night came again and still they would hear him whisper in his prayers lord  let her come tomorrow  the last time was on a genial day in spring  he did not return at the usual hour and they went to seek him  he was lying dead upon the stone  they laid him by the side of her whom he had loved so well and in the church where they had often prayed and mused and lingered hand in hand the child and the old man slept together     chapter 73  the magic reel which rolling on before has led the chronicler thus far now slackens in its pace and stops  it lies before the goal the pursuit is at an end  it remains but to dismiss the leaders of the little crowd who have borne us company upon the road and so to close the journey  foremost among them smooth sampson brass and sally arm in arm claim our polite attention  mr sampson then being detained as already has been shown by the justice upon whom he called and being so strongly pressed to protract his stay that he could by no means refuse remained under his protection for a considerable time during which the great attention of his entertainer kept him so extremely close that he was quite lost to society and never even went abroad for exercise saving into a small paved yard  so well indeed was his modest and retiring temper understood by those with whom he had to deal and so jealous were they of his absence that they required a kind of friendly bond to be entered into by two substantial housekeepers in the sum of fifteen hundred pounds apiece before they would suffer him to quit their hospitable roofdoubting it appeared that he would return if once let loose on any other terms  mr brass struck with the humour of this jest and carrying out its spirit to the utmost sought from his wide connection a pair of friends whose joint possessions fell some halfpence short of fifteen pence and proffered them as bailfor that was the merry word agreed upon both sides  these gentlemen being rejected after twentyfour hours pleasantry mr brass consented to remain and did remain until a club of choice spirits called a grand jury who were in the joke summoned him to a trial before twelve other wags for perjury and fraud who in their turn found him guilty with a most facetious joynay the very populace entered into the whim and when mr brass was moving in a hackneycoach towards the building where these wags assembled saluted him with rotten eggs and carcases of kittens and feigned to wish to tear him into shreds which greatly increased the comicality of the thing and made him relish it the more no doubt  to work this sportive vein still further mr brass by his counsel moved in arrest of judgment that he had been led to criminate himself by assurances of safety and promises of pardon and claimed the leniency which the law extends to such confiding natures as are thus deluded  after solemn argument this point with others of a technical nature whose humorous extravagance it would be difficult to exaggerate was referred to the judges for their decision sampson being meantime removed to his former quarters  finally some of the points were given in sampsons favour and some against him and the upshot was that instead of being desired to travel for a time in foreign parts he was permitted to grace the mother country under certain insignificant restrictions  these were that he should for a term of years reside in a spacious mansion where several other gentlemen were lodged and boarded at the public charge who went clad in a sober uniform of grey turned up with yellow had their hair cut extremely short and chiefly lived on gruel and light soup  it was also required of him that he should partake of their exercise of constantly ascending an endless flight of stairs and lest his legs unused to such exertion should be weakened by it that he should wear upon one ankle an amulet or charm of iron  these conditions being arranged he was removed one evening to his new abode and enjoyed in common with nine other gentlemen and two ladies the privilege of being taken to his place of retirement in one of royaltys own carriages  over and above these trifling penalties his name was erased and blotted out from the roll of attorneys which erasure has been always held in these latter times to be a great degradation and reproach and to imply the commission of some amazing villanyas indeed it would seem to be the case when so many worthless names remain among its better records unmolested  of sally brass conflicting rumours went abroad  some said with confidence that she had gone down to the docks in male attire and had become a female sailor others darkly whispered that she had enlisted as a private in the second regiment of foot guards and had been seen in uniform and on duty to wit leaning on her musket and looking out of a sentrybox in st jamess park one evening  there were many such whispers as these in circulation but the truth appears to be that after the lapse of some five years during which there is no direct evidence of her having been seen at all two wretched people were more than once observed to crawl at dusk from the inmost recesses of st giless and to take their way along the streets with shuffling steps and cowering shivering forms looking into the roads and kennels as they went in search of refuse food or disregarded offal  these forms were never beheld but in those nights of cold and gloom when the terrible spectres who lie at all other times in the obscene hidingplaces of london in archways dark vaults and cellars venture to creep into the streets the embodied spirits of disease and vice and famine  it was whispered by those who should have known that these were sampson and his sister sally and to this day it is said they sometimes pass on bad nights in the same loathsome guise close at the elbow of the shrinking passenger  the body of quilp being foundthough not until some days had elapsedan inquest was held on it near the spot where it had been washed ashore  the general supposition was that he had committed suicide and this appearing to be favoured by all the circumstances of his death the verdict was to that effect  he was left to be buried with a stake through his heart in the centre of four lonely roads  it was rumoured afterwards that this horrible and barbarous ceremony had been dispensed with and that the remains had been secretly given up to tom scott  but even here opinion was divided for some said tom dug them up at midnight and carried them to a place indicated to him by the widow  it is probable that both these stories may have had their origin in the simple fact of toms shedding tears upon the inquestwhich he certainly did extraordinary as it may appear  he manifested besides a strong desire to assault the jury and being restrained and conducted out of court darkened its only window by standing on his head upon the sill until he was dexterously tilted upon his feet again by a cautious beadle  being cast upon the world by his masters death he determined to go through it upon his head and hands and accordingly began to tumble for his bread  finding however his english birth an insurmountable obstacle to his advancement in this pursuit notwithstanding that his art was in high repute and favour he assumed the name of an italian image lad with whom he had become acquainted and afterwards tumbled with extraordinary success and to overflowing audiences  little mrs quilp never quite forgave herself the one deceit that lay so heavy on her conscience and never spoke or thought of it but with bitter tears her husband had no relations and she was rich  he had made no will or she would probably have been poor  having married the first time at her mothers instigation she consulted in her second choice nobody but herself  it fell upon a smart young fellow enough and as he made it a preliminary condition that mrs jiniwin should be thenceforth an outpensioner they lived together after marriage with no more than the average amount of quarrelling and led a merry life upon the dead dwarfs money  mr and mrs garland and mr abel went out as usual except that there was a change in their household as will be seen presently and in due time the latter went into partnership with his friend the notary on which occasion there was a dinner and a ball and great extent of dissipation  unto this ball there happened to be invited the most bashful young lady that was ever seen with whom mr abel happened to fall in love  how it happened or how they found it out or which of them first communicated the discovery to the other nobody knows  but certain it is that in course of time they were married and equally certain it is that they were the happiest of the happy and no less certain it is that they deserved to be so  and it is pleasant to write down that they reared a family because any propagation of goodness and benevolence is no small addition to the aristocracy of nature and no small subject of rejoicing for mankind at large  the pony preserved his character for independence and principle down to the last moment of his life which was an unusually long one and caused him to be looked upon indeed as the very old parr of ponies he often went to and fro with the little phaeton between mr garlands and his sons and as the old people and the young were frequently together had a stable of his own at the new establishment into which he would walk of himself with surprising dignity  he condescended to play with the children as they grew old enough to cultivate his friendship and would run up and down the little paddock with them like a dog but though he relaxed so far and allowed them such small freedoms as caresses or even to look at his shoes or hang on by his tail he never permitted any one among them to mount his back or drive him thus showing that even their familiarity must have its limits and that there were points between them far too serious for trifling  he was not unsusceptible of warm attachments in his later life for when the good bachelor came to live with mr garland upon the clergymans decease he conceived a great friendship for him and amiably submitted to be driven by his hands without the least resistance  he did no work for two or three years before he died but lived in clover and his last act like a choleric old gentleman was to kick his doctor  mr swiveller recovering very slowly from his illness and entering into the receipt of his annuity bought for the marchioness a handsome stock of clothes and put her to school forthwith in redemption of the vow he had made upon his fevered bed  after casting about for some time for a name which should be worthy of her he decided in favour of sophronia sphynx as being euphonious and genteel and furthermore indicative of mystery  under this title the marchioness repaired in tears to the school of his selection from which as she soon distanced all competitors she was removed before the lapse of many quarters to one of a higher grade  it is but bare justice to mr swiveller to say that although the expenses of her education kept him in straitened circumstances for half a dozen years he never slackened in his zeal and always held himself sufficiently repaid by the accounts he heard with great gravity of her advancement on his monthly visits to the governess who looked upon him as a literary gentleman of eccentric habits and of a most prodigious talent in quotation  in a word mr swiveller kept the marchioness at this establishment until she was at a moderate guess full nineteen years of age goodlooking clever and goodhumoured when he began to consider seriously what was to be done next  on one of his periodical visits while he was revolving this question in his mind the marchioness came down to him alone looking more smiling and more fresh than ever then it occurred to him but not for the first time that if she would marry him how comfortable they might be  so richard asked her whatever she said it wasnt no and they were married in good earnest that day week  which gave mr swiveller frequent occasion to remark at divers subsequent periods that there had been a young lady saving up for him after all  a little cottage at hampstead being to let which had in its garden a smokingbox the envy of the civilised world they agreed to become its tenants and when the honeymoon was over entered upon its occupation  to this retreat mr chuckster repaired regularly every sunday to spend the dayusually beginning with breakfastand here he was the great purveyor of general news and fashionable intelligence for some years he continued a deadly foe to kit protesting that he had a better opinion of him when he was supposed to have stolen the fivepound note than when he was shown to be perfectly free of the crime inasmuch as his guilt would have had in it something daring and bold whereas his innocence was but another proof of a sneaking and crafty disposition  by slow degrees however he was reconciled to him in the end and even went so far as to honour him with his patronage as one who had in some measure reformed and was therefore to be forgiven  but he never forgot or pardoned that circumstance of the shilling holding that if he had come back to get another he would have done well enough but that his returning to work out the former gift was a stain upon his moral character which no penitence or contrition could ever wash away  mr swiveller having always been in some measure of a philosophic and reflective turn grew immensely contemplative at times in the smokingbox and was accustomed at such periods to debate in his own mind the mysterious question of sophronias parentage  sophronia herself supposed she was an orphan but mr swiveller putting various slight circumstances together often thought miss brass must know better than that and having heard from his wife of her strange interview with quilp entertained sundry misgivings whether that person in his lifetime might not also have been able to solve the riddle had he chosen  these speculations however gave him no uneasiness for sophronia was ever a most cheerful affectionate and provident wife to him and dick excepting for an occasional outbreak with mr chuckster which she had the good sense rather to encourage than oppose was to her an attached and domesticated husband  and they played many hundred thousand games of cribbage together  and let it be added to dicks honour that though we have called her sophronia he called her the marchioness from first to last and that upon every anniversary of the day on which he found her in his sick room mr chuckster came to dinner and there was great glorification  the gamblers isaac list and jowl with their trusty confederate mr james groves of unimpeachable memory pursued their course with varying success until the failure of a spirited enterprise in the way of their profession dispersed them in various directions and caused their career to receive a sudden check from the long and strong arm of the law  this defeat had its origin in the untoward detection of a new associateyoung frederick trentwho thus became the unconscious instrument of their punishment and his own  for the young man himself he rioted abroad for a brief term living by his witswhich means by the abuse of every faculty that worthily employed raises man above the beasts and so degraded sinks him far below them  it was not long before his body was recognised by a stranger who chanced to visit that hospital in paris where the drowned are laid out to be owned despite the bruises and disfigurements which were said to have been occasioned by some previous scuffle  but the stranger kept his own counsel until he returned home and it was never claimed or cared for  the younger brother or the single gentleman for that designation is more familiar would have drawn the poor schoolmaster from his lone retreat and made him his companion and friend  but the humble village teacher was timid of venturing into the noisy world and had become fond of his dwelling in the old churchyard  calmly happy in his school and in the spot and in the attachment of her little mourner he pursued his quiet course in peace and was through the righteous gratitude of his friendlet this brief mention suffice for thata poor schoolmaster no more  that friendsingle gentleman or younger brother which you willhad at his heart a heavy sorrow but it bred in him no misanthropy or monastic gloom  he went forth into the world a lover of his kind for a long long time it was his chief delight to travel in the steps of the old man and the child so far as he could trace them from her last narrative to halt where they had halted sympathise where they had suffered and rejoice where they had been made glad  those who had been kind to them did not escape his search  the sisters at the schoolthey who were her friends because themselves so friendlessmrs jarley of the waxwork codlin shorthe found them all and trust me the man who fed the furnace fire was not forgotten  kits story having got abroad raised him up a host of friends and many offers of provision for his future life  he had no idea at first of ever quitting mr garlands service but after serious remonstrance and advice from that gentleman began to contemplate the possibility of such a change being brought about in time  a good post was procured for him with a rapidity which took away his breath by some of the gentlemen who had believed him guilty of the offence laid to his charge and who had acted upon that belief  through the same kind agency his mother was secured from want and made quite happy  thus as kit often said his great misfortune turned out to be the source of all his subsequent prosperity  did kit live a single man all his days or did he marry  of course he married and who should be his wife but barbara  and the best of it was he married so soon that little jacob was an uncle before the calves of his legs already mentioned in this history had ever been encased in broadcloth pantaloonsthough that was not quite the best either for of necessity the baby was an uncle too  the delight of kits mother and of barbaras mother upon the great occasion is past all telling finding they agreed so well on that and on all other subjects they took up their abode together and were a most harmonious pair of friends from that time forth  and hadnt astleys cause to bless itself for their all going together once a quarterto the pitand didnt kits mother always say when they painted the outside that kits last treat had helped to that and wonder what the manager would feel if he but knew it as they passed his house  when kit had children six and seven years old there was a barbara among them and a pretty barbara she was  nor was there wanting an exact facsimile and copy of little jacob as he appeared in those remote times when they taught him what oysters meant  of course there was an abel own godson to the mr garland of that name and there was a dick whom mr swiveller did especially favour  the little group would often gather round him of a night and beg him to tell again that story of good miss nell who died  this kit would do and when they cried to hear it wishing it longer too he would teach them how she had gone to heaven as all good people did and how if they were good like her they might hope to be there too one day and to see and know her as he had done when he was quite a boy  then he would relate to them how needy he used to be and how she had taught him what he was otherwise too poor to learn and how the old man had been used to say she always laughs at kit at which they would brush away their tears and laugh themselves to think that she had done so and be again quite merry  he sometimes took them to the street where she had lived but new improvements had altered it so much it was not like the same  the old house had been long ago pulled down and a fine broad road was in its place  at first he would draw with his stick a square upon the ground to show them where it used to stand  but he soon became uncertain of the spot and could only say it was thereabouts he thought and these alterations were confusing  such are the changes which a few years bring about and so do things pass away like a tale that is told
