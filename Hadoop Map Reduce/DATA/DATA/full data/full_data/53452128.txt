of women    on the minding of other peoples business    on the time wasted in looking before one leaps    on the nobility of ourselves    on the motherliness of man    on the inadvisability of following advice    on the playing of marches at the funerals of marionettes     on the art of making up ones mind  now which would you advise dear you see with the red i shant be able to wear my magenta hat  well then why not have the grey  yesyes i think the grey will be more useful  its a good material  yes and its a pretty grey you know what i mean dear not a common grey of course grey is always an uninteresting colour  its quiet  and then again what i feel about the red is that it is so warmlooking red makes you feel warm even when youre not warm you know what i mean dear  well then why not have the red it suits youred  no do you really think so  well when youve got a colour i mean of course  yes that is the drawback to red no i think on the whole the grey is safer  then you will

madam  well dont for a moment just let me have another look at the red you see dear it has just occurred to methat chinchilla would look so well on the red  so it would dear  and you see ive got the chinchilla  then have the red why not  well there is the hat im thinking of  you havent anything else you could wear with that  nothing at all and it would go so beautifully with the greyyes i think ill have the grey its always a safe colourgrey  fourteen yards i think you said madam  yes fourteen yards will be enough because i shall mix it withone minute you see dear if i take the grey i shall have nothing to wear with my black jacket  wont it go with grey  not wellnot so well as with red  i should have the red then you evidently fancy it yourself  no personally i prefer the grey but then one must think of everything andgood gracious thats surely not the right time  no madam its ten minutes slow we always keep our clocks a little slow  and we were too have been at madame jannaways at a quarter past twelve how long shopping does take iwhy whatever time did we start  about eleven wasnt it  halfpast ten i remember now because you know we said wed start at halfpast nine weve been two hours already  and we dont seem to have done much do we  done literally nothing and i meant to have done so much i must go to madame jannaways have you got my purse dear oh its all right ive got it  well now you havent decided whether youre going to have the grey or the red  im sure i dont know what i do want now i had made up my mind a minute ago and now its all gone againoh yes i remember the red yes ill have the red no i dont mean the red i mean the grey  you were talking about the red last time if you remember dear  oh so i was youre quite right thats the worst of shopping do you know i get quite confused sometimes  then you will decide on the red madam  yesyes i shant do any better shall i dear what do you think you havent got any other shades of red have you this is such an ugly red  the shopman reminds her that she has seen all the other reds and that this is the particular shade she selected and admired  oh very well she replies with the air of one from whom all earthly cares are falling i must take that then i suppose i cant be worried about it any longer ive wasted half the morning already  outside she recollects three insuperable objections to the red and four unanswerable arguments why she should have selected the grey she wonders would they change it if she went back and asked to see the shopwalker her friend who wants her lunch thinks not  that is what i hate about shopping she says one never has time to really think  she says she shant go to that shop again  we laugh at her but are we so very much better come my superior male friend have you never stood amid your wardrobe undecided whether in her eyes you would appear more imposing clad in the rough tweed suit that so admirably displays your broad shoulders or in the orthodox black frock that after all is perhaps more suitable to the figure of a man approachinglet us say the nineandtwenties or better still why not riding costume did we not hear her say how well jones looked in his topboots and breeches and hang it all we have a better leg than jones what a pity ridingbreeches are made so baggy nowadays why is it that male fashions tend more and more to hide the male leg as women have become less and less ashamed of theirs we have become more and more reticent of ours why are the silken hose the tightfitting pantaloons the neat kneebreeches of our forefathers impossible today are we grown more modestor has there come about a falling off rendering concealment advisable  i can never understand myself why women love us it must be our honest worth our sterling merit that attracts themcertainly not our appearance in a pair of tweed dittos black angora coat and vest standup collar and chimneypot hat no it must be our sheer force of character that compels their admiration  what a good time our ancestors must have had was borne in upon me when on one occasion i appeared in character at a fancy dress ball what i represented i am unable to say and i dont particularly care i only know it was something military i also remember that the costume was two sizes too small for me in the chest and thereabouts and three sizes too large for me in the hat i padded the hat and dined in the middle of the day off a chop and half a glass of sodawater i have gained prizes as a boy for mathematics also for scripture historynot often but i have done it a literary critic now dead once praised a book of mine i know there have been occasions when my conduct has won the approbation of good men but nevernever in my whole life have i felt more proud more satisfied with myself than on that evening when the last hook fastened i gazed at my fulllength self in the cheval glass i was a dream i say it who should not but i am not the only one who said it i was a glittering dream the groundwork was red trimmed with gold braid wherever there was room for gold braid and where there was no more possible room for gold braid there hung gold cords and tassels and straps gold buttons and buckles fastened me gold embroidered belts and sashes caressed me white horsehair plumes waved oer me i am not sure that everything was in its proper place but i managed to get everything on somehow and i looked well it suited me my success was a revelation to me of female human nature girls who had hitherto been cold and distant gathered round me timidly solicitous of notice girls on whom i smiled lost their heads and gave themselves airs girls who were not introduced to me sulked and were rude to girls that had been for one poor child with whom i sat out two dances at least she sat while i stood gracefully beside heri had been advised by the costumier not to sit i was sorry he was a worthy young fellow the son of a cotton broker and he would have made her a good husband i feel sure but he was foolish to come as a beerbottle  perhaps after all it is as well those old fashions have gone out a week in that suit might have impaired my natural modesty  one wonders that fancy dress balls are not more popular in this grey age of ours the childish instinct to dress up to make believe is with us all we grow so tired of being always ourselves a teatable discussion at which i once assisted fell into thiswould any one of us when it came to the point change with anybody else the poor man with the millionaire the governess with the princesschange not only outward circumstances and surroundings but health and temperament heart brain and soul so that not one mental or physical particle of ones original self one would retain save only memory the general opinion was that we would not but one lady maintained the affirmative  oh no you wouldnt really dear argued a friend you think you would  yes i would persisted the first lady i am tired of myself id even be you for a change  in my youth the question chiefly important to me waswhat sort of man shall i decide to be at nineteen one asks oneself this question at thirtynine we say i wish fate hadnt made me this sort of man  in those days i was a reader of much wellmeant advice to young men and i gathered that whether i should become a sir lancelot a herr teufelsdrockh or an iago was a matter for my own individual choice whether i should go through life gaily or gravely was a question the pros and cons of which i carefully considered for patterns i turned to books byron was then still popular and many of us made up our minds to be gloomy saturnine young men weary with the world and prone to soliloquy i determined to join them  for a month i rarely smiled or when i did it was with a weary bitter smile concealing a broken heartat least that was the intention shallowminded observers misunderstood  i know exactly how it feels they would say looking at me sympathetically i often have it myself its the sudden change in the weather i think and they would press neat brandy upon me and suggest ginger  again it is distressing to the young man busy burying his secret sorrow under a mound of silence to be slapped on the back by commonplace people and askedwell hows the hump this morning and to hear his mood of dignified melancholy referred to by those who should know better as the sulks  there are practical difficulties also in the way of him who would play the byronic young gentleman he must be supernaturally wickedor rather must have been only alas in the unliterary grammar of life where the future tense stands first and the past is formed not from the indefinite but from the present indicative to have been is to be and to be wicked on a small income is impossible the ruin of even the simplest of maidens costs money in the courts of love one cannot sue in forma pauperis nor would it be the byronic method  to drown remembrance in the cup sounds well but then the cup to be fitting should be of some expensive brand to drink deep of old tokay or asti is poetical but when ones purse necessitates that the draught if it is to be deep enough to drown anything should be of thin beer at fiveandnine the four and a half gallon cask or something similar in price sin is robbed of its flavour  possibly alsolet me think itthe conviction may have been within me that vice even at its daintiest is but an ugly sordid thing repulsive in the sunlight that thoughas rags and dirt to artit may afford picturesque material to literature it is an evilsmelling garment to the wearer one that a good man by reason of poverty of will may come down to but one to be avoided with all ones effort discarded with returning mental prosperity  be this as it may i grew weary of training for a saturnine young man and in the midst of my doubt i chanced upon a book the hero of which was a debonnaire young buck own cousin to tom and jerry he attended fights both of cocks and men flirted with actresses wrenched off doorknockers extinguished street lamps played many a merry jest upon many an unappreciative night watchman for all the which he was much beloved by the women of the book why should not i flirt with actresses put out street lamps play pranks on policemen and be beloved london life was changed since the days of my hero but much remained and the heart of woman is eternal if no longer prizefighting was to be had at least there were boxing competitions so called in dingy back parlours out whitechapel way though cockfighting was a lost sport were there not damp cellars near the river where for twopence a gentleman might back mongrel terriers to kill rats against time and feel himself indeed a sportsman true the atmosphere of reckless gaiety always surrounding my hero i missed myself from these scenes finding in its place an atmosphere more suggestive of gin stale tobacco and nervous apprehension of the police but the essentials must have been the same and the next morning i could exclaim in the very words of my prototypeodds crickets but i feel as though the devil himself were in my head peste take me for a fool  but in this direction likewise my fatal lack of means opposed me it affords much food to the philosophic mind this influence of income upon character even fifthrate boxing competitions organized by friendly leads and ratting contests in rotherhithe slums become expensive when you happen to be the only gentleman present possessed of a collar and are expected to do the honours of your class in dogsnose true climbing lampposts and putting out the gas is fairly cheap providing always you are not caught in the act but as a recreation it lacks variety nor is the modern london lamppost adapted to sport anything more difficult to gripanything with less give in iti have rarely clasped the disgraceful amount of dirt allowed to accumulate upon it is another drawback from the climbers point of view by the time you have swarmed up your third post a positive distaste for gaiety steals over you your desire is towards arnica and a bath  nor in jokes at the expense of policemen is the fun entirely on your side maybe i did not proceed with judgment it occurs to me now looking back that the neighbourhoods of covent garden and great marlborough street were illchosen for sport of this nature to bonnet a fat policeman is excellent fooling while he is struggling with his helmet you can ask him comic questions and by the time he has got his head free you are out of sight but the game should be played in a district where there is not an average of three constables to every dozen square yards when two other policemen who have had their eye on you for the past ten minutes are watching the proceedings from just round the next corner you have little or no leisure for due enjoyment of the situation by the time you have run the whole length of great titchfield street and twice round oxford market you are of opinion that a joke should never be prolonged beyond the point at which there is danger of its becoming wearisome and that the time has now arrived for home and friends the law on the other hand now raised by reinforcements to a strength of six or seven men is just beginning to enjoy the chase you picture to yourself while doing hanover square the scene in court the next morning you will be accused of being drunk and disorderly it will be idle for you to explain to the magistrate or to your relations afterwards that you were only trying to live up to a man who did this sort of thing in a book and was admired for it you will be fined the usual forty shillings and on the next occasion of your calling at the mayfields the girls will be out and mrs mayfield an excellent lady who has always taken a motherly interest in you will talk seriously to you and urge you to sign the pledge  thanks to your youth and constitution you shake off the pursuit at notting hill and to avoid any chance of unpleasant contretemps on the return journey walk home to bloomsbury by way of camden town and islington  i abandoned sportive tendencies as the result of a vow made by myself to providence during the early hours of a certain sunday morning while clinging to the waterspout of an unpretentious house situate in a side street off soho i put it to providence as man to man let me only get out of this i think were the muttered words i used and no more sport for me providence closed on the offer and did let me get out of it true it was a complicated get out involving a broken skylight and three gas globes two hours in a coal cellar and a sovereign to a potman for the loan of an ulster and when at last secure in my chamber i took stock of myselfwhat was left of mei could not but reflect that providence might have done the job neater yet i experienced no desire to escape the terms of the covenant my inclining for the future was towards a life of simplicity  accordingly i cast about for a new character and found one to suit me the german professor was becoming popular as a hero about this period he wore his hair long and was otherwise untidy but he had a heart of steel occasionally of gold the majority of folks in the book judging him from his exterior together with his conversationin broken english dealing chiefly with his dead mother and his little sister lisadubbed him uninteresting but then they did not know about the heart his chief possession was a lame dog which he had rescued from a brutal mob and when he was not talking broken english he was nursing this dog  but his speciality was stopping runaway horses thereby saving the heroines life this combined with the broken english and the dog rendered him irresistible  he seemed a peaceful amiable sort of creature and i decided to try him i could not of course be a german professor but i could and did wear my hair long in spite of much public advice to the contrary voiced chiefly by small boys i endeavoured to obtain possession of a lame dog but failed a oneeyed dealer in seven dials to whom as a last resource i applied offered to lame one for me for an extra five shillings but this suggestion i declined i came across an uncannylooking mongrel late one night he was not lame but he seemed pretty sick and feeling i was not robbing anybody of anything very valuable i lured him home and nursed him i fancy i must have overnursed him he got so healthy in the end there was no doing anything with him he was an illconditioned cur and he was too old to be taught he became the curse of the neighbourhood his idea of sport was killing chickens and sneaking rabbits from outside poulterers shops for recreation he killed cats and frightened small children by yelping round their legs there were times when i could have lamed him myself if only i could have got hold of him i made nothing by running that dognothing whatever people instead of admiring me for nursing him back to life called me a fool and said that if i didnt drown the brute they would he spoilt my character utterlyi mean my character at this period it is difficult to pose as a young man with a heart of gold when discovered in the middle of the road throwing stones at your own dog and stones were the only things that would reach and influence him  i was also hampered by a scarcity in runaway horses the horse of our suburb was not that type of horse once and only once did an opportunity offer itself for practice it was a good opportunity inasmuch as he was not running away very greatly indeed i doubt if he knew himself that he was running away it transpired afterwards that it was a habit of his after waiting for his driver outside the rose and crown for what he considered to be a reasonable period to trot home on his own account he passed me going about seven miles an hour with the reins dragging conveniently beside him he was the very thing for a beginner and i prepared myself at the critical moment however a couple of officious policemen pushed me aside and did it themselves  there was nothing for me to regret as the matter turned out i should only have rescued a baldheaded commercial traveller very drunk who swore horribly and pelted the crowd with empty collarboxes  from the window of a very high flat i once watched three men resolved to stop a runaway horse each man marched deliberately into the middle of the road and took up his stand my window was too far away for me to see their faces but their attitude suggested heroism unto death the first man as the horse came charging towards him faced it with his arms spread out he never flinched until the horse was within about twenty yards of him then as the animal was evidently determined to continue its wild career there was nothing left for him to do but to retire again to the kerb where he stood looking after it with evident sorrow as though saying to himselfoh well if you are going to be headstrong i have done with you  the second man on the catastrophe being thus left clear for him without a moments hesitation walked up a bye street and disappeared the third man stood his ground and as the horse passed him yelled at it i could not hear what he said i have not the slightest doubt it was excellent advice but the animal was apparently too excited even to listen the first and the third man met afterwards and discussed the matter sympathetically i judged they were regretting the pigheadedness of runaway horses in general and hoping that nobody had been hurt  i forget the other characters i assumed about this period one i know that got me into a good deal of trouble was that of a downright honest hearty outspoken young man who always said what he meant  i never knew but one man who made a real success of speaking his mind i have heard him slap the table with his open hand and exclaim  you want me to flatter youto stuff you up with a pack of lies thats not me thats not jim compton but if you care for my honest opinion all i can say is that child is the most marvellous performer on the piano ive ever heard i dont say she is a genius but i have heard liszt and metzler and all the crack players and i prefer her thats my opinion i speak my mind and i cant help it if youre offended  how refreshing the parents would say to come across a man who is not afraid to say what he really thinks why are we not all outspoken  the last character i attempted i thought would be easy to assume it was that of a much admired and beloved young man whose great charm lay in the fact that he was always justhimself other people posed and acted he never made any effort to be anything but his own natural simple self  i thought i also would be my own natural simple self but then the question arosewhat was my own natural simple self  that was the preliminary problem i had to solve i have not solved it to this day what am i i am a great gentleman walking through the world with dauntless heart and head erect scornful of all meanness impatient of all littleness i am a meanthinking littledaring manthe type of man that i of the dauntless heart and the erect head despise greatlycrawling to a poor end by devious ways cringing to the strong timid of all pain ibut dear reader i will not sadden your sensitive ears with details i could give you showing how contemptible a creature this wretched i happens to be nor would you understand me you would only be astonished discovering that such disreputable specimens of humanity contrive to exist in this age it is best my dear sir or madam you should remain ignorant of these evil persons let me not trouble you with knowledge  i am a philosopher greeting alike the thunder and the sunshine with frolic welcome only now and then when all things do not fall exactly as i wish them when foolish wicked people will persist in doing foolish wicked acts affecting my comfort and happiness i rage and fret a goodish deal  as heine said of himself i am knight too of the holy grail valiant for the truth reverent of all women honouring all men eager to yield life to the service of my great captain  and next moment i find myself in the enemys lines fighting under the black banner it must be confusing to these opposing generals all their soldiers being deserters from both armies what are women but mens playthings shall there be no more cakes and ale for me because thou art virtuous what are men but hungry dogs contending each against each for a limited supply of bones do others lest thou be done what is the truth but an unexploded lie  i am a lover of all living things you my poor sister struggling with your heavy burden on your lonely way i would kiss the tears from your worn cheeks lighten with my love the darkness around your feet you my patient brother breathing hard as round and round you tramp the trodden path like some poor halfblind ginhorse stripes your only encouragement scanty store of dry chaff in your manger i would jog beside you taking the strain a little from your aching shoulders and we would walk nodding our heads side by side and you remembering should tell me of the fields where long ago you played of the gallant races that you ran and won and you little pinched brats with wondering eyes looking from dirtencrusted faces i would take you in my arms and tell you fairy stories into the sweet land of makebelieve we would wander leaving the sad old world behind us for a time and you should be princes and princesses and know love  but again a selfish greedy man comes often and sits in my clothes a man who frets away his life planning how to get more moneymore food more clothes more pleasures for himself a man so busy thinking of the many things he needs he has no time to dwell upon the needs of others he deems himself the centre of the universe you would imagine hearing him grumbling that the world had been created and got ready against the time when he should come to take his pleasure in it he would push and trample heedless reaching towards these many desires of his and when grabbing he misses he curses heaven for its injustice and men and women for getting in his path he is not a nice man in any way i wish as i say he would not come so often and sit in my clothes he persists that he is i and that i am only a sentimental fool spoiling his chances sometimes for a while i get rid of him but he always comes back and then he gets rid of me and i become him it is very confusing sometimes i wonder if i really am myself     on the disadvantage of not getting what one wants  long long ago when you and i dear reader were young when the fairies dwelt in the hearts of the roses when the moonbeams bent each night beneath the weight of angels feet there lived a good wise man or rather i should say there had lived for at the time of which i speak the poor old gentleman lay dying waiting each moment the dread summons he fell amusing on the life that stretched far back behind him how full it seemed to him at that moment of follies and mistakes bringing bitter tears not to himself alone but to others also how much brighter a road might it have been had he been wiser had he known  ah me said the good old gentleman if only i could live my life again in the light of experience  now as he spoke these words he felt the drawing near to him of a presence and thinking it was the one whom he expected raising himself a little from his bed he feebly cried  i am ready  but a hand forced him gently back a voice saying not yet i bring life not death your wish shall be granted you shall live your life again and the knowledge of the past shall be with you to guide you see you use it i will come again  then a sleep fell upon the good man and when he awoke he was again a little child lying in his mothers arms but locked within his brain was the knowledge of the life that he had lived already  so once more he lived and loved and laboured so a second time he lay an old worn man with life behind him and the angel stood again beside his bed and the voice said  well are you content now  i am well content said the old gentleman let death come  and have you understood asked the angel  i think so was the answer that experience is but as of the memory of the pathways he has trod to a traveller journeying ever onward into an unknown land i have been wise only to reap the reward of folly knowledge has ofttimes kept me from my good i have avoided my old mistakes only to fall into others that i knew not of i have reached the old errors by new roads where i have escaped sorrow i have lost joy where i have grasped happiness i have plucked pain also now let me go with death that i may learn  which was so like the angel of that period the giving of a gift bringing to a man only more trouble maybe i am overrating my coolness of judgment under somewhat startling circumstances but i am inclined to think that had i lived in those days and had a fairy or an angel come to me wanting to give me somethingmy souls desire or the sum of my ambition or any trifle of that kind i should have been short with him  you pack up that precious bag of tricks of yours i should have said to him it would have been rude but that is how i should have felt and get outside with it im not taking anything in your line today i dont require any supernatural aid to get me into trouble all the worry i want i can get down here so its no good your calling you take that little joke of yoursi dont know what it is but i know enough not to want to knowand run it off on some other idiot im not priggish i have no objection to an innocent game of catchquestions in the ordinary way and when i get a turn myself but if ive got to pay every time and the stakes are to be my earthly happiness plus my future existencewhy i dont play there was the case of midas a nice shabby trick you fellows played off upon him making pretence you did not understand him twisting round the poor old fellows words just for all the world as though you were a pack of old bailey lawyers trying to trip up a witness im ashamed of the lot of you and i tell you socoming down here fooling poor unsuspecting mortals with your nonsense as though we had not enough to harry us as it was then there was that other case of the poor old peasant couple to whom you promised three wishes the whole thing ending in a black pudding and they never got even that you thought that funny i suppose that was your fairy humour a pity i say you have not all of you something better to do with your time as i said before you take that celestial joe miller of yours and work it off on somebody else i have read my fairy lore and i have read my mythology and i dont want any of your blessings and whats more im not going to have them when i want blessings i will put up with the usual sort we are accustomed to down here you know the ones i mean the disguised brandthe blessings that no human being would think were blessings if he were not told the blessings that dont look like blessings that dont feel like blessings that as a matter of fact are not blessings practically speaking the blessings that other people think are blessings for us and that we dont theyve got their drawbacks but they are better than yours at any rate and they are sooner over i dont want your blessings at any price if you leave one here i shall simply throw it out after you  i feel confident i should have answered in that strain and i feel it would have done good somebody ought to have spoken plainly because with fairies and angels of that sort fooling about no one was ever safe for a moment children could hardly have been allowed outside the door one never could have told what silly trick some wouldbe funny fairy might be waiting to play off on them the poor child would not know and would think it was getting something worth having the wonder to me is that some of those angels didnt get tarred and feathered  i am doubtful whether even cinderellas luck was quite as satisfying as we are led to believe after the carpetless kitchen and the black beetles how beautiful the palace must have seemedfor the first year perhaps for the first two and the prince how loving how gallant how tenderfor the first year perhaps for the first two and after you see he was a prince brought up in a court the atmosphere of which is not conducive to the development of the domestic virtues and shewas cinderella and then the marriage altogether was rather a hurried affair oh yes she is a good loving little woman but perhaps our royal highnessship did act too much on the impulse of the moment it was her dear dainty feet that danced their way into our heart how they flashed and twinkled eased in those fairy slippers how like a lily among tulips she moved that night amid the overgorgeous court dames she was so sweet so fresh so different to all the others whom we knew so well how happy she looked as she put her trembling little hand in ours what possibilities might lie behind those drooping lashes and we were in amorous mood that night the music in our feet the flash and glitter in our eyes and then to pique us further she disappeared as suddenly and strangely as she had come who was she whence came she what was the mystery surrounding her was she only a delicious dream a haunting phantasy that we should never look upon again never clasp again within our longing arms was our heart to be for ever hungry haunted by the memory ofno by heavens she is real and a woman here is her dear slipper made surely to be kissed of a size too that a man may well wear within the breast of his doublet had any womannay fairy angel such dear feet search the whole kingdom through but find her find her the gods have heard our prayers and given us this clue suppose she be not all she seemed suppose she be not of birth fit to mate with our noble house out upon thee for an earthbound blind curmudgeon of a lord high chancellor how could a woman whom such slipper fitted be but of the noblest and the best as far above us mere princelet that we are as the stars in heaven are brighter than thy dull old eyes go search the kingdom we tell thee from east to west from north to south and see to it that thou findest her or it shall go hard with thee by venus be she a swineherds daughter she shall be our queenan she deign to accept of us and of our kingdom  ah well of course it was not a wise piece of business that goes without saying but we were young and princes are only human poor child she could not help her education or rather her lack of it dear little thing the wonder is that she has contrived to be no more ignorant than she is dragged up as she was neglected and overworked nor does life in a kitchen amid the companionship of peasants and menials tend to foster the intellect who can blame her for being shy and somewhat dull of thought not we generousminded kindhearted prince that we are and she is very affectionate the family are trying certainly fatherinlaw not a bad sort though a little prosy when upon the subject of his domestic troubles and a little too fond of his glass mammainlaw and those two ugly illmannered sisters decidedly a nuisance about the palace yet what can we do they are our relations now and they do not forget to let us know it well well we had to expect that and things might have been worse anyhow she is not jealousthank goodness  so the day comes when poor little cinderella sits alone of a night in the beautiful palace the courtiers have gone home in their carriages the lord high chancellor has bowed himself out backwards the goldstickinwaiting and the grooms of the chamber have gone to their beds the maids of honour have said goodnight and drifted out of the door laughing and whispering among themselves the clock strikes twelveonetwo and still no footstep creaks upon the stair once it followed swiftly upon the goodnight of the maids who did not laugh or whisper then  at last the door opens and the prince enters none too pleased at finding cinderella still awake so sorry im late my lovedetained on affairs of state foreign policy very complicated dear have only just this moment left the council chamber  and little cinderella while the prince sleeps lies sobbing out her poor sad heart into the beautiful royal pillow embroidered with the royal arms and edged with the royal monogram in lace why did he ever marry me i should have been happier in the old kitchen the black beetles did frighten me a little but there was always the dear old cat and sometimes when mother and the girls were out papa would call softly down the kitchen stairs for me to come up and we would have such a merry evening together and sup off sausages dear old dad i hardly ever see him now and then when my work was done how pleasant it was to sit in front of the fire and dream of the wonderful things that would come to me some day i was always going to be a princess even in my dreams and live in a palace but it was so different to this oh how i hate it this beastly palace where everybody sneers at mei know they do though they bow and scrape and pretend to be so polite and im not clever and smart as they are i hate them i hate these boldfaced women who are always here that is the worst of a palace everybody can come in oh i hate everybody and everything oh godmamma godmamma come and take me away take me back to my old kitchen give me back my old poor frock let me dance again with the firetongs for a partner and be happy dreaming  poor little cinderella perhaps it would have been better had godmamma been less ambitious for you dear had you married some good honest yeoman who would never have known that you were not brilliant who would have loved you because you were just amiable and pretty had your kingdom been only a farmhouse where your knowledge of domestic economy gained so hardly would have been useful where you would have shone instead of being overshadowed where papa would have dropped in of an evening to smoke his pipe and escape from his domestic wrangles where you would have been real queen  but then you know dear you would not have been content ah yes with your present experiencenow you know that queens as well as little drudges have their troubles but without that experience you would have looked in the glass when you were alone you would have looked at your shapely hands and feet and the shadows would have crossed your pretty face yes you would have said to yourselfjohn is a dear kind fellow and i love him very much and all that but and the old dreams dreamt in the old lowceilinged kitchen before the dying fire would have come back to you and you would have been discontented then as now only in a different way oh yes you would cinderella though you gravely shake your goldcrowned head and let me tell you why it is because you are a woman and the fate of all us men and women alike is to be for ever wanting what we have not and to be finding when we have it that it is not what we wanted that is the law of life dear do you think as you lie upon the floor with your head upon your arms that you are the only woman whose tears are soaking into the hearthrug at that moment my dear princess if you could creep unseen about your city peeping at will through the curtainshielded windows you would come to think that all the world was little else than a big nursery full of crying children with none to comfort them the doll is broken no longer it sweetly squeaks in answer to our pressure i love you kiss me the drum lies silent with the drumstick inside no longer do we make a brave noise in the nursery the box of teathings we have clumsily put our foot upon there will be no more merry parties around the threelegged stool the tin trumpet will not play the note we want to sound the wooden bricks keep falling down the toy cannon has exploded and burnt our fingers never mind little man little woman we will try and mend things tomorrow  and after all cinderella dear you do live in a fine palace and you have jewels and grand dresses andno no do not be indignant with me did not you dream of these things as well as of love come now be honest it was always a prince was it not or at the least an exceedingly welltodo party that handsome young gentleman who bowed to you so gallantly from the red embers he was never a virtuous young commercial traveller or cultured clerk earning a salary of three pounds a week was he cinderella yet there are many charming commercial travellers many delightful clerks with limited incomes quite sufficient however to a sensible man and woman desiring but each others love why was it always a prince cinderella had the palace and the liveried servants and the carriages and horses and the jewels and the dresses nothing to do with the dream  no cinderella you were human that is all the artist shivering in his conventional attic dreaming of famedo you think he is not hoping she will come to his loving arms in the form jove came to danae do you think he is not reckoning also upon the good dinners and the big cigars the fur coat and the diamond studs that her visits will enable him to purchase  there is a certain picture very popular just now you may see it cinderella in many of the shopwindows of the town it is called the dream of love and it represents a beautiful young girl sleeping in a very beautiful but somewhat disarranged bed indeed one hopes for the sleepers sake that the night is warm and that the room is fairly free from draughts a ladder of light streams down from the sky into the room and upon this ladder crowd and jostle one another a small army of plump cupids each one laden with some pledge of love two of the imps are emptying a sack of jewels upon the floor four others are bearing well displayed a magnificent dress a confection i believe is the proper term cut somewhat low but making up in train what is lacking elsewhere others bear bonnet boxes from which peep stylish toques and bewitching hoods some representing evidently wholesale houses stagger under silks and satins in the piece cupids are there from the shoemakers with the daintiest of bottines stockings garters and even less mentionable articles are not forgotten caskets mirrors twelvebuttoned gloves scentbottles and handkerchiefs hairpins and the gayest of parasols has the god of love piled into the arms of his messengers really a most practical uptodate god of love moving with the times one feels that the modern temple of love must be a sort of swan and edgars the god himself a kind of celestial shopwalker while his mother venus no doubt superintends the costume department quite an olympian whiteley this latterday eros he has forgotten nothing for at the back of the picture i notice one cupid carrying a rather fat heart at the end of a string  you cinderella could give good counsel to that sleeping child you would say to herawake from such dreams the contents of a pawnbrokers storeroom will not bring you happiness dream of love if you will that is a wise dream even if it remain ever a dream but these coloured beads these manchester goods are you thenyou heiress of all the agesstill at heart only as some poor savage maiden but little removed above the monkeys that share the primeval forest with her will you sell your gold to the first trader that brings you this barter these things child will only dazzle your eyes for a few days do you think the burlington arcade is the gate of heaven  ah yes i too could talk like thati writer of books to the young lad sick of his office stool dreaming of a literary career leading to fame and fortune and do you think lad that by that road you will reach happiness sooner than by another do you think interviews with yourself in penny weeklies will bring you any satisfaction after the first halfdozen do you think the gushing female who has read all your books and who wonders what it must feel like to be so clever will be welcome to you the tenth time you meet her do you think press cuttings will always consist of wondering admiration of your genius of paragraphs about your charming personal appearance under the heading our celebrities have you thought of the uncomplimentary criticisms of the spiteful paragraphs of the everlasting fear of slipping a few inches down the greasy pole called popular taste to which you are condemned to cling for life as some lesser criminal to his weary treadmill struggling with no hope but not to fall make a home lad for the woman who loves you gather one or two friends about you work think and play that will bring you happiness shun this roaring gingerbread fair that calls itself forsooth the world of art and letters let its clowns and its contortionists fight among themselves for the plaudits and the halfpence of the mob let it be with its shouting and its surging its blare and its cheap flare come away the summers night is just the other side of the hedge with its silence and its stars  you and i cinderella are experienced people and can therefore offer good advice but do you think we should be listened to  ah no my prince is not as yours mine will love me always and i am peculiarly fitted for the life of a palace i have the instinct and the ability for it i am sure i was made for a princess thank you cinderella for your wellmeant counsel but there is much difference between you and me  that is the answer you would receive cinderella and my young friend would say to me yes i can understand your finding disappointment in the literary career but then you see our cases are not quite similar i am not likely to find much trouble in keeping my position i shall not fear reading what the critics say of me no doubt there are disadvantages when you are among the ruck but there is always plenty of room at the top so thank you and goodbye  besides cinderella dear we should not quite mean itthis excellent advice we have grown accustomed to these gewgaws and we should miss them in spite of our knowledge of their trashiness you your palace and your little gold crown i my mountebanks cap and the answering laugh that goes up from the crowd when i shake my bells we want everything all the happiness that earth and heaven are capable of bestowing creature comforts and heart and soul comforts also and proudspirited beings that we are we will not be put off with a part give us only everything and we will be content and after all cinderella you have had your day some little dogs never get theirs you must not be greedy you have known happiness the palace was paradise for those few months and the princes arms were about you cinderella the princes kisses on your lips the gods themselves cannot take that from you  the cake cannot last for ever if we will eat of it so greedily there must come the day when we have picked hungrily the last crumbwhen we sit staring at the empty board nothing left of the feast cinderella but the pain that comes of feasting  it is a naive confession poor human nature has made to itself in choosing as it has this story of cinderella for its leading moralbe good little girl be meek under your many trials be gentle and kind in spite of your hard lot and one dayyou shall marry a prince and ride in your own carriage be brave and true little boy work hard and wait with patience and in the end with gods blessing you shall earn riches enough to come back to london town and marry your masters daughter  you and i gentle reader could teach these young folks a truer lesson an we would we know alas that the road of all the virtues does not lead to wealth rather the contrary else how explain our limited incomes but would it be well think you to tell them bluntly the truththat honesty is the most expensive luxury a man can indulge in that virtue if persisted in leads generally speaking to a sixroomed house in an outlying suburb maybe the world is wise the fiction has its uses  i am acquainted with a fairly intelligent young lady she can read and write knows her tables up to six times and can argue i regard her as representative of average humanity in its attitude towards fate and this is a dialogue i lately overheard between her and an older lady who is good enough to occasionally impart to her the wisdom of the world  ive been good this morning havent i  yesoh yes fairly good for you  you think papa will take me to the circus tonight  yes if you keep good if you dont get naughty this afternoon  a pause  i was good on monday you may remember nurse  tolerably good  very good you said nurse  well yes you werent bad  and i was to have gone to the pantomime and i didnt  well that was because your aunt came up suddenly and your papa couldnt get another seat poor auntie wouldnt have gone at all if she hadnt gone then  oh wouldnt she  no  another pause  do you think shell come up suddenly today  oh no i dont think so  no i hope she doesnt i want to go to the circus tonight because you see nurse if i dont it will discourage me  so perhaps the world is wise in promising us the circus we believe her at first but after a while i fear we grow discouraged     on the exceptional merit attaching to the things we meant to do  i can rememberbut then i can remember a long time ago you gentle reader just entering upon the prime of life that age by thoughtless youth called middle i cannot of course expect to follow mewhen there was in great demand a certain periodical ycleped the amateur its aim was noble it sought to teach the beautiful lesson of independence to inculcate the fine doctrine of selfhelp one chapter explained to a man how he might make flowerpots out of australian meat cans another how he might turn buttertubs into musicstools a third how he might utilize old bonnet boxes for venetian blinds that was the principle of the whole scheme you made everything from something not intended for it and as illsuited to the purpose as possible  two pages i distinctly recollect were devoted to the encouragement of the manufacture of umbrella stands out of old gaspiping anything less adapted to the receipt of hats and umbrellas than gaspiping i cannot myself conceive had there been i feel sure the author would have thought of it and would have recommended it  pictureframes you fashioned out of gingerbeer corks you saved your gingerbeer corks you found a pictureand the thing was complete how much gingerbeer it would be necessary to drink preparatory to the making of each frame and the effect of it upon the framemakers physical mental and moral wellbeing did not concern the amateur i calculate that for a fairsized picture sixteen dozen bottles might suffice whether after sixteen dozen of gingerbeer a man would take any interest in framing a picturewhether he would retain any pride in the picture itself is doubtful but this of course was not the point  one young gentleman of my acquaintancethe son of the gardener of my sister as friend ollendorff would have described himdid succeed in getting through sufficient gingerbeer to frame his grandfather but the result was not encouraging indeed the gardeners wife herself was but ill satisfied  whats all them corks round father was her first question  cant you see was the somewhat indignant reply thats the frame  oh but why corks  well the book said corks  still the old lady remained unimpressed  somehow it dont look like father now she sighed  her eldest born grew irritable none of us appreciate criticism  what does it look like then he growled  well i dunno seems to me to look like nothing but corks  the old ladys view was correct certain schools of art possibly lend themselves to this method of framing i myself have seen a funeral card improved by it but generally speaking the consequence was a predominance of frame at the expense of the thing framed the more honest and tasteful of the framemakers would admit as much themselves  yes it is ugly when you look at it said one to me as we stood surveying it from the centre of the room but what one feels about it is that one has done it oneself  which reflection i have noticed reconciles us to many other things beside cork frames  another young gentleman friend of minefor i am bound to admit it was youth that profited most by the advice and counsel of the amateur i suppose as one grows older one grows less daring less industriousmade a rockingchair according to the instructions of this book out of a couple of beer barrels from every practical point of view it was a bad rockingchair it rocked too much and it rocked in too many directions at one and the same time i take it a man sitting on a rockingchair does not want to be continually rocking there comes a time when he says to himselfnow i have rocked sufficiently for the present now i will sit still for a while lest a worse thing befall me but this was one of those headstrong rockingchairs that are a danger to humanity and a nuisance to themselves its notion was that it was made to rock and that when it was not rocking it was wasting its time once started nothing could stop itnothing ever did stop it until it found itself topsy turvy on its own occupant that was the only thing that ever sobered it  i had called and had been shown into the empty drawingroom the rockingchair nodded invitingly at me i never guessed it was an amateur rockingchair i was young in those days with faith in human nature and i imagined that whatever else a man might attempt without knowledge or experience no one would be fool enough to experiment upon a rockingchair  i threw myself into it lightly and carelessly i immediately noticed the ceiling i made an instinctive movement forward the window and a momentary glimpse of the wooded hills beyond shot upwards and disappeared the carpet flashed across my eyes and i caught sight of my own boots vanishing beneath me at the rate of about two hundred miles an hour i made a convulsive effort to recover them i suppose i overdid it i saw the whole of the room at once the four walls the ceiling and the floor at the same moment it was a sort of vision i saw the cottage piano upside down and i again saw my own boots flash past me this time over my head soles uppermost never before had i been in a position where my own boots had seemed so allpervading the next moment i lost my boots and stopped the carpet with my head just as it was rushing past me at the same instant something hit me violently in the small of the back reason when recovered suggested that my assailant must be the rockingchair  investigation proved the surmise correct fortunately i was still alone and in consequence was able a few minutes later to meet my hostess with calm and dignity i said nothing about the rockingchair as a matter of fact i was hoping to have the pleasure before i went of seeing some other guest arrive and sample it i had purposely replaced it in the most prominent and convenient position but though i felt capable of schooling myself to silence i found myself unable to agree with my hostess when she called for my admiration of the thing my recent experiences had too deeply embittered me  willie made it himself explained the fond mother dont you think it was very clever of him  oh yes it was clever i replied i am willing to admit that  he made it out of some old beer barrels she continued she seemed proud of it  my resentment though i tried to keep it under control was mounting higher  oh did he i said i should have thought he might have found something better to do with them  what she asked  oh well many things i retorted he might have filled them again with beer  my hostess looked at me astonished i felt some reason for my tone was expected  you see i explained it is not a wellmade chair these rockers are too short and they are too curved and one of them if you notice is higher than the other and of a smaller radius the back is at too obtuse an angle when it is occupied the centre of gravity becomes  my hostess interrupted me  you have been sitting on it she said  not for long i assured her  her tone changed she became apologetic  i am so sorry she said it looks all right  it does i agreed that is where the dear lads cleverness displays itself its appearance disarms suspicion with judgment that chair might be made to serve a really useful purpose there are mutual acquaintances of oursi mention no names you will know thempompous selfsatisfied superior persons who would be improved by that chair if i were willie i should disguise the mechanism with some artistic drapery bait the thing with a couple of exceptionally inviting cushions and employ it to inculcate modesty and diffidence i defy any human being to get out of that chair feeling as important as when he got into it what the dear boy has done has been to construct an automatic exponent of the transitory nature of human greatness as a moral agency that chair should prove a blessing in disguise  my hostess smiled feebly more i fear from politeness than genuine enjoyment  i think you are too severe she said when you remember that the boy has never tried his hand at anything of the kind before that he has no knowledge and no experience it really is not so bad  considering the matter from that point of view i was bound to concur i did not like to suggest to her that before entering upon a difficult task it would be better for young men to acquire knowledge and experience that is so unpopular a theory  but the thing that the amateur put in the front and foremost of its propaganda was the manufacture of household furniture out of eggboxes why eggboxes i have never been able to understand but eggboxes according to the prescription of the amateur formed the foundation of household existence with a sufficient supply of eggboxes and what the amateur termed a natural deftness no young couple need hesitate to face the furnishing problem three eggboxes made a writingtable on another eggbox you sat to write your books were ranged in eggboxes around youand there was your study complete  for the diningroom two eggboxes made an overmantel four eggboxes and a piece of lookingglass a sideboard while six eggboxes with some wadding and a yard or so of cretonne constituted a socalled cosy corner about the corner there could be no possible doubt you sat on a corner you leant against a corner whichever way you moved you struck a fresh corner the cosiness however i deny eggboxes i admit can be made useful i am even prepared to imagine them ornamental but cosy no i have sampled eggboxes in many shapes i speak of years ago when the world and we were younger when our fortune was the future secure in which we hesitated not to set up house upon incomes folks with lesser expectations might have deemed insufficient under such circumstances the sole alternative to the eggbox or similar school of furniture would have been the strictly classical consisting of a doorway joined to architectural proportions  i have from saturday to monday as honoured guest hung my clothes in eggboxes  i have sat on an eggbox at an eggbox to take my dish of tea i have made love on eggboxesaye and to feel again the blood running through my veins as then it ran i would be content to sit only on eggboxes till the time should come when i could be buried in an eggbox with an eggbox reared above me as tombstonei have spent many an evening on an eggbox i have gone to bed in eggboxes they have their pointsi am intending no punbut to claim for them cosiness would be but to deceive  how quaint they were those homemade rooms they rise out of the shadows and shape themselves again before my eyes i see the knobbly sofa the easychairs that might have been designed by the grand inquisitor himself the dented settle that was a bed by night the few blue plates purchased in the slums off wardour street the enamelled stool to which one always stuck the mirror framed in silk the two japanese fans crossed beneath each cheap engraving the piano cloth embroidered in peacocks feathers by annies sister the teacloth worked by cousin jenny we dreamt sitting on those eggboxesfor we were young ladies and gentlemen with artistic tasteof the days when we would eat in chippendale diningrooms sip our coffee in louis quatorze drawingrooms and be happy well we have got on some of us since then as mr bumpus used to say and i notice when on visits that some of us have contrived so that we do sit on chippendale chairs at sheraton diningtables and are warmed from adams fireplaces but ah me where are the dreams the hopes the enthusiasms that clung like the scent of a march morning about those gimcrack second floors in the dustbin i fear with the cretonnecovered eggboxes and the penny fans fate is so terribly evenhanded as she gives she ever takes away she flung us a few shillings and hope where now she doles us out pounds and fears why did not we know how happy we were sitting crowned with sweet conceit upon our eggbox thrones  yes dick you have climbed well you edit a great newspaper you spread abroad the messagewell the message that sir joseph goldbug your proprietor instructs you to spread abroad you teach mankind the lessons that sir joseph goldbug wishes them to learn they say he is to have a peerage next year i am sure he has earned it and perhaps there may be a knighthood for you dick  tom you are getting on now you have abandoned those unsaleable allegories what rich art patron cares to be told continually by his own walls that midas had asss ears that lazarus sits ever at the gate you paint portraits now and everybody tells me you are the coming man that impression of old lady jezebel was really wonderful the woman looks quite handsome and yet it is her ladyship your touch is truly marvellous  but into your success tomdick old friend do not there creep moments when you would that we could fish up those old eggboxes from the past refurnish with them the dingy rooms in camden town and find there our youth our loves and our beliefs  an incident brought back to my mind the other day the thought of all these things i called for the first time upon a man an actor who had asked me to come and see him in the little home where he lives with his old father to my astonishmentfor the craze i believe has long since died outi found the house half furnished out of packing cases butter tubs and eggboxes my friend earns his twenty pounds a week but it was the old fathers hobby so he explained to me the making of these monstrosities and of them he was as proud as though they were specimen furniture out of the south kensington museum  he took me into the diningroom to show me the latest outragea new bookcase a greater disfigurement to the room which was otherwise prettily furnished could hardly be imagined there was no need for him to assure me as he did that it had been made out of nothing but eggboxes one could see at a glance that it was made out of eggboxes and badly constructed eggboxes at thateggboxes that were a disgrace to the firm that had turned them out eggboxes not worthy the storage of shop uns at eighteen the shilling  we went upstairs to my friends bedroom he opened the door as a man might open the door of a museum of gems  the old boy he said as he stood with his hand upon the doorknob made everything you see here everything and we entered he drew my attention to the wardrobe now i will hold it up he said while you pull the door open i think the floor must be a bit uneven it wobbles if you are not careful it wobbled notwithstanding but by coaxing and humouring we succeeded without mishap i was surprised to notice a very small supply of clothes within although my friend is a dressy man  you see he explained i dare not use it more than i can help i am a clumsy chap and as likely as not if i happened to be in a hurry id have the whole thing over which seemed probable  i asked him how he contrived i dress in the bathroom as a rule he replied i keep most of my things there of course the old boy doesnt know  he showed me a chest of drawers one drawer stood half open  im bound to leave that drawer open he said i keep the things i use in that they dont shut quite easily these drawers or rather they shut all right but then they wont open it is the weather i think they will open and shut all right in the summer i dare say he is of a hopeful disposition  but the pride of the room was the washstand  what do you think of this cried he enthusiastically real marble top  he did not expatiate further in his excitement he had laid his hand upon the thing with the natural result that it collapsed more by accident than design i caught the jug in my arms i also caught the water it contained the basin rolled on its edge and little damage was done except to me and the soapbox  i could not pump up much admiration for this washstand i was feeling too wet  what do you do when you want to wash i asked as together we reset the trap  there fell upon him the manner of a conspirator revealing secrets he glanced guiltily round the room then creeping on tiptoe he opened a cupboard behind the bed within was a tin basin and a small can  dont tell the old boy he said i keep these things here and wash on the floor  that was the best thing i myself ever got out of eggboxesthat picture of a deceitful son stealthily washing himself upon the floor behind the bed trembling at every footstep lest it might be the old boy coming to the door  one wonders whether the ten commandments are so allsufficient as we good folk deem themwhether the eleventh is not worth the whole pack of them that ye love one another with just a commonplace human practical love could not the other ten be comfortably stowed away into a corner of that one is inclined in ones anarchic moments to agree with louis stevenson that to be amiable and cheerful is a good religion for a workaday world we are so busy not killing not stealing not coveting our neighbours wife we have not time to be even just to one another for the little while we are together here need we be so cocksure that our present list of virtues and vices is the only possibly correct and complete one is the kind unselfish man necessarily a villain because he does not always succeed in suppressing his natural instincts is the narrowhearted soursouled man incapable of a generous thought or act necessarily a saint because he has none have we notwe unco guidarrived at a wrong method of estimating our frailer brothers and sisters we judge them as critics judge books not by the good that is in them but by their faults poor king david what would the local vigilance society have had to say to him  noah according to our plan would be denounced from every teetotal platform in the country and ham would head the local vestry poll as a reward for having exposed him and st peter weak frail st peter how lucky for him that his fellowdisciples and their master were not as strict in their notions of virtue as are we today  have we not forgotten the meaning of the word virtue once it stood for the good that was in a man irrespective of the evil that might lie there also as tares among the wheat we have abolished virtue and for it substituted virtues not the herohe was too full of faultsbut the blameless valet not the man who does any good but the man who has not been found out in any evil is our modern ideal the most virtuous thing in nature according to this new theory should be the oyster he is always at home and always sober he is not noisy he gives no trouble to the police i cannot think of a single one of the ten commandments that he ever breaks he never enjoys himself and he never so long as he lives gives a moments pleasure to any other living thing  i can imagine the oyster lecturing a lion on the subject of morality  you never hear me the oyster might say howling round camps and villages making night hideous frightening quiet folk out of their lives why dont you go to bed early as i do i never prowl round the oysterbed fighting other gentlemen oysters making love to lady oysters already married i never kill antelopes or missionaries why cant you live as i do on salt water and germs or whatever it is that i do live on why dont you try to be more like me  an oyster has no evil passions therefore we say he is a virtuous fish we never ask ourselveshas he any good passions a lions behaviour is often such as no just man could condone has he not his good points also  will the fat sleek virtuous man be as welcome at the gate of heaven as he supposes  well st peter may say to him opening the door a little way and looking him up and down what is it now  its me the virtuous man will reply with an oily selfsatisfied smile i should say iive come  yes i see you have come but what is your claim to admittance what have you done with your three score years and ten  done the virtuous man will answer i have done nothing i assure you  nothing  nothing that is my strong point that is why i am here i have never done any wrong  and what good have you done  what good  aye what good do not you even know the meaning of the word what human creature is the better for your having eaten and drunk and slept these years you have done no harmno harm to yourself perhaps if you had you might have done some good with it the two are generally to be found together down below i remember what good have you done that you should enter here this is no mummy chamber this is the place of men and women who have lived who have wrought goodand evil also alasfor the sinners who fight for the right not the righteous who run with their souls from the fight  it was not however to speak of these things that i remembered the amateur and its lessons my intention was but to lead up to the story of a certain small boy who in the doing of tasks not required of him was exceedingly clever i wish to tell you his story because as do most true tales it possesses a moral and stories without a moral i deem to be but foolish literature resembling roads that lead to nowhere such as sick folk tramp for exercise  i have known this little boy to take an expensive eightday clock to pieces and make of it a toy steamboat true it was not when made very much of a steamboat but taking into consideration all the difficultiesthe inadaptability of eightday clock machinery to steamboat requirements the necessity of getting the work accomplished quickly before conservativelyminded people with no enthusiasm for science could interferea good enough steamboat with merely an ironingboard and a few dozen meatskewers he wouldprovided the ironingboard was not missed in timeturn out quite a practicable rabbithutch he could make a gun out of an umbrella and a gasbracket which if not so accurate as a martinihenry was at all events more deadly with half the gardenhose a copper scaldingpan out of the dairy and a few dresden china ornaments off the drawingroom mantelpiece he would build a fountain for the garden he could make bookshelves out of kitchen tables and crossbows out of crinolines he could dam you a stream so that all the water would flow over the croquet lawn he knew how to make red paint and oxygen gas together with many other suchlike commodities handy to have about a house among other things he learned how to make fireworks and after a few explosions of an unimportant character came to make them very well indeed the boy who can play a good game of cricket is liked the boy who can fight well is respected the boy who can cheek a master is loved but the boy who can make fireworks is revered above all others as a boy belonging to a superior order of beings the fifth of november was at hand and with the consent of an indulgent mother he determined to give to the world a proof of his powers a large party of friends relatives and schoolmates was invited and for a fortnight beforehand the scullery was converted into a manufactory for fireworks the female servants went about in hourly terror of their lives and the villa did we judge exclusively by smell one might have imagined had been taken over by satan his main premises being inconveniently crowded as an annex by the evening of the fourth all was in readiness and samples were tested to make sure that no contretemps should occur the following night all was found to be perfect  the rockets rushed heavenward and descended in stars the roman candles tossed their fiery balls into the darkness the catherine wheels sparkled and whirled the crackers cracked and the squibs banged that night he went to bed a proud and happy boy and dreamed of fame he stood surrounded by blazing fireworks and the vast crowd cheered him his relations most of whom he knew regarded him as the coming idiot of the family were there to witness his triumph so too was dickey bowles who laughed at him because he could not throw straight the girl at the bunshop she also was there and saw that he was clever  the night of the festival arrived and with it the guests they sat wrapped up in shawls and cloaks outside the hall dooruncles cousins aunts little boys and big boys little girls and big girls with as the theatre posters say villagers and retainers some forty of them in all and waited  but the fireworks did not go off why they did not go off i cannot explain nobody ever could explain the laws of nature seemed to be suspended for that night only the rockets fell down and died where they stood no human agency seemed able to ignite the squibs the crackers gave one bang and collapsed the roman candles might have been english rushlights the catherine wheels became mere revolving glowworms the fiery serpents could not collect among them the spirit of a tortoise the set piece a ship at sea showed one mast and the captain and then went out one or two items did their duty but this only served to render the foolishness of the whole more striking the little girls giggled the little boys chaffed the aunts and cousins said it was beautiful the uncles inquired if it was all over and talked about supper and trains the villagers and retainers dispersed laughing the indulgent mother said never mind and explained how well everything had gone off yesterday the clever little boy crept upstairs to his room and blubbered his heart out in the dark  hours later when the crowd had forgotten him he stole out again into the garden he sat down amid the ruins of his hope and wondered what could have caused the fiasco still puzzled he drew from his pocket a box of matches and lighting one he held it to the seared end of a rocket he had tried in vain to light four hours ago it smouldered for an instant then shot with a swish into the air and broke into a hundred points of fire he tried another and another with the same result he made a fresh attempt to fire the set piece point by point the whole pictureminus the captain and one mastcame out of the night and stood revealed in all the majesty of flame its sparks fell upon the piledup heap of candles wheels and rockets that a little while before had obstinately refused to burn and that one after another had been thrown aside as useless now with the night frost upon them they leaped to light in one grand volcanic eruption and in front of the gorgeous spectacle he stood with only one consolationhis mothers hand in his  the whole thing was a mystery to him at the time but as he learned to know life better he came to understand that it was only one example of a solid but inexplicable fact ruling all human affairsyour fireworks wont go off while the crowd is around  our brilliant repartees do not occur to us till the door is closed upon us and we are alone in the street or as the french would say are coming down the stairs our afterdinner oratory that sounded so telling as we delivered it before the lookingglass falls strangely flat amidst the clinking of the glasses the passionate torrent of words we meant to pour into her ear becomes a halting rigmarole at whichsmall blame to hershe only laughs  i would gentle reader you could hear the stories that i meant to tell you you judge me of course by the stories of mine that you have readby this sort of thing perhaps but that is not just to me the stories i have not told you that i am going to tell you one day i would that you judge me by those  they are so beautiful you will say so over them you will laugh and cry with me  they come into my brain unbidden they clamour to be written yet when i take my pen in hand they are gone it is as though they were shy of publicity as though they would say to meyou alone you shall read us but you must not write us we are too real too true we are like the thoughts you cannot speak perhaps a little later when you know more of life then you shall tell us  next to these in merit i would place were i writing a critical essay on myself the stories i have begun to write and that remain unfinished why i cannot explain to myself they are good stories most of them better far than the stories i have accomplished another time perhaps if you care to listen i will tell you the beginning of one or two and you shall judge strangely enough for i have always regarded myself as a practical commonsensed man so many of these stillborn children of my mind i find on looking through the cupboard where their thin bodies lie are ghost stories i suppose the hope of ghosts is with us all the world grows somewhat interesting to us heirs of all the ages year by year science with broom and duster tears down the mothworn tapestry forces the doors of the locked chambers lets light into the secret stairways cleans out the dungeons explores the hidden passagesfinding everywhere only dust this echoing old castle the world so full of mystery in the days when we were children is losing somewhat its charm for us as we grow older the king sleeps no longer in the hollow of the hills we have tunnelled through his mountain chamber we have shivered his beard with our pick we have driven the gods from olympus no wanderer through the moonlit groves now fears or hopes the sweet deathgiving gleam of aphrodites face thors hammer echoes not among the peakstis but the thunder of the excursion train we have swept the woods of the fairies we have filtered the sea of its nymphs even the ghosts are leaving us chased by the psychical research society  perhaps of all they are the least however to be regretted they were dull old fellows clanking their rusty chains and groaning and sighing let them go  and yet how interesting they might be if only they would the old gentleman in the coat of mail who lived in king johns reign who was murdered so they say on the outskirts of the very wood i can see from my window as i writestabbed in the back poor gentleman as he was riding home his body flung into the moat that to this day is called tors tomb dry enough it is now and the primroses love its steep banks but a gloomy enough place in those days no doubt with its twenty feet of stagnant water why does he haunt the forest paths at night as they tell me he does frightening the children out of their wits blanching the faces and stilling the laughter of the peasant lads and lasses slouching home from the village dance instead why does he not come up here and talk to me he should have my easychair and welcome would he only be cheerful and companionable  what brave tales could he not tell me he fought in the first crusade heard the clarion voice of peter met the great godfrey face to face stood hand on swordhilt at runnymede perhaps better than a whole library of historical novels would an evenings chat be with such a ghost what has he done with his eight hundred years of death where has he been what has he seen maybe he has visited mars has spoken to the strange spirits who can live in the liquid fires of jupiter what has he learned of the great secret has he found the truth or is he even as i a wanderer still seeking the unknown  you poor pale grey nunthey tell me that of midnights one may see your white face peering from the ruined belfry window hear the clash of sword and shield among the cedartrees beneath  it was very sad i quite understand my dear lady your lovers both were killed and you retired to a convent believe me i am sincerely sorry for you but why waste every night renewing the whole painful experience would it not be better forgotten good heavens madam suppose we living folk were to spend our lives wailing and wringing our hands because of the wrongs done to us when we were children it is all over now had he lived and had you married him you might not have been happy i do not wish to say anything unkind but marriages founded upon the sincerest mutual love have sometimes turned out unfortunately as you must surely know  do take my advice talk the matter over with the young men themselves persuade them to shake hands and be friends come in all of you out of the cold and let us have some reasonable talk  why seek you to trouble us you poor pale ghosts are we not your children be our wise friends tell me how loved the young men in your young days how answered the maidens has the world changed much do you think had you not new women even then girls who hated the everlasting tapestry frame and spinningwheel your fathers servants were they so much worse off than the freemen who live in our eastend slums and sew slippers for fourteen hours a day at a wage of nine shillings a week do you think society much improved during the last thousand years is it worse is it better or is it on the whole about the same save that we call things by other names tell me what have you learned  yet might not familiarity breed contempt even for ghosts  one has had a tiring days shooting one is looking forward to ones bed as one opens the door however a ghostly laugh comes from behind the bedcurtains and one groans inwardly knowing what is in store for one a two or three hours talk with rowdy old sir lanvalhe of the lance we know all his tales by heart and he will shout them suppose our aunt from whom we have expectations and who sleeps in the next room should wake and overhear they were fit and proper enough stories no doubt for the round table but we feel sure our aunt would not appreciate themthat story about sir agravain and the coopers wife and he always will tell that story  or imagine the maid entering after dinner to say  oh if you please sir here is the veiled lady  what again says your wife looking up from her work  yes maam shall i show her up into the bedroom  you had better ask your master is the reply the tone is suggestive of an unpleasant five minutes so soon as the girl shall have withdrawn but what are you to do  yes yes show her up you say and the girl goes out closing the door  your wife gathers her work together and rises  where are you going you ask  to sleep with the children is the frigid answer  it will look so rude you urge we must be civil to the poor thing and you see it really is her room as one might say she has always haunted it  it is very curious returns the wife of your bosom still more icily that she never haunts it except when you are down here where she goes when you are in town im sure i dont know  this is unjust you cannot restrain your indignation  what nonsense you talk elizabeth you reply i am only barely polite to her  some men have such curious notions of politeness returns elizabeth but pray do not let us quarrel i am only anxious not to disturb you two are company you know i dont choose to be the third thats all with which she goes out  and the veiled lady is still waiting for you upstairs you wonder how long she will stop also what will happen after she is gone  i fear there is no room for you ghosts in this our world you remember how they came to hiawathathe ghosts of the departed loved ones he had prayed to them that they would come back to him to comfort him so one day they crept into his wigwam sat in silence round his fireside chilled the air for hiawatha froze the smiles of laughing water  there is no room for you oh you poor pale ghosts in this our world do not trouble us let us forget you stout elderly matron your thin locks turning grey your eyes grown weak your chin more ample your voice harsh with much scolding and complaining needful alas to household management i pray you leave me i loved you while you lived how sweet how beautiful you were i see you now in your white frock among the appleblossom but you are dead and your ghost disturbs my dreams i would it haunted me not  you dull old fellow looking out at me from the glass at which i shave why do you haunt me you are the ghost of a bright lad i once knew well he might have done much had he lived i always had faith in him why do you haunt me i would rather think of him as i remember him i never imagined he would make such a poor ghost     on the preparation and employment of love philtres  occasionally a friend will ask me some such question as this do you prefer dark women or fair another will say do you like tall women or short a third do you think lighthearted women or serious the more agreeable company i find myself in the position that once upon a time overtook a certain charming young lady of taste who was asked by an anxious parent the years mounting and the family expenditure not decreasing which of the numerous and eligible young men then paying court to her she liked the best she replied that was her difficulty she could not make up her mind which she liked the best they were all so nice she could not possibly select one to the exclusion of all the others what she would have liked would have been to marry the lot but that she presumed was impracticable  i feel i resemble that young lady not so much perhaps in charm and beauty as indecision of mind when questions such as the above are put to me it is as if one were asked ones favourite food there are times when one fancies an egg with ones tea on other occasions one dreams of a kipper today one clamours for lobsters tomorrow one feels one never wishes to see a lobster again one determines to settle down for a time to a diet of bread and milk and ricepudding asked suddenly to say whether i preferred ices to soup or beefsteaks to caviare i should be nonplussed  i like tall women and short dark women and fair merry women and grave  do not blame me ladies the fault lies with you every rightthinking man is an universal lover how could it be otherwise you are so diverse yet each so charming of your kind and a mans heart is large you have no idea fair reader how large a mans heart is that is his troublesometimes yours  may i not admire the daring tulip because i love also the modest lily may i not press a kiss upon the sweet violet because the scent of the queenly rose is precious to me  certainly not i hear the rose reply if you can see anything in her you shall have nothing to do with me  if you care for that bold creature says the lily trembling you are not the man i took you for goodbye  go to your babyfaced violet cries the tulip with a toss of her haughty head you are just fitted for each other  and when i return to the lily she tells me that she cannot trust me she has watched me with those others she knows me for a gadabout her gentle face is full of pain  so i must live unloved merely because i love too much  my wonder is that young men ever marry the difficulty of selection must be appalling i walked the other evening in hyde park the band of the life guards played heartlifting music and the vast crowd were basking in a sweet enjoyment such as rarely woos the english toiler i strolled among them and my attention was chiefly drawn towards the women the great majority of them were i suppose shopgirls milliners and others belonging to the lower middleclass they had put on their best frocks their bonniest hats their newest gloves they sat or walked in twos and threes chattering and preening as happy as young sparrows on a clothes line and what a handsome crowd they made i have seen german crowds i have seen french crowds i have seen italian crowds but nowhere do you find such a proportion of pretty women as among the english middleclass three women out of every four were worth looking at every other woman was pretty while every fourth one might say without exaggeration was beautiful as i passed to and fro the idea occurred to me suppose i were an unprejudiced young bachelor free from predilection looking for a wife and let me supposeit is only a fancythat all these girls were ready and willing to accept me i have only to choose i grew bewildered there were fair girls to look at whom was fatal dark girls that set ones heart aflame girls with red gold hair and grave grey eyes whom one would follow to the confines of the universe babyfaced girls that one longed to love and cherish girls with noble faces whom a man might worship laughing girls with whom one could dance through life gaily serious girls with whom life would be sweet and good domesticlooking girlsone felt such would make delightful wives they would cook and sew and make of home a pleasant peaceful place then wickedlooking girls came by at the stab of whose bold eyes all orthodox thoughts were put to a flight whose laughter turned the world into a mad carnival girls one could mould girls from whom one could learn sad girls one wanted to comfort merry girls who would cheer one little girls big girls queenly girls fairylike girls  suppose a young man had to select his wife in this fashion from some twenty or thirty thousand or that a girl were suddenly confronted with eighteen thousand eligible young bachelors and told to take the one she wanted and be quick about it neither boy nor girl would ever marry fate is kinder to us she understands and assists us in the hall of a paris hotel i once overheard one lady asking another to recommend her a milliners shop  go to the maison nouvelle advised the questioned lady with enthusiasm they have the largest selection there of any place in paris  i know they have replied the first lady that is just why i dont mean to go there it confuses me if i see six bonnets i can tell the one i want in five minutes if i see six hundred i come away without any bonnet at all dont you know a little shop  fate takes the young man or the young woman aside  come into this village my dear says fate into this bystreet of this salubrious suburb into this social circle into this church into this chapel now my dear boy out of these seventeen young ladies which will you haveout of these thirteen young men which would you like for your very own my dear  no miss i am sorry but i am not able to show you our upstairs department today the lift is not working but i am sure we shall be able to find something in this room to suit you just look round my dear perhaps you will see something  no sir i cannot show you the stock in the next room we never take that out except for our very special customers we keep our most expensive goods in that room draw that curtain miss circumstance please i have told you of that before now sir wouldnt you like this one this colour is quite the rage this season we are getting rid of quite a lot of these  no sir well of course it would not do for every ones taste to be the same perhaps something dark would suit you better bring out those two brunettes miss circumstance charming girls both of them dont you think so sir i should say the taller one for you sir just one moment sir allow me now what do you think of that sir might have been made to fit you im sure you prefer the shorter one certainly sir no difference to us at all both are the same price theres nothing like having ones own fancy i always say no sir i cannot put her aside for you we never do that indeed theres rather a run on brunettes just at present i had a gentleman in only this morning looking at this particular one and he is going to call again tonight indeed i am not at all sureoh of course sir if you like to settle on this one now that ends the matter put those others away miss circumstance please and mark this one sold i feel sure youll like her sir when you get her home thank you sir goodmorning  now miss have you seen anything you fancy yes miss this is all we have at anything near your price shut those other cupboards miss circumstance never show more stock than you are obliged to it only confuses customers how often am i to tell you that yes miss you are quite right there is a slight blemish they all have some slight flaw the makers say they cant help itits in the material its not once in a season we get a perfect specimen and when we do ladies dont seem to care for it most of our customers prefer a little faultiness they say it gives character now look at this miss this sort of thing wears very well warm and quiet youd like one with more colour in it certainly miss circumstance reach me down the art patterns no miss we dont guarantee any of them over the year so much depends on how you use them oh yes miss theyll stand a fair amount of wear people do tell you the quieter patterns last longer but my experience is that one is much the same as another theres really no telling any of them until you come to try them we never recommend one more than another theres a lot of chance about these goods its in the nature of them what i always say to ladies isplease yourself its you who have got to wear it and its no good having an article you start by not liking yes miss it is pretty and it looks well against you it does indeed thank you miss put that one aside miss circumstance please see that it doesnt get mixed up with the unsold stock  it is a useful philtre the juice of that small western flower that oberon drops upon our eyelids as we sleep it solves all difficulties in a trice why of course helena is the fairer compare her with hermia compare the raven with the dove how could we ever have doubted for a moment bottom is an angel bottom is as wise as he is handsome oh oberon we thank you for that drug matilda jane is a goddess matilda jane is a queen no woman ever born

thinking of you have given the bottle to puck take it away from him quick lord help us all if that imp has the bottle lord save us from puck while we sleep  or may we fairy oberon regard your lotion as an eyeopener rather than as an eyecloser you remember the story the storks told the children of the little girl who was a toad by day only her sweet dark eyes being left to her but at night when the prince clasped her close to his breast lo again she became the kings daughter fairest and fondest of women there be many royal ladies in marshland with bad complexion and thin straight hair and the silly princes sneer and ride away to woo some kitchen wench decked out in queens apparel lucky the prince upon whose eyelids oberon has dropped the magic philtre  in the gallery of a minor continental town i have forgotten hangs a picture that lives with me the painting i cannot recall whether good or bad artists must forgive me for remembering only the subject it shows a man crucified by the roadside no martyr he if ever a man deserved hanging it was this one so much the artist has made clear the face even under its mask of agony is an evil treacherous face a peasant girl clings to the cross she stands tiptoe upon a patient donkey straining her face upward for the halfdead man to stoop and kiss her lips  thief coward blackguard they are stamped upon his face but under the face under the evil outside is there no remnant of manhoodnothing tender nothing true a woman has crept to the cross to kiss him no evidence in his favour my lord love is blindaye to our faults heaven help us all loves eyes would be sore indeed if it were not so but for the good that is in us her eyes are keen you crucified blackguard stand forth a hundred witnesses have given their evidence against you are there none to give evidence for him a woman great judge who loved him let her speak  but i am wandering far from hyde park and its show of girls  they passed and repassed me laughing smiling talking their eyes were bright with merry thoughts their voices soft and musical they were pleased and they wanted to please some were married some had evidently reasonable expectations of being married the rest hoped to be and we myself and some ten thousand other young men i repeat itmyself and some ten thousand other young men for who among us ever thinks of himself but as a young man it is the world that ages not we the children cease their playing and grow grave the lasses eyes are dimmer the hills are a little steeper the milestones surely further apart the songs the young men sing are less merry than the songs we used to sing the days have grown a little colder the wind a little keener the wine has lost its flavour somewhat the new humour is not like the old the other boys are becoming dull and prosy but we are not changed it is the world that is growing old therefore i brave your thoughtless laughter youthful reader and repeat that we myself and some ten thousand other young men walked among these sweet girls and using our boyish eyes were fascinated charmed and captivated how delightful to spend our lives with them to do little services for them that would call up these bright smiles how pleasant to jest with them and hear their flutelike laughter to console them and read their grateful eyes really life is a pleasant thing and the idea of marriage undoubtedly originated in the brain of a kindly providence  we smiled back at them and we made way for them we rose from our chairs with a polite allow me miss dont mention it i prefer standing it is a delightful evening is it not and perhapsfor what harm was therewe dropped into conversation with these chance fellowpassengers upon the stream of life there were those among usbold daring spiritswho even went to the length of mild flirtation some of us knew some of them and in such happy case there followed interchange of pretty pleasantries your english middleclass young man and woman are not adepts at the game of flirtation i will confess that our methods were perhaps elephantine that we may have grown a trifle noisy as the evening wore on but we meant no evil we did but our best to enjoy ourselves to give enjoyment to make the too brief time pass gaily  and then my thoughts travelled to small homes in distant suburbs and these bright lads and lasses round me came to look older and more careworn but what of that are not old faces sweet when looked at by old eyes a little dimmed by love and are not care and toil but the parents of peace and joy  but as i drew nearer i saw that many of the faces were seared with sour and angry looks and the voices that rose round me sounded surly and captious the pretty compliment and praise had changed to sneers and scoldings the dimpled smile had wrinkled to a frown there seemed so little desire to please so great a determination not to be pleased  and the flirtations ah me they had forgotten how to flirt oh the pity of it all the jests were bitter all the little services were given grudgingly the air seemed to have grown chilly a darkness had come over all things  and then i awoke to reality and found i had been sitting in my chair longer than i had intended the bandstand was empty the sun had set i rose and made my way home through the scattered crowd  nature is so callous the dame irritates one at times by her devotion to her one idea the propagation of the species  multiply and be fruitful let my world be ever more and more peopled  for this she trains and fashions her young girls models them with cunning hand paints them with her wonderful red and white crowns them with her glorious hair teaches them to smile and laugh trains their voices into music sends them out into the world to captivate to enslave us  see how beautiful she is my lad says the cunning old woman take her build your little nest with her in your pretty suburb work for her and live for her enable her to keep the little ones that i will send  and to her old hundredbreasted artemis whispers is he not a bonny lad see how he loves you how devoted he is to you he will work for you and make you happy he will build your home for you you will be the mother of his children  so we take each other by the hand full of hope and love and from that hour mother nature has done with us let the wrinkles come let our voices grow harsh let the fire she lighted in our hearts die out let the foolish selfishness we both thought we had put behind us for ever creep back to us bringing unkindness and indifference angry thoughts and cruel words into our lives what cares she she has caught us and chained us to her work she is our universal motherinlaw she has done the matchmaking for the rest she leaves it to ourselves we can love or we can fight it is all one to her confound her  i wonder sometimes if good temper might not be taught in business we use no harsh language say no unkind things to one another the shopkeeper leaning across the counter is all smiles and affability he might put up his shutters were he otherwise the commercial gent no doubt thinks the ponderous shopwalker an ass but refrains from telling him so hasty tempers are banished from the city can we not see that it is just as much to our interest to banish them from tooting and hampstead  the young man who sat in the chair next to me how carefully he wrapped the cloak round the shoulders of the little milliner beside him and when she said she was tired of sitting still how readily he sprang from his chair to walk with her though it was evident he was very comfortable where he was and she she had laughed at his jokes they were not very clever jokes they were not very new she had probably read them herself months before in her own particular weekly journal yet the harmless humbug made him happy i wonder if ten years hence she will laugh at such old humour if ten years hence he will take such clumsy pains to put her cape about her experience shakes her head and is amused at my question  i would have evening classes for the teaching of temper to married couples only i fear the institution would languish for lack of pupils the husbands would recommend their wives to attend generously offering to pay the fee as a birthday present the wife would be indignant at the suggestion of good money being thus wasted no john dear she would unselfishly reply you need the lessons more than i do it would be a shame for me to take them away from you and they would wrangle upon the subject for the rest of the day  oh the folly of it we pack our hamper for lifes picnic with such pains we spend so much we work so hard we make choice pies we cook prime joints we prepare so carefully the mayonnaise we mix with loving hands the salad we cram the basket to the lid with every delicacy we can think of everything to make the picnic a success is there except the salt ah woe is me we forget the salt we slave at our desks in our workshops to make a home for those we love we give up our pleasures we give up our rest we toil in our kitchen from morning till night and we render the whole feast tasteless for want of a haporth of saltfor want of a soupcon of amiability for want of a handful of kindly words a touch of caress a pinch of courtesy  who does not know that estimable housewife working from eight till twelve to keep the house in what she calls order she is so good a woman so untiring so unselfish so conscientious so irritating her rooms are so clean her servants so well managed her children so well dressed her dinners so well cooked the whole house so uninviting everything about her is in applepie order and everybody wretched  my good madam you polish your tables you scour your kettles but the most valuable piece of furniture in the whole house you are letting to rack and ruin for want of a little pains you will find it in your own room my dear lady in front of your own mirror it is getting shabby and dingy oldlooking before its time the polish is rubbed off it madam it is losing its brightness and charm do you remember when he first brought it home how proud he was of it do you think you have used it well knowing how he valued it a little less care of your pots and your pans madam a little more of yourself were wiser polish yourself up madam you had a pretty wit once a pleasant laugh a conversation that was not confined exclusively to the shortcomings of servants the wrongdoings of tradesmen my dear madam we do not live on spotless linen and crumbless carpets hunt out that bundle of old letters you keep tied up in faded ribbon at the back of your bureau drawera pity you dont read them oftener he did not enthuse about your cuffs and collars gush over the neatness of your darning it was your tangled hair he raved about your sunny smile we have not seen it for some years madamthe fault of the cook and the butcher i presume your little hands your rosebud mouthit has lost its shape madam of late try a little less scolding of mary ann and practise a laugh once a day you might get back the dainty curves it would be worth trying it was a pretty mouth once  who invented that mischievous falsehood that the way to a mans heart was through his stomach how many a silly woman taking it for truth has let love slip out of the parlour while she was busy in the kitchen of course if you were foolish enough to marry a pig i suppose you must be content to devote your life to the preparation of hogswash but are you sure that he is a pig if by any chance he be notthen madam you are making a grievous mistake my dear lady you are too modest if i may say so without making you unduly conceited even at the dinnertable itself you are of much more importance than the mutton courage madam be not afraid to tilt a lance even with your own cook you can be more piquant than the sauce a la tartare more soothing surely than the melted butter there was a time when he would not have known whether he was eating beef or pork with you the other side of the table whose fault is it dont think so poorly of us we are not ascetics neither are we all gourmets most of us plain men fond of our dinner as a healthy man should be but fonder still of our sweethearts and wives let us hope try us a moderatelycooked dinnerlet us even say a nottoowellcooked dinner with you looking your best laughing and talking gaily and cleverlyas you can you knowmakes a pleasanter meal for us after the days work is done than that same dinner cooked to perfection with you silent jaded and anxious your pretty hair untidy your pretty face wrinkled with care concerning the sole with anxiety regarding the omelette  my poor martha be not troubled about so many things you are the one thing needfulif the bricks and mortar are to be a home see to it that you are well served up that you are done to perfection that you are tender and satisfying that you are worth sitting down to we wanted a wife a comrade a friend not a cook and a nurse on the cheap  but of what use is it to talk the world will ever follow its own folly when i think of all the good advice that i have given it and of the small result achieved i confess i grow discouraged i was giving good advice to a lady only the other day i was instructing her as to the proper treatment of aunts she was sucking a leadpencil a thing i am always telling her not to do she took it out of her mouth to speak  i suppose you know how everybody ought to do everything she said  there are times when it is necessary to sacrifice ones modesty to ones duty  of course i do i replied  and does mama know how everybody ought to do everything was the second question  my conviction on this point was by no means so strong but for domestic reasons i again sacrificed myself to expediency  certainly i answered and take that pencil out of your mouth ive told you of that before youll swallow it one day and then youll get perichondritis and die  she appeared to be solving a problem  all grownup people seem to know everything she summarized  there are times when i doubt if children are as simple as they look if it be sheer stupidity that prompts them to make remarks of this character one should pity them and seek to improve them but if it be not stupidity well then one should still seek to improve them but by a different method  the other morning i overheard the nurse talking to this particular specimen the woman is a most worthy creature and she was imparting to the child some really sound advice she was in the middle of an unexceptional exhortation concerning the virtue of silence when dorothea interrupted her with  oh do be quiet nurse i never get a moments peace from your chatter  such an interruption discourages a woman who is trying to do her duty  last tuesday evening she was unhappy myself i think that rhubarb should never be eaten before april and then never with lemonade her mother read her a homily upon the subject of pain it was impressed upon her that we must be patient that we must put up with the trouble that god sends us dorothea would descend to details as children will  must we put up with the codliver oil that god sends us  yes decidedly  and with the nurses that god sends us  certainly and be thankful that youve got them some little girls havent any nurse and dont talk so much  on friday i found the mother in tears  whats the matter i asked  oh nothing was the answer only baby shes such a strange child i cant make her out at all  what has she been up to now  oh she will argue you know  she has that failing i dont know where she gets it from but shes got it  well  well she made me cross and to punish her i told her she shouldnt take her dolls perambulator out with her  yes  well she didnt say anything then but so soon as i was outside the door i heard her talking to herselfyou know her way  yes  she said  yes she said  she said i must be patient i must put up with the mother god has sent me  she lunches downstairs on sundays we have her with us once a week to give her the opportunity of studying manners and behaviour milson had dropped in and we were discussing politics i was interested and pushing my plate aside leant forward with my elbows on the table dorothea has a habit of talking to herself in a highpitched whisper capable of being heard above an adelphi love scene i heard her say  i must sit up straight i mustnt sprawl with my elbows on the table it is only common vulgar people behave that way  i looked across at her she was sitting most correctly and appeared to be contemplating something a thousand miles away we had all of us been lounging we sat up stiffly and conversation flagged  of course we made a joke of it after the child was gone but somehow it didnt seem to be our joke  i wish i could recollect my childhood i should so like to know if children are as simple as they can look     on the delights and benefits of slavery  my study window looks down upon hyde park and often to quote the familiar promise of each new magazine it amuses and instructs me to watch from my tower the epitome of human life that passes to and fro beneath at the opening of the gates creeps in the woman of the streets her pitiful work for the time being is over shivering in the chill dawn she passes to her brief rest poor slave lured to the galleys lowest deck then chained there civilization tricked fool they say has need of such you serve as the dogs of eastern towns but at least it seems to me we need not spit on you home to your kennel perchance if the gods be kind they may send you dreams of a cleanly hearth where you lie with a silver collar round your neck  next comes the labourerthe hewer of wood the drawer of waterslouching wearily to his toil sleep clinging still about his leaden eyes his pittance of food carried tied up in a dishclout the first stroke of the hour clangs from big ben haste thee fellowslave lest the overseers whip out we will have no lieabeds here descend upon thy patient back  later the artisan with his bag of tools across his shoulder he too listens fearfully to the chiming of the bells for him also there hangs ready the whip  after him the shop boy and the shop girl making love as they walk not to waste time and after these the slaves of the desk and of the warehouse employers and employed clerks and tradesmen office boys and merchants to your places slaves of all ranks get you unto your burdens  now laughing and shouting as they run the children the sons and daughters of the slaves be industrious little children and learn your lessons that when the time comes you may be ready to take from our hands the creaking oar to slip into our seat at the roaring loom for we shall not be slaves for ever little children it is the good law of the land so many years in the galleys so many years in the fields then we can claim our freedom then we shall go little children back to the land of our birth and you we must leave behind us to take up the tale of our work so off to your schools little children and learn to be good little slaves  next pompous and sleek come the educated slavesjournalists doctors judges and poets the attorney the artist the player the priest they likewise scurry across the park looking anxiously from time to time at their watches lest they be late for their appointments thinking of the rates and taxes to be earned of the bonnets to be paid for the bills to be met the best scourged perhaps of all these slaves the cat reserved for them has fifty tails in place of merely two or three work you higher middleclass slave or you shall come down to the smoking of twopenny cigars harder yet or you shall drink shilling claret harder or you shall lose your carriage and ride in a penny bus your wifes frocks shall be of last years fashion your trousers shall bag at the knees from kensington you shall be banished to kilburn if the tale of your bricks run short oh a manythonged whip is yours my genteel brother  the slaves of fashion are the next to pass beneath me in review they are dressed and curled with infinite pains the liveried pampered footman these kept more for show than use but their senseless tasks none the less labour to them here must they come every day merry or sad by this gravel path and no other must they walk these phrases shall they use when they speak to one another for an hour they must go slowly up and down upon a bicycle from hyde park corner to the magazine and back and these clothes must they wear their gloves of this colour their neckties of this pattern in the afternoon they must return again this time in a carriage dressed in another livery and for an hour they must pass slowly to and fro in foolish procession for dinner they must don yet another livery and after dinner they must stand about at dreary social functions till with weariness and boredom their heads feel dropping from their shoulders  with the evening come the slaves back from their work barristers thinking out their eloquent appeals schoolboys conning their dogeared grammars city men planning their schemes the wearers of motley cudgelling their poor brains for fresh wit with which to please their master shop boys and shop girls silent now as together they plod homeward the artisan the labourer two or three hours you shall have to yourselves slaves to think and love and play if you be not too tired to think or love or play then to your litter that you may be ready for the morrows task  the twilight deepens into dark there comes back the woman of the streets as the shadows she rounds the citys day work strikes its tent evil creeps from its peering place  so we labour driven by the whip of necessity an army of slaves if we do not our work the whip descends upon us only the pain we feel in our stomach instead of on our back and because of that we call ourselves free men  some few among us bravely struggle to be really free they are our tramps and outcasts we wellbehaved slaves shrink from them for the wages of freedom in this world are vermin and starvation we can live lives worth living only by placing the collar round our neck  there are times when one asks oneself why this endless labour why this building of houses this cooking of food this making of clothes is the ant so much more to be envied than the grasshopper because she spends her life in grubbing and storing and can spare no time for singing why this complex instinct driving us to a thousand labours to satisfy a thousand desires we have turned the world into a workshop to provide ourselves with toys to purchase luxury we have sold our ease  oh children of israel why were ye not content in your wilderness it seems to have been a pattern wilderness for you a simple wholesome food ready cooked was provided you took no thought for rent and taxes you had no poor among youno poorrate collectors you suffered not from indigestion nor the hundred ills that follow overfeeding an omer for every man was your portion neither more nor less you knew not you had a liver doctors wearied you not with their theories their physics and their bills you were neither landowners nor leaseholders neither shareholders nor debenture holders the weather and the market reports troubled you not the lawyer was unknown to you you wanted no advice you had nought to quarrel about with your neighbour no riches were yours for the moth and rust to damage your yearly income and expenditure you knew would balance to a fraction your wife and children were provided for your old age caused you no anxiety you knew you would always have enough to live upon in comfort your funeral a simple and tasteful affair would be furnished by the tribe and yet poor foolish child fresh from the egyptian brickfield you could not rest satisfied you hungered for the fleshpots knowing well what fleshpots entail the cleaning of the fleshpots the forging of the fleshpots the hewing of wood to make the fires for the boiling of the fleshpots the breeding of beasts to fill the pots the growing of fodder to feed the beasts to fill the pots  all the labour of our life is centred round our fleshpots on the altar of the fleshpot we sacrifice our leisure our peace of mind for a mess of pottage we sell our birthright  oh children of israel saw you not the long punishment you were preparing for yourselves when in your wilderness you set up the image of the calf and fell before it cryingthis shall be our god  you would have veal thought you never of the price man pays for veal the servants of the golden calf i see them stretched before my eyes a weary endless throng i see them toiling in the mines the black sweat on their faces i see them in sunless cities silent and grimy and bent i see them aguetwisted in the rainsoaked fields i see them panting by the furnace doors i see them in loincloth and necklace the load upon their head i see them in blue coats and red coats marching to pour their blood as an offering on the altar of the calf i see them in homespun and broadcloth i see them in smock and gaiters i see them in cap and apron the servants of the calf they swarm on the land and they dot the sea they are chained to the anvil and counter they are chained to the bench and the desk they make ready the soil they till the fields where the golden calf is born they build the ship and they sail the ship that carries the golden calf they fashion the pots they mould the pans they carve the tables they turn the chairs they dream of the sauces they dig for the salt they weave the damask they mould the dish to serve the golden calf  the work of the world is to this end that we eat of the calf war and commerce science and law what are they but the four pillars supporting the golden calf he is our god it is on his back that we have journeyed from the primeval forest where our ancestors ate nuts and fruit he is our god his temple is in every street his bluerobed priest stands ever at the door calling to the people to worship hark his voice rises on the gastainted airnows your time nows your time buy buy ye people bring hither the sweat of your brow the sweat of your brain the ache of your heart buy veal with it bring me the best years of your life bring me your thoughts your hopes your loves ye shall have veal for them nows your time nows your time buy buy  oh children of israel was veal even with all its trimmings quite worth the price  and we what wisdom have we learned during the centuries i talked with a rich man only the other evening he calls himself a financier whatever that may mean he leaves his beautiful house some twenty miles out of london at a quarter to eight summer and winter after a hurried breakfast by himself while his guests still sleep and he gets back just in time to dress for an elaborate dinner he himself is too weary or too preoccupied to more than touch if ever he is persuaded to give himself a holiday it is for a fortnight in ostend when it is most crowded and uncomfortable he takes his secretary with him receives and despatches a hundred telegrams a day and has a private telephone through which he can speak direct to london brought up into his bedroom  i suppose the telephone is really a useful invention business men tell me they wonder how they contrived to conduct their affairs without it my own wonder always is how any human being with the ordinary passions of his race can conduct his business or even himself creditably within a hundred yards of the invention i can imagine job or griselda or socrates liking to have a telephone about them as exercise socrates in particular would have made quite a reputation for himself out of a three months subscription to a telephone myself i am perhaps too sensitive i once lived for a month in an office with a telephone if one could call it life i was told that if i had stuck to the thing for two or three months longer i should have got used to it i know friends of mine men once fearless and highspirited who now stand in front of their own telephone for a quarter of an hour at a time and never so much as answer it back they tell me that at first they used to swear and shout at it as i did but now their spirit seems crushed that is what happens you either break the telephone or the telephone breaks you you want to see a man two streets off you might put on your hat and be round at his office in five minutes you are on the point of starting when the telephone catches your eye you think you will ring him up to make sure he is in you commence by ringing up some halfdozen times before anybody takes any notice of you whatever you are burning with indignation at this neglect and have left the instrument to sit down and pen a stinging letter of complaint to the company when the ringback recalls you you seize the ear trumpets and shout  how is it that i can never get an answer when i ring here have i been ringing for the last halfhour i have rung twenty times this is a falsehood you have rung only six times and the halfhour is an absurd exaggeration but you feel the mere truth would not be adequate to the occasion i think it disgraceful you continue and i shall complain to the company what is the use of my having a telephone if i cant get any answer when i ring here i pay a large sum for having this thing and i cant get any notice taken ive been ringing all the morning why is it  then you wait for the answer  whatwhat do you say i cant hear what you say  i say ive been ringing here for over an hour and i cant get any reply you call back i shall complain to the company  you want what dont stand so near the tube i cant hear what you say what number  bother the number i say why is it i dont get an answer when i ring  eight hundred and what  you cant argue any more after that the machine would give way under the language you want to make use of half of what you feel would probably cause an explosion at some point where the wire was weak indeed mere language of any kind would fall short of the requirements of the case a hatchet and a gun are the only intermediaries through which you could convey your meaning by this time so you give up all attempt to answer back and meekly mention that you want to be put in communication with fourfivesevensix  fourninesevensix says the girl  no fourfivesevensix  did you say sevensix or sixseven  sixsevenno i mean sevensix nowait a minute i dont know what i do mean now  well i wish youd find out says the young lady severely you are keeping me here all the morning  so you look up the number in the book again and at last she tells you that you are in connection and then ramming the trumpet tight against your ear you stand waiting  and if there is one thing more than another likely to make a man feel ridiculous it is standing on tiptoe in a corner holding a machine to his head and listening intently to nothing your back aches and your head aches your very hair aches you hear the door open behind you and somebody enter the room you cant turn your head you swear at them and hear the door close with a bang it immediately occurs to you that in all probability it was henrietta she promised to call for you at halfpast twelve you were to take her to lunch it was twelve oclock when you were fool enough to mix yourself up with this infernal machine and it probably is halfpast twelve by now your past life rises before you accompanied by dim memories of your grandmother you are wondering how much longer you can bear the strain of this attitude and whether after all you do really want to see the man in the next street but two when the girl in the exchangeroom calls up to know if youre done  done you retort bitterly why i havent begun yet  well be quick she says because youre wasting time  thus admonished you attack the thing again are you there you cry in tones that ought to move the heart of a charity commissioner and then oh joy oh rapture you hear a faint human voice replyingyes what is it  oh are you fourfivesevensix  what  are you fourfivesevensix williamson  what who are you  eightonenine jones  bones  no jones are you fourfivesevensix  yes what is it  is mr williamson in  will i whatwho are you  jones is mr williamson in  who  williamson williamson  youre the son of what i cant hear what you say  then you gather yourself for one final effort and succeed by superhuman patience in getting the fool to understand that you wish to know if mr williamson is in and he says so it sounds to you be in all the morning  so you snatch up your hat and run round  oh ive come to see mr williamson you say  very sorry sir is the polite reply but hes out  out why you just now told me through the telephone that hed be in all the morning  no i said he wont be in all the morning  you go back to the office and sit down in front of that telephone and look at it there it hangs calm and imperturbable were it an ordinary instrument that would be its last hour you would go straight downstairs get the coalhammer and the kitchenpoker and divide it into sufficient pieces to give a bit to every man in london but you feel nervous of these electrical affairs and there is a something about that telephone with its black hole and curly wires that cows you you have a notion that if you dont handle it properly something may come and shock you and then there will be an inquest and bother of that sort so you only curse it  that is what happens when you want to use the telephone from your end but that is not the worst that the telephone can do a sensible man after a little experience can learn to leave the thing alone your worst troubles are not of your own making you are working against time you have given instructions not to be disturbed perhaps it is after lunch and you are thinking with your eyes closed so that your thoughts shall not be distracted by the objects about the room in either case you are anxious not to leave your chair when off goes that telephone bell and you spring from your chair uncertain for the moment whether you have been shot or blown up with dynamite it occurs to you in your weakness that if you persist in taking no notice they will get tired and leave you alone but that is not their method the bell rings violently at tensecond intervals you have nothing to wrap your head up in you think it will be better to get this business over and done with you go to your fate and call back savagely  what is it what do you want  no answer only a confused murmur prominent out of which come the voices of two men swearing at one another the language they are making use of is disgraceful the telephone seems peculiarly adapted for the conveyance of blasphemy ordinary language sounds indistinct through it but every word those two men are saying can be heard by all the telephone subscribers in london  it is useless attempting to listen till they have done when they are exhausted you apply to the tube again no answer is obtainable you get mad and become sarcastic only being sarcastic when you are not sure that anybody is at the other end to hear you is unsatisfying  at last after a quarter of an hour or so of saying are you there yes im here well the young lady at the exchange asks what you want  i dont want anything you reply  then why do you keep talking she retorts you mustnt play with the thing  this renders you speechless with indignation for a while upon recovering from which you explain that somebody rang you up  who rang you up she asks  i dont know  i wish you did she observes  generally disgusted you slam the trumpet up and return to your chair the instant you are seated the bell clangs again and you fly up and demand to know what the thunder they want and who the thunder they are  dont speak so loud we cant hear you what do you want is the answer  i dont want anything what do you want why do you ring me up and then not answer me do leave me alone if you can  we cant get hong kongs at seventyfour  well i dont care if you cant  would you like zulus  what are you talking about you reply i dont know what you mean  would you like zuluszulus at seventythree and a half  i wouldnt have em at six a penny what are you talking about  hong kongswe cant get them at seventyfour oh halfaminute the halfaminute passes are you there  yes but you are talking to the wrong man  we can get you hong kongs at seventyfour and seveneights  bother hong kongs and you too i tell you you are talking to the wrong man ive told you once  once what  why that i am the wrong mani mean that you are talking to the wrong man  who are you  eightonenine jones  oh arent you onenineeight  no  oh goodbye  goodbye  how can a man after that sit down and write pleasantly of the european crisis and if it were needed herein lies another indictment against the telephone i was engaged in an argument which if not in itself serious was at least concerned with a serious enough subject the unsatisfactory nature of human riches and from that highly moral discussion have i been lured by the accidental sight of the word telephone into the writing of matter which can have the effect only of exciting to frenzy all critics of the new humour into whose hands for their sins this book may come let me forget my transgression and return to my sermon or rather to the sermon of my millionaire acquaintance  it was one day after dinner we sat together in his magnificently furnished diningroom we had lighted our cigars at the silver lamp the butler had withdrawn  these cigars we are smoking my friend suddenly remarked a propos apparently of nothing they cost me five shillings apiece taking them by the thousand  i can quite believe it i answered they are worth it  yes to you he replied almost savagely what do you usually pay for your cigars  we had known each other years ago when i first met him his offices consisted of a back room up three flights of stairs in a dingy bystreet off the strand which has since disappeared we occasionally dined together in those days at a restaurant in great portland street for one and nine our acquaintanceship was of sufficient standing to allow of such a question  threepence i answered they work out at about twopence threefarthings by the box  just so he growled and your twopennythreefarthing weed gives you precisely the same amount of satisfaction that this five shilling cigar affords me that means four and ninepence farthing wasted every time i smoke i pay my cook two hundred a year i dont enjoy my dinner as much as when it cost me four shillings including a quarter flask of chianti what is the difference personally to me whether i drive to my office in a carriage and pair or in an omnibus i often do ride in a bus it saves trouble it is absurd wasting time looking for ones coachman when the conductor of an omnibus that passes ones door is hailing one a few yards off before i could afford even buseswhen i used to walk every morning to the office from hammersmithi was healthier it irritates me to think how hard i work for no earthly benefit to myself my money pleases a lot of people i dont care two straws about and who are only my friends in the hope of making something out of me if i could eat a hundredguinea dinner myself every night and enjoy it four hundred times as much as i used to enjoy a fiveshilling dinner there would be some sense in it why do i do it  i had never heard him talk like this before in his excitement he rose from the table and commenced pacing the room  why dont i invest my money in the two and a half per cents he continued at the very worst i should be safe for five thousand a year what in the name of common sense does a man want with more i am always saying to myself ill do it why dont i  well why not i echoed  thats what i want you to tell me he returned you set up for understanding human nature its a mystery to me in my place you would do as i do you know that if somebody left you a hundred thousand pounds tomorrow you would start a newspaper or build a theatresome damnfool trick for getting rid of the money and giving yourself seventeen hours anxiety a day you know you would  i hung my head in shame i felt the justice of the accusation it has always been my dream to run a newspaper and own a theatre  if we worked only for what we could spend he went on the city might put up its shutters tomorrow morning what i want to get at the bottom of is this instinct that drives us to work apparently for works own sake what is this strange thing that gets upon our back and spurs us  a servant entered at that moment with a cablegram from the manager of one of his austrian mines and he had to leave me for his study but walking home i fell to pondering on his words why this endless work why each morning do we get up and wash and dress ourselves to undress ourselves at night and go to bed again why do we work merely to earn money to buy food and eat food so as to gain strength that we may work why do we live merely in the end to say goodbye to one another why do we labour to bring children into the world that they may die and be buried  of what use our mad striving our passionate desire will it matter to the ages whether once upon a time the union jack or the tricolour floated over the battlements of badajoz yet we poured our blood into its ditches to decide the question will it matter in the days when the glacial period shall have come again to clothe the earth with silence whose foot first trod the pole yet generation after generation we mile its roadway with our whitening bones so very soon the worms come to us does it matter whether we love or hate yet the hot blood rushes through our veins we wear out heart and brain for shadowy hopes that ever fade as we press forward  the flower struggles up from seedpod draws the sweet sap from the ground folds its petals each night and sleeps then love comes to it in a strange form and it longs to mingle its pollen with the pollen of some other flower so it puts forth its gay blossoms and the wandering insect bears the message from seedpod to seedpod and the seasons pass bringing with them the sunshine and the rain till the flower withers never having known the real purpose for which it lived thinking the garden was made for it not it for the garden the coral insect dreams in its small soul which is possibly its small stomach of home and food so it works and strives deep down in the dark waters never knowing of the continents it is fashioning  but the question still remains for what purpose is it all science explains it to us by ages of strife and effort we improve the race from ether through the monkey man is born so through the labour of the coming ages he will free himself still further from the brute through sorrow and through struggle by the sweat of brain and brow he will lift himself towards the angels he will come into his kingdom  but why the building why the passing of the countless ages why should he not have been born the god he is to be imbued at birth with all the capabilities his ancestors have died acquiring why the pict and hun that i may be why i that a descendant of my own to whom i shall seem a savage shall come after me why if the universe be ordered by a creator to whom all things are possible the protoplasmic cell why not the man that is to be shall all the generations be so much human waste that he may live am i but another layer of the soil preparing for him  or if our future be in other spheres then why the need of this planet are we labouring at some work too vast for us to perceive are our passions and desires mere whips and traces by the help of which we are driven any theory seems more hopeful than the thought that all our eager fretful lives are but the turning of a useless prison crank looking back the little distance that our dim eyes can penetrate the past what do we find civilizations built up with infinite care swept aside and lost beliefs for which men lived and died proved to be mockeries greek art crushed to the dust by gothic bludgeons dreams of fraternity drowned in blood by a napoleon what is left to us but the hope that the work itself not the result is the real monument maybe we are as children asking of what use are these lessons what good will they ever be to us but there comes a day when the lad understands why he learnt grammar and geography when even dates have a meaning for him but this is not until he has left school and gone out into the wider world so perhaps when we are a little more grown up we too may begin to understand the reason for our living     on the care and management of women  i talked to a woman once on the subject of honeymoons i said would you recommend a long honeymoon or a saturday to monday somewhere a silence fell upon her i gathered she was looking back rather than forward to her answer  i would advise a long honeymoon she replied at length the oldfashioned month  why i persisted i thought the tendency of the age was to cut these things shorter and shorter  it is the tendency of the age she answered to seek escape from many things it would be wiser to face i think myself that for good or evil the sooner it is overthe sooner both the man and the woman knowthe better  the sooner what is over i asked  if she had a fault this woman about which i am not sure it was an inclination towards enigma  she crossed to the window and stood there looking out  was there not a custom she said still gazing down into the wet glistening street among one of the ancient peoples i forget which ordaining that when a man and woman loving one another or thinking that they loved had been joined together they should go down upon their wedding night to the temple and into the dark recesses of the temple through many winding passages the priest led them until they came to the great chamber where dwelt the voice of their god there the priest left them clangingto the massive door behind him and there alone in silence they made their sacrifice and in the night the voice spoke to them showing them their future lifewhether they had chosen well whether their love would live or die and in the morning the priest returned and led them back into the day and they dwelt among their fellows but no one was permitted to question them nor they to answer should any do so well do you know our nineteenthcentury honeymoon at brighton switzerland or ramsgate as the choice or necessity may be always seems to me merely another form of that night spent alone in the temple before the altar of that forgotten god our young men and women marry and we kiss them and congratulate them and standing on the doorstep throw rice and old slippers and shout good wishes after them and he waves his gloved hand to us and she flutters her little handkerchief from the carriage window and we watch their smiling faces and hear their laughter until the corner hides them from our view then we go about our own business and a short time passes by and one day we meet them again and their faces have grown older and graver and i always wonder what the voice has told them during that little while that they have been absent from our sight but of course it would not do to ask them nor would they answer truly if we did  my friend laughed and leaving the window took her place beside the teathings and other callers dropping in we fell to talk of pictures plays and people  but i felt it would be unwise to act on her sole advice much as i have always valued her opinion  a woman takes life too seriously it is a serious affair to most of us the lord knows that is why it is well not to take it more seriously than need be  little jack and little jill fall down the hill hurting their little knees and their little noses spilling the hardearned water we are very philosophical  oh dont cry we tell them that is babyish little boys and little girls must learn to bear pain up you get fill the pail again and try once more  little jack and little jill rub their dirty knuckles into their little eyes looking ruefully at their bloody little knees and trot back with the pail we laugh at them but not illnaturedly  poor little souls we say how they did hullabaloo one might have thought they were halfkilled and it was only a broken crown after all what a fuss children make we bear with much stoicism the fall of little jack and little jill  but when wegrownup jack with moustache turning grey grownup jill with the first faint crows feet showingwhen we tumble down the hill and our pail is spilt ye heavens what a tragedy has happened put out the stars turn off the sun suspend the laws of nature mr jack and mrs jill coming down the hillwhat they were doing on the hill we will not inquirehave slipped over a stone placed there surely by the evil powers of the universe mr jack and mrs jill have bumped their silly heads mr jack and mrs jill have hurt their little hearts and stand marvelling that the world can go about its business in the face of such disaster  dont take the matter quite so seriously jack and jill you have spilled your happiness you must toil up the hill again and refill the pail carry it more carefully next time what were you doing playing some fools trick ill be bound  a laugh and a sigh a kiss and goodbye is our life is it worth so much fretting it is a merry life on the whole courage comrade a campaign cannot be all drum and fife and stirrupcup the marching and the fighting must come into it somewhere there are pleasant bivouacs among the vineyards merry nights around the camp fires white hands wave a welcome to us bright eyes dim at our going would you run from the battlemusic what have you to complain of forward the medal to some the surgeons knife to others to all of us sooner or later six feet of mother earth what are you afraid of courage comrade  there is a mean between basking through life with the smiling contentment of the alligator and shivering through it with the aggressive sensibility of the lama determined to die at every cross word to bear it as a man we must also feel it as a man my philosophic friend seek not to comfort a brother standing by the coffin of his child with the cheery suggestion that it will be all the same a hundred years hence because for one thing the observation is not true the man is changed for all eternitypossibly for the better but dont add that a soldier with a bullet in his neck is never quite the man he was but he can laugh and he can talk drink his wine and ride his horse now and again towards evening when the weather is trying the sickness will come upon him you will find him on a couch in a dark corner  hallo old fellow anything up  oh just a twinge the old wound you know i will be better in a little while  shut the door of the dark room quietly i should not stay even to sympathize with him if i were you the men will be coming to screw the coffin down soon i think he would like to be alone with it till then let us leave him he will come back to the club later on in the season for a while we may have to give him another ten points or so but he will soon get back his old form now and again when he meets the other fellows boys shouting on the towingpath when brown rushes up the drive paper in hand to tell him how that young scapegrace jim has won his cross when he is congratulating joness eldest on having passed with honours the old wound may give him a nasty twinge but the pain will pass away he will laugh at our stories and tell us his own eat his dinner play his rubber it is only a wound  tommy can never be ours jenny does not love us we cannot afford claret so we will have to drink beer well what would you have us do yes let us curse fate by all meanssome one to curse is always useful let us cry and wring our handsfor how long the dinnerbell will ring soon and the smiths are coming we shall have to talk about the opera and the picturegalleries quick where is the eaudecologne where are the curlingtongs or would you we committed suicide is it worth while only a few more yearsperhaps tomorrow by aid of a piece of orange peel or a broken chimneypotand fate will save us all that trouble  or shall we as sulky children mope day after day we are a brokenhearted little jacklittle jill we will never smile again we will pine away and die and be buried in the spring the world is sad and life so cruel and heaven so cold oh dear oh dear we have hurt ourselves  we whimper and whine at every pain in old strong days men faced real dangers real troubles every hour they had no time to cry death and disaster stood ever at the door men were contemptuous of them now in each snug protected villa we set to work to make wounds out of scratches every headache becomes an agony every heartache a tragedy it took a murdered father a drowned sweetheart a dishonoured mother a ghost and a slaughtered prime minister to produce the emotions in hamlet that a modern minor poet obtains from a chorus girls frown or a temporary slump on the stock exchange like mrs gummidge we feel it more the lighter and easier life gets the more seriously we go out to meet it the boatmen of ulysses faced the thunder and the sunshine alike with frolic welcome we modern sailors have grown more sensitive the sunshine scorches us the rain chills us we meet both with loud selfpity  thinking these thoughts i sought a second frienda man whose breezy commonsense has often helped me and him likewise i questioned on this subject of honeymoons  my dear boy he replied take my advice if ever you get married arrange it so that the honeymoon shall only last a week and let it be a bustling week into the bargain take a cooks circular tour get married on the saturday morning cut the breakfast and all that foolishness and catch the eleventen from charing cross to paris take her up the eiffel tower on sunday lunch at fontainebleau dine at the maison doree and show her the moulin rouge in the evening take the night train for lucerne devote monday and tuesday to doing switzerland and get into rome by thursday morning taking the italian lakes en route on friday cross to marseilles and from there push along to monte carlo let her have a flutter at the tables start early saturday morning for spain cross the pyrenees on mules and rest at bordeaux on sunday get back to paris on monday monday is always a good day for the opera and on tuesday evening you will be at home and glad to get there dont give her time to criticize you until she has got used to you no man will bear unprotected exposure to a young girls eyes the honeymoon is the matrimonial microscope wobble it confuse it with many objects cloud it with other interests dont sit still to be examined besides remember that a man always appears at his best when active and a woman at her worst bustle her my dear boy bustle her i dont care who she may be give her plenty of luggage to look after make her catch trains let her see the average husband sprawling comfortably over the railway cushions while his wife has to sit bolt upright in the corner left to her let her hear how other men swear let her smell other mens tobacco hurry up and get her accustomed quickly to the sight of mankind then she will be less surprised and shocked as she grows to know you one of the best fellows i ever knew spoilt his married life beyond repair by a long quiet honeymoon they went off for a month to a lonely cottage in some heavenforsaken spot where never a soul came near them and never a thing happened but morning afternoon and night there for thirty days she overhauled him when he yawnedand he yawned pretty often i guess during that monthshe thought of the size of his mouth and when he put his heels upon the fender she sat and brooded upon the shape of his feet at mealtime not feeling hungry herself having nothing to do to make her hungry she would occupy herself with watching him eat and at night not feeling sleepy for the same reason she would lie awake and listen to his snoring after the first day or two he grew tired of talking nonsense and she of listening to it it sounded nonsense now they could speak it aloud they had fancied it poetry when they had had to whisper it and having no other subject as yet of common interest they would sit and stare in front of them in silence one day some trifle irritated him and he swore on a busy railway platform or in a crowded hotel she would have said oh and they would both have laughed from that echoing desert the silly words rose up in widening circles towards the sky and that night she cried herself to sleep bustle them my dear boy bustle them we all like each other better the less we think about one another and the honeymoon is an exceptionally critical time bustle her my dear boy bustle her  my very worst honeymoon experience took place in the south of england in eighteen hundred andwell never mind the exact date let us say a few years ago i was a shy young man at that time many complain of my reserve to this day but then some girls expect too much from a man we all have our shortcomings even then however i was not so shy as she we had to travel from lyndhurst in the new forest to ventnor an awkward bit of crosscountry work in those days  its so fortunate you are going too said her aunt to me on the tuesday minnie is always nervous travelling alone you will be able to look after her and i shant be anxious  i said it would be a pleasure and at the time i honestly thought it on the wednesday i went down to the coach office and booked two places for lymington from where we took the steamer i had not a suspicion of trouble  the bookingclerk was an elderly man he said  ive got the box seat and the end place on the back bench  i said  oh cant i have two together  he was a kindlylooking old fellow he winked at me i wondered all the way home why he had winked at me he said  ill manage it somehow  i said  its very kind of you im sure  he laid his hand on my shoulder he struck me as familiar but wellintentioned he said  we have all of us been there  i thought he was alluding to the isle of wight i said  and this is the best time of the year for it so im told it was early summer time  he saidits all right in summer and its good enough in winterwhile it lasts you make the most of it young un and he slapped me on the back and laughed  he would have irritated me in another minute i paid for the seats and left him  at halfpast eight the next morning minnie and i started for the coachoffice i call her minnie not with any wish to be impertinent but because i have forgotten her surname it must be ten years since i last saw her she was a pretty girl too with those brown eyes that always cloud before they laugh her aunt did not drive down with us as she had intended in consequence of a headache she was good enough to say she felt every confidence in me  the old bookingclerk caught sight of us when we were about a quarter of a mile away and drew to us the attention of the coachman who communicated the fact of our approach to the gathered passengers everybody left off talking and waited for us the boots seized his horn and blewone could hardly call it a blast it would be difficult to say what he blew he put his heart into it but not sufficient wind i think his intention was to welcome us but it suggested rather a feeble curse we learnt subsequently that he was a beginner on the instrument  in some mysterious way the whole affair appeared to be our party the bookingclerk bustled up and helped minnie from the cart i feared for a moment he was going to kiss her the coachman grinned when i said goodmorning to him the passengers grinned the boots grinned two chambermaids and a waiter came out from the hotel and they grinned i drew minnie aside and whispered to her i said  theres something funny about us all these people are grinning  she walked round me and i walked round her but we could neither of us discover anything amusing about the other the bookingclerk said  its all right ive got you young people two places just behind the boxseat well have to put five of you on that seat you wont mind sitting a bit close will you  the bookingclerk winked at the coachman the coachman winked at the passengers the passengers winked at one anotherthose of them who could winkand everybody laughed the two chambermaids became hysterical and had to cling to each other for support with the exception of minnie and myself it seemed to be the merriest coach party ever assembled at lyndhurst  we had taken our places and i was still busy trying to fathom the joke when a stout lady appeared on the scene and demanded to know her place  the clerk explained to her that it was in the middle behind the driver  weve had to put five of you on that seat added the clerk  the stout lady looked at the seat  five of us cant squeeze into that she said  five of her certainly could not four ordinary sized people with her would find it tight  very well then said the clerk you can have the end place on the back seat  nothing of the sort said the stout lady i booked my seat on monday and you told me any of the front places were vacant  ill take the back place i said i dont mind it  you stop where you are young un said the clerk firmly and dont be a fool ill fix her  i objected to his language but his tone was kindness itself  oh let me have the back seat said minnie rising id so like it  for answer the coachman put both his hands on her shoulders he was a heavy man and she sat down again  now then mum said the clerk addressing the stout lady are you going up there in the middle or are you coming up here at the back  but why not let one of them take the back seat demanded the stout lady pointing her reticule at minnie and myself they say theyd like it let them have it  the coachman rose and addressed his remarks generally  put her up at the back or leave her behind he directed man and wife have never been separated on this coach since i started running it fifteen year ago and they aint going to be now  a general cheer greeted this sentiment the stout lady now regarded as a wouldbe blighter of loves young dream was hustled into the back seat the whip cracked and away we rolled  so here was the explanation we were in a honeymoon district in junethe most popular month in the whole year for marriage every two out of three couples found wandering about the new forest in june are honeymoon couples the third are going to be when they travel anywhere it is to the isle of wight we both had on new clothes our bags happened to be new by some evil chance our very umbrellas were new our united ages were thirtyseven the wonder would have been had we not been mistaken for a young married couple  a day of greater misery i have rarely passed to minnie so her aunt informed me afterwards the journey was the most terrible experience of her life but then her experience up to that time had been limited she was engaged and devotedly attached to a young clergyman i was madly in love with a somewhat plump girl named cecilia who lived with her mother at hampstead i am positive as to her living at hampstead i remember so distinctly my weekly walk down the hill from church row to the swiss cottage station when walking down a steep hill all the weight of the body is forced into the toe of the boot and when the boot is two sizes too small for you and you have been living in it since the early afternoon you remember a thing like that but all my recollections of cecilia are painful and it is needless to pursue them  our coachload was a homely party and some of the jokes were broadharmless enough in themselves had minnie and i really been the married couple we were supposed to be but even in that case unnecessary i can only hope that minnie did not understand them anyhow she looked as if she didnt  i forget where we stopped for lunch but i remember that lamb and mint sauce was on the table and that the circumstance afforded the greatest delight to all the party with the exception of the stout lady who was still indignant minnie and myself about my behaviour as a bridegroom opinion appeared to be divided hes a bit standoffish with her i overheard one lady remark to her husband i like to see em a bit kittenish myself a young waitress on the other hand i am happy to say showed more sense of natural reserve well i respect him for it she was saying to the barmaid as we passed through the hall id just hate to be fuzzled over with everybody looking on nobody took the trouble to drop their voices for our benefit we might have been a pair of prize love birds on exhibition the way we were openly discussed by the majority we were clearly regarded as a sulky young couple who would not go through their tricks  i have often wondered since how a real married couple would have faced the situation possibly had we consented to give a short display of marital affection by desire we might have been left in peace for the remainder of the journey  our reputation preceded us on to the steamboat minnie begged and prayed me to let it be known we were not married how i was to let it be known except by requesting the captain to summon the whole ships company on deck and then making them a short speech i could not think minnie said she could not bear it any longer and retired to the ladies cabin she went off crying her trouble was attributed by crew and passengers to my coldness one fool planted himself opposite me with his legs apart and shook his head at me  go down and comfort her he began take an old mans advice put your arms around her he was one of those sentimental idiots tell her that you love her  i told him to go and hang himself with so much vigour that he all but fell overboard he was saved by a poultry crate i had no luck that day  at ryde the guard by superhuman effort contrived to keep us a carriage to ourselves i gave him a shilling because i did not know what else to do i would have made it halfasovereign if he had put eight other passengers in with us at every station people came to the window to look in at us  i handed minnie over to her father on ventnor platform and i took the first train the next morning to london i felt i did not want to see her again for a little while and i felt convinced she could do without a visit from me our next meeting took place the week before her marriage  where are you going to spend your honeymoon i asked her in the new forest  no she replied nor in the isle of wight  to enjoy the humour of an incident one must be at some distance from it either in time or relationship i remember watching an amusing scene in whitefield street just off tottenham court road one winters saturday night a womana rather respectable looking woman had her hat only been on straighthad just been shot out of a publichouse she was very dignified and very drunk a policeman requested her to move on she called him fellow and demanded to know of him if he considered that was the proper tone in which to address a lady she threatened to report him to her cousin the lord chancellor  yes this way to the lord chancellor retorted the policeman you come along with me and he caught hold of her by the arm  she gave a lurch and nearly fell to save her the man put his arm round her waist she clasped him round the neck and together they spun round two or three times while at the very moment a pianoorgan at the opposite corner struck up a waltz  choose your partners gentlemen for the next dance shouted a wag and the crowd roared  i was laughing myself for the situation was undeniably comical the constables expression of disgust being quite hogarthian when the sight of a childs face beneath the gaslamp stayed me her look was so full of terror that i tried to comfort her  its only a drunken woman i said hes not going to hurt her  please sir was the answer its my mother  our joke is generally anothers pain the man who sits down on the tintack rarely joins in the laugh     on the minding of other peoples business  i walked one bright september morning in the strand i love london best in the autumn then only can one see the gleam of its white pavements the bold unbroken outline of its streets i love the cool vistas one comes across of mornings in the parks the soft twilights that linger in the empty byestreets in june the restaurant manager is offhand with me i feel i am but in his way in august he spreads for me the table by the window pours out for me my wine with his own fat hands i cannot doubt his regard for me my foolish jealousies are stilled do i care for a drive after dinner through the caressing night air i can climb the omnibus stair without a preliminary fight upon the curb can sit with easy conscience and unsquashed body not feeling i have deprived some hot tired woman of a seat do i desire the play no harsh forbidding house full board repels me from the door during her season london a harassed hostess has no time for us her intimates her rooms are overcrowded her servants overworked her dinners hurriedly cooked her tone insincere in the spring to be truthful the great lady condescends to be somewhat vulgarnoisy and ostentatious not till the guests are departed is she herself again the london that we her children love  have you gentle reader ever seen londonnot the london of the waking day coated with crawling life as a blossom with blight but the london of the morning freed from her rags the patient city clad in mists get you up with the dawn one sunday in summer time wake none else but creep down stealthily into the kitchen and make your own tea and toast  be careful you stumble not over the cat she will worm herself insidiously between your legs it is her way she means it in friendship neither bark your shins against the coalbox why the kitchen coalbox has its fixed place in the direct line between the kitchen door and the gasbracket i cannot say i merely know it as an universal law and i would that you escaped that coalbox lest the frame of mind i desire for you on this sabbath morning be dissipated  a spoon to stir your tea i fear you must dispense with knives and forks you will discover in plenty blacking brushes you will put your hand upon in every drawer of emery paper did one require it there are reams but it is a point with every housekeeper that the spoons be hidden in a different place each night if anybody excepting herself can find them in the morning it is a slur upon her no matter a stick of firewood sharpened at one end makes an excellent substitute  your breakfast done turn out the gas remount the stairs quietly open gently the front door and slip out you will find yourself in an unknown land a strange city grown round you in the night  the sweet long streets lie silent in sunlight not a living thing is to be seen save some lean tom that slinks from his gutter feast as you approach from some tree there will sound perhaps a fretful chirp but the london sparrow is no early riser he is but talking in his sleep the slow tramp of unseen policeman draws near or dies away the clatter of your own footsteps goes with you troubling you you find yourself trying to walk softly as one does in echoing cathedrals a voice is everywhere about you whispering to you hush is this millionbreasted city then some tender artemis seeking to keep her babes asleep hush you careless wayfarer do not waken them walk lighter they are so tired these myriad children of mine sleeping in my thousand arms they are overworked and overworried so many of them are sick so many fretful many of them alas so full of naughtiness but all of them so tired hush they worry me with their noise and riot when they are awake they are so good now they are asleep walk lightly let them rest  where the ebbing tide flows softly through worn arches to the sea you may hear the stonefaced city talking to the restless waters why will you never stay with me why come but to go  i cannot say i do not understand from the deep sea i come but only as a bird loosed from a childs hand with a cord when she calls i must return  it is so with these children of mine they come to me i know not whence i nurse them for a little while till a hand i do not see plucks them back and others take their place  through the still air there passes a ripple of sound the sleeping city stirs with a faint sigh a distant milkcart rattling by raises a thousand echoes it is the vanguard of a yoked army soon from every street there rises the soothing cry meehilkmeehilk  london like some gargantuan babe is awake crying for its milk these be the whitesmocked nurses hastening with its morning nourishment the early church bells ring you have had your milk little london now come and say your prayers another week has just begun baby london god knows what will happen say your prayers  one by one the little creatures creep from behind the blinds into the streets the brooding tenderness is vanished from the citys face the fretful noises of the day have come again silence her lover of the night kisses her stone lips and steals away and you gentle reader return home garlanded with the selfsufficiency of the early riser  but it was of a certain weekday morning in the strand that i was thinking i was standing outside gattis restaurant where i had just breakfasted listening leisurely to an argument between an indignant lady passenger presumably of irish extraction and an omnibus conductor  for what dye want thin to paint putney on yer bus if ye dont go to putney said the lady  we do go to putney said the conductor  thin why did ye put me out here  i didnt put you out yer got out  shure didnt the gintleman in the corner tell me i was comin further away from putney ivery minit  wal and so yer was  thin whoy didnt you tell me  how was i to know yer wanted to go to putney yer sings out putney and i stops and in yer jumps  and for what dye think i called out putney thin  cause its my name or rayther the buss name this ere is a putney  how can it be a putney whin it isnt goin to putney ye gomerhawk  aint you an hirishwoman retorted the conductor course yer are but yer arent always goin to ireland were goin to putney in time only were agoing to liverpool street fust igher up jim  the bus moved on and i was about cross the road when a man muttering savagely to himself walked into me he would have swept past me had i not recognizing him arrested him it was my friend b a busy editor of magazines and journals it was some seconds before he appeared able to struggle out of his abstraction and remember himself halloo he then said who would have thought of seeing you here  to judge by the way you were walking i replied one would imagine the strand the last place in which you expected to see any human being do you ever walk into a shorttempered muscular man  did i walk into you he asked surprised  well not right in i answered i if we are to be literal you walked on to me if i had not stopped you i suppose you would have walked over me  it is this confounded christmas business he explained it drives me off my head  i have heard christmas advanced as an excuse for many things i replied but not early in september  oh you know what i mean he answered we are in the middle of our christmas number i am working day and night upon it by the bye he added that puts me in mind i am arranging a symposium and i want you to join should christmasi interrupted him  my dear fellow i said i commenced my journalistic career when i was eighteen and i have continued it at intervals ever since i have written about christmas from the sentimental point of view i have analyzed it from the philosophical point of view and i have scarified it from the sarcastic standpoint i have treated christmas humorously for the comics and sympathetically for the provincial weeklies i have said all that is worth saying on the subject of christmasmaybe a trifle more i have told the newfashioned christmas storyyou know the sort of thing your heroine tries to understand herself and failing runs off with the man who began as the hero your good woman turns out to be really bad when one comes to know her while the villain the only decent person in the story dies with an enigmatic sentence on his lips that looks as if it meant something but which you yourself would be sorry to have to explain i have also written the oldfashioned christmas storyyou know that also you begin with a good oldfashioned snowstorm you have a good oldfashioned squire and he lives in a good oldfashioned hall you work in a good oldfashioned murder and end up with a good oldfashioned christmas dinner i have gathered christmas guests together round the crackling logs to tell ghost stories to each other on christmas eve while without the wind howled as it always does on these occasions at its proper cue i have sent children to heaven on christmas eveit must be quite a busy time for st peter christmas morning so many good children die on christmas eve it has always been a popular night with themi have revivified dead lovers and brought them back well and jolly just in time to sit down to the christmas dinner i am not ashamed of having done these things at the time i thought them good i once loved currant wine and girls with towzley hair ones views change as one grows older i have discussed christmas as a religious festival i have arraigned it as a social incubus if there be any joke connected with christmas that i have not already made i should be glad to hear it i have trotted out the indigestion jokes till the sight of one of them gives me indigestion myself i have ridiculed the family gathering i have scoffed at the christmas present i have made witty use of paterfamilias and his bills i have  did i ever show you i broke off to ask as we were crossing the haymarket that little parody of mine on poes poem of the bells it begins he interrupted me in his turn  bills bills bills he repeated  you are quite right i admitted i forgot i ever showed it to you  you never did he replied  then how do you know how it begins i asked  i dont know for certain he admitted but i get on an average sixtyfive a year submitted to me and they all begin that way i thought perhaps yours did also  i dont see how else it could begin i retorted he had rather annoyed me besides it doesnt matter how a poem begins it is how it goes on that is the important thing and anyhow im not going to write you anything about christmas ask me to make you a new joke about a plumber suggest my inventing something original and not too shocking for a child to say about heaven propose my running you off a dog story that can be believed by a man of average determination and we may come to terms but on the subject of christmas i am taking a rest  by this time we had reached piccadilly circus  i dont blame you he said if you are as sick of the subject as i am so soon as these christmas numbers are off my mind and christmas is over till next june at the office i shall begin it at home the housekeeping is gone up a pound a week already i know what that means the dear little woman is saving up to give me an expensive present that i dont want i think the presents are the worst part of christmas emma will give me a watercolour that she has painted herself she always does there would be no harm in that if she did not expect me to hang it in the drawing room have you ever seen my cousin emmas watercolours he asked  i think i have i replied  theres no thinking about it he retorted angrily theyre not the sort of watercolours you forget  he apostrophized the circus generally  why do people do these things he demanded even an amateur artist must have some sense cant they see what is happening theres that thing of hers hanging in the passage i put it in the passage because theres not much light in the passage shes labelled it reverie if she had called it influenza i could have understood it i asked her where she got the idea from and she said she saw the sky like that one evening in norfolk great heavens then why didnt she shut her eyes or go home and hide behind the bedcurtains if i had seen a sky like that in norfolk i should have taken the first train back to london i suppose the poor girl cant help seeing these things but why paint them  i said i suppose painting is a necessity to some natures  but why give the things to me he pleaded  i could offer him no adequate reason  the idiotic presents that people give you he continued i said id like tennysons poems one year they had worried me to know what i did want i didnt want anything really that was the only thing i could think of that i wasnt dead sure i didnt want well they clubbed together four of them and gave me tennyson in twelve volumes illustrated with coloured photographs they meant kindly of course if you suggest a tobaccopouch they give you a blue velvet bag capable of holding about a pound embroidered with flowers lifesize the only way one could use it would be to put a strap to it and wear it as a satchel would you believe it i have got a velvet smokingjacket ornamented with forgetmenots and butterflies in coloured silk im not joking and they ask me why i never wear it ill bring it down to the club one of these nights and wake the place up a bit it needs it  we had arrived by this at the steps of the devonshire  and im just as bad he went on when i give presents i never give them what they want i never hit upon anything that is of any use to anybody if i give jane a chinchilla tippet you may be certain chinchilla is the most outofdate fur that any woman could wear oh that is nice of you she says now that is just the very thing i wanted i will keep it by me till chinchilla comes in again i give the girls watchchains when nobody is wearing watchchains when watchchains are all the rage i give them earrings and they thank me and suggest my taking them to a fancydress ball that being their only chance to wear the confounded things i waste money on white gloves with black backs to find that white gloves with black backs stamp a woman as suburban i believe all the shopkeepers in london save their old stock to palm it off on me at christmas time and why does it always take halfadozen people to serve you with a pair of gloves id like to know only last week jane asked me to get her some gloves for that last mansion house affair i was feeling amiable and i thought i would do the thing handsomely i hate going into a drapers shop everybody stares at a man as if he were forcing his way into the ladies department of a turkish bath one of those marionette sort of men came up to me and said it was a fine morning what the devil did i want to talk about the morning to him for i said i wanted some gloves i described them to the best of my recollection i said i want them four buttons but they are not to be buttongloves the buttons are in the middle and they reach up to the elbow if you know what i mean he bowed and said he understood exactly what i meant which was a damned sight more than i did i told him i wanted three pair cream and three pair fawncoloured and the fawncoloured were to be swedes he corrected me he said i meant suede i dare say he was right but the interruption put me off and i had to begin over again he listened attentively until i had finished i guess i was about five minutes standing with him there close to the door he said is that all you require sir this morning i said it was   thank you sir he replied this way please sir  he took me into another room and there we met a man named jansen to whom he briefly introduced me as a gentleman who desired gloves yes sir said mr jansen and what sort of gloves do you desire  i told him i wanted six pairs altogetherthree suede fawncoloured and three creamcolouredkids  he said do you mean kid gloves sir or gloves for children  he made me angry by that i told him i was not in the habit of using slang nor am i when buying gloves he said he was sorry i explained to him about the buttons so far as i could understand it myself and about the length i asked him to see to it that the buttons were sewn on firmly and that the stitching everywhere was perfect adding that the last gloves my wife had had of his firm had been most unsatisfactory jane had impressed upon me to add that she said it would make them more careful  he listened to me in rapt ecstacy i might have been music  and what size sir he asked  i had forgotten that oh sixes i answered unless they are very stretchy indeed in which case they had better be five and threequarter  oh and the stitching on the cream is to be black i added that was another thing i had forgotten  thank you very much said mr jansen is there anything else that you require this morning  no thank you i replied not this morning i was beginning to like the man  he took me for quite a walk and wherever we went everybody left off what they were doing to stare at me i was getting tired when we reached the glove department he marched me up to a young man who was sticking pins into himself he said gloves and disappeared through a curtain the young man left off sticking pins into himself and leant across the counter  ladies gloves or gentlemens gloves he said  well i was pretty mad by this time as you can guess it is funny when you come to think of it afterwards but the wonder then was that i didnt punch his head  i said are you ever busy in this shop does there ever come a time when you feel you would like to get your work done instead of lingering over it and spinning it out for pure love of the thing  he did not appear to understand me i said i met a man at your door a quarter of an hour ago and we talked about these gloves that i want and i told him all my ideas on the subject he took me to your mr jansen and mr jansen and i went over the whole business again now mr jansen leaves it with youyou who do not even know whether i want ladies or gentlemens gloves before i go over this story for the third time i want to know whether you are the man who is going to serve me or whether you are merely a listener because personally i am tired of the subject  well this was the right man at last and i got my gloves from him but what is the explanationwhat is the idea i was in that shop from first to last fiveandthirty minutes and then a fool took me out the wrong way to show me a special line in sleepingsocks i told him i was not requiring any he said he didnt want me to buy he only wanted me to see them no wonder the drapers have had to start luncheon and tearooms theyll fix up small furnished flats soon where a woman can live for a week  i said it was very trying shopping i also said as he invited me and as he appeared determined to go on talking that i would have a brandyandsoda we were in the smokeroom by this time  there ought to be an association he continued a kind of clearinghouse for the collection and distribution of christmas presents one would give them a list of the people from whom to collect presents and of the people to whom to send suppose they collected on my account twenty christmas presents value say ten pounds while on the other hand they sent out for me thirty presents at a cost of fifteen pounds they would debit me with the balance of five pounds together with a small commission i should pay it cheerfully and there would be no further trouble perhaps one might even make a profit the idea might include birthdays and weddings a firm would do the business thoroughly they would see that all your friends paid upi mean sent presents and they would not forget to send to your most important relative there is only one member of our family capable of leaving a shilling and of course if i forget to send to any one it is to him when i remember him i generally make a muddle of the business two years ago i gave him a bathi dont mean i washed himan indiarubber thing that he could pack in his portmanteau i thought he would find it useful for travelling would you believe it he took it as a personal affront and wouldnt speak to me for a month the snuffy old idiot  i suppose the children enjoy it i said  enjoy what he asked  why christmas i explained  i dont believe they do he snapped nobody enjoys it we excite them for three weeks beforehand telling them what a good time they are going to have overfeed them for two or three days take them to something they do not want to see but which we do and then bully them for a fortnight to get them back into their normal condition i was always taken to the crystal palace and madame tussauds when i was a child i remember how i did hate that crystal palace aunt used to superintend it was always a bitterly cold day and we always got into the wrong train and travelled half the day before we got there we never had any dinner it never occurs to a woman that anybody can want their meals while away from home she seems to think that nature is in suspense from the time you leave the house till the time you get back to it a bun and a glass of milk was her idea of lunch for a schoolboy half her time was taken up in losing us and the other half in slapping us when she had found us the only thing we really enjoyed was the row with the cabman coming home  i rose to go  then you wont join that symposium said b it would be an easy enough thing to knock offwhy christmas should be abolished  it sounds simple i answered but how do you propose to abolish it the lady editor of an advanced american magazine once set the discussionshould sex be abolished and eleven ladies and gentlemen seriously argued the question  leave it to die of inanition said b the first step is to arouse public opinion convince the public that it should be abolished  but why should it be abolished i asked  great scott man he exclaimed dont you want it abolished  im not sure that i do i replied  not sure he retorted you call yourself a journalist and admit there is a subject under heaven of which you are not sure  it has come over me of late years i replied it used not to be my failing as you know  he glanced round to make sure we were out of earshot then sunk his voice to a whisper  between ourselves he said im not so sure of everything myself as i used to be why is it  perhaps we are getting older i suggested  he saidi started golf last year and the first time i took the club in my hand i sent the ball a furlong it seems an easy game i said to the man who was teaching me yes most people find it easy at the beginning he replied dryly he was an old golfer himself i thought he was jealous i stuck well to the game and for about three weeks i was immensely pleased with myself then gradually i began to find out the difficulties i feel i shall never make a good player have you ever gone through that experience  yes i replied i suppose that is the explanation the game seems so easy at the beginning  i left him to his lunch and strolled westward musing on the time when i should have answered that question of his about christmas or any other question offhand that good youth time when i knew everything when life presented no problems dangled no doubts before me  in those days wishful to give the world the benefit of my wisdom and seeking for a candlestick wherefrom my brilliancy might be visible and helpful unto men i arrived before a dingy portal in chequers street st lukes behind which a conclave of young men together with a few old enough to have known better met every friday evening for the purpose of discussing and arranging the affairs of the universe speaking members were charged tenandsixpence per annum which must have worked out at an extremely moderate rate per word and gentlemen whose subscriptions were more than three months in arrear became by rule seven powerless for good or evil we called ourselves the stormy petrels and under the sympathetic shadow of those wings i laboured two seasons towards the reformation of the human race until indeed our treasurer an earnest young man and a tireless foe of all that was conventional departed for the east leaving behind him a balance sheet showing that the club owed fortytwo pounds fifteen and fourpence and that the subscriptions for the current year amounting to a little over thirtyeight pounds had been carried forward but as to where the report afforded no indication whereupon our landlord a man utterly without ideals seized our furniture offering to sell it back to us for fifteen pounds we pointed out to him that this was an extravagant price and tendered him five  the negotiations terminated with ungentlemanly language on his part and the stormy petrels scattered never to be foregathered together again above the troubled waters of humanity nowadays listening to the feeble plans of modern reformers i cannot help but smile remembering what was done in chequers street st lukes in an age when mrs grundy still gave the law to literature while yet the british matron was the guide to british art i am informed that there is abroad the question of abolishing the house of lords why the stormy petrels abolished the aristocracy and the crown in one evening and then only adjourned for the purpose of appointing a committee to draw up and have ready a republican constitution by the following friday evening they talk of empire lounges we closed the doors of every musichall in london eighteen years ago by twentynine votes to seventeen they had a patient hearing and were ably defended but we found that the tendency of such amusements was antiprogressive and against the best interests of an intellectually advancing democracy i met the mover of the condemnatory resolution at the old pav the following evening and we continued the discussion over a bottle of bass he strengthened his argument by persuading me to sit out the whole of the three songs sung by the lion comique but i subsequently retorted successfully by bringing under his notice the dancing of a lady in blue tights and flaxen hair i forget her name but never shall i cease to remember her exquisite charm and beauty ah me how charming and how beautiful artistes were in those golden days whence have they vanished ladies in blue tights and flaxen hair dance before my eyes today but move me not unless it be towards boredom where be the tripping witches of twenty years ago whom to see once was to dream of for a week to touch whose white hand would have been joy to kiss whose red lips would have been to foretaste heaven i heard only the other day that the son of an old friend of mine had secretly married a lady from the front row of the ballet and involuntarily i exclaimed poor devil there was a time when my first thought would have been lucky beggar is he worthy of her for then the ladies of the ballet were angels how could one gaze at themfrom the shilling pitand doubt it they danced to keep a widowed mother in comfort or to send a younger brother to school then they were glorious creatures a young man did well to worship but nowadays  it is an old jest the eyes of youth see through rosetinted glasses the eyes of age are dim behind smokeclouded spectacles my flaxen friend you are not the angel i dreamed you nor the exceptional sinner some would paint you but under your feathers just a womana bundle of follies and failings tied up with some sweetness and strength you keep a brougham i am sure you cannot afford on your thirty shillings a week there are ladies i know in mayfair who have paid an extravagant price for theirs you paint and you dye i am told it is even hinted you pad dont we all of us deck ourselves out in virtues that are not our own when the paint and the powder my sister is stripped both from you and from me we shall know which of us is entitled to look down on the other in scorn  forgive me gentle reader for digressing the lady led me astray i was speaking of the stormy petrels and of the reforms they accomplished which were many we abolished i remember capital punishment and war we were excellent young men at heart christmas we reformed altogether along with bank holidays by a majority of twelve i never recollect any proposal to abolish anything ever being lost when put to the vote there were few things that we stormy petrels did not abolish we attacked christmas on grounds of expediency and killed it by ridicule we exposed the hollow mockery of christmas sentiment we abused the indigestible christmas dinner the tiresome christmas party the silly christmas pantomime our funny member was sidesplitting on the subject of christmas waits our social reformer bitter upon christmas drunkenness our economist indignant upon christmas charities only one argument of any weight with us was advanced in favour of the festival and that was our leading cynics suggestion that it was worth enduring the miseries of christmas to enjoy the soulsatisfying comfort of the after reflection that it was all over and could not occur again for another year  but since those days when i was prepared to put this old world of ours to rights upon all matters i have seen many sights and heard many sounds and i am not quite so sure as i once was that my particular views are the only possibly correct ones christmas seems to me somewhat meaningless but i have looked through windows in povertystricken streets and have seen dingy parlours gay with many chains of coloured paper they stretched from corner to corner of the smokegrimed ceiling they fell in clumsy festoons from the cheap gasalier they framed the flyblown mirror and the tawdry pictures and i know tired hands and eyes worked many hours to fashion and fix those foolish chains saying it will please himshe will like to see the room look pretty and as i have looked at them they have grown in some mysterious manner beautiful to me the gaudycoloured child and dog irritates me i confess but i have watched a grimy inartistic personage smoothing it affectionately with toilstained hand while eager faces crowded round to admire and wonder at its blatant crudity it hangs to this day in its cheap frame above the chimneypiece the one bright spot relieving those dampstained walls dull eyes stare and stare again at it catching a vista through its flashy tints of the faroff land of art christmas waits annoy me and i yearn to throw open the window and fling coal at themas once from the window of a high flat in chelsea i did i doubted their being genuine waits i was inclined to the opinion they were young men seeking excuse for making a noise one of them appeared to know a hymn with a chorus another played the concertina while a third accompanied with a step dance instinctively i felt no respect for them they disturbed me in my work and the desire grew upon me to injure them it occurred to me it would be good sport if i turned out the light softly opened the window and threw coal at them it would be impossible for them to tell from which window in the block the coal came and thus subsequent unpleasantness would be avoided they were a compact little group and with average luck i was bound to hit one of them  i adopted the plan i could not see them very clearly i aimed rather at the noise and i had thrown about twenty choice lumps without effect and was feeling somewhat discouraged when a yell followed by language singularly unappropriate to the season told me that providence had aided my arm the music ceased suddenly and the party dispersed apparently in high gleewhich struck me as curious  one man i noticed remained behind he stood under the lamppost and shook his fist at the block generally  who threw that lump of coal he demanded in stentorian tones  to my horror it was the voice of the man at eightyeight an irish gentleman a journalist like myself i saw it all as the unfortunate hero always exclaims too late in the play henumber eightyeightalso disturbed by the noise had evidently gone out to expostulate with the rioters of course my lump of coal had hit himhim the innocent the peaceful up till then the virtuous that is the justice fate deals out to us mortals here below there were ten to fourteen young men in that crowd each one of whom fully deserved that lump of coal he the one guiltless got itseemingly so far as the dim light from the gas lamp enabled me to judge full in the eye  as the block remained silent in answer to his demand he crossed the road and mounted the stairs on each landing he stopped and shouted  who threw that lump of coal i want the man who threw that lump of coal out you come  now a good man in my place would have waited till number eightyeight arrived on his landing and then throwing open the door would have said with manly candour  i threw that lump of coal i was he would not have got further because at that point i feel confident number eightyeight would have punched his head there would have been an unseemly fracas on the staircase to the annoyance of all the other tenants and later there would have issued a summons and a crosssummons angry passions would have been roused bitter feeling engendered which might have lasted for years  i do not pretend to be a good man i doubt if the pretence would be of any use were i to try i am not a sufficiently good actor i said to myself as i took off my boots in the study preparatory to retiring to my bedroomnumber eightyeight is evidently not in a frame of mind to listen to my story it will be better to let him shout himself cool after which he will return to his own flat bathe his eye and obtain some refreshing sleep in the morning when we shall probably meet as usual on our way to fleet street i will refer to the incident casually and sympathize with him i will suggest to him the truththat in all probability some fellowtenant irritated also by the noise had aimed coal at the waits hitting him instead by a regrettable but pure accident with tact i may even be able to make him see the humour of the incident later on in march or april choosing my moment with judgment i will perhaps confess that i was that fellowtenant and over a friendly brandyandsoda we will laugh the whole trouble away  as a matter of fact that is what happened said number eightyeighthe was a big man as good a fellow at heart as ever lived but impulsivedamned lucky for you old man you did not tell me at the time  i felt i replied instinctively that it was a case for delay  there are times when one should control ones passion for candour and as i was saying christmas waits excite no emotion in my breast save that of irritation but i have known hark the herald angels sing wheezily chanted by fogfilled throats and accompanied hopelessly out of tune by a cornet and a flute bring a great look of gladness to a workworn face to her it was a message of hope and love making the hard life taste sweet the mere thought of family gatherings so customary at christmas time bores us superior people but i think of an incident told me by a certain man a friend of mine one christmas my friend visiting in the country came face to face with a woman whom in town he had often met amid very different surroundings the door of the little farmhouse was open she and an older woman were ironing at a table and as her soft white hands passed to and fro folding and smoothing the rumpled heap she laughed and talked concerning simple homely things my friends shadow fell across her work and she looking up their eyes met but her face said plainly i do not know you here and here you do not know me here i am a woman loved and respected my friend passed in and spoke to the older woman the wife of one of his hosts tenants and she turned towards and introduced the youngermy daughter sir we do not see her very often she is in a place in london and cannot get away but she always spends a few days with us at christmas  it is the season for family reunions answered my friend with just the suggestion of a sneer for which he hated himself  yes sir said the woman not noticing she has never missed her christmas with us have you bess  no mother replied the girl simply and bent her head again over her work  so for these few days every year this woman left her furs and jewels her fine clothes and dainty foods behind her and lived for a little space with what was clean and wholesome it was the one anchor holding her to womanhood and one likes to think that it was perhaps in the end strong enough to save her from the drifting waters all which arguments in favour of christmas and of christmas customs are i admit purely sentimental ones but i have lived long enough to doubt whether sentiment has not its legitimate place in the economy of life     on the time wasted in looking before one leaps  have you ever noticed the going out of a woman  when a man goes out he saysim going out shant be long  oh george cries his wife from the other end of the house dont go for a moment i want you to she hears a falling of hats followed by the slamming of the front door  oh george youre not gone she wails it is but the voice of despair as a matter of fact she knows he is gone she reaches the hall breathless  he might have waited a minute she mutters to herself as she picks up the hats there were so many things i wanted him to do  she does not open the door and attempt to stop him she knows he is already halfway down the street it is a mean paltry way of going out she thinks so like a man  when a woman on the other hand goes out people know about it she does not sneak out she says she is going out she says it generally on the afternoon of the day before and she repeats it at intervals until teatime at tea she suddenly decides that she wont that she will leave it till the day after tomorrow instead an hour later she thinks she will go tomorrow after all and makes arrangements to wash her hair overnight for the next hour or so she alternates between fits of exaltation during which she looks forward to going out and moments of despondency when a sense of foreboding falls upon her at dinner she persuades some other woman to go with her the other woman once persuaded is enthusiastic about going until she recollects that she cannot the first woman however convinces her that she can  yes replies the second woman but then how about you dear you are forgetting the joneses  so i was answers the first woman completely nonplussed how very awkward and i cant go on wednesday i shall have to leave it till thursday now  but i cant go thursday says the second woman  well you go without me dear says the first woman in the tone of one who is sacrificing a lifes ambition  oh no dear i should not think of it nobly exclaims the second woman we will wait and go together friday  ill tell you what well do says the first woman we will start early this is an inspiration and be back before the joneses arrive  they agree to sleep together there is a lurking suspicion in both their minds that this may be their last sleep on earth they retire early with a can of hot water at intervals during the night one overhears them splashing water and talking  they come down very late for breakfast and both very cross each seems to have argued herself into the belief that she has been lured into this piece of nonsense against her better judgment by the persistent folly of the other one during the meal each one asks the other every five minutes if she is quite ready each one it appears has only her hat to put on they talk about the weather and wonder what it is going to do they wish it would make up its mind one way or the other they are very bitter on weather that cannot make up its mind after breakfast it still looks cloudy and they decide to abandon the scheme altogether the first woman then remembers that it is absolutely necessary for her at all events to go  but there is no need for you to come dear she says  up to that point the second woman was evidently not sure whether she wished to go or whether she didnt now she knows  oh yes ill come she says then it will be over  i am sure you dont want to go urges the first woman and i shall be quicker by myself i am ready to start now  the second woman bridles  i shant be a couple of minutes she retorts you know dear its generally i who have to wait for you  but youve not got your boots on the first woman reminds her  well they wont take any time is the answer but of course dear if youd really rather i did not come say so by this time she is on the verge of tears  of course i would like you to come dear explains the first in a resigned tone i thought perhaps you were only coming to please me  oh no id like to come says the second woman  well we must hurry up says the first i shant be more than a minute myself ive merely got to change my skirt  halfanhour later you hear them calling to each other from different parts of the house to know if the other one is ready it appears they have both been ready for quite a long while waiting only for the other one  im afraid calls out the one whose turn it is to be downstairs its going to rain  oh dont say that calls back the other one  well it looks very like it  what a nuisance answers the upstairs woman shall we put it off  well what do you think dear replies the downstairs  they decide they will go only now they will have to change their boots and put on different hats  for the next ten minutes they are still shouting and running about then it seems as if they really were ready nothing remaining but for them to say goodbye and go  they begin by kissing the children a woman never leaves her house without secret misgivings that she will never return to it alive one child cannot be found when it is found it wishes it hadnt been it has to be washed preparatory to being kissed after that the dog has to be found and kissed and final instructions given to the cook  then they open the front door  oh george calls out the first woman turning round again are you there  hullo answers a voice from the distance do you want me  no dear only to say goodbye im going  oh goodbye  goodbye dear do you think its going to rain  oh no i should not say so  george  yes  have you got any money  five minutes later they come running back the one has forgotten her parasol the other her purse  and speaking of purses reminds one of another essential difference between the male and female human animal a man carries his money in his pocket when he wants to use it he takes it out and lays it down this is a crude way of doing things a woman displays more subtlety say she is standing in the street and wants fourpence to pay for a bunch of violets she has purchased from a flowergirl she has two parcels in one hand and a parasol in the other with the remaining two fingers of the left hand she secures the violets the question then arises how to pay the girl she flutters for a few minutes evidently not quite understanding why it is she cannot do it the reason then occurs to her she has only two hands and both these are occupied first she thinks she will put the parcels and the flowers into her right hand then she thinks she will put the parasol into her left then she looks round for a table or even a chair but there is not such a thing in the whole street her difficulty is solved by her dropping the parcels and the flowers the girl picks them up for her and holds them this enables her to feel for her pocket with her right hand while waving her open parasol about with her left she knocks an old gentlemans hat off into the gutter and nearly blinds the flowergirl before it occurs to her to close it this done she leans it up against the flowergirls basket and sets to work in earnest with both hands she seizes herself firmly by the back and turns the upper part of her body round till her hair is in front and her eyes behind still holding herself firmly with her left handdid she let herself go goodness knows where she would spin towith her right she prospects herself the purse is there she can feel it the problem is how to get at it the quickest way would of course be to take off the skirt sit down on the kerb turn it inside out and work from the bottom of the pocket upwards but this simple idea never seems to occur to her there are some thirty folds at the back of the dress between two of these folds commences the secret passage at last purely by chance she suddenly discovers it nearly upsetting herself in the process and the purse is brought up to the surface the difficulty of opening it still remains she knows it opens with a spring but the secret of that spring she has never mastered and she never will her plan is to worry it generally until it does open five minutes will always do it provided she is not flustered  at last it does open it would be incorrect to say that she opens it it opens because it is sick of being mauled about and as likely as not it opens at the moment when she is holding it upside down if you happen to be near enough to look over her shoulder you will notice that the gold and silver lies loose within it in an inner sanctuary carefully secured with a second secret spring she keeps her coppers together with a postagestamp and a drapers receipt nine months old for elevenpence threefarthings  i remember the indignation of an old busconductor once inside we were nine women and two men i sat next the door and his remarks therefore he addressed to me it was certainly taking him some time to collect the fares but i think he would have got on better had he been less bustling he worried them and made them nervous  look at that he said drawing my attention to a poor lady opposite who was diving in the customary manner for her purse they sit on their money women do blest if you wouldnt think they was trying to atch it  at length the lady drew from underneath herself an exceedingly fat purse  fancy riding in a bumpby bus perched up on that thing he continued think what a stamina they must have he grew confidential ive seen one woman he said pull out from underneath er a street doorkey a tin box of lozengers a pencilcase a whopping big purse a packet of hairpins and a smellingbottle why you or me would be wretched sitting on a plain doorknob and them women goes about like that all day i suppose they gets used to it drop em on an eiderdown pillow and theyd scream the time it takes me to get tuppence out of them why its eartbreaking first they tries one side then they tries the other then they gets up and shakes theirselves till the bus jerks them back again and there they are a more opeless eap than ever if i ad my way id make every bus carry a female searcher as could overaul em one at a time and take the money from em talk about the poor pickpocket what i say is that a man as finds his way into a womans pocketwell he deserves what he gets  but it was the thought of more serious matters that lured me into reflections concerning the overcarefulness of women it is a theory of minewrong possibly indeed i have so been informedthat we pick our way through life with too much care we are for ever looking down upon the ground maybe we do avoid a stumble or two over a stone or a brier but also we miss the blue of the sky the glory of the hills these books that good men write telling us that what they call success in life depends on our flinging aside our youth and wasting our manhood in order that we may have the means when we are eighty of spending a rollicking old age annoy me we save all our lives to invest in a south sea bubble and in skimping and scheming we have grown mean and narrow and hard we will put off the gathering of the roses till tomorrow today it shall be all work all bargaindriving all plotting lo when tomorrow comes the roses are blown nor do we care for roses idle things of small marketable value cabbages are more to our fancy by the time tomorrow comes  life is a thing to be lived not spent to be faced not ordered life is not a game of chess the victory to the most knowing it is a game of cards ones hand by skill to be made the best of is it the wisest who is always the most successful i think not the luckiest whistplayer i ever came across was a man who was never quite certain what were trumps and whose most frequent observation during the game was i really beg your pardon addressed to his partner a remark which generally elicited the reply oh dont apologize alls well that ends well the man i knew who made the most rapid fortune was a builder in the outskirts of birmingham who could not write his name and who for thirty years of his life never went to bed sober i do not say that forgetfulness of trumps should be cultivated by whistplayers i think my builder friend might have been even more successful had he learned to write his name and had he occasionallynot overdoing itenjoyed a sober evening all i wish to impress is that virtue is not the road to successof the kind we are dealing with we must find other reasons for being virtuous maybe there are some the truth is life is a gamble pure and simple and the rules we lay down for success are akin to the infallible systems with which a certain class of idiot goes armed each season to monte carlo we can play the game with coolness and judgment decide when to plunge and when to stake small but to think that wisdom will decide it is to imagine that we have discovered the law of chance let us play the game of life as sportsmen pocketing our winnings with a smile leaving our losings with a shrug perhaps that is why we have been summoned to the board and the cards dealt round that we may learn some of the virtues of the good gambler his selfcontrol his courage under misfortune his modesty under the strain of success his firmness his alertness his general indifference to fate good lessons these all of them if by the game we learn some of them our time on the green earth has not been wasted if we rise from the table having learned only fretfulness and selfpity i fear it has been  the grim hall porter taps at the door number five hundred billion and twentyeight your boatman is waiting sir  so is it time already we pick up our counters of what use are they in the country the other side of the river they are no tender the bloodred for gold and the palegreen for love to whom shall we fling them here is some poor beggar longing to play let us give them to him as we pass out poor devil the game will amuse himfor a while  keep your powder dry and trust in providence is the motto of the wise wet powder could never be of any possible use to you dry it may be with the help of providence we will call it providence it is a prettier name than chanceperhaps also a truer  another mistake we make when we reason out our lives is this we reason as though we were planning for reasonable creatures it is a big mistake wellmeaning ladies and gentlemen make it when they picture their ideal worlds when marriage is reformed and the social problem solved when poverty and war have been abolished by acclamation and sin and sorrow rescinded by an overwhelming parliamentary majority ah then the world will be worthy of our living in it you need not wait ladies and gentlemen so long as you think for that time no social revolution is needed no slow education of the people is necessary it would all come about tomorrow if only we were reasonable creatures  imagine a world of reasonable beings the ten commandments would be unnecessary no reasoning being sins no reasoning creature makes mistakes there would be no rich men for what reasonable man cares for luxury and ostentation there would be no poor that i should eat enough for two while my brother in the next street as good a man as i starves is not reasonable there would be no difference of opinion on any two points there is only one reason you dear reader would find that on all subjects you were of the same opinion as i no novels would be written no plays performed the lives of reasonable creatures do not afford drama no mad loves no mad laughter no scalding tears no fierce unreasoning brieflived joys no sorrows no wild dreamsonly reason reason everywhere  but for the present we remain unreasonable if i eat this mayonnaise drink this champagne i shall suffer in my liver then why do i eat it julia is a charming girl amiable wise and witty also she has a share in a brewery then why does john marry ann who is shorttempered to say the least of it who he feels will not make him so good a housewife who has extravagant notions who has no little fortune there is something about anns chin that fascinates himhe could not explain to you what on the whole julia is the betterlooking of the two but the more he thinks of julia the more he is drawn towards ann so tom marries julia and the brewery fails and julia on a holiday contracts rheumatic fever and is a helpless invalid for life while ann comes in for ten thousand pounds left to her by an australian uncle no one had ever heard of  i have been told of a young man who chose his wife with excellent care said he to himself very wisely in the selection of a wife a man cannot be too circumspect he convinced himself that the girl was everything a helpmate should be she had every virtue that could be expected in a woman no faults but such as are inseparable from a woman speaking practically she was perfection he married her and found she was all he had thought her only one thing could he urge against herthat he did not like her and that of course was not her fault  how easy life would be did we know ourselves could we always be sure that tomorrow we should think as we do today we fall in love during a summer holiday she is fresh delightful altogether charming the blood rushes to our head every time we think of her our ideal career is one of perpetual service at her feet it seems impossible that fate could bestow upon us any greater happiness than the privilege of cleaning her boots and kissing the hem of her garmentif the hem be a little muddy that will please us the more we tell her our ambition and at that moment every word we utter is sincere but the summer holiday passes and with it the holiday mood and winter finds us wondering how we are going to get out of the difficulty into which we have landed ourselves or worse still perhaps the mood lasts longer than is usual we become formally engaged we marryi wonder how many marriages are the result of a passion that is burnt out before the altarrails are reachedand three months afterwards the little lass is brokenhearted to find that we consider the lacing of her boots a bore her feet seem to have grown bigger there is no excuse for us save that we are silly children never sure of what we are crying for hurting one another in our play crying very loudly when hurt ourselves  i knew an american lady once who used to bore me with long accounts of the brutalities exercised upon her by her husband she had instituted divorce proceedings against him the trial came on and she was highly successful we all congratulated her and then for some months she dropped out of my life but there came a day when we again found ourselves together one of the problems of social life is to know what to say to one another when we meet every man and womans desire is to appear sympathetic and clever and this makes conversation difficult because taking us all round we are neither sympathetic nor cleverbut this by the way  of course i began to talk to her about her former husband i asked her how he was getting on she replied that she thought he was very comfortable  married again i suggested  yes she answered  serve him right i exclaimed and his wife too she was a pretty brighteyed little woman my american friend and i wished to ingratiate myself a woman who would marry such a man knowing what she must have known of him is sure to make him wretched and we may trust him to be a curse to her  my friend seemed inclined to defend him  i think he is greatly improved she argued  nonsense i returned a man never improves once a villain always a villain  oh hush she pleaded you mustnt call him that  why not i answered i have heard you call him a villain yourself  it was wrong of me she said flushing im afraid he was not the only one to be blamed we were both foolish in those days but i think we have both learned a lesson  i remained silent waiting for the necessary explanation  you had better come and see him for yourself she added with a little laugh to tell the truth i am the woman who has married him tuesday is my day number 2 k mansions and she ran off leaving me staring after her  i believe an enterprising clergyman who would set up a little church in the strand just outside the law courts might do quite a trade remarrying couples who had just been divorced a friend of mine a respondent told me he had never loved his wife more than on two occasionsthe first when she refused him the second when she came into the witnessbox to give evidence against him  you are curious creatures you men remarked a lady once to another man in my presence you never seem to know your own mind  she was feeling annoyed with men generally i do not blame her i feel annoyed with them myself sometimes there is one man in particular i am always feeling intensely irritated against he says one thing and acts another he will talk like a saint and behave like a fool knows what is right and does what is wrong but we will not speak further of him he will be all he should be one day and then we will pack him into a nice comfortablylined box and screw the lid down tight upon him and put him away in a quiet little spot near a church i know of lest he should get up and misbehave himself again  the other man who is a wise man as men go looked at his fair critic with a smile  my dear madam he replied you are blaming the wrong person i confess i do not know my mind and what little i do know of it i do not like i did not make it i did not select it i am more dissatisfied with it than you can possibly be it is a greater mystery to me than it is to you and i have to live with it you should pity not blame me  there are moods in which i fall to envying those old hermits who frankly and with courageous cowardice shirked the problem of life there are days when i dream of an existence unfettered by the thousand petty strings with which our souls lie bound to lilliputia land i picture myself living in some norwegian sater high above the black waters of a rockbound fiord no other human creature disputes with me my kingdom i am alone with the whispering fir forests and the stars how i live i am not quite sure once a month i could journey down into the villages and return laden i should not need much for the rest my gun and fishingrod would supply me i would have with me a couple of big dogs who would talk to me with their eyes so full of dumb thought and together we would wander over the uplands seeking our dinner after the old primitive fashion of the men who dreamt not of tencourse dinners and savoy suppers i would cook the food myself and sit down to the meal with a bottle of good wine such as starts a mans thoughts for i am inconsistent as i acknowledge and that gift of civilization i would bear with me into my hermitage then in the evening with pipe in mouth beside my logwood fire i would sit and think until new knowledge came to me strengthened by those silent voices that are drowned in the roar of streetland i might perhaps grow into something nearer to what it was intended that a man should bemight catch a glimpse perhaps of the meaning of life  no no my dear lady into this life of renunciation i would not take a companion certainly not of the sex you are thinking of even would she care to come which i doubt there are times when a man is better without the woman when a woman is better without the man love drags us from the depths makes men and women of us but if we would climb a little nearer to the stars we must say goodbye to it we men and women do not show ourselves to each other at our best too often i fear at our worst the womans highest ideal of man is the lover to a man the woman is always the possible beloved we see each others hearts but not each others souls in each others presence we never shake ourselves free from the earth matchmaking mother nature is always at hand to prompt us a woman lifts us up into manhood but there she would have us stay climb up to me she cries to the lad walking with soiled feet in muddy ways be a true man that you may be worthy to walk by my side be brave to protect me kind and tender and true but climb no higher stay here by my side the martyr the prophet the leader of the worlds forlorn hopes she would wake from his dream her arms she would fling about his neck holding him down  to the woman the man says you are my wife here is your america within these walls here is your work your duty true in nine hundred and ninetynine cases out of every thousand but men and women are not made in moulds and the worlds work is various sometimes to her sorrow a womans work lies beyond the home the duty of mary was not to joseph  the hero in the popular novel is the young man who says i love you better than my soul our favourite heroine in fiction is the woman who cries to her lover i would go down into hell to be with you there are men and women who cannot answer thusthe men who dream dreams the women who see visionsimpracticable people from the bayswater point of view but bayswater would not be the abode of peace it is had it not been for such  have we not placed sexual love on a pedestal higher than it deserves it is a noble passion but it is not the noblest there is a wider love by the side of which it is but as the lamp illumining the cottage to the moonlight bathing the hills and valleys there were two women once this is a play i saw acted in the daylight they had been friends from girlhood till there came between them the usual troublea man a weak pretty creature not worth a thought from either of them but women love the unworthy there would be no overpopulation problem did they not and this poor specimen illluck had ordained they should contend for  their rivalry brought out all that was worst in both of them it is a mistake to suppose love only elevates it can debase it was a mean struggle for what to an onlooker must have appeared a remarkably unsatisfying prize the loser might well have left the conqueror to her poor triumph even granting it had been gained unfairly but the old ugly primeval passions had been stirred in these women and the weddingbells closed only the first act  the second is not difficult to guess it would have ended in the divorce court had not the deserted wife felt that a finer revenge would be secured to her by silence  in the third after an interval of only eighteen months the man diedthe first piece of good fortune that seems to have occurred to him personally throughout the play his position must have been an exceedingly anxious one from the beginning notwithstanding his flabbiness one cannot but regard him with a certain amount of pitynot unmixed with amusement most of lifes dramas can be viewed as either farce or tragedy according to the whim of the spectator the actors invariably play them as tragedy but then that is the essence of good farce acting  thus was secured the triumph of legal virtue and the punishment of irregularity and the play might be dismissed as uninterestingly orthodox were it not for the fourth act showing how the wronged wife came to the woman she had once wronged to ask and grant forgiveness strangely as it may sound they found their love for one another unchanged they had been long parted it was sweet to hold each others hands again two lonely women they agreed to live together those who knew them well in this later time say that their life was very beautiful filled with graciousness and nobility  i do not say that such a story could ever be common but it is more probable than the world might credit sometimes the man is better without the woman the woman without the man     on the nobility of ourselves  an old anglicized frenchman i used to meet often in my earlier journalistic days held a theory concerning mans future state that has since come to afford me more food for reflection than at the time i should have deemed possible he was a brighteyed eager little man one felt no lotus land could be paradise to him we build our heaven of the stones of our desires to the old redbearded norseman a foe to fight and a cup to drain to the artistic greek a grove of animated statuary to the red indian his happy hunting ground to the turk his harem to the jew his new jerusalem paved with gold to others according to their taste limited by the range of their imagination  few things had more terrors for me when a child than heavenas pictured for me by certain of the good folks round about me i was told that if i were a good lad kept my hair tidy and did not tease the cat i would probably when i died go to a place where all day long i would sit still and sing hymns think of it as reward to a healthy boy for being good there would be no breakfast and no dinner no tea and no supper one old lady cheered me a little with a hint that the monotony might be broken by a little manna but the idea of everlasting manna palled upon me and my suggestions concerning the possibilities of sherbet or jumbles were scouted as irreverent there would be no school but also there would be no cricket and no rounders i should feel no desire so i was assured to do another angels dags by sliding down the heavenly banisters my only joy would be to sing  shall we start singing the moment we get up in the morning i asked  there wont be any morning was the answer there will be no day and no night it will all be one long day without end  and shall we always be singing i persisted  yes you will be so happy you will always want to sing  shant i ever get tired  no you will never get tired and you will never get sleepy or hungry or thirsty  and does it go on like that for ever  yes for ever and ever  will it go on for a million years  yes a million years and then another million years and then another million years after that there will never be any end to it  i can remember to this day the agony of those nights when i would lie awake thinking of this endless heaven from which there seemed to be no possible escape for the other place was equally eternal or i might have been tempted to seek refuge there  we grownup folk our brains dulled by the slowly acquired habit of not thinking do wrong to torture children with these awful themes eternity heaven hell are meaningless words to us we repeat them as we gabble our prayers telling our smug selfsatisfied selves that we are miserable sinners but to the child the intelligent stranger in the land seeking to know they are fearful realities if you doubt me reader stand by yourself beneath the stars one night and solve this thought eternity your next address shall be the county lunatic asylum  my actively inclined french friend held cheerier views than are common of mans life beyond the grave his belief was that we were destined to constant change to everlasting work we were to pass through the older planets to labour in the greater suns  but for such advanced career a more capable being was needed no one of us was sufficient he argued to be granted a future existence all to himself his idea was that two or three or four of us according to our intrinsic value would be combined to make a new and more important individuality fitted for a higher existence man he pointed out was already a collection of the beasts you and i he would say tapping first my chest and then his own we have them all herethe ape the tiger the pig the motherly hen the gamecock the good ant we are all rolled into one so the man of the future he will be made up of many menthe courage of one the wisdom of another the kindliness of a third  take a city man he would continue say the lord mayor add to him a poet say swinburne mix them with a religious enthusiast say general booth there you will have the man fit for the higher life  garibaldi and bismarck he held should make a very fine mixture correcting one another if needful extract of ibsen might be added as seasoning he thought that irish politicians would mix admirably with scotch divines that oxford dons would go well with lady novelists he was convinced that count tolstoi a few gaiety johnnies we called them mashers in those days together with a humouristhe was kind enough to suggest myselfwould produce something very choice queen elizabeth he fancied was probably being reserved to golet us hope in the long distant futurewith ouida it sounds a whimsical theory set down here in my words not his but the old fellow was so much in earnest that few of us ever thought to laugh as he talked indeed there were moments on starry nights as walking home from the office we would pause on waterloo bridge to enjoy the witchery of the long line of the embankment lights when i could almost believe as i listened to him in the not impossibility of his dreams  even as regards this world it would often be a gain one thinks and no loss if some halfdozen of us were rolled together or boiled down or whatever the process necessary might be and something made out of us in that way  have not you my fair reader sometimes thought to yourself what a delightful husband tom this plus harry that plus dick the other would make tom is always so cheerful and goodtempered yet you feel that in the serious moments of life he would be lacking a delightful hubby when you felt merry yes but you would not go to him for comfort and strength in your troubles now would you no in your hour of sorrow how good it would be to have near you grave earnest harry he is a good sort harry perhaps after all he is the best of the threesolid staunch and true what a pity he is just a trifle commonplace and unambitious your friends not knowing his sterling hidden qualities would hardly envy you and a husband that no other girl envies youwell that would hardly be satisfactory would it dick on the other hand is clever and brilliant he will make his way there will come a day you are convinced when a woman will be proud to bear his name if only he were not so selfcentred if only he were more sympathetic  but a combination of the three or rather of the best qualities of the threetoms good temper harrys tender strength dicks brilliant masterfulness that is the man who would be worthy of you  the woman david copperfield wanted was agnes and dora rolled into one he had to take them one after the other which was not so nice and did he really love agnes mr dickens or merely feel he ought to forgive me but i am doubtful concerning that second marriage of copperfields come strictly between ourselves mr dickens was not david good human soul now and again a wee bit bored by the immaculate agnes she made him an excellent wife i am sure she never ordered oysters by the barrel unopened it would on any day have been safe to ask traddles home to dinner in fact sophie and the whole rosegarden might have accompanied him agnes would have been equal to the occasion the dinner would have been perfectly cooked and served and agnes sweet smile would have pervaded the meal but after the dinner when david and traddles sat smoking alone while from the drawingroom drifted down the notes of highclass elevating music played by the saintly agnes did they never glancing covertly towards the empty chair between them see the laughing curlframed face of a very foolish little womanone of those foolish little women that a wise man thanks god for makingand wish in spite of all that it were flesh and blood not shadow  oh you foolish wise folk who would remodel human nature cannot you see how great is the work given unto childish hands think you that in wellordered housekeeping and highclass conversation lies the whole making of a man foolish dora fashioned by clever old magician nature who knows that weakness and helplessness are as a talisman calling forth strength and tenderness in man trouble yourself not unduly about those oysters nor the underdone mutton little woman good plain cooks at twenty pounds a year will see to these things for us and now and then when a windfall comes our way we will dine together at a moderatepriced restaurant where these things are managed even better your work dear is to teach us gentleness and kindliness lay your curls here child it is from such as you that we learn wisdom foolish wise folk sneer at you foolish wise folk would pull up the useless lilies the needless roses from the garden would plant in their places only serviceable wholesome cabbage but the gardener knowing better plants the silly shortlived flowers foolish wise folk asking for what purpose  as for agnes mr dickens do you know what she always makes me think of you will not mind my sayingthe woman one reads about frankly i dont believe in her i do not refer to agnes in particular but the woman of whom she is a type the faultless woman we read of women have many faults but thank god they have one redeeming virtuethey are none of them faultless  but the heroine of fiction oh a terrible dragon of virtue is she may heaven preserve us poor men undeserving though we be from a life with the heroine of fiction she is all soul and heart and intellect with never a bit of human nature to catch hold of her by her beauty it appals one it is so painfully indescribable whence comes she whither goes she why do we never meet her like of women i know a goodish few and i look among them for her prototype but i find it not they are charming they are beautiful all these women that i know it would not be right for me to tell you ladies the esteem and veneration with which i regard you all you yourselves blushing would be the first to cheek my ardour but yet dear ladies seen even through my eyes you come not near the ladies that i read about you are notif i may be permitted an expressive vulgarismin the same street with them your beauty i can look upon and retain my reasonfor whatever value that may be to me your conversation i admit is clever and brilliant in the extreme your knowledge vast and various your culture quite bostonian yet you do noti hardly know how to express ityou do not shine with the sixteen fullmoonpower of the heroine of fiction you do notand i thank you for itimpress me with the idea that you are the only women on earth you even you possess tempers of your own i am inclined to think you take an interest in your clothes i would not be sure even that you do not mingle a little of your own hair you know what i mean with the hair of your head there is in your temperament a vein of vanity a suggestion of selfishness a spice of laziness i have known you a trifle unreasonable a little inconsiderate slightly exacting unlike the heroine of fiction you have a certain number of human appetites and instincts a few human follies perhaps a human fault or shall we say two in short dear ladies you also even as we men are the children of adam and eve tell me if you know where i may meet with this supernatural sister of yours this woman that one reads about she never keeps any one waiting while she does her back hair she is never indignant with everybody else in the house because she cannot find her own boots she never scolds the servants she is never cross with the children she never slams the door she is never jealous of her younger sister she never lingers at the gate with any cousin but the right one  dear me where do they keep them these women that one reads about i suppose where they keep the pretty girl of art you have seen her have you not reader the pretty girl in the picture she leaps the sixbarred gate with a yard and a half to spare turning round in her saddle the while to make some smiling remark to the comic man behind who of course is standing on his head in the ditch she floats gracefully off dieppe on stormy mornings her baigneusegenerally of chiffon and old point lacehas not lost a curve the older ladies bathing round her look wet their dress clings damply to their limbs but the pretty girl of art dives and never a curl of her hair is disarranged the pretty girl of art stands lightly on tiptoe and volleys a tennisball six feet above her head the pretty girl of art keeps the head of the punt straight against a stiff current and a strong wind she never gets the water up her sleeve and down her back and all over the cushions her pole never sticks in the mud with the steam launch ten yards off and the man looking the other way the pretty girl of art skates in highheeled french shoes at an angle of fortyfive to the surface of the ice both hands in her muff she never sits down plump with her feet a yard apart and says ough the pretty girl of art drives tandem down piccadilly during the height of the season at eighteen miles an hour it never occurs to her leader that the time has now arrived for him to turn round and get into the cart the pretty girl of art rides her bicycle through the town on market day carrying a basket of eggs and smiling right and left she never throws away both her handles and runs into a cow the pretty girl of art goes trout fishing in openwork stockings under a blazing sun with a bunch of dewbespangled primroses in her hair and every time she gracefully flicks her rod she hauls out a salmon she never ties herself up to a tree or hooks the dog she never comes home soaked and disagreeable to tell you that she caught six but put them all back again because they were merely two or threepounders and not worth the trouble of carrying the pretty girl of art plays croquet with one hand and looks as if she enjoyed the game she never tries to accidentally kick her ball into position when nobody is noticing or stands it out that she is through a hoop that she knows she isnt  she is a good allround sportswoman is the pretty girl in the picture the only thing i have to say against her is that she makes one dissatisfied with the girl out of the picturethe girl who mistakes a punt for a teetotum so that you land feeling as if you had had a day in the bay of biscay and who every now and again stuns you with the thick end of the pole the girl who does not skate with her hands in her muff but who throwing them up to heaven says im going and who goes taking care that you go with her the girl who as you brush her down and try to comfort her explains to you indignantly that the horse took the corner too sharply and never noticed the milestone the girl whose hair sea water does not improve  there can be no doubt about it that is where they keep the good woman of fiction where they keep the pretty girl of art  does it not occur to you messieurs les auteurs that you are sadly disturbing us these women that are a combination of venus st cecilia and elizabeth fry you paint them for us in your glowing pages it is not kind of you knowing as you must the women we have to put up with  would we not be happier we men and women were we to idealize one another less my dear young lady you have nothing whatever to complain to fate about i assure you unclasp those pretty hands of yours and come away from the darkening window jack is as good a fellow as you deserve dont yearn so much sir galahad my dearsir galahad rides and fights in the land that lies beyond the sunset far enough away from this noisy little earth where you and i spend much of our time tittletattling flirting wearing fine clothes and going to shows and besides you must remember sir galahad was a bachelor as an idealist he was wise your jack is by no means a bad sort of knight as knights go nowadays in this unidyllic world there is much solid honesty about him and he does not pose he is not exceptional i grant you but my dear have you ever tried the exceptional man yes he is very nice in a drawingroom and it is interesting to read about him in the society papers you will find most of his good qualities there take my advice dont look into him too closely you be content with jack and thank heaven he is no worse we are not saints we mennone of us and our beautiful thoughts i fear we write in poetry not action the white knight my dear young lady with his pure soul his heroic heart his lifes devotion to a noble endeavour does not live down here to any great extent they have tried it one or two of them and the worldyou and i the world is made up of you and ihas generally starved and hooted them there are not many of them left now do you think you would care to be the wife of one supposing one were to be found for you would you care to live with him in two furnished rooms in clerkenwell die with him on a chair bedstead a century hence they will put up a statue to him and you may be honoured as the wife who shared with him his sufferings do you think you are woman enough for that if not thank your stars you have secured for your own exclusive use one of us unexceptional men who knows no better than to admire you you are not exceptional  and in us ordinary men there is some good it wants finding that is all we are not so commonplace as you think us even your jack fond of his dinner his conversation fourcornered by the sporting pressyes i agree he is not interesting as he sits snoring in the easychair but believe it or not there are the makings of a great hero in jack if fate would but be kinder to him and shake him out of his ease  dr jekyll contained beneath his ample waistcoat not two egos but threenot only hyde but another a greater than jekylla man as near to the angels as hyde was to the demons these wellfed city men these gaiety johnnies these ploughboys apothecaries thieves within each one lies hidden the hero did fate the sculptor choose to use his chisel that little drab we have noticed now and then our way taking us often past the end of the court there was nothing by which to distinguish her she was not overclean could use coarse language on occasionjust the spawn of the streets take care lest the cloak of our child should brush her  one morning the district coroner not generally speaking a poet himself but an adept at discovering poetry buried under unlikely rubbishheaps tells us more about her she earned six shillings a week and upon it supported a bedridden mother and three younger children she was housewife nurse mother breadwinner rolled into one yes there are heroines out of fiction  so loutish tom has won the victoria crossdashed out under a storm of bullets and rescued the riddled flag who would have thought it of loutish tom the village alehouse one always deemed the goal of his endeavours chance comes to tom and we find him out to harry the fates were less kind a neerdowell was harrydrank knocked his wife about they say bury him we are well rid of him he was good for nothing are we sure  let us acknowledge we are sinners we know those of us who dare to examine ourselves that we are capable of every meanness of every wrong under the sun it is by the accident of circumstance aided by the helpful watchfulness of the policeman that our possibilities of crime are known only to ourselves but having acknowledged our evil let us also acknowledge that we are capable of greatness the martyrs who faced death and torture unflinchingly for conscience sake were men and women like ourselves they had their wrong side before the small trials of daily life they no doubt fell as we fall by no means were they the pick of humanity thieves many of them had been and murderers evillivers and evildoers but the nobility was there also lying dormant and their day came among them must have been men who had cheated their neighbours over the counter men who had been cruel to their wives and children selfish scandalmongering women in easier times their virtue might never have been known to any but their maker  in every age and in every period when and where fate has called upon men and women to play the man human nature has not been found wanting they were a poor lot those french aristocrats that the terror seized cowardly selfish greedy had been their lives yet there must have been good even in them when the little things that in their little lives they had thought so great were swept away from them when they found themselves face to face with the realities then even they played the man poor shuffling charles the first crusted over with weakness and folly deep down in him at last we find the great gentleman  i like to hear stories of the littleness of great men i like to think that shakespeare was fond of his glass i even cling to the tale of that disgraceful final orgie with friend ben jonson possibly the story may not be true but i hope it was i like to think of him as poacher as village neerdowell denounced by the local grammarschool master preached at by the local j p of the period i like to reflect that cromwell had a wart on his nose the thought makes me more contented with my own features i like to think that he put sweets upon the chairs to see finelydressed ladies spoil their frocks to tell myself that he roared with laughter at the silly jest like any east end arry with his bank holiday squirt of dirty water i like to read that carlyle threw bacon at his wife and occasionally made himself highly ridiculous over small annoyances that would have been smiled at by a man of wellbalanced mind i think of the fifty foolish things a week i do and say to myself i too am a literary man  i like to think that even judas had his moments of nobility his good hours when he would willingly have laid down his life for his master perhaps even to him there came before the journeys end the memory of a voice sayingthy sins be forgiven thee there must have been good even in judas  virtue lies like the gold in quartz there is not very much of it and much pains has to be spent on the extracting of it but nature seems to think it worth her while to fashion these huge useless stones if in them she may hide away her precious metals perhaps also in human nature she cares little for the mass of dross provided that by crushing and cleansing she can extract from it a little gold sufficient to repay her for the labour of the world we wonder why she troubles to make the stone why cannot the gold lie in nuggets on the surface but her methods are secrets to us perchance there is a reason for the quartz perchance there is a reason for the evil and folly through which run unseen to the careless eye the tiny veins of virtue  aye the stone predominates but the gold is there we claim to have it valued the evil that there is in man no tongue can tell we are vile among the vile a little evil people but we are great pile up the bricks of our sins till the tower knocks at heavens gate calling for vengeance yet we are greatwith a greatness and a virtue that the untempted angels may not reach to the written history of the human race it is one long record of cruelty of falsehood of oppression think you the world would be spinning round the sun unto this day if that written record were all sodom god would have spared had there been found ten righteous men within its walls the world is saved by its just men history sees them not she is but the newspaper a report of accidents judge you life by that then you shall believe that the true temple of hymen is the divorce court that men are of two classes only the thief and the policeman that all noble thought is but a politicians catchword history sees only the destroying conflagrations she takes no thought of the sweet firesides history notes the wrong but the patient suffering the heroic endeavour that slowly and silently as the soft processes of nature reclothing with verdure the passionwasted land obliterate that wrong she has no eyes for in the days of cruelty and oppressionnot altogether yet of the past one fearsmust have lived gentlehearted men and women healing with their help and sympathy the wounds that else the world had died of after the thief riding with jingle of sword and spur comes mounted on his ass the good samaritan the pyramid of the worlds evilgod help us it rises high shutting out almost the sun but the record of mans good deeds it lies written in the laughter of the children in the light of lovers eyes in the dreams of the young men it shall not be forgotten the fires of persecution served as torches to show heaven the heroism that was in man from the soil of tyranny sprang selfsacrifice and daring for the right cruelty what is it but the vile manure making the ground ready for the flowers of tenderness and pity hate and anger shriek to one another across the ages but the voices of love and comfort are none the less existent that they speak in whispers lips to ear  we have done wrong oh ye witnessing heavens but we have done good we claim justice we have laid down our lives for our friends greater love hath no man than this we have fought for the right we have died for the truthas the truth seemed to us we have done noble deeds we have lived noble lives we have comforted the sorrowful we have succoured the weak failing falling making in our blindness many a false step yet we have striven for the sake of the army of just men and true for the sake of the myriads of patient loving women for the sake of the pitiful and helpful for the sake of the good that lies hidden within usspare us o lord     on the motherliness of man  it was only a piece of broken glass from its shape and colour i should say it had in its happier days formed portion of a cheap scentbottle lying isolated on the grass shone upon by the early morning sun it certainly appeared at its best it attracted him  he cocked his head and looked at it with his right eye then he hopped round to the other side and looked at it with his left eye with either optic it seemed equally desirable  that he was an inexperienced young rook goes without saying an older bird would not have given a second glance to the thing indeed one would have thought his own instinct might have told him that broken glass would be a mistake in a birds nest but its glitter drew him too strongly for resistance i am inclined to suspect that at some time during the growth of his family tree there must have occurred a mesalliance perhaps worse possibly a strain of magpie bloodone knows the character of magpies or rather their lack of characterand such things have happened but i will not pursue further so painful a train i throw out the suggestion as a possible explanation that is all  he hopped nearer was it a sweet illusion this flashing fragment of rainbow a beautiful vision to fade upon approach typical of so much that is ununderstandable in rook life he made a dart forward and tapped it with his beak no it was realas fine a lump of jagged green glass as any newlymarried rook could desire and to be had for the taking she would be pleased with it he was a wellmeaning bird the mere upward inclination of his tail suggested earnest though possibly illdirected endeavour  he turned it over it was an awkward thing to carry it had so very many corners but he succeeded at last in getting it firmly between his beak and in haste lest some other bird should seek to dispute with him its possession at once flew off with it  a second rook who had been watching the proceedings from the lime tree called to a third who was passing even with my limited knowledge of the language i found it easy to follow the conversation it was so obvious  issachar  hallo  what do you think zebulans found a piece of broken bottle hes going to line his nest with it  no  gods truth look at him there he goes hes got it in his beak  well im   and they both burst into a laugh  but zebulan heeded them not if he overheard he probably put down the whole dialogue to jealousy he made straight for his tree by standing with my left cheek pressed close against the windowpane i was able to follow him he is building in what we call the paddock elmsa suburb commenced only last season but rapidly growing i wanted to see what his wife would say  at first she said nothing he laid it carefully down on the branch near the halffinished nest and she stretched up her head and looked at it  then she looked at him for about a minute neither spoke i could see that the situation was becoming strained when she did open her beak it was with a subdued tone that had a vein of weariness running through it  what is it she asked  he was evidently chilled by her manner as i have explained he is an inexperienced young rook this is clearly his first wife and he stands somewhat in awe of her  well i dont exactly know what its called he answered  oh  no but its pretty isnt it he added he moved it trying to get it where the sun might reach it it was evident he was admitting to himself that seen in the shade it lost much of its charm  oh yes very pretty was the rejoinder perhaps youll tell me what youre going to do with it  the question further discomforted him it was growing upon him that this thing was not going to be the success he had anticipated it would be necessary to proceed warily  of course its not a twig he began  i see it isnt  no you see the nest is nearly all twigs as it is and i thought  oh you did think  yes my dear i thoughtunless you are of opinion that its too showyi thought we might work it in somewhere  then she flared out  oh did you you thought that a good idea an a1 prize idiot i seem to have married i do youve been gone twenty minutes and you bring me back an eightcornered piece of broken glass which you think we might work into the nest youd like to see me sitting on it for a month you would you think it would make a nice bed for the children to lie on you dont think you could manage to find a packet of mixed pins if you went down again i suppose theyd look pretty worked in somewhere dont you thinkhere get out of my way ill finish this nest by myself she always had been short with him  she caught up the offending objectit was a fairly heavy lump of glassand flung it out of the tree with all her force i heard it crash through the cucumber frame that makes the seventh pane of glass broken in that cucumber frame this week the couple in the branch above are the worst their plan of building is the most extravagant the most absurd i ever heard of they hoist up ten times as much material as they can possibly use you might think they were going to build a block and let it out in flats to the other rooks then what they dont want they fling down again suppose we built on such a principle suppose a human husband and wife were to start erecting their house in piccadilly circus let us say and suppose the man spent all the day steadily carrying bricks up the ladder while his wife laid them never asking her how many she wanted whether she didnt think he had brought up sufficient but just accumulating bricks in a senseless fashion bringing up every brick he could find and then suppose when evening came and looking round they found they had some twenty cartloads of bricks lying unused upon the scaffold they were to commence flinging them down into waterloo place they would get themselves into trouble somebody would be sure to speak to them about it yet that is precisely what those birds do and nobody says a word to them they are supposed to have a president he lives by himself in the yew tree outside the morningroom window what i want to know is what he is supposed to be good for this is the sort of thing i want him to look into i would like him to be worming underneath one evening when those two birds are tidying up perhaps he would do something then i have done all i can i have thrown stones at them that in the course of nature have returned to earth again breaking more glass i have blazed at them with a revolver but they have come to regard this proceeding as a mere expression of lightheartedness on my part possibly confusing me with the arab of the desert who i am given to understand expresses himself thus in moments of deep emotion they merely retire to a safe distance to watch me no doubt regarding me as a poor performer inasmuch as i do not also dance and shout between each shot i have no objection to their building there if they only would build sensibly i want somebody to speak to them to whom they will pay attention  you can hear them in the evening discussing the matter of this surplus stock  dont you work any more he says as he comes up with the last load youll tire yourself  well i am feeling a bit done up she answers as she hops out of the nest and straightens her back  youre a bit peckish too i expect he adds sympathetically i know i am we will have a scratch down and be off  what about all this stuff she asks while titivating herself wed better not leave it about it looks so untidy  oh well soon get rid of that he answers ill have that down in a jiffy  to help him she seizes a stick and is about to drop it he darts forward and snatches it from her  dont you waste that one he cries thats a rare one that is you see me hit the old man with it  and he does what the gardener says i will leave you to imagine  judged from its structure the rook family is supposed to come next in intelligence to man himself judging from the intelligence displayed by members of certain human families with whom i have come in contact i can quite believe it that rooks talk i am positive no one can spend halfanhour watching a rookery without being convinced of this whether the talk be always wise and witty i am not prepared to maintain but that there is a good deal of it is certain a young french gentleman of my acquaintance who visited england to study the language told me that the impression made upon him by his first social evening in london was that of a parrothouse later on when he came to comprehend he of course recognized the brilliancy and depth of the average london drawingroom talk but that is how not comprehending it impressed him at first listening to the riot of a rookery is much the same experience the conversation to us sounds meaningless the rooks themselves would probably describe it as sparkling  there is a misanthrope i know who hardly ever goes into society i argued the question with him one day why should i he replied i know say a dozen men and women with whom intercourse is a pleasure they have ideas of their own which they are not afraid to voice to rub brains with such is a rare and goodly thing and i thank heaven for their friendship but they are sufficient for my leisure what more do i require what is this society of which you all make so much ado i have sampled it and i find it unsatisfying analyze it into its elements what is it some person i know very slightly who knows me very slightly asks me to what you call an at home the evening comes i have done my days work and i have dined i have been to a theatre or concert or i have spent a pleasant hour or so with a friend i am more inclined for bed than anything else but i pull myself together dress and drive to the house while i am taking off my hat and coat in the hall a man enters i met a few hours ago at the club he is a man i have very little opinion of and he probably takes a similar view of me our minds have no thought in common but as it is necessary to talk i tell him it is a warm evening perhaps it is a warm evening perhaps it isnt in either case he agrees with me i ask him if he is going to ascot i do not care a straw whether he is going to ascot or not he says he is not quite sure but asks me what chance passion flower has for the thousand guineas i know he doesnt value my opinion on the subject at a brass farthinghe would be a fool if he did but i cudgel my brains to reply to him as though he were going to stake his shirt on my advice we reach the first floor and are mutually glad to get rid of one another i catch my hostess eye she looks tired and worried she would be happier in bed only she doesnt know it she smiles sweetly but it is clear she has not the slightest idea who i am and is waiting to catch my name from the butler i whisper it to him perhaps he will get it right perhaps he wont it is quite immaterial they have asked two hundred and forty guests some seventyfive of whom they know by sight for the rest any chance passerby able as the theatrical advertisements say to dress and behave as a gentleman would do every bit as well indeed i sometimes wonder why people go to the trouble and expense of invitation cards at all a sandwichman outside the door would answer the purpose lady tompkins at home this afternoon from three to seven tea and music ladies and gentlemen admitted on presentation of visiting card afternoon dress indispensable the crowd is the thing wanted as for the items well tell me what is the difference from the society point of view between one man in a black frockcoat and another  i remember being once invited to a party at a house in lancaster gate i had met the woman at a picnic in the same green frock and parasol i might have recognized her the next time i saw her in any other clothes i did not expect to my cabman took me to the house opposite where they were also giving a party it made no difference to any of us the hostessi never learnt her namesaid it was very good of me to come and then shunted me off on to a colonial premier i did not catch his name and he did not catch mine which was not extraordinary seeing that my hostess did not know it who she whispered to me had come over from wherever it was she did not seem to be very sure principally to make my acquaintance half through the evening and by accident i discovered my mistake but judged it too late to say anything then i met a couple of people i knew had a little supper with them and came away the next afternoon i met my right hostessthe lady who should have been my hostess she thanked me effusively for having sacrificed the previous evening to her and her friends she said she knew how seldom i went out that made her feel my kindness all the more she told me that the brazilian ministers wife had told her that i was the cleverest man she had ever met i often think i should like to meet that man whoever he may be and thank him  but perhaps the butler does pronounce my name rightly and perhaps my hostess actually does recognize me she smiles and says she was so afraid i was not coming she implies that all the other guests are but as a feather in her scales of joy compared with myself i smile in return wondering to myself how i look when i do smile i have never had the courage to face my own smile in the lookingglass i notice the society smile of other men and it is not reassuring i murmur something about my not having been likely to forget this evening in my turn seeking to imply that i have been looking forward to it for weeks a few men shine at this sort of thing but they are a small percentage and without conceit i regard myself as no bigger a fool than the average male not knowing what else to say i tell her also that it is a warm evening she smiles archly as though there were some hidden witticism in the remark and i drift away feeling ashamed of myself to talk as an idiot when you are an idiot brings no discomfort to behave as an idiot when you have sufficient sense to know it is painful i hide myself in the crowd and perhaps ill meet a woman i was introduced to three weeks ago at a picture gallery we dont know each others names but both of us feeling lonesome we converse as it is called if she be the ordinary type of woman she asks me if i am going on to the johnsons i tell her no we stand silent for a moment both thinking what next to say she asks me if i was at the thompsons the day before yesterday i again tell her no i begin to feel dissatisfied with myself that i was not at the thompsons trying to get even with her i ask her if she is going to the browns next monday there are no browns she will have to say no she is not and her tone suggests that a social stigma rests upon the browns i ask her if she has been to barnums circus she hasnt but is going i give her my impressions of barnums circus which are precisely the impressions of everybody else who has seen the show  or if luck be against me she is possibly a smart woman that is to say her conversation is a running fire of spiteful remarks at the expense of every one she knows and of sneers at the expense of every one she doesnt i always feel i could make a better woman myself out of a bottle of vinegar and a pennorth of mixed pins yet it usually takes one about ten minutes to get away from her  even when by chance one meets a fleshandblood man or woman at such gatherings it is not the time or place for real conversation and as for the shadows what person in their senses would exhaust a single brain cell upon such i remember a discussion once concerning tennyson considered as a social item the dullest and most denselystupid bore i ever came across was telling how he had sat next to tennyson at dinner i found him a most uninteresting man so he confided to us he had nothing to say for himselfabsolutely nothing i should like to resuscitate dr samuel johnson for an evening and throw him into one of these at homes of yours  my friend is an admitted misanthrope as i have explained but one cannot dismiss him as altogether unjust that there is a certain mystery about societys craving for society must be admitted i stood one evening trying to force my way into the supper room of a house in berkeley square a lady hot and weary a few yards in front of me was struggling to the same goal  why remarked she to her companion why do we come to these places and fight like a bank holiday crowd for eighteenpennyworth of food  we come here replied the man whom i judged to be a philosopher to say weve been here  i met a the other evening and asked him to dine with me on monday i dont know why i ask a to dine with me but about once a month i do he is an uninteresting man  i cant he said ive got to go to the bs confounded nuisance it will be infernally dull  why go i asked  i really dont know he replied  a little later b met me and asked me to dine with him on monday  i cant i answered some friends are coming to us that evening its a duty dinner you know the sort of thing  i wish you could have managed it he said i shall have no one to talk to the as are coming and they bore me to death  why do you ask him i suggested  upon my word i really dont know he replied  but to return to our rooks we were speaking of their social instincts some dozen of themthe scallywags and bachelors of the community i judge them to behave started a club for a month past i have been trying to understand what the affair was now i know it is a club  and for their club house they have chosen of course the tree nearest my bedroom window i can guess how that came about it was my own fault i never thought of it about two months ago a single rooksuffering from indigestion or an unhappy marriage i know notchose this tree one night for purposes of reflection he woke me up i felt angry i opened the window and threw an empty sodawater bottle at him of course it did not hit him and finding nothing else to throw i shouted at him thinking to frighten him away he took no notice but went on talking to himself i shouted louder and woke up my own dog the dog barked furiously and woke up most things within a quarter of a mile i had to go down with a bootjackthe only thing i could find handyto soothe the dog two hours later i fell asleep from exhaustion i left the rook still cawing  the next night he came again i should say he was a bird with a sense of humour thinking this might happen i had however taken the precaution to have a few stones ready i opened the window wide and fired them one after another into the tree after i had closed the window he hopped down nearer and cawed louder than ever i think he wanted me to throw more stones at him he appeared to regard the whole proceeding as a game on the third night as i heard nothing of him i flattered myself that in spite of his bravado i had discouraged him i might have known rooks better  what happened when the club was being formed i take it was this  where shall we fix upon for our club house said the secretary all other points having been disposed of one suggested this tree another suggested that then up spoke this particular rook  ill tell you where said he in the yew tree opposite the porch and ill tell you for why just about an hour before dawn a man comes to the window over the porch dressed in the most comical costume you ever set eyes upon ill tell you what he reminds me ofthose little statues that men use for decorating fields he opens the window and throws a lot of things out upon the lawn and then he dances and sings its awfully interesting and you can see it all from the yew tree  that i am convinced is how the club came to fix upon the tree next my window i have had the satisfaction of denying them the exhibition they anticipated and i cheer myself with the hope that they have visited their disappointment upon their misleader  there is a difference between rook clubs and ours in our clubs the respectable members arrive early and leave at a reasonable hour in rook clubs it would appear this principle is reversed the mad hatter would have liked this clubit would have been a club after his own heart it opens at halfpast two in the morning and the first to arrive are the most disreputable members in rookland the rowdydowdy randydandy rollickyranky boys get up very early in the morning and go to bed in the afternoon towards dawn the older more orderly members drop in for reasonable talk and the club becomes more respectable the tree closes about six for the first two hours however the goingson are disgraceful the proceedings as often as not open with a fight if no two gentlemen can be found to oblige with a fight the next noisiest thing to fall back upon is held to be a song it is no satisfaction to me to be told that rooks cannot sing i know that without the trouble of referring to the natural history book it is the rook who does not know it he thinks he can and as a matter of fact he does you can criticize his singing you can call it what you like but you cant stop itat least that is my experience the song selected is sure to be one with a chorus towards the end it becomes mainly chorus unless the soloist be an extra powerful bird determined to insist upon his rights  the president knows nothing of this club he gets up himself about seventhree hours after all the others have finished breakfastand then fusses round under the impression that he is waking up the colony the fatheaded old fool he is the poorest thing in presidents i have ever heard of a south american republic would supply a better article the rooks themselves the married majority fathers of families respectable nestholders are as indignant as i am i hear complaints from all quarters  reflection comes to one as towards the close of these chill afternoons in early spring one leans upon the paddock gate watching the noisy bustling in the bare elms  so the earth is growing green again and love is come again unto the hearts of us old sobercoated fellows oh madam your feathers gleam wondrous black and your bonnie bright eye stabs deep come sit by our side and well tell you a tale such as rook never told before its the tale of a nest in a topmost bough that sways in the good west wind its strong without but its soft within where the little green eggs lie safe and there sits in that nest a lady sweet and she caws with joy for afar she sees the rook she loves the best oh he has been east and he has been west and his crop it is full of worms and slugs and they are all for her  we are old old rooks so many of us the white is mingling with the purple black upon our breasts we have seen these tall elms grow from saplings we have seen the old trees fall and die yet each season come to us again the young thoughts so we mate and build and gather that again our old old hearts may quiver to the thin cry of our newborn  mother nature has but one care the children we talk of love as the lord of life it is but the minister our novels end where natures tale begins the drama that our curtain falls upon is but the prologue to her play how the ancient dame must laugh as she listens to the prattle of

platform late one winters night waiting for the last train to watford when i noticed a man cursing an automatic machine twice he shook his fist at it i expected every moment to see him strike it naturally curious i drew near softly i wanted to catch what he was saying however he heard my approaching footsteps and turned on me are you the man said he who was here just now  just where i replied i had been pacing up and down the platform for about five minutes  why here where we are standing he snapped out where do you think here isover there he seemed irritable  i may have passed this spot in the course of my peregrinations if that is what you mean i replied i spoke with studied politeness my idea was to rebuke his rudeness  i mean he answered are you the man that spoke to me just a minute ago  i am not that man i said goodnight  are you sure he persisted  one is not likely to forget talking to you i retorted  his tone had been most offensive i beg your pardon he replied grudgingly i thought you looked like the man who spoke to me a minute or so ago  i felt mollified he was the only other man on the platform and i had a quarter of an hour to wait no it certainly wasnt me i returned genially but ungrammatically why did you want him  yes i did he answered i put a penny in the slot here he continued feeling apparently the need of unburdening himself wanted a box of matches i couldnt get anything put and i was shaking the machine and swearing at it as one does when there came along a man about your size andyoure sure it wasnt you  positive i again ungrammatically replied i would tell you if it had been what did he do  well he saw what had happened or guessed it he said they are troublesome things those machines they want understanding i said they want taking up and flinging into the sea thats what they want i was feeling mad because i hadnt a match about me and i use a lot he said they stick sometimes the thing to do is to put another penny in the weight of the first penny is not always sufficient the second penny loosens the drawer and tumbles out itself so that you get your purchase together with your first penny back again i have often succeeded that way well it seemed a silly explanation but he talked as if he had been weaned by an automatic machine and i was sawney enough to listen to him i dropped in what i thought was another penny i have just discovered it was a twoshilling piece the fool was right to a certain extent i have got something out i have got this  he held it towards me i looked at it it was a packet of everton toffee  two and a penny he remarked bitterly ill sell it for a third of what it cost me  you have put your money into the wrong machine i suggested  well i know that he answered a little crossly as it seemed to mehe was not a nice man had there been any one else to talk to i should have left him it isnt losing the money i mind so much its getting this damn thing that annoys me if i could find that idiot id ram it down his throat  we walked to the end of the platform side by side in silence  there are people like that he broke out as we turned people who will go about giving advice ill be getting six months over one of them im always afraid i remember a pony i had once i judged the man to be a small farmer he talked in a wurzelly tone i dont know if you understand what i mean but an atmosphere of wurzels was the thing that somehow he suggested it was a thoroughbred welsh pony as sound a little beast as ever stepped id had him out to grass all the winter and one day in the early spring i thought id take him for a run i had to go to amersham on business i put him into the cart and drove him across it is just ten miles from my place he was a bit uppish and had lathered himself pretty freely by the time we reached the town  a man was at the door of the hotel he says thats a good pony of yours  pretty middling i says  it doesnt do to overdrive em when theyre young he says  i says hes done ten miles and ive done most of the pulling i reckon im a jolly sight more exhausted than he is  i went inside and did my business and when i came out the man was still there going back up the hill he says to me  somehow i didnt cotton to him from the beginning well ive got to get the other side of it i says and unless you know any patent way of getting over a hill without going up it i reckon i am  he says you take my advice give him a pint of old ale before you start  old ale i says why hes a teetotaler  never you mind that he answers you give him a pint of old ale i know these ponies hes a good un but he aint set a pint of old ale and hell take you up that hill like a cable tramway and not hurt himself  i dont know what it is about this class of man one asks oneself afterwards why one didnt knock his hat over his eyes and run his head into the nearest horsetrough but at the time one listens to them i got a pint of old ale in a handbowl and brought it out about halfadozen chaps were standing round and of course there was a good deal of chaff  youre starting him on the downward course jim says one of them hell take to gambling rob a bank and murder his mother thats always the result of a glass of ale cording to the tracts  he wont drink it like that says another its as flat as ditch water put a head on it for him  aint you got a cigar for him says a third  a cup of coffee and a round of buttered toast would do him a sight more good a cold day like this says a fourth  id half a mind then to throw the stuff away or drink it myself it seemed a piece of bally nonsense giving good ale to a fouryearold pony but the moment the beggar smelt the bowl he reached out his head and lapped it up as though hed been a christian and i jumped into the cart and started off amid cheers we got up the hill pretty steady then the liquor began to work into his head ive taken home a drunken man more than once and theres pleasanter jobs than that ive seen a drunken woman and theyre worse but a drunken welsh pony i never want to have anything more to do with so long as i live having four legs he managed to hold himself up but as to guiding himself he couldnt and as for letting me do it he wouldnt first we were one side of the road and then we were the other when we were not either side we were crossways in the middle i heard a bicycle bell behind me but i dared not turn my head all i could do was to shout to the fellow to keep where he was  i want to pass you he sang out so soon as he was near enough  well you cant do it i called back  why cant i he answered how much of the road do you want  all of it and a bit over i answered him for this job and nothing in the way  he followed me for halfamile abusing me and every time he thought he saw a chance he tried to pass me but the pony was always a bit too smart for him you might have thought the brute was doing it on purpose  youre not fit to be driving he shouted he was quite right i wasnt i was feeling just about dead beat  what do you think you are he continued the charge of the light brigade he was a common sort of fellow who sent you home with the washing  well he was making me wild by this time whats the good of talking to me i shouted back come and blackguard the pony if you want to blackguard anybody ive got all i can do without the help of that alarm clock of yours go away youre only making him worse  whats the matter with the pony he called out  cant you see i answered hes drunk  well of course it sounded foolish the truth often does  one of yous drunk he retorted for two pins id come and haul you out of the cart  i wish to goodness he had id have given something to be out of that cart but he didnt have the chance at that moment the pony gave a sudden swerve and i take it he must have been a bit too close i heard a yell and a curse and at the same instant i was splashed from head to foot with ditch water then the brute bolted a man was coming along asleep on the top of a cartload of windsor chairs its disgraceful the way those wagoners go to sleep i wonder there are not more accidents i dont think he ever knew what had happened to him i couldnt look round to see what became of him i only saw him start halfway down the hill a policeman hollad to me to stop i heard him shouting out something about furious driving halfamile this side of chesham we came upon a girls school walking two and twoa crocodile they call it i think i bet you those girls are still talking about it it must have taken the old woman a good hour to collect them together again  it was marketday in chesham and i guess there has not been a busier marketday in chesham before or since we went through the town at about thirty miles an hour ive never seen chesham so livelyits a sleepy hole as a rule a mile outside the town i sighted the high wycombe coach i didnt feel i minded much i had got to that pass when it didnt seem to matter to me what happened i only felt curious a dozen yards off the coach the pony stopped dead that jerked me off the seat to the bottom of the cart i couldnt get up because the seat was on top of me i could see nothing but the sky and occasionally the head of the pony when he stood upon his hind legs but i could hear what the driver of the coach said and i judged he was having trouble also  take that damn circus out of the road he shouted if hed had any sense hed have seen how helpless i was i could hear his cattle plunging about they are like that horsesif they see one fool then they all want to be fools  take it home and tie it up to its organ shouted the guard  then an old woman went into hysterics and began laughing like an hyena that started the pony off again and as far as i could calculate by watching the clouds we did about another four miles at the gallop then he thought hed try to jump a gate and finding i suppose that the cart hampered him he started kicking it to pieces id never have thought a cart could have been separated into so many pieces if i hadnt seen it done when he had got rid of everything but half a wheel and the splashboard he bolted again i remained behind with the other ruins and glad i was to get a little rest he came back later in the afternoon and i was pleased to sell him the next week for a fivepoundnote it cost me about another ten to repair myself  to this day i am chaffed about that pony and the local temperance society made a lecture out of me thats what comes of following advice  i sympathized with him i have suffered from advice myself i have a friend a city man whom i meet occasionally one of his most ardent passions in life is to make my fortune he buttonholes me in threadneedle street the very man i wanted to see he says im going to let you in for a good thing we are getting up a little syndicate he is for ever getting up a little syndicate and for every hundred pounds you put into it you take a thousand out had i gone into all his little syndicates i could have been worth at the present moment i reckon two million five hundred thousand pounds but i have not gone into all his little syndicates i went into one years ago when i was younger i am still in it my friend is confident that my holding later on will yield me thousands being however hardup for ready money i am willing to part with my share to any deserving person at a genuine reduction upon a cash basis another friend of mine knows another man who is in the know as regards racing matters i suppose most people possess a friend of this type he is generally very popular just before a race and extremely unpopular immediately afterwards a third benefactor of mine is an enthusiast upon the subject of diet one day he brought me something in a packet and pressed it into my hand with the air of a man who is relieving you of all your troubles  what is it i asked  open it and see he answered in the tone of a pantomime fairy  i opened it and looked but i was no wiser  its tea he explained  oh i replied i was wondering if it could be snuff  well its not exactly tea he continued its a sort of tea you take one cup of thatone cup and you will never care for any other kind of tea again  he was quite right i took one cup after drinking it i felt i didnt care for any other tea i felt i didnt care for anything except to die quietly and inoffensively he called on me a week later  you remember that tea i gave you he said  distinctly i answered ive got the taste of it in my mouth now  did it upset you he asked  it annoyed me at the time i answered but thats all over now  he seemed thoughtful you were quite correct he answered it was snuff a very special snuff sent me all the way from india  i cant say i liked it i replied  a stupid mistake of mine he went oni must have mixed up the packets  oh accidents will happen i said and you wont make another mistake i feel sure so far as i am concerned  we can all give advice i had the honour once of serving an old gentleman whose profession it was to give legal advice and excellent legal advice he always gave in common with most men who know the law he had little respect for it i have heard him say to a wouldbe litigant  my dear sir if a villain stopped me in the street and demanded of me my watch and chain i should refuse to give it to him if he thereupon said then i shall take it from you by brute force i should old as i am i feel convinced reply to him come on but if on the other hand he were to say to me very well then i shall take proceedings against you in the court of queens bench to compel you to give it up to me i should at once take it from my pocket press it into his hand and beg of him to say no more about the matter and i should consider i was getting off cheaply  yet that same old gentleman went to law himself with his nextdoor neighbour over a dead poll parrot that wasnt worth sixpence to anybody and spent from first to last a hundred pounds if he spent a penny  i know im a fool he confessed i have no positive proof that it was his cat but ill make him pay for calling me an old bailey attorney hanged if i dont  we all know how the pudding ought to be made we do not profess to be able to make it that is not our business our business is to criticize the cook it seems our business to criticize so many things that it is not our business to do we are all critics nowadays i have my opinion of you reader and you possibly have your own opinion of me i do not seek to know it personally i prefer the man who says what he has to say of me behind my back i remember when on a lecturing tour the groundplan of the hall often necessitated my mingling with the audience as they streamed out this never happened but i would overhear somebody in front of me whisper to his or her companiontake care hes just behind you i always felt so grateful to that whisperer  at a bohemian club i was once drinking coffee with a novelist who happened to be a broadshouldered athletic man a fellowmember joining us said to the novelist i have just finished that last book of yours ill tell you my candid opinion of it promptly replied the novelist i give you fair warningif you do i shall punch your head we never heard that candid opinion  most of our leisure time we spend sneering at one another it is a wonder going about as we do with our noses so high in the air we do not walk off this little round world into space all of us the masses sneer at the classes the morals of the classes are shocking if only the classes would consent as a body to be taught behaviour by a committee of the masses how very much better it would be for them if only the classes would neglect their own interests and devote themselves to the welfare of the masses the masses would be more pleased with them  the classes sneer at the masses if only the masses would follow the advice given them by the classes if only they would be thrifty on their ten shillings a week if only they would all be teetotalers or drink old claret which is not intoxicating if only all the girls would be domestic servants on five pounds a year and not waste their money on feathers if only the men would be content to work for fourteen hours a day and to sing in tune god bless the squire and his relations and would consent to be kept in their proper stations all things would go swimminglyfor the classes  the new woman poohpoohs the old the old woman is indignant with the new the chapel denounces the stage the stage ridicules little bethel the minor poet sneers at the world the world laughs at the minor poet  man criticizes woman we are not altogether pleased with woman we discuss her shortcomings we advise her for her good if only english wives would dress as french wives talk as american wives cook as german wives if only women would be precisely what we want them to bepatient and hardworking brilliantly witty and exhaustively domestic bewitching amenable and less suspicious how very much better it would be for themalso for us we work so hard to teach them but they will not listen instead of paying attention to our wise counsel the tiresome creatures are wasting their time criticizing us it is a popular game this game of school all that is needful is a doorstep a cane and six other children the difficulty is the six other children every child wants to be the schoolmaster they will keep jumping up saying it is their turn  woman wants to take the stick now and put man on the doorstep there are one or two things she has got to say to him he is not at all the man she approves of he must begin by getting rid of all his natural desires and propensities that done she will take him in hand and make of himnot a man but something very much superior  it would be the best of all possible worlds if everybody would only follow our advice i wonder would jerusalem have been the cleanly city it is reported if instead of troubling himself concerning his own twopennyhalfpenny doorstep each citizen had gone out into the road and given eloquent lectures to all the other inhabitants on the subject of sanitation  we have taken to criticizing the creator himself of late the world is wrong we are wrong if only he had taken our advice during those first six days  why do i seem to have been scooped out and filled up with lead why do i hate the smell of bacon and feel that nobody cares for me it is because champagne and lobsters have been made wrong  why do edwin and angelina quarrel it is because edwin has been given a fine highspirited nature that will not brook contradiction while angelina poor girl has been cursed with contradictory instincts  why is excellent mr jones brought down next door to beggary mr jones had an income of a thousand a year secured by the funds but there came along a wicked company promoter why are wicked company promoters permitted with a prospectus telling good mr jones how to obtain a hundred per cent for his money by investing it in some scheme for the swindling of mr joness fellowcitizens  the scheme does not succeed the people swindled turn out contrary to the promise of the prospectus to be mr jones and his fellowinvestors why does heaven allow these wrongs  why does mrs brown leave her husband and children to run off with the new doctor it is because an illadvised creator has given mrs brown and the new doctor unduly strong emotions neither mrs brown nor the new doctor are to be blamed if any human being be answerable it is probably mrs browns grandfather or some early ancestor of the new doctors  we shall criticize heaven when we get there i doubt if any of us will be pleased with the arrangements we have grown so exceedingly critical  it was once said of a very superior young man that he seemed to be under the impression that god almighty had made the universe chiefly to hear what he would say about it consciously or unconsciously most of us are of this way of thinking it is an age of mutual improvement societiesa delightful idea everybodys business being to improve everybody else of amateur parliaments of literary councils of playgoers clubs  first night criticism seems to have died out of late the student of the drama having come to the conclusion possibly that plays are not worth criticizing but in my young days we were very earnest at this work we went to the play less with the selfish desire of enjoying our evening than with the noble aim of elevating the stage maybe we did good maybe we were neededlet us think so certain it is many of the old absurdities have disappeared from the theatre and our roughandready criticism may have helped the happy dispatch a folly is often served by an unwise remedy  the dramatist in those days had to reckon with his audience gallery and pit took an interest in his work such as galleries and pits no longer take i recollect witnessing the production of a very bloodcurdling melodrama at i think the old queens theatre the heroine had been given by the author a quite unnecessary amount of conversation so we considered the woman whenever she appeared on the stage talked by the yard she could not do a simple little thing like cursing the villain under about twenty lines when the hero asked her if she loved him she stood up and made a speech about it that lasted three minutes by the watch one dreaded to see her open her mouth in the third act somebody got hold of her and shut her up in a dungeon he was not a nice man speaking generally but we felt he was the man for the situation and the house cheered him to the echo we flattered ourselves we had got rid of her for the rest of the evening then some fool of a turnkey came along and she appealed to him through the grating to let her out for a few minutes the turnkey a good but softhearted man hesitated  dont you do it shouted one earnest student of the drama from the gallery shes all right keep her there  the old idiot paid no attention to our advice he argued the matter to himself tis but a trifling request he remarked and it will make her happy  yes but what about us replied the same voice from the gallery you dont know her youve only just come on weve been listening to her all the evening shes quiet now you let her be  oh let me out if only for one moment shrieked the poor woman i have something that i must say to my child  write it on a bit of paper and pass it out suggested a voice from the pit well see that he gets it  shall i keep a mother from her dying child mused the turnkey no it would be inhuman  no it wouldnt persisted the voice of the pit not in this instance its too much talk that has made the poor child ill  the turnkey would not be guided by us he opened the cell door amidst the execrations of the whole house she talked to her child for about five minutes at the end of which time it died  ah he is dead shrieked the distressed parent  lucky beggar was the unsympathetic rejoinder of the house  sometimes the criticism of the audience would take the form of remarks addressed by one gentleman to another we had been listening one night to a play in which action seemed to be unnecessarily subordinated to dialogue and somewhat poor dialogue at that suddenly across the wearying talk from the stage came the stentorian whisper  jim  hallo  wake me up when the play begins  this was followed by an ostentatious sound as of snoring then the voice of the second speaker was heard  sammy  his friend appeared to awake  eh yes whats up has anything happened  wake you up at halfpast eleven in any event i suppose  thanks do sonny and the critic slept again  yes we took an interest in our plays then i wonder shall i ever enjoy the british drama again as i enjoyed it in those days shall i ever enjoy a supper again as i enjoyed the tripe and onions washed down with bitter beer at the bar of the old albion i have tried many suppers after the theatre since then and some when friends have been in generous mood have been expensive and elaborate the cook may have come from paris his portrait may be in the illustrated papers his salary may be reckoned by hundreds but there is something wrong with his art for all that i miss a flavour in his meats there is a sauce lacking  nature has her coinage and demands payment in her own currency at natures shop it is you yourself must pay your unearned increment your inherited fortune your luck are not legal tenders across her counter  you want a good appetite nature is quite willing to supply you certainly sir she replies i can do you a very excellent article indeed i have here a real genuine hunger and thirst that will make your meal a delight to you you shall eat heartily and with zest and you shall rise from the table refreshed invigorated and cheerful  just the very thing i want exclaims the gourmet delightedly tell me the price  the price answers mrs nature is one long days hard work  the customers face falls he handles nervously his heavy purse  cannot i pay for it in money he asks i dont like work but i am a rich man i can afford to keep french cooks to purchase old wines  nature shakes her head  i cannot take your cheques tissue and nerve are my charges for these i can give you an appetite that will make a rumpsteak and a tankard of ale more delicious to you than any dinner that the greatest chef in europe could put before you i can even promise you that a hunk of bread and cheese shall be a banquet to you but you must pay my price in my money i do not deal in yours  and next the dilettante enters demanding a taste for art and literature and this also nature is quite prepared to supply  i can give you true delight in all these things she answers music shall be as wings to you lifting you above the turmoil of the world through art you shall catch a glimpse of truth along the pleasant paths of literature you shall walk as beside still waters  and your charge cries the delighted customer  these things are somewhat expensive replies nature i want from you a life lived simply free from all desire of worldly success a life from which passion has been lived out a life to which appetite has been subdued  but you mistake my dear lady replies the dilettante i have many friends possessed of taste and they are men who do not pay this price for it their houses are full of beautiful pictures they rave about nocturnes and symphonies their shelves are packed with first editions yet they are men of luxury and wealth and fashion they trouble much concerning the making of money and society is their heaven cannot i be as one of these  i do not deal in the tricks of apes answers nature coldly the culture of these friends of yours is a mere pose a fashion of the hour their talk mere parrot chatter yes you can purchase such culture as this and pretty cheaply but a passion for skittles would be of more service to you and bring you more genuine enjoyment my goods are of a different class i fear we waste each others time  and next comes the boy asking with a blush for love and natures motherly old heart goes out to him for it is an article she loves to sell and she loves those who come to purchase it of her so she leans across the counter smiling and tells him that she has the very thing he wants and he trembling with excitement likewise asks the figure  it costs a good deal explains nature but in no discouraging tone it is the most expensive thing in all my shop  i am rich replies the lad my father worked hard and saved and he has left me all his wealth i have stocks and shares and lands and factories and will pay any price in reason for this thing  but nature looking graver lays her hand upon his arm  put by your purse boy she says my price is not a price in reason nor is gold the metal that i deal in there are many shops in various streets where your banknotes will be accepted but if you will take an old womans advice you will not go to them the thing they will sell you will bring sorrow and do evil to you it is cheap enough but like all things cheap it is not worth the buying no man purchases it only the fool  and what is the cost of the thing you sell then asks the lad  selfforgetfulness tenderness strength answers the old dame the love of all things that are of good repute the hate of all things evilcourage sympathy selfrespect these things purchase love put by your purse lad it will serve you in other ways but it will not buy for you the goods upon my shelves  then am i no better off than the poor man demands the lad  i know not wealth or poverty as you understand it answers nature here i exchange realities only for realities you ask for my treasures i ask for your brain and heart in exchangeyours boy not your fathers not anothers  and this price he argues how shall i obtain it  go about the world replies the great lady labour suffer help come back to me when you have earned your wages and according to how much you bring me so we will do business  is real wealth so unevenly distributed as we think is not fate the true socialist who is the rich man who the poor do we know does even the man himself know are we not striving for the shadow missing the substance take life at its highest which was the happier man rich solomon or poor socrates solomon seems to have had most things that most men most desiremaybe too much of some for his own comfort socrates had little beyond what he carried about with him but that was a good deal according to our scales solomon should have been one of the happiest men that ever lived socrates one of the most wretched but was it so  or taking life at its lowest with pleasure its only goal is my lord tom noddy in the stalls so very much jollier than arry in the gallery were beer ten shillings the bottle and champagne fourpence a quart which think you we should clamour for if every west end club had its skittle alley and billiards could only be played in east end pubs which game my lord would you select is the air of berkeley square so much more joygiving than the atmosphere of seven dials i find myself a piquancy in the air of seven dials missing from berkeley square is there so vast a difference between horsehair and straw when you are tired is happiness multiplied by the number of rooms in ones house are lady ermintrudes lips so very much sweeter than sallys of the alley what is success in life     on the playing of marches at the funerals of marionettes  he began the day badly he took me out and lost me it would be so much better would he consent to the usual arrangement and allow me to take him out i am far the abler leader i say it without conceit i am older than he is and i am less excitable i do not stop and talk with every person i meet and then forget where i am i do less to distract myself i rarely fight i never feel i want to run after cats i take but little pleasure in frightening children i have nothing to think about but the walk and the getting home again if as i say he would give up taking me out and let me take him out there would be less trouble all round but into this i have never been able to persuade him  he had mislaid me once or twice but in sloane square he lost me entirely when he loses me he stands and barks for me if only he would remain where he first barked i might find my way to him but before i can cross the road he is barking halfway down the next street i am not so young as i was and i sometimes think he exercises me more than is good for me i could see him from where i was standing in the kings road evidently he was most indignant i was too far off to distinguish the barks but i could guess what he was saying  damn that man hes off again  he made inquiries of a passing dog  you havent smelt my man about anywhere have you  a dog of course would never speak of seeing anybody or anything smell being his leading sense reaching the top of a hill he would say to his companionlovely smell from here i always think i could sit and sniff here all the afternoon or proposing a walk he would sayi like the road by the canal dont you theres something interesting to catch your nose at every turn  no i havent smelt any man in particular answered the other dog what sort of a smelling man is yours  oh an eggandbacony sort of a man with a dash of soap about him  thats nothing to go by retorted the other most men would answer to that description this time of the morning where were you when you last noticed him  at this moment he caught sight of me and came up pleased to find me but vexed with me for having got lost  oh here you are he barked didnt you see me go round the corner do keep closer bothered if half my time isnt taken up finding you and losing you again  the incident appeared to have made him badtempered he was just in the humour for a row of any sort at the top of sloane street a stout militarylooking gentleman started running after the chelsea bus with a hooroo william smith was after him had the old gentleman taken no notice all would have been well a butcher boy driving just behind wouldi could read it in his eyehave caught smith a flick as he darted into the road which would have served him right the old gentleman would have captured his bus and the affair would have been ended unfortunately he was that type of retired military man all gout and curry and no sense he stopped to swear at the dog that of course was what smith wanted it is not often he gets a scrimmage with a fullgrown man theyre a poorspirited lot most of them he thinks they wont even answer you back i like a man who shows a bit of pluck he was frenzied with delight at his success he flew round his victim weaving whooping circles and curves that paralyzed the old gentleman as though they had been the mystic figures of a merlin the colonel clubbed his umbrella and attempted to defend himself i called to the dog i gave good advice to the colonel i judged him to be a colonel the louder he spoke the less one could understand him but both were too excited to listen to me a sympathetic bus driver leaned over and whispered hoarse counsel  ketch im by the tail sir he advised the old gentleman dont you be afraid of him you ketch im firmly by the tail  a milkman on the other hand sought rather to encourage smith shouting as he passed  good dog kill him  a child brained within an inch by the old gentlemans umbrella began to cry the nurse told the old gentleman he was a foola remark which struck me as singularly apt the old gentleman gasped back that perambulators were illegal on the pavement and between his exercises inquired after myself a crowd began to collect and a policeman strolled up  it was not the right thing i do not defend myself but at this point the temptation came to me to desert william smith he likes a street row i dont these things are matters of temperament i have also noticed that he has the happy instinct of knowing when to disappear from a crisis and the ability to do so mysteriously turning up quarter of a mile off clad in a peaceful and preoccupied air and to all appearances another and a better dog  consoling myself with the reflection that i could be of no practical assistance to him and remembering with some satisfaction that by a fortunate accident he was without his collar which bears my name and address i slipped round the off side of a vauxhall bus making no attempt at ostentation and worked my way home through lowndes square and the park  five minutes after i had sat down to lunch he flung open the diningroom door and marched in it is his customary entrance in a previous state of existence his soul was probably that of an actormanager  from his exuberant selfsatisfaction i was inclined to think he must have succeeded in following the milkmans advice at all events i have not seen the colonel since his bad temper had disappeared but his uppishness had if possible increased previous to his return i had given the oshannon a biscuit the oshannon had been insulted he did not want a dog biscuit if he could not have a grilled kidney he did not want anything he had thrown the biscuit on the floor smith saw it and made for it now smith never eats biscuits i give him one occasionally and he at once proceeds to hide it he is a thrifty dog he thinks of the future you never know what may happen he says suppose the guvnor dies or goes mad or bankrupt i may be glad even of this biscuit ill put it under the doormatno i wont somebody will find it there ill scratch a hole in the tennis lawn and bury it there thats a good idea perhaps itll grow once i caught him hiding it in my study behind the shelf devoted to my own books it offended me his doing that the argument was so palpable generally wherever he hides it somebody finds it we find it under our pillowsinside our boots no place seems safe this time he had said to himselfby jove a whole row of the guvnors books nobody will ever want to take these out ill hide it here one feels a thing like that from ones own dog  but the oshannons biscuit was another matter honesty is the best policy but dishonesty is the better fun he made a dash for it and commenced to devour it greedily you might have thought he had not tasted food for a week  the indignation of the oshannon was a sight for the gods he has the goodnature of his race had smith asked him for the biscuit he would probably have given it to him it was the insultthe immorality of the proceeding that maddened the oshannon  for a moment he was paralyzed  well of all thedid ye see that now he said to me with his eyes then he made a rush and snatched the biscuit out of smiths very jaws ye onprincipled black saxon thief growled the oshannon how dare ye take my biscuit  you miserable irish cur growled smith how was i to know it was your biscuit does everything on the floor belong to you perhaps you think i belong to you im on the floor i dont believe it is your biscuit you longeared snubbednosed bogtrotter give it me back  i dont require any of your argument you flopeared son of a tramp with half a tail replied the oshannon you come and take it if you think you are dog enough  he did think he was dog enough he is half the size of the oshannon but such considerations weigh not with him his argument is if a dog is too big for you to fight the whole of him take a bit of him and fight that he generally gets licked but what is left of him invariably swaggers about afterwards under the impression it is the victor when he is dead he will say to himself as he settles himself in his gravewell i flatter myself ive laid out that old world at last it wont trouble me any more im thinking  on this occasion i took a hand in the fight it becomes necessary at intervals to remind master smith that the man as the useful and faithful friend of dog has his rights i deemed such interval had arrived he flung himself on to the sofa muttering it sounded likewish id never got up this morning nobody understands me  nothing however sobers him for long halfanhour later he was killing the nextdoor cat he will never learn sense he has been killing that cat for the last three months why the next morning his nose is invariably twice its natural size while for the next week he can see objects on one side of his head only he never seems to grasp i suppose he attributes it to change in the weather  he ended up the afternoon with what he no doubt regarded as a complete and satisfying success dorothea had invited a lady to take tea with her that day i heard the sound of laughter and being near the nursery i looked in to see what was the joke smith was worrying a doll i have rarely seen a more worriedlooking doll its head was off and its sawdust strewed the floor both the children were crowing with delight dorothea in particular was in an ecstasy of amusement  whose doll is it i asked  evas answered dorothea between her peals of laughter  oh no it isnt explained eva in a tone of sweet content heres my doll she had been sitting on it and now drew it forth warm but whole thats dorrys doll  the change from joy to grief on the part of dorothea was distinctly dramatic even smith accustomed to storm was nonplussed at the suddenness of the attack upon him  dorotheas sorrow lasted longer than i had expected i promised her another doll but it seemed she did not want another that was the only doll she would ever care for so long as life lasted no other doll could ever take its place no other doll would be to her what that doll had been these little people are so absurd as if it could matter whether you loved one doll or another when all are so much alike they have curly hair and pinkandwhite complexions big eyes that open and shut a little red mouth two little hands yet these foolish little people they will love one while another they will not look upon i find the best plan is not to reason with them but to sympathize later onbut not too soonintroduce to them another doll they will not care for it at first but in time they will come to take an interest in it of course it cannot make them forget the first doll no doll ever born in lowther arcadia could be as that but still it is many weeks before they forget entirely the first love  we buried dolly in the country under the yew tree a friend of mine who plays the fiddle came down on purpose to assist we buried her in the hot spring sunshine while the birds from shady nooks sang joyously of life and love and our chief mourner cried real tears just for all the world as though it were not the fate of dolls sooner or later to get brokenthe little fragile things made for an hour to be dressed and kissed then paintless and stript to be thrown aside on the nursery floor poor little dolls i wonder do they take themselves seriously not knowing the springs that stir their sawdust bosoms are but clockwork not seeing the wires to which they dance poor little marionettes do they talk together i wonder when the lights of the booth are out  you little sister doll were the heroine you lived in the whitewashed cottage all honeysuckle and clematis withoutearwiggy and damp within maybe how pretty you always looked in your simple neatlyfitting print dress how good you were how nobly you bore your poverty how patient you were under your many wrongs you never harboured an evil thought a revengeful wishnever little doll were there never moments when you longed to play the wicked womans part live in a room with many doors beclad in furs and jewels with lovers galore at your feet in those long winter evenings the household work is donethe greasy dishes washed the floor scrubbed the excellent child is asleep in the corner the oneandelevenpenny lamp sheds its dismal light on the darned tablecloth you sit busy at your coarse sewing waiting for hero dick knowingguessing at least where he is yes dear i remember your fine speeches when you told her in stirring language the gallery cheered to the echo what you thought of her and of such women as she when lifting your hand to heaven you declared you were happier in your attic working your fingers to the bone than she in her gilded saloni think gilded salon was the term was it notfurnished by sin but speaking of yourself weak little sister doll not of your fine speeches the gallery listening did you not in your secret heart envy her did you never before blowing out the one candle stand for a minute in front of the cracked glass and think to yourself that you too would look well in lowcut dresses from paris the diamonds flashing on your white smooth skin did you never toiling home through the mud bearing your bundle of needlework feel bitter with the wages of virtue as she splashed you passing by in her carriage alone over your cup of weak tea did you never feel tempted to pay the price for champagne suppers and gaiety and admiration ah yes it is easy for folks who have had their good time to prepare copybooks for weary little inkstained fingers longing for play the fine maxims sound such cant when we are in that mood do they not you too were young and handsome did the author of the play think you were never hungry for the good things of life did he think that reading tracts to crotchety old women was joy to a fullblooded girl in her twenties why should she have all the love and all the laughter how fortunate that the villain the wicked baronet never opened the cottage door at that moment eh dear he always came when you were strong when you felt that you could denounce him and scorn his temptations would that the villain came to all of us at such time then we would all perhaps be heroes and heroines  ah well it was only a play it is over now you and i little tired dolls lying here side by side waiting to know our next part we can look back and laugh where is she this wicked dolly that made such a stir on our tiny stage ah here you are madam i thought you could not be far they have thrown us all into this corner together but how changed you are dolly your paint rubbed off your golden hair worn to a wisp no wonder it was a trying part you had to play how tired you must have grown of the glare and the glitter and even hope was denied you the peace you so longed for you knew you had lost the power to enjoy like the girl bewitched in the fairy tale you knew you must dance ever faster and faster with limbs growing palsied with face growing ashen and hair growing grey till death should come to release you and your only prayer was he might come ere your dancing grew comic  like the smell of the roses to nancy hawking them through the hot streets must the stifling atmosphere of love have been to you the song of passion how monotonous in your ears sung now by the young and now by the old now shouted now whined now shrieked but ever the one strident tune do you remember when first you heard it you dreamt it the morning hymn of heaven you came to think it the dance music of hell ground from a cracked hurdygurdy lent out by the devil on hire  an evil race we must have seemed to you dolly faustine as to some old bailey lawyer you saw but one side of us you lived in a world upside down where the leaves and the blossoms were hidden and only the roots saw your day you imagined the wormbeslimed fibres the plant and all things beautiful you deemed cant chivalry love honour how you laughed at the lying words you knew the truthas you thought aye half the truth we were swine while your spell was upon us daughter of circe and you not knowing your island secret deemed it our natural shape  no wonder dolly your battered waxen face is stamped with an angry sneer the hero who eventually came into his estates amid the plaudits of the pit while you were left to die in the streets you remembered but the house had forgotten those earlier scenes in always wicked paris the good friend of the family the breezy man of the world the deus ex machina of the play who was so good to everybody whom everybody loved aye you loved him oncebut that was in the prologue in the play proper he was respectable how you loathed that word that meant to you all you vainly longed for to him the prologue was a period past and dead a memory giving flavour to his life to you it was the first act of the play shaping all the others his sins the house had forgotten at yours they held up their hands in horror no wonder the sneer lies on your waxen lips  never mind dolly it was a stupid house next time perhaps you will play a better part and then they will cheer instead of hissing you you were wasted i am inclined to think on modern comedy you should have been cast for the heroine of some oldworld tragedy the strength of character the courage the power of selfforgetfulness the enthusiasm were yours it was the part that was lacking you might have worn the mantle of a judith a boadicea or a jeanne darc had such plays been popular in your time perhaps they had they played in your day might have had to be content with such a part as yours they could not have played the meek heroine and what else would there have been for them in modern drama catherine of russia had she been a waiters daughter in the days of the second empire should we have called her great the magdalene had her lodging in those days been in some byestreet of rome instead of in jerusalem should we mention her name in our churches  you were necessary you see dolly to the piece we cannot all play heroes and heroines there must be wicked people in the play or it would not interest think of it dolly a play where all the women were virtuous all the men honest we might close the booth the world would be as dull as an oysterbed without you wicked folk there would be no good how should we have known and honoured the heroines worth but by contrast with your worthlessness where would have been her fine speeches but for you to listen to them where lay the heros strength but in resisting temptation of you had not you and the wicked baronet between you robbed him of his estates falsely accused him of crime he would have lived to the end of the play an idle unheroic incomplete existence you brought him down to poverty you made him earn his own breada most excellent thing for him gave him the opportunity to play the man but for your conduct in the prologue of what value would have been that fine scene at the end of the third act that stirred the house to tears and laughter you and your accomplice the wicked baronet made the play possible how would pit and gallery have known they were virtuous but for the indignation that came to them watching your misdeeds pity sympathy excitement all that goes to the making of a play you were necessary for it was ungrateful of the house to hiss you  and you mr merryman the painted grin worn from your pale lips you too were dissatisfied if i remember rightly with your part you wanted to make the people cry not laugh was it a higher ambition the poor tired people so much happens in their life to make them weep is it not good sport to make them merry for awhile do you remember that old soul in the front row of the pit how she laughed when you sat down on the pie i thought she would have to be carried out i heard her talking to her companion as they passed the stagedoor on their way home i have not laughed my dear till tonight she was saying the good gay tears still in her eyes since the day poor sally died was not that alone worth the old stale tricks you so hated aye they were commonplace and conventional those antics of yours that made us laugh are not the antics that make us weep commonplace and conventional also are not all the plays played since the booth was opened but of one pattern the plot oldfashioned now the scenes now commonplace hero villain cynicare their parts so much the fresher the love duets are they so very new the deathbed scenes would you call them uncommonplace hate and evil and wrongare their voices new to the booth what are you waiting for people a play with a plot that is novel with characters that have never strutted before it will be ready for you perhaps when you are ready for it with new tears and new laughter  you mr merryman were the true philosopher you saved us from forgetting the reality when the fiction grew somewhat strenuous how we all applauded your gag in answer to the hero when bewailing his sad fate he demanded of heaven how much longer he was to suffer evil fortune well there cannot be much more of it in store for you you answered him its nearly nine oclock already and the show closes at ten and true to your prophecy the curtain fell at the time appointed and his troubles were of the past you showed us the truth behind the mask when pompous lord shallow in ermine and wig went to take his seat amid the fawning crowd you pulled the chair from under him and down he sat plump on the floor his robe flew open his wig flew off no longer he awed us his aped dignity fell from him we saw him a stupideyed bald little man he imposed no longer upon us it is your fool who is the only true wise man  yours was the best part in the play brother merryman had you and the audience but known it but you dreamt of a showier part where you loved and fought i have heard you now and again when you did not know i was near shouting with sword in hand before your lookingglass you had thrown your motley aside to don a dingy red coat you were the hero of the play you performed the gallant deeds you made the noble speeches i wonder what the play would be like were we all to write our own parts there would be no clowns no singing chambermaids we would all be playing lead in the centre of the stage with the limelight exclusively devoted to ourselves would it not be so  what grand acting parts they are these characters we write for ourselves alone in our dressingrooms we are always brave and noblewicked sometimes but if so in a great highminded way never in a mean or little way what wondrous deeds we do while the house looks on and marvels now we are soldiers leading armies to victory what if we die it is in the hour of triumph and a nation is left to mourn not in some forgotten skirmish do we ever fall not for some affair of outposts do we give our blood our very name unmentioned in the dispatches home now we are passionate lovers well losing a world for lovea very different thing to being a laughterprovoking corespondent in a sordid divorce case  and the house is always crowded when we play our fine speeches always fall on sympathetic ears our brave deeds are noted and applauded it is so different in the real performance so often we play our parts to empty benches or if a thin house be present they misunderstand and laugh at the pathetic passages and when our finest opportunity comes the royal box in which he or she should be present to watch us is vacant  poor little dolls how seriously we take ourselves not knowing the springs that stir our bosoms are but clockwork not seeing the wires to which we dance poor little marionettes shall we talk together i wonder when the lights of the booth are out  we are little wax dollies with hearts we are little tin soldiers with souls oh king of many toys are you merely playing with us is it only clockwork within us this thing that throbs and aches have you wound us up but to let us run down will you wind us again tomorrow or leave us here to rust is it only clockwork to which we respond and quiver now we laugh now we cry now we dance our little arms go out to clasp one another our little lips kiss then say goodbye we strive and we strain and we struggle we reach now for gold now for laurel we call it desire and ambition are they only wires that you play will you throw the clockwork aside or use it again o master  the lights of the booth grow dim the springs are broken that kept our eyes awake the wire that held us erect is snapped and helpless we fall in a heap on the stage oh brother and sister dollies we played beside where are you why is it so dark and silent why are we being put into this black box and hark the little doll orchestrahow far away the music sounds what is it they are playing  start of gounods funeral march of a marionette
