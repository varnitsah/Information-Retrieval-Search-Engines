38599533	life in the red brigade by rm ballantyne    chapter one  wet worn and wearywith water squeaking in his boots and a mixture of charcoal and water streaking his face to such an extent that as a comrade asserted his own mother would not have known hima stout young man walked smartly one morning through the streets of london towards his own home  he was tall and goodlooking as well as stout and although wet and weary had a spring in his step which proved beyond all question that he was not wornout  as the comrade above referred to would have said there was plenty of go in him still  his blue and belted coat sailors cap and small hatchet with the brass helmet swinging by its chin strap on his left arm betokened him a member of the red brigadea london firemanone of those dareanything characters who appear to hold their lives remarkably cheap for they carry these lives in their hands as the saying goes night and day who seem to be able to live in smoke as if it were their native element who face the flames as if their bodies were made of cast iron and whose apparent delight in fire is such that one is led to suspect they must be all more or less distantly connected with the family of salamander  the young mans expression of countenance as far as it could be discerned through the charcoal and water was hearty and his name dashwoodwas in keeping with his profession  the comrade whose opinion we have already quoted was wont to say that he ought to change it to dashwater that being his chief occupation in life  we need scarcely say that this comrade was rather fond of his joke  arrived at a small street not far from the regent circus young dashwood entered a firestation there and found the comrade above referred to in the act of disposing himself on a narrow tresselbed on which there was no bedding save one blanket  the comrade happened to be on duty that night  it was his duty to repose on the tresselbedstead booted and belted ready at a moments notice to respond to calls another fireman lay sleeping at his side on another tresselbed similarly clothed for there were always two men on duty all night at that station  the guardroom or as it was styled the lobby in which they lay was a very small room with a bright fire in the grate for it was winter a plain wooden desk near the window a plain deal table near the door on which stood four telegraphic instruments and having the walls ornamented with a row of wellington boots on one side and a row of bright brass helmets on the other each helmet having a small hatchet suspended by a belt below it  the comrade who looked very sleepy glanced at a small clock whose tick was the only sound that fell upon the ear and whose hands indicated the hour of halfpast two  on hearing the door open the comrade whose name was bob clazie raised himself on one elbow  ah joethat you he said with a somewhat violent yawn  all thats left of me anyhow replied joe dashwood as he hung up his helmet and axe on his own particular peg  bin much doin bob  not much growled bob but they dont give a poor fellow much chance of a sleep with them telegraphs  roused me four times already within the last hourstops for chimbleys  ha very inconsiderate of em said dashwood turning towards the door  its time i had a snooze now so ill bid ee good night bob  just as he spoke one of the sharp little telegraphic bells rang viciously  he waited to ascertain the result while clazie rosequickly but not hurriedlyand went to read the instrument with sleepy eyes  another stop for a chimbley he muttered with a remonstrative growl by this he meant that the head office in watling street had telegraphed that a chimney had gone on fire in some part of london that it was being looked after and that he and his comrades were to stop where they were and pay no attention to it even although some one should rush into the office like a maniac shouting that there was a fire in that particular place  this use of the telegraph in thus stopping the men of the brigade from going out in force to trifling fires is of the greatest service because it not only prevents them from being harassed the engines from being horsed and steam got up needlessly but it prevents rascals from running from station to station and getting several shillings instead of the one shilling which is due to the first intimator of any fire  having acknowledged the message bob clazie lay down once more gave another expostulatory grunt and drew his blanket over him while joe dashwood went home  joes home consisted of a small apartment round the corner of the street within a few seconds run of the station  off the small apartment there was a large closet  the small apartment was dashwoods drawingroom diningroom and kitchen the large closet was his bedroom  dashwood had a wife as tight a little craft with as pretty a figurehead he was wont to say as you could find in a days walk through london  that was saying a good deal but there was some truth in it  when joe entered intending to go to bed for the night he found that mary had just got up for the day  it was washingday or something of that sort with mary which accounted for her getting up at about three in the morning  hallo lass up already exclaimed the strapping fireman as he entered the room which was a perfect marvel of tidiness despite washingday  yes joe theres plenty to do an little may dont give me much time to do it replied mary glancing at a crib where little may their firstborn lay coiled up in sheets like a rosebud in snow  joe having rubbed the water and charcoal from his face with a huge jacktowel went to the washtub and imprinted a hearty kiss on marys rosy lips which she considerately held up for the purpose of being saluted  he was about to do the same to the rosebud when mary stopped him with an energetic dont  wy not molly asked the obedient man  cause youll wake her up  thus put down joe seated himself humbly on a seachest and began to pull off his wet boots  its bin a bad fire i think said mary glancing at her husband  rather  a beershop in whitechapel  house of five rooms burnt out and the roof off  you look tired joe said mary  i am a bit tired but an hours rest will put me all to rights thats the third fire ive bin called to tonight not that i think much about that but the last one has bin a stiff one an i got a fall or two that nigh shook the wind out o me  have something to eat joe said mary in a sympathetic tone  no thankee lass i need sleep more than meat just now  a glass of beer then urged mary sweeping the soap suds off her pretty arms and hands and taking up a towel  the fireman shook his head as he divested himself of his coat and neckcloth  do joe entreated mary im sure it will do you good and no one could say that you broke through your principles considerin the condition youre in  foolish mary she was young and inexperienced and knew not the danger of tempting her husband to drink  she only knew that hundreds of firstrate sober good trustworthy men took a glass of beer now and then without any evil result following and did not think that her joe ran the slightest risk in doing the same  but joe knew his danger  his father had died a drunkard  he had listened to earnest men while they told of the bitter curse that drinking had been to thousands that to some extent the tendency to drink was hereditary and that however safe some natures might be while moderately indulging there were other natures to which moderate drinking was equivalent to getting on those rails which running down a slight incline at firstalmost a level gradually pass over a steep descent where brakes become powerless and end at last in total destruction  i dont require beer molly said dashwood with a smile as he retired into the large closet at my time o life a man must be a miserable halfalive sort o critter if he cant git along without dutch courage the sight o your face and mays there is better than a stiff glass o grog to me any day  it makes me feel stronger than the stoutest man in the brigade  good night lass or good mornin  i must make the most o my time  theres no sayin how soon the next call may come  seems to me as if people was settin their houses alight on purpose to worry us  the tones in which the last sentences were uttered and the creaking of the bedstead indicated that the fireman was composing his massive limbs to rest and scarcely had mrs dashwood resumed her washing when his regular heavy breathing proclaimed him to be already in the land of nod  quietly but steadily did mrs dashwood pursue her work  neat little undergarments and fairylike little socks and indescribable little articles of lilliputian clothing of various kinds all telling of the little rosebud in the crib passed rapidly through marys nimble fingers and came out of the tub fair as the driven snow  soon the front of the fireplace became like a ship dressed with flags with this difference that the flags instead of being gay and particoloured were white and suggestive of infancy and innocence  the gentle noise of washing and the soft breathing of the sleepers and the tiny ticking of the clock over the chimneypiece were the only audible sounds for london had reached its deadest hour four oclock  rioters had exhausted their spirits natural and artificial and early risers had not begun to move  presently to these sounds were added another very distant sound which induced mary to stop and listen  a late cab she whispered to herself  the rumbling of the late cab became more distinct and soon proved it to be a hurried cab  to marys accustomed ear this raised some disagreeable idea  she cast a look of anxiety into the closet wiped her hands quickly and taking up a pair of dry boots which had been standing near the fire placed them beside her husbands coat this was barely accomplished when the hurried cab was heard to pull up at the neighbouring firestation  only a few seconds elapsed when racing footsteps were heard outside  mary seized her husbands arm  up joe up she cried and darted across the room leaped on a chair and laid violent hands on the tongue of the doorbell thereby preventing a furious double ring from disturbing the rosebud  at the first word up the bed in the closet groaned and creaked as the fireman bounded from it and the house shook as he alighted on the floor  next moment he appeared buttoning his braces and winking like an owl in sunshine  one moment sufficed to pull on the right boot another moment affixed the left  catching up his halfdried coat with one hand and flinging on his sailors cap with the other he darted from the house thrust himself into his coat as he ran along and appeared at the station just as four of his comrades drew the fireengine up to the door while two others appeared with three horses which they harnessed theretotwo abreast one in frontwith marvellous rapidity  the whole affair from the up joe up of mrs dashwood to the harnessing of the steeds was accomplished in less than five minutes  by that time joe and several of his mates stood ready belted and armed with brass helmets on their heads which flashed back the rays of the neighbouring street lamp and the engine lanterns  there was wonderfully little noise or fuss although there was so much display of promptitude and energy the reason being that all the men were thoroughly drilled and each had his particular duty to perform there was therefore no room for orders counterorders or confusion  the moment the call was given bob clazie having received no telegraphic stop had at once run to ring up the men who like dashwood had been sleeping close at hand  he rang up the driver of the engine first  at the same moment his comrade on duty had run round to the stable where the horses stood ready harnessed and brought them out  thus the thing was done without a moments delay  the driver when roused flung on his coat and helmet and ran to the engine  it was a steam fireengine that is the pumps were worked by steam instead of by hand  the firing was ready laid and the water kept nearly at the boiling point by means of a jet of gas  he had scarcely applied a light to the fire and turned off the gas when four comrades ran into the shed seized the redpainted engine and dragged her out as we have seen  much shorter time did it take to do all this than is required to describe it  when the driver mounted his box the others sprang on the engine crack went the whip fire flew from the pavingstones fire poured from the furnace the spirited steeds tore round the corner into regent street and off they went to the fire in the dark winter morning like a monster rocket or a vision of roman gladiators whirled away by a red fiery dragon  mrs dashwood heard them go and turned with a little sigh to her washingtub  she was very proud of joe and she had good reason to be for he was one of the best men in the red brigade and what was of more importance to her he was one of the best husbands in the world perhaps this was largely owing to the fact that she was one of the best of wives  his career as a fireman had been short but he had already become known as one of the daring men to whom their chief looked when some desperate service had to be performed  on several occasions he had while in charge of the fireescape been the means of saving life upon the whole therefore it is not surprising that mary was proud of her husbandalmost as proud of him as she was of the little rosebud but in regard to this she was never quite sure of the exact state of her mind  meditating on joe and giving an occasional glance at may whose sweet upturned face seemed nothing short of angelic mrs dashwood continued energetically to scrub the fairylike habiliments and make the soapsuds fly  meanwhile the red engine whirled along its fiery course at full gallop like a horrible meteor clattering loudly in the deserted streets of the great city  so it would have sped in its wild career even if it had been broad day for the loss of a single moment in reaching a fire is important but in this case the men instead of sitting like brazenheaded statues would have stood up and increased the din of their progress by shouting continuously to clear the crowded thoroughfares  as it was they had it all to themselves  sometimes the corner of a windowblind was hastily lifted showing that some wakeful one had curiosity enough to leap out of bed to see them pass  here and there a policeman paused and followed them with his eye as long as the tail of sparks from the furnace was visible  occasionally a belated toper stopped in his staggering progress to gaze at them with an idiotical assumption of seriousness and demand wash ey makin sh a orrible row for  now and then a cat with exploratory tendencies put up its back and greeted them with a glare and a fuff or a shutout cur gave them a yelping salute but the great mass of the london population let them go by without notice as they would have treated any other passing thunderbolt with which they had nothing to do  and yet they had something to do with that engine or rather it had to do with them  but for it and the rest of the red brigade london would have long ago been in ashes  it is only by unremitting vigilance and incessant action that the london fires can be kept within bounds there are nearly two thousand fires in the year in the metropolis and the heroic little army which keeps these in check numbers only three hundred and seventyeight men  that this force is much too small for the work to be done is proved by the fact that the same men have sometimes to turn out three four or five times in a night to work of the most trying and dangerous nature  there is no occupation in which the lives of the men employed are so frequently risked and their physical endurance so severely tried as that of a london fireman  as there are on the average five fires every night all the year round it follows that he is liable to be called out several times every night and in point of fact this actually takes place very often  sometimes he has barely returned from a fire and put off his drenched garments when he receives another call and is obliged to put them on again and go forth wearyit may be fastingto engage in another skirmish with the flames  in all weathers and at all seasonshot or cold wet or dryhe must turn out at a moments notice to find himself almost before he is well awake in the midst of stifling smoke obliged to face and to endure the power of roasting flames to stand under cataracts of water beside tottering walls and gables or to plunge through smoke and flames in order to rescue human lives  liability to be called occasionally to the exercise of such courage and endurance is severe enough it is what every soldier is liable to in time of war and the lifeboatman in times of storm but to be liable to such calls several times every day and night all round the year is hard indeed and proves that the red brigade although almost perfect in its organisation and heroic in its elements is far too small  paris has about seven hundred fires a year new york somewhere about three hundred yet these cities have a far larger body of firemen than london which with little short of two thousand fires a year does her work of extinction with only three hundred and seventyeight men  she succeeds because every man in the little army is a hero not one whit behind the spartans of old  the london fireman ford who in 1871 at one great fire rescued six lives from the flames and perished in accomplishing the noble deed is a sample of the rest  all the men of the brigade are picked menpicked from among the strapping and youthful tars of the navy because such men are accustomed to strict discipline to being turned out at all hours and in all weathers and to climb with cool heads in trying circumstances besides being as a class preeminently noted for daring anything and sticking at nothing such men are sure to do their work well however hard to do it without complaining and to die if need be in the doing of it  but ought they to be asked to sacrifice so much  surely londoners would do well to make that complaint which the men will never make and insist on the force being increased not only for the sake of the men but also for the sake of themselves for although there are three hundred and seventyeight heroes who hold the fiery foe so well in check there are limits to heroic powers of action and it stands to reason that double the number would do it better  but we are wandering from our point  the engine has been tearing all this time at racing speed along the bayswater road  it turns sharp round a corner near notting hill gateso sharp that the feat is performed on the two off wheels and draws from bob clazie the quiet remark pretty nigh on our beamends that time joe  a light is now seen glaring in the sky over the housetops another moment and the engine dashes into ladbroke square where a splendid mansion is in a blaze with the flames spouting from the windows of the second floor  the engine pulls up with a crash the reeking horses are removed and led aside  look alive lads is the only word uttered and the helmeted heroes knowing their work well go into action with that cool promptitude which is more than half the battle in attacking the most desperate odds or the fiercest foe    chapter two  the house on fire was as we have said an elegant mansionone of those imposing edifices with fresh paint outside and splendid furniture within which impress the beholder with the idea of a family in luxurious circumstances  no one could tell how the fire originated  in the daily report of fires made next day by the chief of the red brigade wherein nine fires were set down as having occurred within the twentyfour hours the cause of this fire in ladbroke square was reported unknown  of the other eight the supposed causes were in one case escape of gas in another paraffinlamp upset in another intoxication in another spark from fire in another candle in another children playing with matches and so on but in this mansion none of these causes were deemed probable  the master of the house turned off the gas regularly every night before going to bed therefore it could not have been caused by escape of gas  paraffinlamps were not used in the house  candles were but they were always carefully handled and guarded  as to intoxication the most suspicious of mortals could not have dreamed of such a cause in so highly respectable a family  the fires were invariably put out at night and guards put on in every room therefore no spark could have been so audacious as to have leaped into being and on to the floor  there were indeed matches in the house but there were no children except one old lady who having reached her second childhood might perhaps have been regarded as a child  it is true there was a certain betty a housemaid whose fingers were reported by the cook to be all thumbs and who had an awkward and incurable tendency to spill and break and drop and fall over things on whom suspicion fastened very keenly at first but betty who was young and rather pretty asserted so earnestly that she had been unusually happy that night in having done nothing whatever of a condemnable nature and backed her asseverations with such floods of tears that she was exonerated and as we have said the cause was reported unknown  it was not however so completely unknown as was at first supposed there was a certain grave retiring modest individual who knew the gentleman of the house and his doings a little more thoroughly than was agreeable to the said gentleman and who had become aware in some unaccountable way which it is impossible to explain that he the said gentleman had very recently furnished the house in a sumptuous style and had insured it much beyond its value  the said individuals knowledge ultimately resulted in the said gentleman being convicted and transported for arson  but with all this we have nothing to do  whatever the uncertainty that afterwards arose as to the cause of the fire there could be no uncertainty as to the fire itself at the time  it blazed and roared so furiously that the inside of the house resembled a whitehot furnace flames spouted from the windows and chimneys glaring fiercely on the spectators who assembled rapidly from all quarters as if defying them all and daring the firemen to do their worst  sparks enough to have shamed all the roman candles ever made in or out of rome were vomited forth continuously and whirled away with volumes of dense black smoke into the wintry sky  its well alight observed a chimneysweep to a policeman  the policeman made no reply although it did seem as if it would have been quite safe even for a policeman to admit that the sweep was thoroughly correct  it was well alight so well that it seemed absolutely ridiculous to suppose that the firemen could make any impression on it at all  but the firemen did not appear to think the attempt ridiculous  never give in was or might have been their motto  it was their maxim to attack the enemy with promptitude and vigour no matter what his strength might be  when he crept out like a sneaking burglar from under a hearthstone or through an overheated flue they would have at him with the handpumps and quench him at once  when he came forth like a dashing party of skirmishers to devastate a woodyard or light up a musichall with unusual brilliancy they sent an engine or two against him without delay and put him down in an hour or two  when he attacked in force they despatched engine after enginemanuals and steamers to the front until he was quelled and if the prey already seized could not be wrenched from his grasp they at all events killed him before he could destroy more  when he boldly and openly declared war attacking the great combustible warehouses of tooley street threatening a descent on the shipping and almost setting the thames on fire they sent out the whole available army from every quarter of the metropolis with all their engines of warmanuals steamers and floating batteries or spouteries and fought him tooth and nail till he gave in  they might be terribly overmatchedas in the case of the great fire when the gallant braidwood fellthey might lose men and might have to fight day and night for weeks but they would never say die until the enemy had died and left them tired and torn but still tough and triumphant victors on the field of battle  before the engine from regent street came on the ground two manual engines from kensington and notting hill had arrived and opened water on the foe  at first their shot fell harmlessly on the roaring furnace but by the time the steamer had got ready for action some little effect was beginning to be produced  when this great gun so to speak began to play and sent a thick continuous stream through the windows like an inexhaustible water mitrailleuse clouds of white steam mingled with the black smoke and varied the aspect of the fire but did not appear to lessen its fury in any degree  just then another manual engine dashed into the square at full gallop and formed up  before it had well taken a position another steamer with three horses came swinging round the corner and fell into the ranks  the panting steeds were unharnessed the bold charioteers leaped down the suctionpipe was dipped into the watertrough and the hose attached  as two engines cannot drink at the same plug a canvas trough with an iron frame is put over the plug having a hole in its bottom which fits tightly round the plug  it quietly fills and thus two or more engines may do their work conviviallydip in their suctionpipes and drink simultaneously at the same fountain  down with her shouted the man who held the branch or nozzle at the end of the hose  a steam whistle gives a shrill short reply the engine quivers under the power of mans greatest servant and another battery opens on the foe  but london firemen are not content to play at long bowls  while the artillery goes thus vigorously into action the helmets of the men are seen gleaming and glancing everywhere amid the smoke searching for weak points turning the enemys flanks and taking him in rear  hose are dragged through neighbouring houses trailing their black coils like horrid water snakes through places were such things were never meant to be  if too short additional lengths are added again and again till the men who hold the branches gain points of vantage on adjoining roofs or outhouses until at last from below above in front and behind cataracts of water dash into the glowing furnace  the fireescape had been first to reach the ground after the alarm was given this being the instrument nearest to the scene of conflagration it happened that night to be in charge of david clazie a brother of comrade bob  being a smart young fellow david hadwith the assistance of two early risers who chanced to be at hand and the policeman on the beatrun up his escape and put it in position before the fire had gained its full force  the gentleman of the house had already got out and fled in his night garments but the fire had rendered the staircase impassable so that the cook the manythumbed betty and the old lady who was the gentlemans mother were imprisoned in the upper floor  david clazie did not learn this from the gentleman however  that amiable character had received such a fright that he had taken himself off no oneexcept the individual aforementionedknew whither fortunately betty announced the fact of her existence by rushing to a window and shrieking  david ran his escape towards the window mounted the ladder carried the damsel down bore her kicking into a neighbouring house and left her in fits  meanwhile the cook rushed to the same window shrieked and fell back halfsuffocated with the smoke which just then surrounded her  a policeman gallantly ran up the escape jumped into the room gathered up the cook with great difficultyfor she was unusually fat and the smoke very suffocating carried her down bore her to the same house where betty lay and left her there in violent hysterics  as neither of them could answer questions it could not be ascertained whether there were any more people in the burning house  david therefore explored it as far as was possible in the circumstances and much more than was safe for himself but found no one  after nearly choking himself therefore he drew aside the escape to prevent its being burned  when the engines came up however it was again brought into play to enable the firemen to get up with their branches to the upper windows  try that window dashwood said the officer of the station to which joe belonged pointing to a window on the second floor  there aint much smoke coming out  before he had done speaking joe and a comrade had pushed the escape towards the window in question  he ascended and leaped into the room but could scarcely see for the smoke  knowing that the air in a burning house is clearer near the floor he stooped as low as possible and went round the room guiding himself by the walls  coming to a door he seized the handle and tried to open it but found it locked and the handle so hot that he was forced to let go abruptly  he seized a chair tried to burst it open with a blow and shivered the chair to atoms but did not force the door  a powerful effort with his foot also failed  rushing to the window he got out on the escape and shouted  the axe lads look sharp and pass up the hose  well get at it here  a large heavy axe was handed up by one fireman while another let down a rope to which the end of the hose was attached and hauled up  joe seized the axe returned to the door and with one blow dashed it open  flames leaped upon him as if they had been eagerly awaiting the opportunity licked hungrily round his legs and kissed his whiskersof which by the way he was rather proud and with good reason for they were very handsome whiskers  but joe cared no more for them at that moment than he did for his boots  he was forced to retreat however to the window where bob clazie had already presented his branch and commenced a telling discharge on the fire  thats the way to do it muttered bob as he directed the branch and turned aside his head to avoid as much as possible the full volume of the smoke  lets get a breath o fresh air gasped joe dashwood endeavouring to squeeze past his comrade through the window  at that moment a faint cry was heard  it appeared to come from an inner room  some one there joe said bob clazie in a grave tone but without diverting his attention for an instant from the duty in which he was engaged  joe made no reply but at once leaped back into the room and a second time felt his way round the walls  he came on another door  one blow of the ponderous axe dashed it in and revealed a bedroom not quite so densely filled with smoke as the outer room  observing a bed looming through the smoke he ran towards it and struck his head against one of the posts so violently that he staggered  recovering he made a grasp at the clothes and felt that there was a human being wrapped tightly up in them like a bundle  a female shriek followed  joe dashwood was not the man to stand on ceremony in such circumstances  he seized the bundle straightened it out a little so as to make it more portable and throwing it over his shoulder made a rush towards the window by which he had entered  all this the young fireman did with considerable energy and haste because the density of the smoke was increasing and his retreat might be cut off by the flames at any moment  clear the way there he gasped on reaching the window  all right replied bob clazie who was still presenting his branch with untiring energy at the flames  joe passed out got on the head of the escape and holding the bundle on his shoulder with one hand grasped the rounds of the ladder with the other  he descended amid the cheers of the vast multitude which had by this time assembled to witness the fire  as joe hurried towards the open door of the nearest house betty with the thumbs rushed frantically out screaming missis oh my shell be burnt alive gracious help fire back room first floor oh my  be easy lass cried joe catching the flying domestic firmly by the arm and detaining her despite her struggles  let me go missis  i forgot her  here she is cried joe interrupting all safe  you come and attend to her  the reaction on poor bettys feelings was so great that she went into fits a second time and was carried with her mistress into the house where the cook still lay in violent hysterics  joe laid the bundle gently on the bed and looked quickly at the bystanders  observing several cool and collected females among them he pointed to the bundle which had begun to exhibit symptoms of life and said briefly shes all right look after her and vanished like a wreath of that smoke into which in another moment he plunged  he was not a moment too soon for he found bob clazie despite his fortitude and resolution on the point of abandoning the window where the smoke had increased to such a degree as to render suffocation imminent  cant stand it gasped bob scrambling a few paces down the ladder  give us the branch bob i saw where it was in fetchin out the old woman said joe in a stifled voice  he grasped the copper tube from which the water spouted with such force as to cause it to quiver and recoil like a living thing so that being difficult to hold it slipped aside and nearly fell  the misdirected waterspout went straight at the helmet of a policeman which it knocked off with the apparent force of a cannon shot plunged into the bosom of a stout collier whom it washed whiter than he had ever been since the days of infancy and scattered the multitude like chaff before the wind seeing this the foreman ordered number 3 engine which supplied the particular branch in question to cease pumping  joe recovered the erratic branch in a moment and dragged it up the escape bob who was now in a breatheable atmosphere helping to pass up the hose  the foreman who seemed to have acquired the power of being in several places at one and the same moment of time and whose watchful eye was apparently everywhere ordered bobs brother david and another man named ned crashington to go up and look after joe dashwood  meanwhile joe shouted down with number 3 by which he meant up with as much water as possible from number 3 and as fast as you can and sprang into the room from which he had just rescued the old woman  in passing out with her he had observed a glimmer of flame through the door which he had first broken open and which he reflected while descending the escape was just out of range of bob clazies branch  it was the thought of this that had induced him to hurry back so promptly in time as we have seen to relieve his comrade  he now pointed the branch at the precise spot and hit that part of the fire right in its heart  the result was that clouds of steam mingled with the smoke  but joe was human after all  the atmosphere or rather the want of atmosphere was too much for him  he was on the point of dropping the branch and rushing to the window for his life when ned crashington feeling his way into the room tumbled over him  speech was not required in the circumstances  ned knew exactly what to do and joe knew that he had been sent to relieve him  he therefore delivered the branch to ned and at once sprang out on the escape where he encountered david clazie  go in davy he cant stand it long gasped joe  no fears of im replied davy with a smile as he prepared to enter the window ned can stand hanythink amost  but i say send up some more ands  it takes two on us to old that ere branch you know  the brass helmets of more hands coming up the escape were observed as he spoke for the foreman saw that this was a point of danger and like a wise general had his reserves up in time  david clazie found ned standing manfully to the branch  ned was noted in the red brigade as a man who could stand amost anything and who appeared to cherish a martyrlike desire to die by roasting or suffocation  this was the more surprising that he was not a boastful or excitable fellow but a silent melancholy and stern man who except when in action usually seemed to wish to avoid observation  most of his comrades were puzzled by this compound of character but some of them hinted that crashingtons wife could have thrown some light on the subject  be this as it may whenever the chief or the foreman of the brigade wanted a man for any desperate work they invariably turned to ned crashington  not that ned was one whit more courageous or willing to risk his life than any of the other men all of whom it must be remembered were picked for courage and capacity for their special work but he combined the greatest amount of coolness with the utmost possible recklessness besides being unusually powerful so that he could be depended on for wise as well as desperate action  joe dashwood was thought to be almost equal to nedindeed in personal activity he was superior but there was nothing desperate in joes character  he was ever ready to dare anything with a sort of jovial alacrity but he did not appear like ned to court martyrdom  while ned and david subdued the flames above joe descended the escape and being by that time almost exhausted sat down to rest with several comrades who had endured the first shock of battle while fresh men were sent to continue the fight  have a glass joe said one of the firemen coming round with a bottle of brandy  no thank ee said joe i dont require it  hand it here said a man who stood leaning against the rails beside him my constitution is good like the british one but its none the worse for a drop o brandy after such tough work  there was probably truth in what the man said  desperate work sometimes necessitates a stimulant nevertheless there were men in the red brigade who did their desperate work on nothing stronger than water and joe was one of these  in three hours the fire was subdued and before noon of that day it was extinguished  the report of it as published by the chief of the firebrigade next morning recorded that a house in ladbroke square occupied by mr blank a gentleman whose business was privatein other words unknownhad been set on fire by some unknown cause that the whole tenement had been burnt out and the roof off and that the contents of the building were insured in the phoenix  some of the firemen were sent home about daybreak when the flames first began to be mastered  joe was among these  he found mary ready with a cup of hot coffee and the rosebud who had just awakened ready with a kiss  joe accepted the second swallowed the first stretched his huge frame with a sigh of weariness remarked to mary that he would turn in and in five minutes thereafter was snoring profoundly    chapter three  one pleasant afternoon in spring david clazie and ned crashington sat smoking together in front of the fire in the lobby of the station chatting of hairbreadth escapes by flood and fire  its cold enough yet to make a fire a very pleasant comradewen es inside the bars observed david  hm replied crashington  as this was not a satisfactory reply david said so and remarked further that ned seemed to be in the blues  wotever can be the matter wi you ned said david looking at his companion with a perplexed air youre a young smart ealthy fellar in a business quite to your mind an with a goodlookin young wife at ome not to mention a babby  wy wot more would you ave ned  you didnt ought for to look blue  praps not replied ned relighting his pipe and puffing between sentences but a man may be in a business quite to his mind and have a goodlooking wife and a babby and health to boot without bein exactly safe from an attack of the blues now and then dye see  it aint all gold that glitters  youve heard o that proverb no doubt  well yes replied clazie  ah  then theres another sayin which mayhap youve heard of too every mans got a skeleton in the cupboard  ive heard o that likewise said clazie but it aint true leastways i have got no skeleton in none o my cupboards an wots more if i ad id pitch him overboard  but what if he was too strong for you suggested ned  why theni dont know said clazie shaking his head  before this knotty point could be settled in a satisfactory manner the comrades were interrupted by the entrance of a man  he was a thickset illfavoured fellow with garments of a disreputable appearance and had a slouch that induced honest men to avoid his company  nevertheless ned crashington gave him a hearty good afternoon and shook hands  my brotherinlaw clazie said ned turning and introducing him mr sparks  clazie was about to say he was appy to etcetera but thought better of it and merely nodded as he turned to the grate and shook the ashes out of his pipe  youll come and have a cup of tea phil  maggie and i usually have it about this time  phil sparks said he had no objection to tea and left the station with ned leaving david clazie shaking his head with a look of profound wisdom  youre a bad lot you are growled david after the man was gone a werry bad lot indeed  having expressed his opinion to the clock for there was no one else present david thrust both hands into his pockets and went out to take an observation of the weather  meanwhile ned crashington led his brotherinlaw to his residence which like the abodes of the other firemen was close at hand entering it he found his skeleton waiting for him in the shape of his wife  she was anything but a skeleton in aspect being a stout handsome woman with a fine figure an aquiline nose and glittering black eyes  oh youve come at last she said in a sharp querulous tone almost before her husband had entered the room  full ten minutes late and i expected you sooner than usual tonight  i didnt know you expected me sooner maggie  heres phil come to have tea with us  oh phil how are you said mrs crashington greeting her brother with a smile and shaking him heartily by the hand  ah if youd only receive me with a smile like that how different it might be thought ned but he said nothing  now then stoopid cried mrs crashington turning quickly round on her husband as if to counteract the little touch of amiability into which she had been betrayed how long are you going to stand there in peoples way staring at the fire  what are you thinking of  i was thinking of you maggie  hm thinking no good of me i dare say replied maggie sharply  did your conscience tell you that asked ned with a heightened colour  maggie made no reply  one secret of her bad temper was that she had all her life been allowed to vent it and now that she was married she felt the necessity of restraining it very irksome  whenever she had gone far enough with ned and saw that he was not to be trifled with she found that she possessed not only power to control her temper but the sense now and then to do so  on the present occasion she at once busied herself in preparing tea while ned sat down opposite his brotherinlaw and taking fred his only child a handsome boy of about five years of age on his knee began to run his fingers through his jet black curly hair  did you get your tasks well today fred asked ned  no father  no repeated ned in surprise why not  because i was playin with may dashwood father  was that a good reason for neglecting your dooty demanded ned shaking his head reproachfully yet smiling in spite of himself  iss father replied the boy boldly  youre wrong fred  no doubt you might have had a worse reason but play is not a good reason for neglect of dooty  only thinkwhat would be said to me if i was called to a fire and didnt go because i wanted to play with may dashwood  but i was sent for pleaded fred  mrs dashwood had a bigoh such a big washin an sent to say if i might be let go an mother said i might so i went  ah that alters the case fred replied his father patting the boys head  to help a woman in difficulties justifies amost anything dont it phil  thus appealed to phil said that he didnt know and what was more he didnt care  now dont sit talkin nonsense but sit in to tea said mrs crashington  the stout firemans natural amiability had been returning like a flood while he conversed with fred but this sharp summons rather checked its flow and when he was told in an exasperating tone to hand the toast and not look like a stuck pig it was fairly stopped and his spirit sank to zero  have you got anything to do yet he asked of phil sparks by way of cheering up a little  no nothin replied sparks leastways nothin worth mentionin  i knew his last application would fail observed maggie in a quietly contemptuous tone  his last application had been made through neds influence and advice and that is how she came to know it would fail  ned felt a rising of indignation within him which he found it difficult to choke down because it was solely for his wifes sake that he had made any effort at all to give a helping hand to surly phil sparks for whom he entertained no personal regard  but ned managed to keep his mouth shut  although a passionate man he was not illtempered and often suffered a great deal for the sake of peace  london growled sparks in a tone of sulky remonstrance aint a place for a man to git on in  if youve the luck to have friends who can help you an are willin why its well enough but if you havent got friends its o no manner o use to try anything except pocketpickin or housebreakin  come phil said ned laughing as he helped himself to a huge round of buttered toast i ope you hant made up your mind to go in for either of them professions for they dont pay  they entail hard work small profits an great risknot to mention the dishonesty of em but i dont agree with you about london neither  you never agree with nobody about anythink observed mrs crashington in a low tone as if the remark were made to the teapot but ned heard it and his temper was sorely tried again for while the remark was utterly false as regarded himself it was particularly true as regarded his wife  however he let it pass and continued  you see phil london as you know is a big place the population of it being equal to that of all scotlandso im told though it aint easy to swallow that  now it seems to me that where theres so many people an so much doin it ought to be the very place for smart stout fellows like you  if i was you id  yes but you aint him interrupted mrs crashington testily so it wont do him much good to tell what you would or wouldnt do  ive heard of wives maggie who sometimes tried to be agreeable said ned gravely  if i dont suit you why did you marry me demanded maggie  ah why indeed said ned with a frown  at this critical point in the conversation little fred who was afraid that a storm was on the point of bursting forth chanced to overturn his tin mug of tea  his mother was one of those obtuse women who regard an accident as a sin to be visited by summary punishment  her usual method of inflicting punishment was by means of an openhanded slap on the side of the head on this occasion she dealt out the measure of justice with such goodwill that poor little fred was sent sprawling and howling on the floor  this was too much for ned who was a tenderhearted man  the blood rushed to his face he sprang up with such violence as to overturn his chair seized his cap and without uttering a word dashed out of the room and went downstairs three steps at a time  what ned meant to do or where to go of course no one could tell for he had no definite intentions in his own mind but his energies were unexpectedly directed for him  on rushing out at the street door he found himself staggering unexpectedly in the arms of bob clazie  hullo  bob whats up  turn out said bob as he wheeled round and ran to the next firemans door  ned understood him  he ran smartly to the station and quickly put on helmet belt and axe  already the engine was out and the horses were being harnessed  in two minutes the men were assembled and accoutred in three they were in their placesthe whip cracked and away they went  it was a good blazing roaring soulstirring firea drysalters warehouse with lots of inflammable materials to give it an intense heart of heat and fanned by a pretty stiff breeze into ungovernable furyyet it was as nothing to the fire that raged in neds bosom  if he had hated his wife or been indifferent to her he would in all probability like too many husbands have sought for congenial society elsewhere and would have been harsh to her when obliged to be at home but ned loved his wife and would have made any sacrifice if by so doing he could have smoothed her into a more congenial spirit  when therefore he found that his utmost efforts were of no avail and that he was perpetually goaded and twitted and tweaked for every little trifle his spirit was set alightas he at last remarked in confidence to david clazieand all the fireengines in europe asia africa and america couldnt put it out  the drysalters premises seemed to have been set on fire for poor neds special benefit that night  they suited his case exactly  there was more than the usual quantity of smoke to suffocate and fire to roast him  there was considerable danger too so that the daring men of the brigade were in requestif we may say that of a brigade in which all the men were daringand ned had congenial work given him to do  the proverbial meeting of greek with greek was mere childs play to this meeting of fire with fire  the inflamed ned and the blazing drysalter met in mortal conflict and the result was tremendous  it made his brother firemen stand aghast with awful admiration to observe the way in which ned dashed up tottering staircases and along smokechoked passages where lambent flames were licking about in search of oxygen to feed on and the way in which he hurled down brick walls and hacked through wood partitions and tore up firplanking and seized branch and hose and dragging them into holeandcorner places and out upon dizzy beams and ridge poles dashed tons of water in the fires face until it hissed again  it was a fine example of the homoeopathic principle that like cures like for the fire in neds bosom did wonders that night in the way of quenching the fire in the drysalters warehouse  when this had gone on for an hour and the fire was at its height ned quite exhausted descended to the street and sitting down on the pavement leaned against a rail  if you goes on like that ned said bob clazie coming up to him youll bust yourself  i wish i could said ned  at that moment bobs brother david came towards them with the brandy bottle  have a glass ned you need it said david  ned although not a teetotaller was one of the men who did not require spirits and therefore seldom took more than a sip but he now seized the glass and drained it eagerly  another he cried holding it up  david refilled it with a look of some surprise  ned drained it a second time  now said he springing up and tightening his belt im all right come along bob  with that he rushed into the burning house and in a few seconds was seen to take the branch from a fireman on one of the upper floors and drag it out on a charred beam that overhung the fire  the spot on which they stood was brilliantly illuminated and it was seen that the fireman remonstrated with ned but the latter thrust him away and stepped out on the beam  he stood there black as ebony with a glowing background of red walls and fire and the crowd cheered him for his unwonted courage but the cheer was changed abruptly into a cry of alarm as the beam gave way and ned fell head foremost into the burning ruins  the chief of the brigadedistinguishable everywhere by his tall figureobserved the accident and sprang towards the place  if hes not killed by the fall hes safe from the fire for it is burnt out there he remarked to david clazie who accompanied him before they reached the place joe dashwood and two other men had rushed in  they found ned lying on his back in a mixture of charcoal and water almost buried in a mass of rubbish which the falling beam had dragged down along with it  in a few seconds this was removed and ned was carried out and laid on the pavement with a coat under his head  theres no cut anywhere that i can see said joe dashwood examining him  his fall must have been broke by goin through the lath and plaster o the ceilin below suggested bob clazie  at that moment there was a great crash followed by a loud cry and a cheer from the multitude as the roof fell in sending up a magnificent burst of sparks and flame in the midst of which ned crashington was borne from the field of battle  while this scene was going on mrs crashington and her brother were still seated quietly enjoying their teaat least enjoying it as much as such characters can be said to enjoy anything  when ned had gone out as before mentioned phil remarked  i wouldnt rouse him like that mag if i was you  but hes so aggravatin pleaded mrs crashington  he aint half so aggravatin as you are replied phil gruffly  i dont understand your temper at all  you take all the hard words i give you as meek as a lamb but if he only offers to open his mouth you fly at him like a turkeycock  however its no business o mine and now he added rising i must be off  so you wont tell me before you go what sort of employment youve got  no replied phil shortly  why not phil  because i dont want you to know and i dont want your husband to know  but i wont tell him phil  ill take good care you cant tell him returned phil as he fastened a worsted comforter round his hairy throat  its enough for you to know that i aint starvin and that the work pays though it aint likely to make my fortin  saying this mr sparks condescended to give his sister a brief nod and left the house  he had not been gone much more than a couple of hours when mrs crashington having put little fred to sleep was roused from a reverie by the sound of several footsteps outside followed by a loud ring at the bell she opened the door quickly and her husband was borne in and laid on his bed  not dead exclaimed the woman in a voice of agony  no missus not dead said david clazie but hardly better i fear  when maggie looked on the poor bruised form with garments torn to shreds and so covered with charcoal water lime and blood as to be almost an indistinguishable mass she could not have persuaded herself that he was alive had not a slight heaving of the broad chest told that life still remained  its a orrible sight that missus said david clazie with a look that seemed strangely stern  it isoh it isterrible said mrs crashington scarce able to suppress a cry  ah youd better take a good look at it added clazie for its your own doing missus  maggie looked at him in surprise but he merely advised her to lend a hand to take the clothes off as the doctor would be round in a minute so she silently but actively busied herself in such duties as were necessary  meanwhile phil sparks went about the streets of london attending to the duties of his own particular business  to judge from appearances it seemed to be rather an easy occupation for it consisted mainly in walking at a leisurely pace through the streets and thoroughfares with his hands in his pockets and a pipe in his mouth  meditation also appeared to be an important branch of this business for phil frequently paused in front of a large mansion or a magnificent shop and gazed at it so intently that one might have almost fancied he was planning the best method of attempting a burglary although nothing was farther from phils intentions  still his meditations were sometimes so prolonged that more than one policeman advised him quite in a friendly way to move on  apparently however phil turned over no profit on this business and was about to return home supperless to bed when he suddenly observed smoke issuing from an upper window  rare and lucky chance  he was the first to observe it  he knew that the first who should convey the alarm of fire to a firestation would receive a shilling for his exertions he dashed off at once had the firemen brought to the spot in a few minutes so that the fire was easily and quickly overcome  thus honest phil sparks earned his supper and the right to go home and lay his head on his pillow with the happy consciousness of having done a good action to his fellowmen and performed a duty to the public and himself    chapter four  it is probable that there is not in all the wide world a manno matter how depraved or illfavoured or unattractivewho cannot find some sympathetic soul some one who will be glad to see him and find more or less pleasure in his society  coarse in body and mind though philip sparks was there dwelt a young woman in one of the poorest of the poor streets in the neighbourhood of thames street who loved him and would have laid down her life for him  to do martha reading justice she had fallen in love with sparks before intemperance had rendered his countenance repulsive and his conduct brutal  when perceiving the power he had over her he was mean enough to borrow and squander the slender gains she made by the laborious work of dressmakingcompared to which coalheaving must be mere childs playshe experienced a change in her feelings towards him which she could not easily understand or define  her thoughts of him were mingled with intense regrets and anxieties and she looked forward to his visits with alarm  yet those thoughts were not the result of dying affection she felt quite certain of that having learned from experience that many waters cannot quench love  one evening about eight oclock phil sparks having prosecuted his business up to that hour without success tapped at the door of marthas garret and entered without waiting for permission indeed his tapping at all was a rather unwonted piece of politeness  come in phil said martha rising and shaking hands after which she resumed her work  you seem busy tonight remarked sparks sitting down on a broken chair beside the fireless grate and taking out his bosom companion a short black pipe which he began to fill  i am always busy said martha with a sigh  an it dont seem to agree with you to judge from your looks rejoined the man  this was true  the poor girls pretty face was thin and very pale and haggard  i was up all last night she said and feel tired now and theres not much chance of my getting to bed tonight either because the lady for whom i am making this must have it by tomorrow afternoon at latest  here mr sparks muttered something very like a malediction on ladies in general and on ladies who must have dresses in particular  your fires dead out martha he added poking among the ashes in search of a live ember  yes phil its out  i cant afford fire of an evening besides it aint cold just now  you can afford matches i suppose growled phil ah here they are useful things matches not only for lightin a fellers pipe with but also forwell so she must have it by tomorrow afternoon must she  yes so my employer tells me  an shell not take no denial wont she  i believe not replied martha with a faint smile which like a gleam of sunshine on a dark landscape gave indication of the brightness that might have been if grey clouds of sorrow had not overspread her sky  whats the ladys name martha  middleton  and were abouts may she live  in conway street knightsbridge  the number  number 6 i believe but why are you so particular in your inquiries about her said martha looking up for a moment from her work while the faint gleam of sunshine again flitted over her face  why you see martha replied phil gazing through the smoke of his pipe with a sinister smile it makes a feller feel koorious to hear the partiklers about a lady wot must have things an wont take no denial  if i was you now id disappoint her an see how shed take it  he wound up his remark which was made in a bantering tone with another malediction which was earnest enoughsavagely so  oh  phil cried the girl in an earnest tone of entreaty dont oh dont swear so  it is awful to think that god hears you is near you at your very elbowwhile you thus insult him to his face  the man made no reply but smoked with increasing intensity while he frowned at the empty fireplace  well martha he said after a prolonged silence ive got work at last  have you cried the girl with a look of interest  yes it aint much to boast of to be sure but it pays and as it ties me to nothin an nobody it suits my taste well  im wot you may call a appendage o the firebrigade  i hangs about the streets till i sees a fire wen off i goes full split to the nearest firestation calls out the engine and gits the reward for bein first to give the alarm  indeed said martha whose face which had kindled up at first with pleasure assumed a somewhat disappointed look ii fear you wont make much by that phil  you dont seem to make much by that retorted phil pointing with the bowl of his pipe to the dress which lay in her lap and streamed in a profusion of rich folds down to the floor  not much assented martha with a sigh  well then continued phil relighting his pipe and pausing occasionally in his remarks to admire the bowl that bein so you and i are much in the same fix so if we unites our small incomes of course thatll make em just double the size  phil said martha in a lower voice as she let her hands and the work on which they were engaged fall on her lap i think now that it will never be  whatll never be demanded the man rudely looking at the girl in surprise  our marriage  what are you going to jilt me  heaven forbid said martha earnestly  but you and i are not as we once were phil we differ on many points  i feel sure that our union would make us more miserable than we are  come come cried the man half in jest and half in earnest  this kind of thing will never do  you mustnt joke about that old girl else ill have you up for breach of promise  mr sparks rose as he spoke knocked the ashes out of his pipe put it in his waistcoat pocket and prepared to go  martha he said im goin off now to attend to my business but i havent made a rap yet today and its hard working on a empty stomach so i just looked in to light my pipe and enquire if you hadnt got a shillin about you eh  the girl looked troubled  oh very well cried sparks with an offended air if you dont want to accommodate me never mind i can get it elsewhere  stop cried martha taking a leathern purse from her pocket  well it would have been rather hard he said returning and holding out his hand  there take it said martha you shouldnt judge too quickly  you dont know why i looked put out  it is my  she stopped short and then said hurriedly dont drink it phil  no i wont  im hungry  ill eat it  thankee  with a coarse laugh he left the room and poor martha sat down again to her weary toil which was not in any degree lightened by the fact that she had just given away her last shilling  a moment after the door opened suddenly and mr sparks looked in with a grin which did not improve the expression of his countenance  i say i wouldnt finish that dress tonight if i was you  why not phil asked the girl in surprise  cause the lady wont want it tomorrow arternoon  how do you know that  no matter  its by means of a kind of secondsight ive got that i find out amany things  all i can say is that ive got a strong suspiciona what dye call ita presentiment that mrs middleton of number 6 conway street knightsbridge wont want her dress tomorrow so i advise you to go to bed tonight  without waiting for a reply mr sparks shut the door and descended to the street  purchasing and lighting a cheroot at the nearest tobacco shop with part of marthas last shilling he thrust his hands into his pockets and sauntering along various small streets and squares gave his undivided attention to business  for a man whose wants were rather extensive and urgent the business did not seem a very promising one  he glanced up at the houses as he sauntered along appearing almost to expect that some of them would undergo spontaneous combustion for his special accommodation occasionally he paused and gazed at a particular house with rapt intensity as if he hoped the light which flashed from his own eyes would set it on fire but the houses being all regular bricks refused to flare up at such a weak insult  finding his way to trafalgar square mr sparks threw away the end of his cheroot and mending his pace walked smartly along piccadilly until he gained the neighbourhood of knightsbridge  here he purchased another cheroot and while lighting it took occasion to ask if there was a street thereabouts named conway street  yes sir there is said a small and exceedingly pert crossingsweeper who chanced to be standing near the open door of the shop and overheard the question  ill show you the way for a copper sir but silver preferred if youre so disposed  whereabouts is it asked mr sparks of the shopman regardless of the boy  round the corner to your right and after that second turning to your left  oh thats all wrong cried the boy  wy ow should ee know hanythink about streets  never goes nowheres does nothink but sell snuff an pigtail mornin noon and night  ee should have said right round the corner to your right and ee should have added sir for thats right wen a genlmns spoke to arter wich wen youve left this ere street take second turnin to your left if youre leftanded an then you come hall right  thats ow ee ought to have said it sir  in the midst of this flow of information mr sparks emerged into the street  ill show you the way for love sir if you aint got no money said the boy in a tone of mock sincerity stepping up and touching his cap  let im alone bloater cried another and smaller boy dont you see ees one of the swell mob an dont want to ave too much attention drawed to him  no ee aint little jim ees only a genlmn in disguise replied the bloater sidling up to mr sparks and urgently repeating show you the way for a copper sir only a copper  mr sparks being as we have said an irascible man and particularly out of humour that evening did not vouchsafe a reply but turning suddenly round gave the bloater a savage kick that turned him head over heels into the road  the bloater whose proper name was robert herring from which were derived the aliases raw herring and the bloater immediately recovered himself and rushed at mr sparks with his broom  he was a strong resolute passionate boy yet withal goodhumoured and placable  in the first burst of indignation he certainly meant to commit a violent assault but he suddenly changed his mind  perhaps the look and attitude of his antagonist had something to do with the change perhaps the squeaky voice of little jim shouting hooray bloater go in an win may have aroused his sense of the ludicrous which was very strong and helped to check him  at all events instead of bringing his broom down on the head of mr sparks bloater performed an impromptu wardance round him and flourished his weapon with a rapidity that was only surpassed by the rapid flow of his language  now then gunpowder come on wot do you mean by iteh  you lowminded son of a peppercastor  who let you out o the cruetstand wot dee mean by raisin yer dirty foot agin a honest man wch you aint an never was an never will be an never could be seein that both your respected parients was anged afore you was born  come on i say  you aint a coward air you  if so ill and you over to little jim ere an stand by to see fair play  during this outburst mr sparks had quietly faced the excited boy watching his opportunity to make a dash at him but the appearance of a policeman put a sudden termination to the riot by inducing the bloater and little jim to shoulder their brooms and fly  mr sparks smiling grimly he never smiled otherwise thrust his hands into his pockets resumed his cheroot and held on the even tenor of his way  but he had not yet done with the bloater  that volatile and revengeful youth having run on in advance ensconced himself behind a projection at the corner of the street close to which sparks had to pass and from that point of vantage suddenly shot into his ear a yell so excruciating that it caused the man to start and stagger off the pavement before he could recover himself his tormentor had doubled round the corner and vanished  growling savagely he continued his walk  one of the turns to the left which he had to make led him through a dark and narrow street  here keeping carefully in the middle of the road for security he looked sharply on either side having his hands out of his pockets now and clenched for he fully expected another yell  he was wrong however in his expectations  the bloater happened to know of a long ladder whose nightly place of repose was on the ground in a certain dark passage with its end pointing across that street  taking up a position beside this ladder with little jimwho followed him almost bursting with delighthe bided his time and kept as quiet as a mouse  just in the nick of time the ladder was run out and mr sparks tripping over it fell violently to the ground  he sprang up and gave chase of course but he might as well have followed a willothewisp  the young scamps doubling like hares took refuge in a dark recess under a stair with which they were well acquainted and from that position they watched their enemy  they heard him go growling past knew a moment or two later from the disappointed tone of the growl that he had found the opening at the other end of the passage heard him return growling and saw him for a moment in the dim light of the entrance as he left the place  then swiftly issuing from their retreat they followed  i say bloater whispered little jim ees got such an ugly mug that i do blieve ees up to some game or other  praps ee is returned the bloater meditatively well let im alone an foller im up  the prolonged season of peace that followed induced mr sparks to believe that his tormentors had left him he therefore dismissed them from his mind and gave himself entirely to business  arrived at conway street he found that it was one of those semigenteel streets in the immediate neighbourhood of kensington gardens wherein dwell thriving tradespeople who know themselves to be rising in the world and unfortunate members of the upper ten who know that they have come down in the world but have not ceased the struggle to keep up appearances  it was a quiet unfrequented street in which the hum of the surrounding city sounded like the roar of a distant cataract  here mr sparks checked his pacestoppedand looked about him with evident caution  ho ho whispered little jim  weve tracked im down replied the bloater with a chuckle  mr sparks soon found number 6  on the door a brass plate revealed mrs middleton  ha she must have it must she an wont take no denial muttered the man between his teeth  mr sparks observed that one of the lower windows was open which was not to be wondered at for the weather was rather warm at the time  he also observed that the curtains of the window were made of white flowered muslin and that they swayed gently in the wind not far from a couple of candles which stood on a small table  there was no one in the room at the time  strange muttered mr sparks with a grim smile that people will leave lights so near muslin curtains  most ordinary people would have thought the candles in question at a sufficiently safe distance from the curtains but mr sparks apparently thought otherwise  he entertained peculiar views about the danger of fire  from the position which the two boys occupied they could not see the man while he was thus engaged in examining and commenting on number 6 conway street but they saw him quite well when he crossed the street which had only one side to it a wall occupying the other and they saw him still better in the course of a few seconds when a bright light suddenly streamed towards him and illumined his villainous countenance and they heard as well as saw him the next instant when he shouted firefire and rushed frantically away  hallo exclaimed the bloater and dashed off at full speed  little jim echoed the sentiment and followed  robert alias raw herring was a sharpwitted lad  he understood the case partly at least in a moment and proceeded to appropriate action  being intimately acquainted with that part of london he took a short cut overshot mr sparks and was first to give the alarm at the firestation  when therefore mr sparks ran in panting and shouting fire great was his surprise to find the men already roused and the horses being attached to the engine  where away inquired one of the firemen supposing that sparks perhaps brought information of another fire  number 6 conway street he gasped  all right weve got the noos already  the boys brought it  the bloater with a mouth extending from ear to ear and all his teeth displayed uttered the single word sold as mr sparks turned his eyes on him  one glance was enough  the man became very pale and suddenly left the station amid a shout of laughter from the firemen as they leaped on the engine and drove away followed by the two boys whose spirits were already excited to the highest pitch of ecstasy by a fire  it was early morning before the fire was subdued and number 6 left the blackened skeleton of a house  long before that the bloater and little jim had sought repose in the cartshed of a neighbouring stable  long before that mr philip sparks had retired to rest growling anathemas on the heads of boys in general and crossingsweepers in particular and not very long before that poor martha reading had put in the last stitch of her work and fallen into a profound sleep in her chair  mr sparks turned out to be a true prophet  mrs middleton did not insist on having her dress home that afternoon and when martha true to her promise conveyed it to number 6 conway street she found no one there to receive it except a few drenched men of the red brigade and the police    chapter five  mr philip sparks though not naturally fond of society was nevertheless obliged to mingle occasionally with that unpleasant body for the purpose of recruiting his finances  he would rather have remained at home and enjoyed his pipe and beer in solitude but that was not possible in the circumstances  owing no doubt to the selfishness of the age in which he lived people would not go and pour money into his pockets entreat him to accept of the same and then retire without giving him any farther trouble  on the contrary even when he went out and took a great deal of trouble to obtain moneymuch more trouble than he would have had to take had he been an honest working manpeople refused to give it to him but freely gave him a good deal of gratuitous advice instead and sometimes threatened the donation of other favours which in many instances are said to be more numerous than hapence  things in general being in this untoward condition mr sparks went out one morning and entered into society  society did not regard him with a favourable eye but sparks was not thinskinned he persevered being determined come what might to seek his fortune  poor fellow like many a man in this world who deems himself a most unlucky fellow he had yet to learn the lesson that fortunes must be wrought for not sought for if they are to be found  finding society gruffer than usual that morning and not happening to meet with his or anybody elses fortune in any of the streets through which he passed he resolved to visit martha readings abode did so and found her not at home  with despairing disgust he then went to visit his sister  mrs crashington was obviously at home for she opened the door to him and held up her finger  hallo mag exclaimed sparks a little surprised  hush said mrs crashington admitting him speak low  thus admonished mr sparks asked in a hoarse whisper what was up  neds had a bad fall phil whispered mrs crashington in a tremulous tone that was so unlike her usual voice as to make sparks look at her in surprise not unmingled with anxiety  you dont mean to say mag that hes agoin totoknock under  i hope not phil butthe doctor  here the poor woman broke down altogether and sobbed quietly as she led her brother through the house and into the little bedroom where the injured fireman lay  neds bruised burned and lacerated frame was concealed under a patchwork coverlet  only his face was visible but that although the least injured part of his body was so deadly pale that even mr sparks was solemnised by the supposition that he was in the presence of death  oh ned ned exclaimed maggie unable to repress her grief can youcan you ever forgive me  she laid her hand on the firemans broad breast and passionately kissed his brow  he opened his eyes and whispered with difficulty forgive you maggie god for ever bless you  he could say no more owing to excessive weakness  come missus you mustnt disturb him said david clazie emerging from behind the curtains at the foot of the bed  the doctors orders was strictto keep im quiet  youd better go into the other room an your brother likewise  praps you might send im to tell joe dashwood to be ready  david clazie who was more a man of action than of words quietly but firmly ejected the brother and sister from the little room while he was speaking and having shut the door sat down at his post again as a guard over his sick comrade  seems to me its all up with im observed sparks as he stood gazing uneasily into the fire  as mrs crashington replied only by sobbing he continued after a few minutes  does the doctor say its all up mag  no oh no replied the poor woman he dont quite say so but i cant git no comfort from that  ned has lost such a quantity of blood it seems impossible for him to git round  theyre goin to try a operation on im today but i cant understand it an dont believe in it  they talk of puttin noo blood into im  an that reminds me that the doctor is to be here at twelve  do run round phil to the dashwoods and tell joe to be here in good time  whats joe wanted for  never mind but go and tell him that  i cant talk just now she said pushing her brother out of the room  tapping at joe dashwoods door phil received from a strong deep voice permission to come in  he entered and found a very different state of things from that which he had just left  a bright room and bright happy faces  the windows were bright which made the light appear brighter than usual the grate was bright the furniture was bright the face of the clock whose interior seemed about to explode on every occasion of striking the hour was brightalmost to smiling and the potlids dishcovers etcetera were brightso bright as to be absolutely brilliant  joe dashwood and his little wife were conversing near the window but although their faces were unquestionably bright by reason of contentment coupled with a free use of soap and the jacktowel there was nevertheless a shade of sadness in their looks and tones  nothing of the sort however appeared on the countenances of the rosebud and young fred crashington  these gushing little offshoots of the red brigade were too young to realise the danger of neds condition but they were quite old enough to create an imaginary fire in the cupboard which they were wildly endeavouring to extinguish with a poker for a branch and a bucket for a fireengine when mr sparks entered  oh kik feddy kik put it out kik or itll bun down all e house cried little may eagerly as she tossed back a cataract of golden curls from her flushed countenance and worked away at the handle of the bucket with all her might  all right shouted fred who had been sent to play with the rosebud that he might be out of the way  down with number 1 thats your sort keep er goin hooray  he brought the poker down with an awful whack on the cupboard at this point causing the crockery to rattle again  hallo youngster mind what youre about cried joe else there will be more damage caused by the engine than the firenot an uncommon thing either in our practice  it was at this point that he replied to mr sparkss knock  come in mr sparks youve heard of your poor brotherinlaws accident i suppose  yes ive just comed from his house with a message  youre wanted to be there in good time  all right ill be up to time said joe putting on his coat and cap and smiling to his wife as he added its a queer sort o thing to do well be bloodrelations ned and i after this  look after these youngsters molly else theyll knock your crockery to bits  goodday mr sparks  goodday replied sparks as joe went out  then turning to mrs dashwood what sort of operation is it theyre goin to perform on ned  did you not hear  its a very curious one  ned has lost so much blood from a deep cut in his leg that the doctors say he cant recover no matter how strong his constitution is unless he gits some blood put into him so theyre goin to put some o my joes blood into him  what exclaimed sparks take blood out o your husband and put it hot and livin into ned  no no ive got a pretty big swallow but i cant git that down  if you cant swallow it youll have to bolt it then for its a fact returned mary with a laugh  but how do they mean to go about it asked sparks with an unbelieving expression of countenance  well i aint quite sure about that replied mary they say that the doctor cuts a hole in a vein of the arms of both men and puts a pipe or something of that sort into the two veins and so lets the blood run from the one man into the other  i dont half believe it myself to say truth but its quite true that theyre goin to try it on ned  the doctor says it has bin tried before with great success and that the main thing is to get a stout healthy young man to take the blood from they thought at first to get a healthy youth from the country but my joe begged so hard to let him supply his friend and comrade with what they wanted that they agreed and now hes off to have it done  aint it funny  funny exclaimed sparks well it is just  but im not such a fool as to believe that they can pump the blood out o one man into another in that fashion  i hope they can for poor neds sake said mary in a sad tone as she stirred a large pot which stood simmering on the fire  there was a short silence after that for mary was thinking of the strange operation that was probably going on at that moment and phil sparks was debating with himself as to the propriety of attempting to induce mrs dashwood to lend him a shilling or two  he could not easily make up his mind however not because he was ashamed to ask it but because he was afraid of receiving a rebuke from the pretty little woman  he knew that she and martha reading were intimate friends and he had a suspicion that mrs dashwood was aware of marthas fondness for him and that she bore him no good will in consequence  besides although one of the sweetest tempered women in london mary was one whose indignation could be roused and whose clear blue eye had something overawing in it especially to scoundrels  he therefore sat there more than an hour conversing on various subjects while mary busied herself in household matters which she occasionally left off in order to assist in extinguishing the fire in the cupboard  at last sparks resolved to make the attempt and thought he would begin by trying to propitiate mary by commenting on her child  thats a pretty little girl of yours missis he remarked in a casual way  that she is cried mary catching up the child and kissing her rosy face all over and shes better than prettyshes good good as gold  oh top ma  let may down kik  fire not out yit  thats right never give in may  wot a jolly fireman youd make cried fred still directing all his energies to the cupboard  thats a queer sort o helmet the boys got on said sparks alluding to a huge leathern headpiece of a curious oldfashioned form which was rolling about on the boys head being much too large for him  it was bought for him by my joe in an old curiosity shop said mary  ha replied sparks  well missis dashwood ill have to be goin though i havent got no business to attend tostill a man must keep movin about you know specially wen hes had no breakfast an hant got nothin to buy one  thats a sad condition said mary pursing her lips for she knew the man  it is missis  you couldnt lend me halfacrown could you  no i couldnt replied the little woman with decision while her cheeks reddened moreover i wouldnt if i could  you ought to be ashamed of yourself mr sparks its a disgrace for a man of your strength and years to be goin about borrowing as youre in the habit of doin and you have got the impudence too to be running after poor martha reading but you shall never get her if i can prevent it  mr sparks was much nettled by the first part of mrs dashwoods speech the last part put him in a towering passion  he started up but had the wisdom to restrain himself to some extent  perhaps he said between his teeth you cant prevent it missis  perhaps not but i shall try  at that moment master fred crashington chanced to stumble in his energetic attempts to extinguish the fire in the cupboard which the rosebud assured him in excited tones was not out yit gittin wus an wus  in falling the oldfashioned helmet flew off and the comb of it hit mr sparks a severe blow on the shinbone  in the heat of the moment he dealt fred a violent slap on the cheek which sent him tumbling and howling on the floor  at that moment the door opened and joe dashwood entered  he had heard the noise before entering and now stood with a stern frown on his face as he gazed at his wife and her visitor  did you do that he demanded of sparks pointing to the little boy  he did joe said mary but  joe waited for no more  he seized mr sparks by the nape of the neck with a grip that almost choked himstrong though he wasand thrust him out of the room down the stairs and out into the street where he gave him a final kick and shut the door  oh dear joe exclaimed mary on his return you shouldnt have been so violent to im  wy not molly  surely you would not have me stand by and look on while he insulted you and knocked down the boy  no but it would have been a better rebuke if you had ordered him off quietly  no good ever comes of violence joe and hes such a spiteful vindictive man that he will never forgive youperhaps hell do you a mischief if he ever gets the chance  i hope he will never get the chance replied joe  i hope not but i fear him said mary  but tell me joe how has the operation succeeded  firstrate molly  ned and i are bloodrelations now  i dont know how much they took out o me but it dont signify for i am none the worse an poor ned seems much the better  here joe entered into a minute detail of all that had been donehow a puncture had been made in one of the veins of his arm and another in one of the veins of neds arm and how the end of a small tube with a bulb in the middle of it had been inserted into his puncture and the other end into neds puncture and the blood pumped as it were from the fullblooded man into the injured man until it was supposed that he had had enough of it and how ned had already shown signs of revival while he joe didnt feel the loss at all as was made abundantly evident by the energetic manner in which he had kicked mr sparks out of his house after the operation was over  to all this mary listened with wide open eyes and fred crashington listened with wider open eyes and little rosebud listened with eyes and mouth equally opennot that she understood anything of it but because the others were in that condition  now may my pet cried the fireman catching up his little one and tossing her in the air ned that is so fond of you is a bloodrelation so you may call him uncle next time he comesuncle ned  unkil ned lisped the rosebud  and me cousin chimed in fred  isscuzn responded may  just so cried joe seizing fred round the waist and tossing him on his right shoulderrosebud being already on his leftcome ill carry you down the fireescape now hurrah down we go  how long joe would have gone on playing with the children we cannot say for he was interrupted by the entrance of bob and david clazie  come along joe said the latter its your turn to go along with us to drill  its ard work to ave to go playin at fires doorin the day an puttin of em out doorin the night joe aint it said bob clazie  so tis bob but it must be done you know  duty first pleasure afterwards replied joe with a laugh  besides the green hands could never learn how to do it if they hadnt some of the old uns to show em the way  hall right replied bob come along  they left the room with a hearty goodday to mrs dashwood and a nod to the children  putting on the round sailors caps which replaced the helmets when they were not on actual service the three firemen took their way towards the city and finally reached a large piece of open ground where a number of very old houses had been partly pulled down to be soon replaced by new ones  the firebrigade had obtained permission to perform their drill there until the ground should be required  it was a curious waste place in the heart of the great city with rubbish cumbering the ground in front of the half demolished houses here several ungainly fireescapes leaned against the ruined walls and thrust their heads through broken windows or stood on the ground rampant as if eager to have their heads crammed into smoke and flames here also were several manual engines with their appropriate gearing and hose and near to these were grouped a band of as fine fresh muscular young fellows as one could wish to see  these were the new hands of the brigadethe young men recently engaged who were undergoing drill  each was a picked and to some extent a proved man the lightest and least powerful among these men was a sturdy courageous fellow  he like the others had been tried at an old fireescape which stood in a corner of the yard and which was unusually large and cumbrous  if he had failed to work various portions of that escape singlehanded without assistance he would have been pronounced physically unfit for the service  courage and strength alone would not have been sufficient  weight to a certain extent was essential  among these youths were several of the older hands and one or two officers of the brigade the latter being distinguished by brass ornaments or brasses on their shoulders  they were there to superintend and direct  in the midst of them stood their chief explaining the minutiae of the work they had to do  when our three firemen reached the drillground the chief was showing his recruits how to coil several lengths of the hose so as to avoid a twist or kink which might endanger its bursting when the water was turned suddenly on by the powerful steamers  he then pointed to the tall empty buildings beside him and ordered his recruits to go into the third floor of the premises drag up the hose and bring the branch to bear on the back rooms in which fire was supposed to be raging  look alive now he said see how quickly youll manage it  instantly the active youths sprang to their work  some got the hose out of the box of an engine and uncoiled it length by length towards the house others screwed the lengths together at the same time that the watertrough was being set up and the suctionpipe attached  meanwhile some had run up into the building and from an upper window let down a rope so as to be ready to drag up the hose when it was made long enough to reach them  thus they practised during the forenoon the mimic warfare with the flames which they should have to carry into actual operation at night  in another part of the yard a foreman was instructing some recruits in the use of the fireescape  under a neighbouring archway stood a small group of idlers looking on at these stirring operations one of these was philip sparks another was the bloater  the interests of the first had taken him there the second had been led to the scene by his affections  sparks did not observe the bloater but the bloater being unusually sharp had observed sparks and with a look of surprise and glee at the unexpected sight set himself to watch and listen  thats him growled sparks in a low whisper pointing to joe dashwood as he entered the yard  this was said to a darkskinned illlooking powerful man who stood at his elbow  the man nodded in reply  take a good look at him jeff youll know him again  jeff nodded and guessed that he would  well then westend friday at 12 pm number 5 close to the firestation  you wont forget whispered sparks as he and his illlooking friend slunk away  i say observed the bloater poking little jim in the ribs and looking down at him with one eye shut you and i shall form an engagement for friday nightshant we  little jim opened his eyes very wide pressed his mouth very tight and nodded his head violently  well then continued the bloater repeating sparkss words in a deep stage whisper westend friday at 12 pm number 5 close to the firestation  you wont forget  little jim again nodded his head and uttered a little shriek of delight  this attracted the notice of a policeman who hinted as delicately as possible that the boys had better move on  they took the hint and retired precipitately    chapter six  oh but it was an interesting occupation to watch the expression of little jims countenance as the bloater watched it while the two boys were on their way to the westend that evening bent on doing duty as amateur watchmen on number 5 close to the firestation  your face aint cherubic observed the bloater looking down at his little friend  if anythink i should say it partakes of the diabolic so youve got no occasion to make it wus than it is by twistin it about like that  wotever do you do it for  little jim replied by a sound which can only be represented by the letters sk pronounced in the summit of the nose  that aint no answer said the bloater with a knowing smile the knowingness of which consisted chiefly in the corners of the mouth being turned down instead of up  this peculiarity be it carefully observed was natural to the bloater who scorned every species of affectation many of his young friends and admirers were wont to imitate this smile if they could have seen the inconceivably idiotic expressions of their countenances when they tried it they would never have made a second effort  wot a jolly lark said little jim prefacing the remark with another sk  ha replied the bloater with a frown that implied the pressure of weighty matters on his mind  after a few minutes silence during which the cherubic face of little jim underwent various contortions the bloater said  if i aint mistaken jim you and i are sound of wind and limb  jim looked up in surprise and nodded assent  besides which continued the bloater were rayther fleet than otherwise  again jim nodded and grinned  no bobby as ever stuck is hignorant hinsolent ead into a elmet ever could catch us  sk ejaculated jim expanding from ear to ear  well then continued the bloater becoming more grave and confidential its my opinion jim that you and i shall ave a run for it tonight  its quite plain that our hamiable friend who seems so fond o fireraisin is goin to pay is respects to number 5  avin got it well alight it is just within the bounds o the possiblenot to say probblethat ell give em legbailmake tracks as the yankees saycut and run for it  well in course it would never do to let im go off alone or with only a eavy stoopid conceited slowcoach of a bobby at is tail  no no responded little jim that would never do  quite out of the question  ighly himproper  therefore said the bloater with emphasis you and i shall ave to keep our heyes on im shant we  he put this concluding question with a wink of such astounding significance that little jim could only reply with another sk as he stopped for a few moments to hug himself  at the firestation close to number 5 the firemen lounged about that evening with the air of men who although they chanced to be idle at the moment were nevertheless on the alert and ready for action at a moments notice  their large foldingdoors stood open with an air of offhand hospitality  a couple of engines stood within glittering from excessive polish and cleanliness  coils of hose and buckets etcetera were seen here and there in readiness while in an interior room a glimpse might be had of gleaming brass helmets which hung in a row on the wall each with an axe pendant below it and opposite to these a row of dry boots arranged on pegs with their soles to the ceiling  the two boys lingered about the station admiring all this and commenting in their own peculiar fashion on men and things sometimes approvingly often critically and now and then disparagingly  they sometimes ventured to address a remark or two to any of the men who chanced to look at them with a sufficiently goodhumoured expression and even went the length of asking bob clazie if in the event of the thames going on fire e thought e could manage to put it hout to which bob replied that he thought he could if cheek were a fireextinguisher and he only had a brigade of boys equal to the bloater to help him  as the night advanced the firemen devoted themselves to pipes draughts and miscellaneous conversation in their back room in which they were occasionally interrupted by the tingle of the telegraphic bell to inform them that there was a chimney on fire in holborn to which they need pay no attention even though called by an excited informer because it was already being attended to and didnt merit farther notice or to let them know that there was a fire raging in whitechapel which although being most energetically looked after by the men of the brigade in its immediate neighbourhood would be the better of aid nevertheless from one man from that station  on such distant duty bob clazie and his brother david were successively sent out in different directions during the first part of the night but they returned in the course of an hour or sobob considerably dirtied and moistened in consequence of having had to go vigorously into action at the tail end of a fire while david returned as he went having found that his fire had been effectually got under before his arrival  only once during the night did a regular call reach the station  it was about eleven oclock  our youthful watchmen feeling that the appointed hour was drawing nigh had retired to the shade of a neighbouring court to avoid observation when a man came tearing round the corner dashed into the firestation tumbled over a bucket into the midst of the men and yelled fire  in three minutes the engine was out the horses were attached the men in their places and away they went  oh lets follow cried little jim enthusiastically while his eyes glittered as if they too were on fire  the more sedate bloater laid his hand heavily on his little friends shoulder  no jim no  business fust pleasure arterwards  weve got business on hand tonight  little jim felt the force of the observation and made what we may call a mighty effortconsidering that he was such a mite of a thingto restrain himself  his heroism was rewarded for in less than half an hour the engine came rattling back again its services not having been required  the fire had occurred close to the fireescape of which one of the men of that station had the charge that night  he had run to the fire with his escape at the first alarm and had brought to bear on it the little hand fireengine with which all the escapes are now provided  at that early stage in the fire its little stream was more effectual than the flood from a powerful steamer would have been at a later period  the consequence was that the fire was got under at once and as we have said the engine was not required  wirtoo observed the bloater sententiously is its own reward  he pointed to the returning engine and looked at little jim with solemnity whereupon jim displayed all his teeth nodded approval of the sentiment andsk  little jim continued the bloater shaking his head gravely they do saythem as knows best or thinks they does which is all the same that theres wit in silence if so it appears to me that you tries to be too witty at times  i dun know bob replied jim with a meditative look much about wit bein in silence  i only wish there was wittles in it  oh wouldnt i old my tongue just till i was fit to bust  but there aint wittles in it jim nor nothin else worth avin so dont try it on too much tonight  you see im a bit downearted about the thoughts o this ere black business an feel the want of a cheerin word now and agin to keep up my droopin spirits dye see so dont stand grinnin there like a cheshire cat else ill  the bloater terminated the sentence in action by squeezing little jims cap over his eyes  he was still engaged in this act of pleasantry when mr sparks and his friend jeff appeared on the other side of the street they walked smartly past the door of the firestation which was shut by that time the men having retired to their various domiciles for the night with the exception of the two on night duty  they stopped at the corner of the street looked back and stood as if conversing casually with each other  meanwhile the two boys shrank out of sight and gazed at them like weasels peeping out of a hole  the street being a small back one was quite deserted at that hour  after talking in low tones for a few seconds and making sure as jeff said that the coast was clear the incendiaries shrunk round the corner and disappeared  now jim whispered the bloater theyve gone to number 5 lets foller  they were uncommonly active and sly little fellows but despite their utmost efforts they failed to gain a position of vantage from which to observe the enemy without being seen  they did indeed manage to make out that the two men were for some time busily and stealthily engaged in the neighbourhood of joe dashwoods dwelling but what they were doing could not be ascertained  after repeated and desperate efforts to overcome his difficulties at the risk of his neck and to the detriment of his shins the bloater at last sat down on a doorstep within a dark passage and feigned to tear his hair  now aint it wexin he whispered appealing to his small friend  aggrawatin beyond endoorance replied jim with looks of sympathy  wot is to be done demanded the bloater  invite a bobby to come an help us suggested jim  hm an stop em in their game praps at a pint were nobody could prove nothink against em besides bringin on ourselves the purlite inquiry wot are you up to ere  little jim looked disconsolate and said nothing which as the bloater testily remarked was another of his witty rejoinders  well then said jim we must just wait till the fire breaks out an then bust upon em all of a eap  hm much theyd care for your bustin on em  no jim we must risk a little  never wenter never win you know  just you go round by the other end of the street and creep as close as you can youre small you know an wont be so easy seen as me  try to make out wot theyre up to and then  then wot  wy come back an let me know  away said the bloater waving his hand with the air of a fieldmarshal  jim disappeared at once and was absent about ten minutes during which master robert herring sat in the dark passage biting his nails and feeling really uncomfortable as is usually the case with energetic spirits when reduced to unavoidable inaction  presently little jim returned with as his friend and patron remarked his eyes like two saucers and his face as white as a sheet  hallo jim wots up  oh bob gasped jim  speak exclaimed the bloater seizing him by the shoulders and shaking him violently  theyve got the ouse choke full o combustibles gasped jim in an excited whisper  i see em stuffin straw and pitch an i dun know wot all through a small back winder  sonows the time for a bobby observed the bloater leaping up  no taint said jim detaining him  i eard em speak  oh theyre sly dogs  they aint agoin to run away arter settin it alight theyre goin to run to the station rouse up the men an help to put it out an one of em says jeff says e larfin wont we lend em a good and to put it hout neither  and the other grinned an says yes phil well do our best an itll go hard if i cant in the middle o the smoke an flames git a chance at joe to  e didnt say no more but e drewed is finger across is throat but the one as e called phil said no jeff no ill split on you if you do  its quite enough to give im a rap over the ead  i didnt wait to ear no more arter that  theyre safe not to go off then observed the bloater nevertheless we must take a bobby into our confidence now for the case begins to look ugly  while these things were transpiring in the dark and silent night outside of number 5 the inmates of that modest mansion were buried in profound repose  joe dashwood on leaving the station for the night and going home had found that molly had already retired and was asleep in the inner room with the rosebud in her bosom  after contemplating this pleasant sight for a few minutes he returned to the outer or kitchendinodrawingroom where he found a cot extemporised out of four chairs and a bakingboard on which reposed the sturdy little figure of fred crashington  that enthusiastic amateur fireman had been invited to take up his quarters at number 5 until his father should be out of danger and having devoted his energies during the entire day along with the rosebud in a futile effort to extinguish that obstinate fire in the cupboard had at length been persuaded to retire exhausted to the bakingboard where he lay with a happy smile on his parted lips and his right arm embracing the quaint old helmet with which he was wont to extinguish his little head  being unusually tired that night but not sleepy joe resolved to solace himself with a pipe before lying down  he threw off his coat vest and braces pulled up his flannel shirt so as to let it hang comfortably loose over the waistband of his trousers sat down in an armchair in front of the fire filled his pipe and began to smoke  his intention was to take a few whiffs and then turn in but the influence of the tobacco appeared to be soporific for he soon began to nod then he removed his pipe stared earnestly at the fire and established quite a nodding acquaintance with it  presently he dropped his chin on his broad chest and snored steadily  from this condition of repose he was awakened by a sensation as if of suffocation by smoke  this was such an extremely natural not to say habitual state of things with joe that he was at least a couple of seconds in realising the fact that there was unusual cause for haste and vigorous action  like a giant refreshed joe leaped to his work  every fibre of his huge frame was replete with energy and his heart beat strong but it beat steadily not a vestige of a flutter was there for his head was clear and cool  he knew exactly what to do  he knew exactly what was being done  surprise did indeed fill him when he reflected that it was his own house which had caught fire but that did not for a moment confuse him as to the certainty that the engine must be already out and his comrades rushing to his assistance  he strode to the door and opened it  a volume of dense black smoke followed by sheets of flame drove him back  at the same moment loud shouts were heard outside and a shriek came from the inner room  joe dashed towards it  in passing he pulled fred off the bakingboard and at the same moment seized the curious old helmet and almost instinctively clapped it on his own head  there was a back door to the house  joe grasped his wife and the rosebud and the bedclothes in one mighty embrace and bore the whole bundle towards this back door before he reached it it was dashed open by bob clazie who sprang in with the branch  bob having been roused to a fire so near at hand had not taken time to go through the usual process of putting on his uniform  he like joe was in dishabille  here take care of em  let go the branch ill look after it  foul play here  let the police look out  joe said this sharply as he thrust the bundle containing his wife into bobs arms and picking up the rosebud who had slipped out clapped her on bobs back  bob made for the back staircase while joe picked up the branch and turning his head in the direction of the open door shouted in the voice of a stentor down with er  meanwhile fred who had a vague impression that the fire in the cupboard had got to a powerful head at last picked up the hose and looked on with a sleepy smile  obedient to the order the water rushed on filled and straightened the hose threw fred on his back on the floor and caused the nozzle to quiver as joe directed it to the fire  just then a man dashed into the room  lend a hand here cried joe glancing round  he saw in a moment by the mans look that he meant mischief  instantly he turned the nozzle full in his face  jeff for it was he fell as if he had been shot and was partly washed partly rolled down the back staircase at the foot of which a policeman was prepared to receive him but jeff sprang up knocked down the policeman and fled  seeing this mr sparks took alarm and was about to follow when the bloater suddenly sprang at his throat and little jim caught him by the legs  he quickly disengaged himself however and ran off at full speed closely followed by his young tormentors and two policemen besides a miscellaneous crowd of hooting and yelling lads and boys  it was an exciting chase that ensued  the two policemen were young and strong and for some time kept pretty near the fugitive but gradually they fell behind and by doubling through several narrow streets sparks threw them off the scent  as for the crowd the greater part of those who composed it gave in after a short run  but the bloater and little jim were not thus to be got rid of  they were fleet of foot and easily kept mr sparks in view though he made desperate efforts to catch them as well as to get away from them  the two boys were so persevering that they followed him all the way to thames street and just when the unhappy man thought he had at length eluded them they set up the cry of stop thief and gave chase again with a new force of policemen and roughs at their heels  turning abruptly into a dark passage sparks rushed upstairs burst open a door and fell exhausted on the floor of the cheerless room occupied by poor martha reading  almost at the same moment the two boys who were at least a hundred yards in advance of the other pursuers sprang into the room  ha run you down at last have we gasped the bloater  poor startled martha leaping at once to the conclusion that he was pursued fell on her knees and in a voice of agonising entreaty begged the boys to have mercy on him  eh hallo what exclaimed the bloater taken by surprise  then under a sudden impulse he dashed out of the room followed by little jim and rushed into the street just as the first of the crowd came up  this way  straight on hooray he shouted leading off the crowd in the direction of the river  the crowd followed  the bloater led them into a maze of intricate back streets shot far ahead of them and then doubling like a hare into a retired corner stood chuckling there while the shouting crowd swept by  for a few minutes little jim was utterly bereft of speech owing to a compound of amazement delight excitement and exhaustion  after a little time he said  well this is a lark  but i say bloater dye think it was right to let im off like that  whos let im off stoopid retorted the bloater  dont i know is nameat least part of it an the abitation of is wife or sweeteart or sister or suthin o that sort  oh ah werry true replied little jim with a terminating sk  well that bein ow it is we hant let im off just yet dye see so now well go an turn in  with that observation the bloater and little jim went away to search for and appropriate some convenient place of repose for the night    chapter seven  seated by the fireside of joe dashwoods new abodefor the old one although not quite burnt out was uninhabitablebob clazie chatted and smoked his pipe contentedly  at the conclusion of a remark he looked up in mrs dashwoods puzzled face and said thats ow it is dye see  no i dont see replied mary with a smile  no well now that is koorious  wy its as plain as the nose on my face  see here  as the law now stands there is no public authority to inwestigate the cause o fires in london well wots the consikence wy that there are regular gangs of scoundrels who make it their business to arrange fires for their own adwantage  now thats just what i dont understand said mary knitting her pretty brows what advantage can it be to any one to set fire to a house except to pickpockets who may get a chance of doing business in the crowd  well that of itself is enough to endooce some blackguards to raise a fire and likewise to get the shillin for bringin the first noose to the station which by the way was the chief okipation of that willain phil sparks im pretty sure  but heres ow it is  the swindlers i speak of go an take ousesthe further from firestations the better then they furnishes the ouses arter which they insures em  in the course of a short time they removes most of the furniture in a quiet way and then set the ouses alight themselves escapin praps in nothin but their night clothes  so you see they gits the insurance which more than pays for all the furniture they had bought besides which they ave a good deal of the furniture itself to sell or do wot they please with  thats one way in which fires are raisedaint it joe  joe who sat smoking in silence on the other side of the fire nodded and turning his head round advised fred crashington and little may to make less row  but we cant put it out widout a row remonstrated the rosebud  what have you found a fire in this cupboard as well as in the one o the old house asked joe with a laugh  iss iss an its a far wuss fire than the last one  thats your sort cried fred now then may dont stand jawin there but down with number two  look alive  ha chips o the old blocks i see said bob clazie with a grin well as i was sayin theres another class o men not so bad as the first but bad enough who are indooced to go in for this crime of fireraisinarson they calls it but why so is beyond me to diskiver a needy tradesman for instance when at his witsend for money cant help thinkin that a lucky spark would put him all right  but how could the burning of his goods put him all right demanded mary  wy e dont want goods you know e wants to sell is goods an so git money but nobody will buy so e cant sell nor git money yet money must be ad for creditors wont wait  wot then  all the goods are insured against fire  well make a bonfire of em redoose em all to hashes an of coorse the insurance companies is bound to pay up so e gits rid of the goods gits a lot o ready money in and pays off is creditors and praps starts fresh in a noo business  now a public officer to inwestigate such matters would mend things to some extent though e mightnt exactly cure em  some time ago the yankees im told appointed a officer they called a firemarshal in some of their cities and its said that the consikence was a sudden an extraornary increase in the conwictions for arson followed by a remarkable decrease in the number o fires  theyve got somethin o the same sort in france an over all the chief towns o europe i blieve but we dont need no such precautions in london  were rich you know an can afford to let scamps burn right an left  it aint worth our while to try to redooce the number of our fires  weve already got an average of about five fires every twentyfour hours in london  why should we try to make em less wen they furnishes ealthy work to such fine fellows as joe and me and the policenot to mention the fun afforded to crossinsweepers and other little boys whose chief enjoyment in life would be gone if there was no fires  if i had the making of the laws exclaimed mary flushing with indignation as she thought of her own recent risks and losses in consequence of fireraising id have every man that set light to his house hanged  ah an if e could also be drawd and quartered added bob and ave the bits stuck on the weathercocks of saint pauls or atop of temple bar it would serve im right  we must have you into parliament some day molly said joe with a smile  women are tryin hard i believe to get the right to vote for members wy not go the whole hog and vote themselves in  theyd make splendid firemen too said clazie at least if they were only half as vigorous as your little may  by the way joe continued bob has sparks been took yet  not yet  it is rumoured that the crossinsweeper who chased him down so smartly suddenly favoured his escape at last from some unaccountable cause or other  i suppose that sparks bribed him  youre sure it was sparks are you inquired bob  quite sure  it is true i only saw his confederate but one of the men who had often seen sparks in company with crashington his brotherinlaw knew him at once and saw him run off with the boys after him  hes a bad lot but i hope hell escape for poor mrs crashingtons sake  and i hope he wont escape for poor martha readings sake said mary with much decision of tone  thats his sweetearta friend of mollys said joe to bob in explanation  at this point in the conversation master fred crashington in his frantic efforts to reach an elevated part of the cupboard fell backwards drawing a shelf and all its contents on the top of himself and may  neither of them was hurt though both were much frightened  i think that must have put the fire out at last said joe with a laugh as he took the panting rosebud on his knee and smoothed her soft little head  well sit quiet now and have a chat  a knock at the outer door here called mrs dashwood from the room  fire exclaimed may holding up her finger and listening with eager expectation  no little woman said joe they would ring loud if it was fire  meanwhile mrs dashwood opened the door and found herself confronted by a boy with his hands in his pockets and his cap thrown in a reckless way half on the side and half on the back of his head  oh i suppose you are the boy herring sent here by miss reading said mrs dashwood  well as to that maam you must be guided by taste  ive eard of men of my years an standin bein styled obbledeoys  my name

dashwoodwhomi presoom  here the bloater laid his hand on his heart and made a courtly bow  mrs dashwood laughed and said come in boy  i have a pal maama chumain fact a friendmay i  without finishing his sentence or waiting for a reply the bloater gave a sharp whistle and little jim stood by his side as if by magical influence looking the embodiment of united innocence and impudence  come in both of you and make haste said mary ushering them into a small empty room  now boy  bloater maam if you ave no objection  well bloater our communication with each other must be brief and to the point because  yes maamsharp and short interrupted the bloaterreasons not required  smiling in spite of herself mrs dashwood said  you know mr sparks and cancanin short give him into the hands of justice  if i knowed were justice was said the bloater sternly praps i might give mr sparks into is ands but i dont  its my opinion that justice aint finished yet  theyve made is ands no doubtand pretty strong ones they are toobut they avent give im brains yet owsever to make a long story short as amlet said to is fathers ghost wich was prince of timbuctoo i do know mr sparks and i can give im into the ands of the plicewot then  do it said mrs dashwood with sudden intensity of feeling and manner do it boy bloater murmured the lad do it bloater oh you have no idea what a blessing it would be tototoa poor dear girl who is madinfatuated and andthen he is such a scoundrel such a fireraiser deceiver villain  you dont appear to like im yourself remarked the bloater  he said this so quietly and with an air of calmness which contrasted so strongly with mrs dashwoods excitement that little jim gave vent to an irresistible sk and blew his nose violently to distract attention from it  will you not consent to give up a thorough scoundrel who every one condemns demanded mrs dashwood with sudden indignation  well that depends  bloater said mary with increasing earnestness i cannot bribe you i have not the means even if i had the will but i would not if i could i scorn bribery  if you will not aid me for the sake of a poor helpless infatuated girl who is on the brink of ruin  missis dashwood said the bloater with a look of seriocomic dignity i scorns bribery as much as you does  no bribery no cruptons no popery thems my mottoesbesides a few more that theres no occasion to mention  wether or not i gives im up depends on circumstances now i spose you wants im took an bagged cause e aint fit for your friend martha readingwell drop the miss if you please  well wot i want to know is does martha think as you does  of course not boy  no doubt she knows that he is an unworthy scoundrel but she cant prevail on herself to forsake him so you see i want to help her a little  ah i seeyesi see  well missis ill take it into consideration come along jim  without waiting for a reply the bloater quitted the house abruptly followed by his friend  he walked very fast towards the cityso fast that jim was compelled to trotand was unusually silent  he went straight to the abode of martha reading and found her sewing and weeping  ha hes bin with you i see said the bloater  did e ask you to let im ide ere  yees said martha hesitating but i refused to do it  god knows how willinghow willingi would be to shelter and save him if i could  would you shelter a guilty man demanded the bloater sternly  i dont know that he is guilty said martha evasively  but tell me what did mrs dashwood want with you  thats a private matter said the bloater frowning  you cant turn me off the scent like that  i ask you aint it right to and a guilty man over to justice  it is replied martha wiping her eyes but it is also right to temper justice with mercy  i say thats drawin it rather fine aint it said the bloater screwing up one eyebrow and turning towards little jim but that small youth was so touched with the poor girls sorrow and so attracted by her countenance that he had quite forgotten his patron for the moment going towards her he laid his dirty little hand on her knee and looked up in her face  god bless you dear boy she said patting him on the head you are the first that has given me a look of sympathy for many  she broke down suddenly burst into a flood of tears and seizing the child in her arms absolutely hugged him  hallo hallo cried the bloater when little jim was released  i say you know come this sort o thing will never do  wy its houtrageous  come along with you  saying which he seized little jim by the collar dragged him out into the street and hurried him along  presently he released him but without slackening his pace and said now jim you an i shall go and pay another wisit  they traversed several small streets which seemed to be influenced by a tendency to gravitate towards the thames while the river as if in sympathy appeared to meet them more than half way in the shape of mud as they proceeded huge warehouses frowned above having doors high up on their blank faces where windows ought to have been with no steps leading thereto but in some cases with huge block tackles pendent therefrom suggestive of the idea that the owners were wont to drop the enormous hooks and fish for passersby  these streets naturally became more nautical in some respects as they neared the river  old bits of timber lay here and there among old cordage in little yards where the owners appeared to deal in smallcoal and miscellaneous filth elsewhere wornout anchors held tenaciously to the mud as if afraid of being again pressed into service and carried off to sea  everything was cold dismal dreary disreputable and here in the dirtiest corner of the smallest possible yard the bloater found a halfconcealed door that might have been the portal to a dogkennel or pigsty  opening it he entered and little jim followed  the aspect of things inside was not attractive  dirt damp and rubbish prevailed in the room which was just big enough to permit of a tall man lying down but not high enough to admit of his standing up  an uncommonly small fourpost bed almost filled the apartment at the foot of which on the floor and halfreclining against one of the posts lay phil sparks either deaddrunk or asleep or both  the bloater glanced back at little jim with a look of satisfaction and held up his finger to enjoin silence  peering round the room which was lighted by a farthing candle stuck in the neck of a pint bottle he observed a piece of rope lying among some rubbish  ha thisll do he whispered as he took it up and with wonderful rapidity made a loop on it  now jim you be ready to cut and run if he should waken before i ave im fast  dont mind me ill look arter myself  an wotever you do dont holler for the bobbies  mind that else ill strangle you  with this advice and caution the bloater advanced toward the recumbent man and passed the rope softly round his body including his arms and the bedpost in the coil  drawing it suddenly tight he hastily made it fast but there was no occasion for haste for the sleep of the man was so profound that the action did not awake him  hall rightfus rate said the bloater aloud as he wound the rope round and round sparks so as to make him doubly secure  nothin could be better  now jim im goin for to preach a sermon tonighta sort o discoorse  you never heard me preach did you  little jim who despite his love of mischief was somewhat alarmed at the strange proceedings of his friend and patron looked at him with a mingled expression of fear and glee and shook his head  well you shall ear  moreover i ope that youll profit by wot you ears  saying this he advanced his hand towards the sleeping mans face and causing his thumb to act as a trigger to his middle finger gave him such a flip on the point of his nose that he awoke with a tremendous roar  suddenly he became pale as deathsupposing no doubt that he had betrayed himselfand glanced towards the door with a bewildered stare  oh you neednt alarm yourself said the bloater placing a stool in front of his victim and sitting down thereon with a hand on each knee it aint the bobbies  if you keep quiet theres no fear of them in this neighbourhood  i can call em wen i wants em  theres nobody but me and little jim ereyour friends you know  becoming suddenly convinced of the truth of this phil sparks who was very drunk made so desperate an effort to free himself that he nearly overturned the bed  oh you are anxious to see the bobbies are you  well go an call em in jim  jim rose to obey and the man became instantly quiet  ho youre reasonable now are you  thats well  you neednt call em in yet jim  well grant im a reprieve  fetch that stool an sit down beside methere  now mr sparks alias blazes no doubt youre a precious specimen of hinnocent unmanity aint you  sparks made no reply but scowled at the boy with a look of deadly hatred  well upon my word resumed the bloater with a smile if i kep a menagerie id offer you five undred a year to represent a tasmanian devil  but look ere now ive no time to waste with you i come ere to give you a bit of my mind  youre a fireraiser you are  ah you may well wince an grow wite  youd grow witer still with a rope round your neck if you wos left to my tender mercies you wite livered villain for i knows you ive watched you ive found you hout an ive only got to old up my little finger to cut your pretty little career prematoorly short  you dont seem to like that  no i didnt expect you would  this young man whose art is big if is bodys small knows as much about you as i do  two witnesses you see but you aint left to our tender mercies and if you wants to know who delivered you from us and from the maginstrates and jack ketch alias calcraft i replies martha reading  ha you look surprised quite natral  youve deserved very different treatment from that young ooman an didnt expect that shed return good for evil i spose thats because you dont know er you dont understand er you miserable lump of selfish stoopidity  owsever as i said before i aint agoin to waste no more time with you  but let me before biddin you adoo give you a caution  remember that ive got my eye on you  just one word more  wen you thinks of me dont think of one as as got any tender mercies for i aint got none not a scrap of em nor nothin of the sort  wen you wants to know the true cause of your bein let off just think of two wordsmartha reading  she knows nothin o wot im doin nevertheless shes done it  let er name ring in your ears an thunder in your brain and burn in your art till it consooms your witals or your willany  now jim concluded the bloater rising and opening a large claspknife you go to the door open it wide an stan by to cut and run  this genlmn aint to be trusted wen free  are you ready  hall ready replied jim  the bloater cut the cord that bound phil sparks and darted from the room  before the man could disentangle himself from its coils the boys were safe from pursuit quietly wending their way through the crowded thoroughfares of the great city    chapter eight  several months passed away  during this period phil sparks kept in close hiding because although the bloater true to his promise refrained from giving information against him there were others who knew and suspected him and who had no visions of an imploring martha to restrain them in their efforts to deliver him into the hands of justice  during this period also ned crashington recovered his wonted health and vigour while his wife to some extent recovered her senses and instead of acting as an irritant blister on her husband began really to aim at unanimity  the result was that neds love for her which had only been smothered a little burst forth with renewed energy and maggie found that in peace there is prosperity  it is not to be supposed that maggie was cured all at once  she was not an angelonly an energetic and selfwilled woman  she therefore broke out now and then in her old style but on the whole she was much improved and the stalwart fireman no longer sought martyrdom in the flames  during this period too the men of the red brigade held on the even tenor of their furious fiery way not indeed scatheless but with a much smaller amount of damage to life and limb than might have been expected in a service where the numerical strength was so lowonly about 380 menand where the duty night and day was so severe and hazardous  about this time their chiefs report for the past year was issued and it revealed a few facts which are worthy of record  it stated that there had been altogether 1946 fires in london during the past twelve months that is an average of a little more than five fires every twentyfour hours  of these 1670 had been slight while 276 were serious  in these fires 186 persons had been seriously endangered of whom 153 were rescued by the men of the red brigade while 33 perished despite the most gallant efforts to save them  the report showed further that there were in london at that time and it is much the same still 50 fireengine stations 25 land steam fireengines 85 manual fireengines 2 floating steam fireengines on the thames and 104 fireescapes  the number of journeys made by the fireengines during the year was 8127 and the total distance run was 21914 miles this the reader will observe implies an enormous amount of labour performed by the 380 heroes who constitute the red brigade and who although thus heavily overtaxed were never heard to murmur or complain that they suffered pretty frequently and severely might have been expected  in truth it is a marvel that they did not suffer more  the report showed that among them all in the course of the year they had received 36 contusions dislocations fractures and such like injuries 22 incised lacerated and punctured wounds 18 injuries to eyes head and arms 2 internal injuries 22 sprains and strange to say only 4 burns and scalds making 104 injuries altogether but no deaths  things being in this condition the brigade lay on its oars so to speak awaiting a call one bleak evening in november when everything in london looked so wet and cold and wretched that some people went the length of saying that a good rousing fire would be quite a cheering sight for the eyes to rest upon  in the westend station to which we have directed attention more than once in this tale joe dashwood and ned crashington and bob clazie with his brother david and some more of the men were seated in the inner lobby discussing the news of the day and settling the affairs of the nation to their own entire satisfaction  the bloater and little jim were also there hanging about the door  these fireeating youths had become so fond of the locality and of the men that they had taken to sweeping a crossing in the neighbourhood and were wont to cheer their spirits during intervals of labour by listening to or chaffing the firemen and following them when possible to fires  suddenly the rattle of the telegraphic bell roused the men  this was so common an occurrence that it scarcely called forth a passing remark one of them however rose with alacrity and replying to the signal read off the message  we cannot give the precise words of the telegram but it was to the effect that a fire had broken out at saint katharines docks and that all available force was to be sent out at once  on hearing this there was unusual promptitude in the movements of the firemen  at all times they are bound on pain of a heavy fine to turn out in three minutes after receiving the call to a fire  sometimes they succeed in turning out in less  it was so on the present occasion mention of a fire anywhere near the docks has much the same effect on the red brigade as the order to march to the field of waterloo had on the british army  the extreme danger the inflammable nature of the goods contained in the huge and denselypacked warehouses the proximity to the shipping the probability of a pitched battle with the flames the awful loss of property and perhaps of life if the fire should gain the mastery and the urgent need there is for hurrying all the disposable force in london to the spot without delay if the victory is to be gainedall these circumstances and considerations act as an unusually sharp spur to men who however being already willing at all times to do their utmost can only force themselves to gain a few additional moments of time by their most strenuous exertions  in less than three minutes then our westend engine sprang off like a rocket at full gallop with a crack of the whip a snort from the steeds a shout from the men to clear the way and a cheer from the bystanders  two of these bystanders started off alongside of the engine with glittering eyes and flushed cheeks  the bloater and little jim had heard the telegraph read off had caught the words firesaint katharines docks and knew well what that implied  they resolved to witness the fight and ran as if their lives depended on the race  it need scarcely be said that the engine quickly left them out of sight behind not only because the horses were fleet but also because various pedestrians into whose bosoms the boys plunged in their blind haste treated them rather roughly and retarded their progress a good deal but nothing short of a knockdown blow could have put a full stop to the career of those imps of the broom  after innumerable hairbreadth escapes from bobbies and others by agile bounds and desperate plunges among horses legs and carriagewheels they reached the scene of action not very long after the engine with which they had set out  it was night  the fire had been raging for some time with terrible fury and had already got full possession of two large warehouses each five or six floors in height all connected by means of double iron foldingdoors and stored from basement to roof with spirits tallow palmoil cotton flax jute and other merchandise to the extent of upwards of two millions sterling in value  the dock fireengines had been brought to bear on the flames a few minutes after the fire was discovered  the two floatingengines were paddled at once to the spot and their powerful hydrants poured continuous streams on the flames while every few minutes another and another of the landengines came rattling up until all the available force of the red brigade was on the spot each man straining like the hero of a forlorn hope regardless of life and limb to conquer the terrible foe  the brompton and chelsea volunteer firebrigade and several private engines also came up to lend a helping hand  but all these engines brave hearts and vigorous proceedings appeared at first of no avail for the greedy flames shot out their tongues hissed through water and steam and licked up the rich fuel with a deep continuous roar as if they gloated over their unusually splendid banquet and meant to enjoy it to the full despite mans utmost efforts to oppose them  the excitement at this time was tremendous  every available spot of ground or building from which the most limited view of the fire could be obtained was crowded to excess by human beings whose upturned faces were lighted more or less ruddily according to their distance from the fire  no doubt the greater proportion of the vast multitude beheld the waste of so much property with anxiety and regret  doubtless also many thoughtless ones were there who merely enjoyed the excitement and looked on it as a pyrotechnic display of unwonted splendour  but there was yet another class of men aye and women whose view of the matter was fitted to cause anxiety in the breasts of those who talk of elevating the masses and this was by far the largest class  the greater part of them belonged to the lowest class of labourers men willing to work for their living but who got little to do  amongst these not one expression of regret was to be heard though the women sometimes asked anxiously whether any one was likely to be hurt  but let a few of these speak for themselves  ah said an old woman with an unintellectual style of countenance now there will be plenty of work for poor men  yes responded a rough with a black eye thats true  my blissin as paddy says on a fire it warms the cockles o yer heart an kapes yer hands busy  theyve much need to be kep busy sure enough remarked another man for mine have been pretty idle for more than a week  i wish exclaimed another with a bitter curse on mankind in general that the whole thames would go afire from westminster to gravesend  the energy with which this was said caused a general laugh and a good deal of chaff but there was no humour in the man who spoke  he was one of those of whom it is said by a periodical which ought to know that hundreds of such may be seen day by day year by year waiting at the different gates of the docks in stolid weariness for the chance of a days workthe wage of which is halfacrown  when a foreman comes to a gate to take on a few such hands the press of men and the faces hungry and eager beyond description make one of the saddest of the sad sights to be seen even at the east end of london  in another part of the crowd where the street was narrow a scene of a most fearful kind was being enacted  all scoundreldom appeared to have collected in that spot  for two or three hours robbery and violence reigned unchecked in the very face of the police who reduced to inaction by the density of the crowd could render little or no assistance to the sufferers  scarcely one respectably dressed person was unmolested  hats were indiscriminately smashed over the brows of their wearers coats were torn off their backs and watches and purses violently wrested from their owners  in many cases there was no attempt at secrecy men were knocked down and plundered with all the coolness and deliberation with which we commonly pursue our lawful calling  by degrees the perseverance and heroism of the firemen were rewarded the fire began to succumb to the copious floods with which it was deluged and towards midnight there was a perceptible diminution in the violence of the flames  there were however several temporary outbursts from time to time which called for the utmost watchfulness and promptitude on the part of the brigade  during one of these a block of private dwellings nearest to the conflagration was set on fire  so intent was every one on the great fire that this incidental one was not observed until it had gained considerable headway  the buildings were very old and dry so that before an engine could be detached from the warehouses it was in a complete blaze  most of the inhabitants escaped by the chief staircase before it became impassable and one or two leaped from the lower windows  it chanced that joe dashwoods engine was nearest to this house at the time and was run up to it  now then lads look alive said joe as the men affixed the hose and suctionpipe  out o the way cried ned crashington to two boys who appeared to be rather curious about the operations of the firemen  i say exclaimed the bloater in great excitement whythats the ouse were martha lives  whos martha asked ned without interrupting his operation of screwing on an additional length of hose  wy the friend o joe dashwoods wifemarthamartha reading you know  eh exclaimed ned looking up  at that moment martha herself appeared at a window in the upper storey waving her arms and shrieking wildly for help  men were seen endeavouring to bring forward a fireescape but the crowd was so dense as to render this an unusually difficult and slow operation  without uttering a word ned crashington dashed up the blazing staircase  for a moment he was lost to view but quickly reappeared attempting to cross a halfcharred beam which overhung a yawning gulf of fire where the first and second floors had just fallen in  suddenly a dense mass of smoke surrounded him  he staggered threw up his arms and was seen to fall headlong into the flames  a deep groan or cry of horror arose from the crowd and wild shouts of fetch a ladder bring up the escape were heard while poor martha got out on the windowsill to avoid the flames which were rapidly drawing towards and almost scorching her  just then a man was seen to dash furiously through the crowd he fought his way madlyknocking down all who opposed him  gaining the door of the burning house he sprang in  i say whispered little jim in an excited voice its phil sparks  im glad to hear it observed a quiet broadshouldered man who stood near two policemen to whom he winked knowingly  the bloater attempted to move off but one of the policemen detained him  the other detained little jim  meanwhile the crowd looked for phils reappearance on the beam from which poor ned crashington had fallen but phil knew the house better than ned  he gained the upper floor by a back stair which was not quite impassable seized martha in his arms just as she was about to leap into the street and dragged her back into the smoke and flames it appeared almost certain that both must have perished but in a few seconds the man was seen to descend the lower stair with the woman in his arms and in another moment a wild enthusiastic cheer burst from the vast multitude as he leaped into the street  laying martha gently down on a doorstep sparks bent over her and whispered in her ear  she appeared to have swooned but opened her eyes and gazed earnestly in the face of her deliverer  the lord must have sent you to save me phil he will save you also if you will trust him  forgive me martha i was hard on you but  god bless you phil  clear the way there cried a commanding voice here doctor this way  the crowd opened  a medical man came forward and examined martha and pronounced her to be only slightly injured  several men then raised her and carried her towards a neighbouring house  phil sparks was about to follow but the quiet man with the broad shoulders touched him gently on the arm and said that he was wanted  sorry to interrupt you in such a good work but it cant be helped other people can take care of her now you know come along  sparks first impulse was to knock the quiet man down and fly but he felt a restraining power on his other arm and looking round observed a tall policeman at his side  as if by magic another tall policeman appeared in front of him and a third behind him  he suddenly bent down his head and suffered himself to be led away  seeing this the bloater and little jim wrenched themselves from the grasp of their respective captors dived between the legs of the bystanders as eels might do among sedges and vanished to their own inexpressible delight and the total discomfiture of the bobbies  they met a few minutes later at a wellknown rendezvous  i wish e adnt bin took said the bloater with a look of regret on his expressive though dirty countenance  poor martha said little jim almost crying as he thought of her ow much dyou think ell get bloater  twenty years at least praps go for life you see its an aggrawated case  ive bin makin partikler inquiries and i finds es bin raisin no end o fires doorin the last six monthskep the red brigade trottin about quite in a surprisin way  i rather fear that ell be let in for ever an a day  the bloater was not quite correct in his guess  when the trial came on to the surprise of all especially of his pals phil sparks pleaded guilty  partly in consideration of this and partly on account of his last courageous act in saving the girl he was let off with fifteen years penal servitude  but to return from this episode  the great fire at the docks after gutting several warehouses was finally subdued  and what of the loss a hundred thousand pounds did not cover it and every insurance office in london suffered  in addition to this several persons lost their lives while the red brigade besides having some of their number more or less severely injured lost one of its best and bravest men  gallant ned crashingtons fighting days were over  his mangled remains were gathered up next morning and a few days later were conveyed by his comrades to their last restingplace  it is no easy matter to move the heart of london  that vast nationinacity has too many diverse interests to permit of the eyes of all being turned even for a moment upon one thing  nevertheless the firemans funeral seemed to cause the great cord to vibrate for a little  hundreds of thousands of people turned out to witness the cortege  neds coffin was drawn military fashion on one of the engines peculiar to his profession with his helmet and hatchet placed upon the lid  the whole of the force of the brigade that could be spared followed him in uniform headed by their chief and accompanied by a large detachment of the police force  the procession was imposing and the notices that appeared next day in all the papers were a touching tribute of respect to the selfsacrificing fireman who as one of these papers said left a widow and son in poor circumstances to mourn his early death  ah these things were soon forgotten in the rush of the worlds business by all save that widow and son and one or two bosom friends  even the men of the red brigade appeared to forget the fallen hero very soon we say appeared because there were some among them who mourned ned as a dear brother chief among whom was joe dashwood  but whatever the feelings of the firemen might have been theirs was a warfare that allowed no time for the undue indulgence or exhibition of grief  the regular calls and duties went on steadily sternly as if nothing had occurred and before neds remains had lain a night in their last restingplace many of his old comrades were out again doing fierce battle with the restless and untameable flames    chapter nine  years passed away and with them many old things vanished while many novelties appeared but the red brigade remained much as it was excepting that it was if possible smarter and more energetic than ever  in the lobby of our westend station one pleasant summer evening the men sat and stood about the open door beside the trim engines and materiel of their profession chatting heartily as men are wont to do when in high health and spirits  there were new faces among them but there were also several that had long been familiar there  the stalwart form of joe dashwood was there so little altered by time that there was nothing about him to tell that he was passing the period of middleage save a few grey hairs that mingled here and there with the dark curls on his temples  bob clazie was there also but he had not stood the trials of his profession so well as joeprobably his constitution was not so strong  a disagreeable short cough harassed him though he made light of it  frequent scorching smoking and partial suffocation had increased his wrinkles and rendered his eyelids permanently red nevertheless although nearly fifty years old bob clazie was still one of the best men in the brigade  joe dashwood wore a pair of brass epaulettes on his shoulders which indicated that he had attained to the highest rank in the service short of the chief command  he was giving directions to one of the younger men of the force when a tall strapping young man with a plain but open and singularly pleasing countenance entered and going up to him shook him warmly by the hand  well bob whats the news you seem excited this evening said joe  so i am joe and with good reason too for several pleasant things have happened today  in the first place my friend and patron  thats the old gentleman with the ruddy face and the bald head interrupted joe  yes and with the kind heart  dont ever omit the kind heart joe in your description of him else youll only have painted half the portrait  well but the kind heart aint quite so visible at first sight as the ruddy face and bald head you know  perhaps not but if you watched him long enough to see him act youd perceive the kind heart as plain as if it hung at his buttonhole and beat like a sixtyhorsepower steamengine outside his ribs instead of inside said the strapping young man with quite a glow of enthusiasm oh if you could only see how that old gentleman labours and strives and wears himself out in his desire to rescue what they call our street arabs you couldnt help loving him as i do  but im wandering from the pleasant things ive got to tell about  through his influence my friend jim has obtained a good appointment on the metropolitan railway which gives him a much better salary than he had in skrimps office and opens up a prospect of promotion so although it sends him underground before his natural time he says he is quite content to be buried alive especially as it makes the prospect of his union with a very small and exceedingly charming little girl with black eyes not quite so remote as it was  in the second place youll be glad to hear that the directors of the insurance office with which i am connected have raised my salary influenced thereto by the same old gentleman with the ruddy face bald head and kind heart  coupled with your own merits bob suggested joe  i know nothing about that replied the strapping young man with a smile but these pleasant pieces of good fortune have enabled me and jim to carry out a plan which we have long cherishedto lodge together with martha reading as our landlady  in truth anticipating some such good fortune as has been sent to us we had some time ago devoted part of our savings to the purpose of rescuing poor martha from that miserable needlework which has been slowly killing her so long  we have taken and furnished a small house martha is already installed as the owner and we go there tonight for the first time as lodgers  you dont say so exclaimed joe laughing why bob you and your friend act with as much promptitude as if you had been regularly trained in the firebrigade  we received much of our training from it if not in it returned the strapping young man with the plain but pleasant countenance  dont you remember joe how perseveringly we followed you in former days when i was the bloater and he was little jim  remember it  i should think i do replied joe  how glad my mary will be when she hears what you have done  but thats not all my news continued the bloater if we may presume to use the old name  last but not least fred has asked me to be his groomsman  he wrote me a very pathetic letter about it but omitted to mention the daynot to be wondered at in the circumstances  poor fred his letter reminded me of the blotted copies which i used to write with such trouble and sorrow at the training school to which my patron sent me  theres reason for the blotted letter besides the excitement of his approaching marriage said joe  he hurt his hand the last fire he attended and its in a sling just now so he must have taken it out for temporary duty when he wrote to you  the truth is that fred is too reckless for a fireman  hes scarcely cool enough  but i can inform you as to the day it is thursday next  see that you are up to time bob  no fear of me being late replied the bloater  by the way have you heard of that new method of putting out fires that somebody has invented  i did hear of some nonsensical plan replied joe with a slight expression of contempt but i dont think it worth while to pay attention to things o this sort  theres nothin can beat good cold water  im not so sure of that joe replied his friend gravely  i have been reading an account of it in the insurance guardian and it seems to me that there is something worth attending to in the new plan  it looks as if there was life in it for a company is to be got up called the fire and water company  but what is this new plan asked joe sending forth a violent puff from his pipe as if to indicate that it would all end in smoke  well im not sure that ive got a correct notion of it myself but my impression is that carbonic acid gas is the foundationprinciple of it fire cannot exist in the presence of this gaswherever it goes extinction of fire is instantaneous which is more than you can say for water joe for as you know well fire when strong enough can turn that into steam as fast as you can pour it on and after getting rid of it in this way blaze up as furious as ever  what this company proposes to do is to saturate water with this carbonic acid gas mixed with nitrogen and then pour that prepared water on fires  of course if much water were required such a plan would never succeed but a very small quantity is said to be sufficient  it seems that some testing experiments of a very satisfactory kind have been made recentlyso you see joe it is time to be looking out for a new profession  hm  ill stick to the old brigade at all events till the new company beats us from the field  perhaps when that happens theyll enrol some of us to work thewhat dye call emsodawater engines  theyll have engines of course i suppose  of course replied the bloater moreover they mean to turn their prepared water to good account when there are no fires to put out  it is said that the proportions of the mixture can be so varied that with one kind the pump may be used for the clarification of beer oils treacle quicksilver and such like and for the preservation of fruit meat milk etcetera and with another mixture they propose to ventilate mines and tunnels water gardens kill insects on trees and flowers soften water for domestic uses and breweries and manufacture sodawater seltzer water and other aerated beverages  oh i say bob hold on cried joe you seem to forget that my capacity for swallowing is limited  well perhaps youll get it enlarged enough before long to swallow all that and a deal more said the bloater with a half serious air meanwhile ill continue to wish all success and prosperity to the red brigadethough you do cause a tremendous amount of damage by your floods of water as we poor insurance companies know  why if it were not for the heroes of the salvage corps we should be ruined altogether its my opinion joe that the men of the salvage corps run quite as much risk as your fellows do in going through fire and smoke and working among falling beams and tumbling walls in order to cover goods with their tarpaulins and protect them from water  i admit that the salvage men do their work like heroes said joe but if you would read our chiefs report for last year you would see that we do our best to put out fires with the smallest possible amount of water  why we only used about eleven million gallons in the last twelve monthsa most insignificant quantity that for the amount of work done  a tinkle of the telegraph bell here cut short the conversation  fire in the mall kensington was the signal  get her out lads cried joe referring to the engine  helmets and hatchets were donned and buckled on in the old style and quiet jokes or humorous and freeandeasy remarks were uttered in slow even sleepy tones while the men acted with a degree of prompt celerity that could not have been excelled had their own lives depended on their speed  in three minutes as usual they were off at full gallop  the bloaterwho still longed to follow them as of old but had other business on handwished them good luck and proceeded at a smart pace to his new lodgings  we must change the scene now for the men of the red brigade do not confine their attentions exclusively to such matters as drilling fighting suffering conquering and dying  they sometimes marry  let us look in at this little church where as a passerby remarks something appears to be going on  a tall handsome young man leads to the altar a delicate beautiful blooming bride whose bent head and blushing cheek and modest mien and dependent air contrast pleasantly with the gladsome firm countenance stalwart frame and selfreliant aspect of the bridegroom  looking at them as they stood then no one could have entertained for a moment the idea that these two had ever united in the desperate and strenuous attempt to put out a fire  yet so it was  they had once upon a time devoted themselves to the extinction of a fire in a cupboard with such enthusiasm that they had been successful not only in putting that fire out but in lighting another fire which nothing short of union for life could extinguish  joe dashwood gave away the bride and he could not help remarking in a whisper to the bloater who was also there in sumptuous attire that if ever a man was the born image of his father that man was fred crashingtonan opinion which was heartily responded to by mrs maggie crashington who then in the period of life which is described as fat fair and forty looked on at the proceedings with intense satisfaction  mary dashwoodalso fat fair and fortywas there too and if ever a woman congratulated herself on a rosebud having grown into a full blown blushrose that woman was mary  besides a pretty large company of welldressed people with white favours in their breasts there was a sprinkling of active men with sailorlike caps who hung about the outskirts of the crowd and among these were two or three stout fellows with brass helmets and dirty hands and faces and wet garments who had returned from a recent fire just in time to take a look at their comrade and his fair bride  poor ned how his kind heart would have rejoiced to see this day murmured joe brushing his cheek hastily as he retired from the altar  so the wedding party left the church and the firemen returned to their posts of watchfulness and duty  about the same period that this wedding took place there was another wedding in the great metropolis to which we would draw the readers attention  not that it was a great one or a splendid one on the contrary if it was marked by any unusual peculiarities these were shabbiness and poverty  the wedding party consisted of only two besides the bride and bridegroom and everything was conducted with such quietness and gravity and absence of excitement that it might almost have been mistaken for a funeral on a small scale by any one unacquainted with the ceremonial appertaining thereto  the happy pair besides looking very sad were past the meridian of life  both were plainly dressed and each appeared desirous of avoiding observation  the man in particular hung his head and moved awkwardly as if begging forgiveness generally for presuming to appear in the character of a bridegroom  his countenance had evidently never been handsome but there was a sad subdued look about itthe result perhaps of prolonged sufferingwhich prevented it from being repulsive  he looked somewhat like an invalid yet his powerful frame and the action of his strong muscular hands were not in keeping with that idea  the bride although careworn and middleaged possessed a singularly sweet and attractive countenanceall the more attractive that it wore a habitual expression of sadness  it was a sympathetic face too because it was the index to a loving sympathetic christian soul and its evervarying indications of feeling lightened and subdued and modified but never quite removed the sadness  the two who composed the remainder of this wedding party were young men apparently in a higher position of life than the principals  the one was tall and strapping the other rather small but remarkably active and handsome  it was evident that they were deeply interested in the ceremony in which they took part and the smaller of the two appeared to enjoy some humorous reminiscences occasionally to judge from the expression of his face when his glance chanced to meet that of his tall friend  as they were leaving the altar the bridegroom bent down and murmured in a deep soft voice  its like a dream martha  it aint easy to believe that such good luck should come to the likes o me  the bride whispered something in reply which was inaudible to those who followed  yes martha yes returned the bridegroom no doubt it is as you put it  but after all theres only one of his sayins that has gone right home to me  ive got it by heart nowi came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance  twould have bin all up with me long ago but for that martha  they reached the door at this point got into a cab and drove away the remainder of the wedding party left the little church on foot  the same evening on which this event took place the strapping young man and the little active youth sat together at the open window of a comfortable though small parlour enjoying a cup of tea  the view from the window was limited but it possessed the charm of variety commanding as it did a vista of chimneypots of every shape and form conceivablemany of which were capped with those multiform and hideous contrivances with which foolish man vainly endeavours to cure smoke  well jim asked the strapping youth as he gazed pensively on this prospect what dyou think of it  what do you refer to bobour view or the wedding  the wedding of course  its hard to say replied jim musing  he seemed to be such an unmitigated scoundrel when we first made his acquaintance that it is difficult to believe he is a changed man now  by which you mean to insinuate jim that the gospel is not sufficient for outandout blackguards that it is only powerful enough to deal with such modified scoundrels as you and i were  by no means replied jim with a peculiar smile but dyou know bloater i never can feel that we were such desperate villains as you make us out to have been when we swept the streets together  just listen to him exclaimed the bloater smiting his knee with his fist you cant feelwhat have feelings to do with knowledge dont you know that we were fairly and almost hopelessly in the current and that we should probably have been swept off the face of the earth by this time if it had not been for that old gentleman with the bald head and the kindly  there now bloater dont let us have any more of that you become positively rabid when you get upon that old gentleman and you are conceited enough also to suppose that all the gratitude in the world has been shovelled into your own bosom  come let us return to the point what do i think of the weddingwell i think a good deal of it there is risk no doubt but there is that in everything sublunary  i think moreover that the marriage is founded on true love  he never would have come to his present condition but for true love to martha which in gods providence seems to have been made the means of opening his mind to marthas message the pith of which message was contained in his last remark on leaving the church  then as to martha our own knowledge of her would be sufficient to ease our minds as to her wisdom even if it were not coupled with the reply she made to me when i expressed wonder that she should desire to marry such a man  many waters she said cannot quench love  ha you know something of that yourself remarked bob with a smile  something replied little jim with a sigh  well dont despond said the bloater laying his hand on jims shoulder  i have reason to know that the obstacles in your way shall soon be removed because that dear old gentleman with the  he was cut short by a loud gruff shouting in the street below accompanied by the rattling of wheels and the clatter of horses hoofs  ah there they go cried jim his eyes glistening with enthusiasm as he and his friend leaned out of the window and strove to gain a glimpse of the street between the forest of chimneys driving along hammer and tongs neck or nothing always at it night and day  a blessing on them  amen said the bloater as he and jim resumed their seats and listened to the sound of the wheels voices and hoofs dying away in the distance  reader we reecho the sentiment and close our tale with the remark that there are many rescued men and women in london who shall have cause as long as life shall last to pray for a blessing on the overwrought heroes who fill the ranks and fight the battles of the red brigade
