55490146	over the rocky mountains by rm ballantyne   this is one of the short but interesting books that ballantyne wrote with the less welloff members of his readership in mind  all of these were of about 120 pages and quite small books that could be sold for only a shilling or two  the hero of many of them is a character called will osten or wandering will  in this book he returns from a long trip away during which his father had died so his mother was very pleased to see him  but just before he died his father had been left a property in californiait was the time of the gold rush  will gathered some of his friends and off they went to have a look at this property  so what the book is really about is the life of the miners in the gold rush  surprise surprise  a young lady whom will had met on one of his previous adventures appeared on the scene on her way back to england will is determined to see more of her but he has no money to pay the exorbitant sum demanded for his fare back to england so he finds a very quick agent who finds a very quick lawyer so that his estate can be sold and the money raised for the fare  he catches the boat by the skin of his teeth  of course we will go with him on some more of his wanderings   over the rocky mountains by rm ballantyne    preface  note plan of this miscellany  there is a vast amount of interesting information on almost all subjects which many people especially the young cannot attain to because of the expense and in some instances the rarity of the books in which it is contained  to place some of this information in an attractive form within the reach of those who cannot afford to purchase expensive books is the principal object of this miscellany  truth is stranger than fiction but fiction is a valuable assistant in the development of truth  both therefore shall be used in these volumes  care will be taken to insure as far as is possible that the facts stated shall be true and that the impressions given shall be truthful  as all classes in every age have proved that tales and stories are the most popular style of literature each volume of the series with perhaps one or two exceptions will contain a complete tale the heroes and actors in which together with the combination of circumstances in which they move shall be more or less fictitious  in writing these volumes the author has earnestly endeavoured to keep in view the glory of god and the good of man    chapter one  describes homecoming and shows that matters whispered in the drawingroom are sometimes loudly proclaimed belowstairs  it was late on a winter evening when our hero william osten arrived in england in company with his two friends and former messmates bunco and larry ohale  when a youth returns to his native land after a long absence which commenced with his running away to sea he may perhaps experience some anxieties on nearing the old home but our hero was not thus troubled because his father having died during his absence and his mother having always been tenderhearted and forgiving he felt sure of a warm reception  our hero was so anxious to see his mother that he resolved to travel by the nightcoach to his native town of b leaving his companions to follow by the mail in the morning  railways although in use throughout the country had not at that time cut their way to the town of b travellers who undertook to visit that part of the land did so with feelings somewhat akin to those of discoverers about to set out on a distant voyage  they laid in a stock of provisions for the journey and provided great supply of wraps for all weathers  when will osten reached the coachoffice he found that all the inside places were taken  youll have to go aloft sir said the coachman a stout and somewhat facetiously inclined individual who observing something of the sailor in wills costume and gait suited his language to his supposed character theres only one berth left vacant on the fogsl longside o myself  well ill take it said will  five minutes afterwards the guard shouted all right and they set off  do you happen to know many of the people in the town of b said will to the coachman as they emerged from the suburbs and dashed out upon a long tract of moorland  know many of em sir said the man tipping the offleader on the flank by way of keeping his hand in i should ope i does its

have heard of a mrs osten no doubt a widow lady said will  wot the widder o that grumpy old genlman as died last year leavin they say a big estate in furrin parts  will felt a tendency to seize the man by the throat and tumble him off his box into the road but on second thoughts he restrained himself and said  she is the widow of a gentleman with whom i was intimately acquainted i did not know anything about his having estates abroad  i axe your pardon sir said the man a little abashed by wills grave manner didnt know they wos friends of yours  no offence i ope the old lady is raither low

belief that marryhann will never marry for her art an soul is set upon mrs osten an shes got a strange feelin of sartinty that master will as she calls the runaway boy will come back to comfort is mother an look arter the furrin estates  no richards mark my words maryhann will never marry  it may be so jemimar says idid you speak sir said the coachman turning sharp round on hearing will utter an exclamation of surprise  is your wifes name jemima  yes it is dyou appen to know her too  well i think i do if she is the same person who used to attend upon mrs ostena tall andthinand andsomewhat  stiff sort of womanhout with it sir youll not urt my feelins  i didnt marry jemimar for her beauty no nor yet for her money nor her youth for she aint young sirolder than myself a long way  i took her

estate  can you tell me how he came by it  no sir i cant  thats the only thing that my wife as failed to fathom  theres somethink mysterious about it i think for missis hosten she wont speak to marryhann on the subjec an all she knows about it is that the lawyer says theres an estate somewheres in furrin parts as needs lookin arter  the lawyer didnt say that to maryhann sir of course but shes got a abit of hairin er ears at keyoles an overears things now an then  further conversation on this point was here stopped by the arrival of the coach at the end of a stage and when the journey was resumed with fresh horses will felt inclined to sleep  he therefore buttoned up his coat tight to the chin fixed his hat well down on his brows and put himself into one of those numerous attitudes of torture with which outsides were wont to beguile the weary hours of night in coaching days  when the sun rose next morning will was still in that state of semisomnolence which causes the expression of the countenance to become idiotic and the eyes owlish  at last the chimneys of his native town became visible and in a short time he found himself standing before the wellremembered house tapping at the old door whose panelsespecially near the footstill bore the deep marks of his own juvenile toes  it is not necessary to drag the reader through the affecting scene of meeting between mother and son  two days after his arrival we find them both seated at tea in the old drawingroom drinking out of the old mug with the name william emblazoned on it in which in days gone by he was wont to dip his infantine lips and nose  not that he had selected this vessel of his own free will but his mother who was a romantic old lady insisted on his using it in order to bring back to her more vividly the days of his childhood and will in the fulness of his heart said he would be glad to drink tea out of the coalscuttle if that would give her pleasure  the good lady even sent to the lumberroom for the old armchair of his babyhood but as neither ingenuity nor perseverance could enable him to squeeze his stout person into that he was fain to content himself with an ordinary chair  now dear mother said will commencing the fifth slice of toast under pressure having eaten the fourth with difficulty you have not yet told me about this wonderful estate which everybody seems to know of except myself  ah darling will sighed mrs osten i have avoided the subject as long as possible for i know it is to be the cause of our being separated again  but there is no help for it because i promised your dear father when he was dying that i would tell you his wishes in regard to it and that i would not attempt to dissuade you from doing your duty  well you remember uncle edward i suppose  his nameyes said will but i never knew anything else about him i had nothing to remember or to forget except indeed that he got the name of being a wild scapegrace something like myself  like yourself darling exclaimed the old lady with a look of indignationno indeed  have not you repented and come back like a good prodigal son and didnt the dear beautiful letter that you wrote from that awful islandwhats its namewhere you were all but eaten alive  the coral island suggested will  yes the coral islanddidnt that dear letter give more delight to your beloved father than any letter he ever received in his life and more than made up to him for your running away and cheered him to his last hour whereas uncle edward was wicked to the lastat least so it is said but i dont know and its not right to speak ill of the dead well as i was going to say uncle edward died in some outlandish place in north america i never can remember the name but its in the papers so youll see itsomewhere on the other side of the something mountainsi forget  rocky perhaps  yes thats it the rocky mountains and i wish they were not so rocky for your sake darling for youve got to go there and take possession or serve yourself heir to or something of that sort of the property not that its large so they say i wish with all my heart it did not exist at all but they tell me there is gold on it though whether it is lying on the fields or down in holes im sure i dont know and oh dear i dont care for it entails your going away again my darling boy  here the poor old lady broke down and throwing her arms round wills neckregardless of the fact that in so doing she upset and broke one of her best china teacupswept upon his bosom  such was the manner of the announcement of the news in the drawingroom  in the kitchen the same subject was being discussed by a select party consisting of maryann mr richards the coachman his spouse jemima formerly scrubbinsthe baby richardswho has already been referred to as being reduced in the matter of his ablutions to a bread canand larry ohale with his faithful indian friend bunco  to think said maryann with a quiet laugh as she handed a cup of tea to buncoto think that i should ever come for to sit at tea with a live red indian from amerikynot that hes red either for im sure that hany one with eyes in their ead could see that hes only brown  ah my dear thats cause hes changed colour said larry pushing in his cup for more tea  he wasnt always like that  sure when i first knowd bunco he was scarletpure scarlet only he took a fancy one day when he was in a wild mood to run his canoe over the falls of niagara for a wager an faix when he came up out o the wather after it he was turned brown ans bin that same ever since  gammon exclaimed maryann  sure ye dont misdoubt me word maryann said larry reproachfully isnt it true bunco  yoos a norribable liar larry answered bunco with a broad grin  richards the coachman who had been for some minutes too busy with the buttered toast and bacon to do more than listen and chuckle here burst into a loud guffaw and choked himself partially  jemima and maryann also laughed whereupon the baby not to be outdone broke suddenly into a tremendous crow and waved its fat arms so furiously that it overturned a teacup and sent the contents into buncos lap  this created a momentary confusion and when calm was restored mrs richards asked maryann if hanythink noo ad turned up in regard to the estate which she seemed to know so much about but in regard to which she was apparently so unwilling to be communicative  not so jemimar said maryann with a look of offended dignity unwillin to speak i am not though unable i may beat least i was so until yesterday but i have come to know a little more about it since master will came ome while i chanced to be near  maryann hesitated a moment and richards through a mouthful of toast muttered the keyhole  did you speak sir said maryann bridling  no oh no not by no means replied richards only the crust o this ere toast is rayther ard and im apt to growl wen thats so  if the crust is ard mr richards your teeth is arder so you ought to scrunch em without growling  brayvo my dear exclaimed larry coming to the rescue youre more nor match for him so be marciful like a good sowl an lets hear about this estate for it seems to me from what ive heard it must be somewhere in the neighbourhood of buncos native place  maryann darting a look of mingled defiance and triumph at richards who became more than ever devoted to the toast and bacon proceeded  well as i was asayin i eard mrs osten say to master will that his uncle edwardas was a scape somethin or otherhad died an left a small estate behind the rocky mountains in ameriky or afriky i aint sure which  ameriky my dear observed larry  an she said as ow they ad discovered gold on it which could be picked up in andfuls an it was somewhere near a place called kally somethin  calliforny cried larry  yes that was it  i towld ye that bunco exclaimed the irishman becoming excited go on dear  well it seems theres some difficulties in the matter wich im sure dont surprise me for i never eard of things as ad to do with estates and law as didnt create difficulties and im thankful as ive got nothin to do with none of such things  well the end of it all is that wen master was dyin he made missis swear as shed urge master will to go to see after things hisself an missis poor dear she would rather let the estate and all the gold go if she could only keep the dear boy at ome but shes faithful to her promise an advises him to gothe sooner the betterbecause that would let him come back to her all the quicker  master will he vowed at first that he would never more leave her and i blieve he was in earnest but when she spoke of his fathers wish he gave in an said he would go if she thought it his dooty so for to do  hooray shouted larry jumping up at this point and performing a species of wardance for a few moments and then sitting down and demanding another supply of tea  didnt i tell ye bunco that the order would soon be up anchor an away again  its wanderin will hes been named an wanderin will hell remain thats as plain as the nose on me face  no doubt the nose on your face is very plainthe plainest i ever did see said maryann sharplybut youre quite wrong about master will for hes very anxious to get married i can tell you an wants to settle down at ome like a sensible man though it does grieve my eart to think of the creetur as has took him in in furrin parts  get married exclaimed larry jemima and richards in the same breath  yes get married replied maryann very full of the importance of her keyhole discoveries and not willing to make them known too readily  how did you come to know that maryhann asked jemima are you sure of it  how i came for to know it replied the other is nobodys business she paused a moment and looked sternly at richards but that sensible man continued to gaze steadfastly at his plate and to scrunch crusts with grave abstraction and as to its bein true all i can say is i had it from his own lips  master will has no objection to my knowing what he tells his motheras no more he shouldnt for jemimar you can bear me witness that ive been a second mother to him an used to love him as if he were my ownthough he was a aggrawatin hinfant an used to bump his ead an skin his knees an tear his clothes an wet his feet in a way that often distracted me though i did my very best to prevent it but nothinks of any use tryin of wen you cant do it as my usband as was in the muttonpie line said to the doctor the night afore he diedmy eart used to be quite broke about him so it did but thats all past an gonewell as i was asayin master will he told his mother as ow there was a young lady so he called her as ad won his art an she was a cannibal as lived on a coal island in the paphysic ocean  then he told her some stories about the coal island as made my blood run cold and said his flora behaved like a heroine in the midst of it all  at this point larry and bunco exchanged meaning glances and the former gave vent to a soft whistle which he accompanied with a wink  im sure continued maryann its past my comprehension for instead of being dreadfully shocked as i had expected mrs osten threw her arms round master wills neck and blessed him and the cannibal too and said she hoped to be spared to see em united though she wouldnt like them to remain on the coal island in the paphysic  i do assure you jemimar continued maryann putting the corner of her apron to her eyes it quite gave me a turn and i was nearly took bad wen i eard it  master will he made his mother promise to keep it to herself as he said not a soul in the world knew of it but him and her  mr richards coughed at this point and appeared to be engaged in a severe conflict with an untractable crust which caused maryann to stop suddenly and look at him  but larry again came to the rescue by saying  why maryann my dear yeve bin an mistook a good deal of what youve heard intirely  this flora westwood is no cannibal but wan o the purtiest bit craturs i iver had the good luck to set eyes on as white as a lily wid cheeks like the rose not to spake of a smile an a timper of an angel  shes a parsons daughter too an lives on a coral island in the pacific ocean where the people is cannibals no doubt as ive good raison to know for they ait up a lot o me shipmates and it was by good luck they didnt ait up myself and master will toothough i do belaive theyd have found me so tough that id have blunted their teeth an soured on their stummicks bad luck to them  but its surprised that i am to hear about this  ah then master will but yere a sly dogmore cunnin than i took ye for  ye threw dust in the eyes of larry ohale anyhow  poor maryann appeared much relieved by this explanation although she felt it to be consistent with her dignity that she should throw considerable doubt on larrys statement crossquestion him pretty severely and allow herself to be convinced only after the accumulation of an amount of evidence that could not be resisted  well now that accounts for the way in which his mother received the news said maryann  it is a strange story remarked jemima  uncommon observed richards  bunco said nothing but he grinned from ear to ear  at that moment as if it were aware of the climax at which the party had arrived the baby without a single note of warning set up a hideous howl in the midst of which the bell rang and maryann rose to answer it  master will wants to speak to you mr hale and to mr bunco too she said on returning  come along mister bunco said larry thatll be the order to trip our anchors  my friends said will osten when the two were seated on the corners of their respective chairs in the drawingroom i sent for you to say that circumstances have occurred which render it necessary that i should visit california  do you feel inclined to join me in this trip or do you prefer to remain in england  im yer man said larry  sos me added bunco  i thought so said will smiling we have been comrades together too long to part yet  but i must start without delay and mean to go by the plains and across the rocky mountains  are you ready to set off on short notice  in half an hour av ye plaze sur said larry  bunco grinned and nodded his head  the end of the week will do said will laughing so be off and make your preparations for a long and rough trip  in pursuance of this plan will osten and his two staunch followers soon after the date of the above conversation crossed the atlantic traversed the great lakes of canada to the centre of north america purchased at the town of saint pauls horses guns provisions powder shot etcetera for a long journey and found themselves one beautiful summer evening galloping gaily over those wide prairies that roll beyond the last of the backwood settlements away into the wild recesses of the western wilderness    chapter two  describes a burst over the western prairie and introduces a new character also a hunt and a great feast  wandering will and his companions laid the reins on the necks of their halftamed horses and galloped wildly away over the western prairie perhaps it was the feeling of absolute freedom from human restraints that excited them to the galloping and shouting condition of maniacs perhaps it was the idea of sweeping over unbounded space in these interminable plains or the influence of the fresh air around the sunny blue sky overhead and the flowerspeckled sward underfootperhaps it was all these put together but whatever the cause our three travellers commenced their journey at a pace that would have rendered them incapable of further progress in a few hours had they kept it up their state of mind was aptly expressed at the end of one of these wild flights by larry who exclaimed as he reined in  ah then its flyin ill be in a minit  sure av i only had a pair o wings no bigger than a sparrows i cud do it aisy  yoos a goose larry observed bunco  faix if i was its mesilf as would fly away an lave you to waller on the dirty earth ye belongs to retorted the other  dirty earth echoed will osten gazing round on the plains of bright green grass that waved in the soft air with something like the gentle heavings of the sea  come lets have another  they stretched out again at full gallop and swept away like the wind itself  hooroo shouted larry ohale wildly throwing out both arms and rising in his stirrups look here bunco im goin to fly boy  larry didnt mean to do so but he did fly  his horse put its foot in a badgerhole at that moment and fell  the rider flying over its head alighted on his back and remained in that position quite motionless while his alarmed comrades reined up hastily and dismounted  not hurt i hope said will anxiously  och ha gintly doctor take me up tinderly gasped the poor man as they raised him to the perpendicular position in which he stood for nearly a minute making very wry faces and slowly moving his shoulders and limbs to ascertain whether any bones were fractured  i do belave im all right he said at length with a sigh of relief have a care bunco kape yer paws off but take a squint at the nape o me neck an see if me backbone is stickin up through me shirtcollar  me no can see him said the sympathetic bunco  thats a blissin anyhow  i only wish ye cud feel him bunco doctor dear did ye iver see stars in the daytime  no never  then yed better make a scientific note of it in yer book for i see em at this good minit dancin about like willothewisps in a bog of ould ireland  there help me on to the back o the bastebad luck to the badgers say i  thus muttering to himself and his comrades half exasperated by the stunning effects of his fall yet rather thankful to find that no real damage was done larry remounted and all three continued their journey with not much less enjoyment but with abated energy  thus much for the beginning  availing ourselves of an authors privilege to annihilate time and space at pleasure we change the scene the three travellers are still riding over the same prairie but at the distance of a hundred miles or so from the spot where the accident above described took place  it was evening  the sun was gradually sinking in the westfar beyond that far west to which they had penetrated  the wanderers looked travelstained and appeared somewhat fatigued while their horses advanced with slow steps and drooping heads  two packhorses which had been procured by them with an additional supply of necessaries at a solitary fort belonging to the furtraders of that region were driven by larry whose voice and action seemed to indicate that he and they were actuated by different sentiments and desires  of all the lazy bastes he exclaimed giving one of the horses a tremendous cut over the flank that startled it into temporary life i iver did seebut och whats the usetheres niver a dhrop o wather in this wilderness  we may as well lie down an die at wance  hush larry said will osten dont talk lightly of dying  lightly is it  well now theres nothin light about me from the sole o me fut to the top o the tallest hair on me head an the heaviest part about me is the heart which feels like lead intirely  but cheer up larry yer owld grandmother always said ye was born to be hanged so of coorse ye cant be starvedthats a comfort anyhow  what think you bunco said will osten turning to his darkskinned companion shall we encamp on this arid part of the plain and go waterless as well as supperless to rest or shall we push on  i fear the horses will break down if we try to force them much further  water not be faroff said bunco curtly  very well we shall hold on  in silence they continued to advance until the sun was descending towards the horizon when there suddenly appeared on the brow of an eminence the figure of a solitary horseman  sharply defined as he was against the bright sky this horseman appeared to be of supernaturally huge proportionsinsomuch that the three travellers pulled up by tacit consent and glanced inquiringly at each other  its a ghost at last muttered the superstitious irishman whose expression of countenance showed that he was not by any means in a jesting humour  ghost or not we must be prepared to meet him said will loosening a large huntingknife in its sheath and examining the priming of his rifle  the strange horseman had evidently observed the party for he presently descended the rising ground and rode slowly towards them  in doing so he passed out of the strong light and consequently assumed more ordinary proportions but still when he drew near it was evident that he was a man of immense size  he rode a black steed of the largest and most powerful description was clad in the leathern huntingshirt belt leggings moccasins etcetera peculiar to the western hunter and carried a short rifle in the hollow of his right arm  goodevening strangers he said in a tone that savoured of the yankee but with an easy manner and goodhumoured gravity that seemed to indicate english extraction  goin far  to california said will smiling at the abrupt commencement of the conversation  hm a longish bit  come far  from england  hm a longish bit too  lost and starvin i see  not exactly but pretty nearly so said will  i had entertained the belief presumptuous if you will that i could find my way in any part of the wilderness by means of a sextant and pocket compass and to say truth i dont feel quite sure that i should have failed but before i had a sufficient opportunity of testing my powers one of our baggage horses rolled down the bank of a creek and broke my sextant  in trying to save him i rolled down along with him and smashed my compass so i have resigned the position of guide in favour of my friend here who being a native seems to possess a mysterious power in the matter of finding his way  from the other side of the mountains asked the strange horseman glancing at bunco  yoos right said bunco with a grin  there was a slight touch of humour in the grave stern countenance of the stranger as he replied in a language which was quite unintelligible to will and larry but which appeared to create wonderful sensations in the breast of bunco who for some minutes continued to talk with much volubility and eagerness  you appear to be old friends said will inquiringly to the stranger  not xactly he replied but ive trapped on the west side o the mountains and the redskin is excited a bit at meetin with a man who knows his nation and his name  ive heard of him before  he was thought a brave warrior by his tribe but it is so long since he disappeared from the face o the arth that theyve given him up for dead  his wife was alive last fall  i saw her myself and she has steadily refused to marry any of the young bravesat least she had refused so to do up to the time i left but theres no calclatin what these redskins will do  however ive comforted this one wi the news  with your leave mister trapper said larry breaking in impatiently at this point may i suggest that when youre quite done talkin we should continue our sarch for grub an wather for at present our stummicks is empty an our mouths is dry  have you no food asked the trapper  none answered will we finished our last scrap of meat yesterday morning and have been hoping and expecting to fall in with buffalo ever since for the signs around show that they cannot be far distant  you are right i am even now followin their trail for like yourselves im wellnigh starvin  not had a bite for three days  ye dont look like it said larry gazing at the man in some surprise  perhaps not nevertheless its a fact so well push on an try to find em before sundown  saying this the stalwart trapper gave the rein to his stead and galloped away over the plains followed as close as possible by the wearied travellers  the pace was hard on the horses but there was need for haste because the sun was close on the horizon and as far as the eye could reach no buffalo were to be seen  ere long the character of the prairie changed the arid ground gave place to more fertile land here and there clumps of willows and even a few small trees appeared while in the far distance a line of low bushes ran across the country  water dere said bunco  the redskins right observed the trapper slackening his speed a little tis his natur to know the signs o the wilderness  does his hawkeye see nothing more  bufflo exclaimed bunco as he drew up and gazed intently at a particular spot in the wilderness  ay lad it is buffalo an no mistake  i knowd i should find em there said the trapper with a quiet chuckle as he examined the priming of his rifle  now friends well have to approach them quietly  youd better catch up the halters o your packhorses mister irishman  larry ohale at your sarvice mister trapper  benjamin hicks at yours mister ohale but im better known as big ben  and now he continued keep well in rear all of you an follow me down in the bottom there between the ridges  dont out o cooriosity go exposin yourselves to the buffalo  in the meantime keep quiet and let your mouths water at the thought o fat steaks and marrowbones  benjamin hicks galloped along the bottom of the hollow for a considerable distance then dismounting hobbled his horse by tying its two fore feet together with a piece of rope  thus hampered it could hop about in an awkward fashion and feed while its master advanced on foot  with rapid strides he proceeded some distance further along the bottom and then ascended the ridge in a stooping position  on nearing the summit he crept on hands and knees and on gaining it he sank like a phantom into the grass and disappeared  the party who followed him stopped on reaching the spot where the horse had been left and for some time waited in excited and silent expectation listening for the report of the hunters rifle  despite the caution given them however they could not long refrain from attempting to see what was going on  after waiting a few minutes will osten hobbled his horse and crept up the side of the ridge which might be more correctly described as an undulating prairiewave  bunco and larry followed his example  when they all lay flat among the grass on the summit and raised their heads cautiously the sight that met their eyes sent a thrill of delight to their hearts  it was still the boundless prairie indeed but its uniform flatness was broken by innumerable knolls and hillocks of varied extent which looked like islands in a green sea  some were covered with clusters of white pines others with low bushes  rich grass waved gently in the evening breeze giving to the whole scene an air of quiet motion  not far distant flowed the little stream already referred to and as this reflected the gorgeous golden clouds that were lit up by the setting sun it appeared like a stream of liquid fire meandering over the plains while far far away on the hazy and glowing horizonso far that it seemed as if a whole world lay betweena soft blue line was faintly visible  it might have been mistaken for the distant sea or a long low cloud of azure blue but will osten knew that however unlike to them it might appear this was in reality the first glimpse of the rocky mountains  the pleasantest sight of all however was a group of ten or a dozen buffalo which grazed in all the lazy ease of fancied security at the side of a knoll not more than three hundred yards distant  as our travellers lay with bated breath and beating hearts gazing at these animals dreaming of feasting on fat things and waiting for a shot they became aware of a low murmuring sound somewhat resembling distant thunder but softer and more continuous  on scanning the plains more intently they perceived that here and there were other scattered groups of buffalo more or less concealed by knolls while in the extreme distance a black line which they had at first mistaken for bushes proved to be an immense herd of living creatures whose pawings and bellowings reached them like a faint murmur  suddenly the animals close to them sprang into the air as if they had received an electric shock  at the same instant a white cloudlet of smoke rose above the grass and a few seconds later the sharp crack of the trappers rifle broke on their ears  the huge ungainly brutes bounded away leaving one of their number behind  he writhed violently and then lay gently down  a moment of suspense followed for he might rise again and run beyond pursuit as buffalo often do under a deadly wound  but no he curled his tail gasped once or twice and rolled over on his side  knives were out in a moment and the whole party rushed like wolves upon the prey  first they rolled the animal upon his brisket slit his hide along the spine peeled it down one side and cut off a piece large enough to form a wrapper for the meat  next the flesh on each side of the spine was pared off and the tongue cut out  the axe was then applied to his ribsthe heart the fat the tender loins and other parts were taken out then the great marrowbones were cut from his legs and the whole being wrapped in the green hide was slung on a pole and carried by will osten and the trapper to the nearest suitable camping ground  this was on the edge of a grove of white pine by the side of the clear rivulet under the shade of a woody hill  here before darkness had completely set in will and his new friend kindled a great fire and prepared supper while larry and bunco went off to fetch and tether the horses  now reader you must understand that it was no light duty which lay before the wanderers that evening  they had to make up for a good many missed meals  the word ravenous scarcely indicates their condition they were too hungry to lose time too tired to speak  everything therefore was done with quiet vigour  steaks were impaled on pieces of stick and stuck up before the fire to roast  when one side of a steak was partially done pieces of it were cut off and devoured while the other was cooking  at the expense of a little burning of the lips and a good deal of roasting of the face the severe pangs of hunger were thus slightly allayed then each man sat down before the blaze with his back against a tree his huntingknife in one hand a huge rib or steak in the other and quietly but steadily and continuously devoured beef  och when did i iver ait so much before exclaimed larry dropping a peeled rib  what not goin to give in yet said big ben setting up another rib to roast why thatll never do  you must eat till daylight if you would be fit to travel in the prairie  our wild meat never pains one you may eat as much as you can hold  thats always the way we do in the far west  sometimes we starve for six or eight days at a time and then when we get plenty we lay in good store and pack it well down always beginnin wi the best pieces first for fear that some skulkin redskin should kill us before weve had time to enjoy them  see here youve only had the first course rest a bit while i prepare the second  while he spoke ben was breaking up the marrowbones with his hatchet and laying bare the beautiful rolls of trappers butter within having extracted about a pound of marrow he put it into a gallon of water and mixing along with it a quantity of the buffalos blood and a little salt set it on the fire to boil  in a short time this savoury soup was ready  turn not up your noses at it ye gentlemen of england who live at home at ease though by the way we doubt the reality of that ease which causes so much dyspepsia amongst you that good food becomes unpalatable and strong food nauseous but believe us when we tell you that the soup was superexcellent  musha exclaimed larry when he tasted the first spoonful i feel exactly as if i had ait nothin at all yitonly goin to begin  and with that he and his comrades attacked and consumed the soup until their faces shone again with grease and gladness  thatll do now said larry in a decided tone as he rose and stretched himself preparatory to filling his beloved pipenot a dhrop nor a bite more on any account  is you stuffed full asked bunco  pretty nigh replied larry glancing at his friend with an inquiring look seems to me that you have overdone it  me is pretty tight said bunco languidly  come come cried the trapper dont shirk your victuals  theres one more course and then you can rest if you have a mind to  so saying the indefatigable man took up the intestines of the buffalo which had been properly prepared for the purpose turned them inside out and proceeded to stuff them with strips of tender loin well salted and peppered  the long sausage thus hastily made was hung in festoons before the fire and roasted until it was thoroughly browned  portions were then cut off and set down before the company  when each thought of beginning he felt as though the swallowing of a single bite were utterly impossible but when each had actually begun he could not stop but continued eating until all was finished and then wished for more while benjamin hicks chuckled heartily to witness the success of his cookery and the extent of his friends powers  ah it is all very well reader for you to say humph nonsense but go you and wander for a year or two among the rocky mountains acquire the muscles of a trapper and the digestion of an ostrich then starve yourself for a few days and get the chance of a feed such as we have feebly described and see whether you wont come home if you ever come home saying well after all truth is strange stranger than fiction  it need scarcely be said that the solace of the pipe was sought immediately after the meal was concluded by will larry and bunco but big ben did not join them  he had starved longer than they and intended as he said to eat all night  well observed larry as he extended himself at full length before the blaze and resting his right elbow on the ground and his head on his hand smoked in calm felicity ive often found that theres nothin like tiredness to make a man enjoy rest but faix its this night ive larned as i niver did before that theres nothin like starvation to mak wan enjoy his victuals  eight larry said will osten with a laugh upon my word i think it would be worth while to live always on the plan of missing our meals each alternate day in order to enjoy them more thoroughly on the other days  if city men would go on that plan observed the trapper gravely tearing the flesh from a rib with his teeth and speaking at the same time there would be no use for doctors  ah then think of that now wouldnt it be a rail hard case for the poor doctors said larry with a sly glance at will  bunco grinned at this and observed that it was time for hims be go sleep  whereupon he rolled his blanket about him and lay down with his feet to the fire  will osten also lay down and fell asleep almost immediately  larry too stretched himself out in repose leaving big ben still engaged with the buffalo beef  the night was rather cold  in course of time will osten awoke and called to the trapper to mend the fire which he did and then resumed his former occupation  once or twice after that one and another of the slumberers awoke and looking up sleepily for a few seconds beheld the enduring man still hard at work  the last to lift his head that night was larry  the puzzled irishman gazed in mute amazement during the unusually long period of half a minute for benjamin hicks still sat there glittering in the light of the campfire grave as a redskin and busy as ever with the bones    chapter three  relates how big ben became a travelling companion and how a big bear was captureddiscussions and misfortunes  to the great satisfaction of will osten and his friends it was discovered that benjamin hicks was a wandering trapper whose avocations led him to whatever part of the wilderness was most likely to produce furs and who had no particular objection to take a trip across the mountains with our adventurers  indeed big ben thought no more of a ride of several hundreds of miles than most men do of an afternoon walk and if particular business did not prevent him he was always ready to undertake a venture so long as it was in his opinion justifiable and likely to pay  you see sir he said as he and will cantered together along the base of a low hill one evening its not that im of an unsettled natur but ive bin born to this sort o life an it would be no manner o use in me tryin to change it  once upon a time i used to think o settlin in one of the back settlementsthat was when my poor old mother was alive  i used to live with her and take care of her after my fathers death  then i married and thought i was fairly fixed down for life but one night when i chanced to be out looking after my traps a warparty o injuns attacked the village and killed every soul in it  at least so it was said at the time but afterwards i met a lad who had escaped an he told me that he had seen my mother and wife killed but that a few of the men escaped as well as him  the trappers voice deepened as he spoke and he paused  was it long ago asked will in a tone of sympathy  ten years now answered ben sadlythough it seems to me but yesterday  for many a day after that i tried to find the trail o the redskins that did it but never succeeded thank god  if i had it would only have ended in the spillin of more blood without any good comin of it  it is long now since i left off thirstin for revenge but i suppose ill never cease wishin thatthatwell well gods will be done he added as if rousing himself out of a sad reverie im not used to speak about this but somehow whenever i meet with white men o the right sort in the plains or mountains i always feel a kind o longin to let my tongue wag raither too free  however as i was goin to say ive been a wanderer since then goin where i think i can be o use to myself or others and so as you dont appear to be overly knowin about the trail across the mountains ill go with ee a bit o the way an pint it out if you have no objections  no objections echoed will ill be delighted to have your company and would be only too glad if you could go all the way  who knows but i might be willin to go if i was asked said the trapper with a slight approach to a smile  are you in earnest asked will big ben not only admitted that he was in earnest but said that he was quite ready to start at once if they would only consent to diverge from their route about thirty miles to a small outpost belonging to the furtraders where he had deposited a lot of peltries which he wished to convert into supplies for the journey this was readily agreed to and accordingly next day about noon they came in sight of rocky mountain fortsocalled because of its being situated in a somewhat wild glen near the verge of one of the eastern spurs of the rocky mountains  while the fort was still far distant though in sight larry ohale uttered a sudden exclamation and pointed to a black spot lying on the side of one of the numerous mounds with which the country was diversified  a black bear said the trapper quietly  have at ye then shouted larry as he drove his heels against the ribs of his steed and went off at full gallop  stay bunco let him have all the glory to himself cried will laughing  bunco who had started to follow reined up and all three cantered to the top of a neighbouring height whence they could clearly see the country for many miles in all directions  meanwhile the enthusiastic larry had descended into a hollow to leeward of the bear  along this he trotted smartly following its windings and keeping carefully out of sight until he judged himself to be nearly opposite to the spot where the bear lay then breaking into a gallop he turned at right angles to his former course bounded over the ridge that had concealed him and rushed furiously on his victim  the bear was a young one but nearly full grown  on beholding the horseman it rose on its hind legs and showed all its formidable teeth  och is it laughin ye are exclaimed larry bringing forward the muzzle of his gun its cryin yell be before long  as he spoke the piece exploded  whether it was that his finger had pressed the trigger too soon or that the aim owing to the pace was unsteady we know not but larry missed the ball hit the ground just in front of the bear and drove such a quantity of earth into his facs eyes and mouth that he shook his head with a spluttering cough which ended in a savage growl but on beholding the wild irishman charging down on him with the ferocity and thunder of a squadron of heavy dragoons he dropt on his forelegs turned tail and fled  larry tried to reload while pursuing but owing to the uneven nature of the ground which required him to devote earnest attention to the badgerholes he could not manage this  without knowing very well what to do he continued the chase meditating as to whether it were better to try to ride over the bear or to attempt the breaking of its skull with the butt end of his gun  as however it was all he could do to keep pace with the brute he found either alternative impossible  ochone whatll i do wid ye cried the perplexed man in despair  the bear as if in reply glanced aside at him and grinned horribly  i do belaive its laughin again at me  git on ye baist to his horse sure yere four times as big an ought to run faster  larry forgot to do his steed the justice to add that it carried fourteen stone weight on its back  the poor man tried hard to overtake the bear but failed to gain an inch on him  to make matters worse he observed that the brute was edging towards a wood which lay on his right  seeing this he diverged a little and by making a dive into a hollow he managed to cut off its retreat in that direction  rocky mountain fort which lay on his left was now within half a mile of him and he could see some of its inhabitants who had observed the party coming from the plains standing at the gate of the fort watching the chase with much interest  a glance over his shoulder showed him that his travelling companions were in view behind  keenly alive to the fact that he should be overwhelmed with ridicule if he failed the now desperate man conceived the bold idea of driving the bear into the fort  he felt that this feat was not beyond the bounds of possibility for the bear was beginning to flag a little while his hardy steed was still in good wind  he therefore applied the whip with greater energy and soon came alongside of the bear which attempted to turn to the right but paddy had become a good and alert horseman by that time and was on his other side in an instant  again the bear tried to double and again his enemy checked him and urged him on  thus they progressed until they drew near to the gate of the fort  this was now deserted for the furtraders soon understood the game that the wild horseman was playing and made way for the entrance of the stranger  at last the bear came so close to the walls of the fort that it observed the open gateway  a way of escape was hereit evidently imaginedso it went through at full gallop  it was immediately met by a house  turning quickly round it was met by another house  dashing aside it was brought up by a wall as a last resource it ran behind a pile of cut firewood and stuck its head into a hole just as larry ohale bounded through the gateway with a wild cheer of triumph  will osten big ben and bunco quickly followed and the gates were shut by the men of the fort  but the victory was by no means completed  the question still remained how was the enemy to be made prisoner  one of the furtraders seized it by the tail and tried to draw it out  he failed to do more than draw forth a tremendous growl  another furtrader aided by larry came to the assistance of the first and by their united power plucked bruin out of the hole like a cork out of a bottle  he turned with fury on his enemies two of whom sprang back overturning larry in the act  at that moment one of the furtraders a stalwart canadian leaped upon the bear grasped him by the throat and tried to strangle him  one of the others seeing this caught at the brutes legs and tumbled him on his side for which he was rewarded with a scratch which tore his right arm open from the elbow to the wrist  the hands of the stout canadian were at the same time severely lacerated by the brutes claws  during the brief moments in which this struggle lasted big ben had leaped from his steed detached the stout line which always hung at his saddlebow made a noose as deftly as if he had been a british tar or a hangman and passed it quickly over the bears muzzle  drawing it tight he took a turn round its neck another round its forelegs and a third round the body  after this the work of subjugation was easy and bruin was finally reduced to slavery  we know not good reader what you may think of this incident but we beg to assure you that in its essence it is a fact and that that bear was afterwards sent to england to suck its paws in a menagerie and delight the eyes and imaginations of an admiring public  again we change the scene to the heart of the rocky mountains in which after many days of toil and trouble heat and cold hunger and thirst difficulty and danger our travellers found themselves at the close of a bright and beautiful day  i think said will osten reining up by the side of a copse which crowned the brow of an eminence that this seems a good camping place  there is not a better within ten mile of us said big ben dismounting  this is the spot i have been pushing on for all day so let us to work without delay  we have a hard day before us tomorrow and that necessitates a hard feed an a sound sleep tonight  thems the trappers cure for all ills  they cure many ills doubtless observed will as he removed the saddle from his jaded steed  larry whose duty it was to cut firewood remarked as he administered his first powerful blow to a dead tree that grub and slumber at night was the chief joys o life and the only thing that could be compared to em was slumber and grub in the mornin  to which sentiment bunco grinned hearty assent as he unloaded and hobbled the packhorses  soon the camp was made  the fire roared grandly up among the branches of the trees  the kettle sent forth savoury smells and clouds of steam the tired steeds munched the surrounding herbage in quiet felicity and the travellers lay stretched upon a soft pile of brushwood loading their pipes and enjoying supper by anticipation  the howling of a wolf and the croaking of some bird of prey formed an appropriate duet to which the trickling of a clear rill of icecold water near by constituted a sweet accompaniment while through the stems of the trees they could scanas an eagle does from his eyrie high up on the cliffs one of the grandest mountain scenes in the world bathed in the soft light of the moon in its first quarter  tis a splendid view of gods handiwork said the trapper observing the gaze of rapt admiration with which will osten surveyed it  it is indeed most glorious responded will a scene that inclines one to ask the question if earth be so fair what must heaven be  it aint easy to answer that said the trapper gravely and with a slight touch of perplexity in a countenance which usually wore that expression of calm selfreliance peculiar to men who have thorough confidence in themselves  seems to me that theres a screw loose in mens thoughts when they come to talk of heaven  the redskins now think its a splendid country where the weather is always fine the sun always shining and the game plentiful  then the men of the settlement seem to have but a hazy notion about its bein a place of happiness but they cant tell why or wherefore in a very comprehensible sort o way and as far as i can see theyre in no hurry to get there  it seems in a muddle somehow an thats a thing that surprises me for the works o the almightyhereaway in the mountainsare plain and onderstandable so as a child might read em but mans brains dont seem to be such perfect work for when he comes to talk o god and heaven they appear to me to work as if they wor out o jint  the trapper was a naturally earnest matteroffact man but knew little or nothing of the christian religion except what he had heard of it from the lips of men who having neither knowledge of it nor regard for it themselves gave a false report both of its blessed truths and its workings  he glanced inquiringly at our hero when he ceased to speak  what is your own opinion about heaven asked will big ben looked earnestly at his companion for a few seconds and said  young man i never was asked that question before an so of course never made a straightforward reply to it  nevertheless i think i have a sort of notion on the pint an can state it too though i cant boast of havin much larnin  seems to me that the notion of the men of the settlements isnt worth much for few o them can tell ye what they think or why they think it except in a ramblin way an they dont agree among themselves  then as for the redskins i cant believe that its likely there will be such work as shootin an fishin in heaven so im inclined to think that we know nothin about it at all and that heaven will be nothin more nor less than bein with god who bein the maker of the soul an body knows whats best for both and will show us that at the proper time  but there are mysteries about it that puzzle me  i know that the almighty must be right in all he does yet he permits men to murder each other and do worse than that  i agree with you ben said will osten after a moments reflection that everything in heaven will be perfect is certain  that we dont at present see how this is to be is equally certain and the most certain thing of all is that the very essence of heaven will consist in being for ever with the lord  i dont wonder at your being puzzled by mysteries  it would be strange indeed were it otherwise but i have a book here which explains many of these mysteries and shows us how we ought to regard those which it does not explain  here will osten drew a small volume from the breastpocket of his coat  the bible said the trapper  part of it at all events said will  it is the new testament  come let us examine it a little  the youth and the trapper sat down and began to read the new testament together and to discuss its contents while supper was being prepared by their comrades  after supper they returned to it and continued for several hours to bend earnestly over the word of god  in the wild remote part of the rocky mountains where their camp was made neither trappers nor indians were wont to ramble  even wild beasts were not so numerous there as elsewhere so that it was deemed unnecessary to keep watch during the night  but a warparty of indians out on an expedition against another tribe with whom they were at deadly feud chanced to traverse the unfrequented pass at that time in order to make a short cut and descend from an unusual quarter and so take their enemies by surprise  towards midnightwhen the rocky crags and beetling cliffs frowned like dark clouds over the spot where the travellers lay in deepest shade with only a few red embers of the campfire to throw a faint lurid light on their slumbering formsa tall savage emerged from the surrounding gloom so stealthily so noiselessly and by such slow degrees that he appeared more like a vision than a reality  at first his painted visage only and the whites of his glittering eyes came into view as he raised his head above the surrounding brushwood and stretched his neck in order to obtain a better view of the camp  then slowly inch by inch almost with imperceptible motion he crept forward until the whole of his gaunt form was revealed  a scalpingknife gleamed in his right hand  the camp was strewn with twigs but these he removed one by one carefully clearing each spot before he ventured to rest a knee upon it  while the savage was thus engaged larry ohale who was nearest to him sighed deeply in his sleep and turned round  the indian at once sank so flat among the grass that scarcely any part of him was visible  big ben who slept very lightly was awakened by larrys motions but having been aroused several times already by the same restless individual he merely glanced at his sleeping comrade and shut his eyes again  well aware that in such a camp there must assuredly be at least one who was acquainted with the ways and dangers of the wilderness and who therefore would be watchful the savage lay perfectly still for more than a quarter of an hour then he raised his head and by degrees his body until he kneeled once more by the side of the unconscious irishman  as he raised himself a small twig snapt under his weight the face of the savage underwent a sudden spasmodic twitch and his dark eye glanced sharply from one to another of the sleepers while his fingers tightened on the hilt of his knife but the rest of his body remained as rigid as a statue  there was no evidence that the sound had been heard  all remained as still and motionless as before while the savage bent over the form of larry ohale and gazed into his face  but the snapping of that little twig had not been unobserved  the trappers eyes were open and his senses wide awake on the instant yet so tutored was he in the ways and warfare of the wilderness that no muscle of his huge frame moved and his eyes were closed again so quickly that the glance of the savage sharp though it was failed to detect the fact of his having awakened  the busy mind of big ben was active however while he lay there  he saw that the savage was armed but the knife was not yet raised to strike  he saw also that this man was in his war paint and knew that others were certainly around him perhaps close to his own back yet he did not dare to look round or to make the slightest movement  his spirit was on fire with excitement but his body lay motionless as if dead while he rapidly considered what was to be done  presently the savage removed a corner of the blanket which covered larrys broad chest and then raised his knife  in another moment the trappers rifle sent forth its deadly contents and the indian fell across the irishman in the agonies of death  instantly the other sleepers sprang to their feet and seized their arms but before they had time to use them they were surrounded by the whole band of savages and amid a hurricane of whoops and yells were overpowered and pinioned  larry with the fiery zeal of his countrymen struggled like a madman until one of the savages gave him a blow on the head with the flat of his tomahawk to quiet him but the others who knew that to struggle against overpowering odds would only make matters worse at once surrendered  it is all over with us now exclaimed will osten bitterly if we had only had the chance of a good fight beforehand it would have been some comfort  when you have lived longer in the wilderness lad said big ben youll not give way to despair so easily  these remarks were made as they sat on the grass while the indians were engaged in catching and saddling the horses  soon after our travellers were assisted to mount having their wrists tied behind their backs and thus with armed savages around them they were led away prisonersthey knew not whither    chapter four  shows that the tables are turned and that good and bad fortune continue to commingle  one fortunate circumstance attending the capture of wandering will and his friends was that the indians happened to follow the route which they had been pursuing so that whatever might be their ultimate fate in the meantime they were advancing on their journey  big ben took occasion to point this out to his comrades the next night when after a severe days ride they were allowed to sit down and eat a scanty meal surrounded by the indian warriors  no fire was lighted for the savages knew they were now approaching their enemies country their food which consisted of dried buffalo meat was eaten cold  in order to enable the captives to feed themselves their hands had been loosed and refastened in front instead of behind them but this did not in any degree improve their chance of escape for they were guarded with extreme vigilance  you see mr osten said big ben in a low tone its a piece of good luck that theyve brought us this way cause when we leave them we have nought to do but continue our journey  leave them exclaimed will in surprise  how shall we manage to leave them  by escapin answered the trapper  how it is to be gone about no man can tell for man is only mortal an dont know nothin about the futur but well find that out in good time  i hope we may returned will sadly as he gazed round on the stern faces of the savages who ate their frugal meal in solemn silence but it seems to me that our case is hopeless  faix thats what meself thinks too muttered larry between his teeth for these cords on me wrists would howld a small frigate an theres a black thief just forenint me who has never tuk his eyes off me since we wos catched  ah then if i wor free i would make ye wink ye ugly rascal  but how comes it mister trapper that ye seem to be so sure o escapin  im not sure but im hopeful replied big ben with a smile  hopeful repeated the other its disapinted yell be then  havent ye often towld me that thim blackguards roast an tear and torture prisoners nowadays just as bad as they ever did  i have  welldye think them redskins look as if they would let us off seein that weve shot wan of them already  they dont  sure then yer hope stands on a bad foundation an the sooner we make up our minds to be skivered the better for sartin am i that our doom is fixed  dont ee think so bunco  the worthy appealed to was busily engaged in tearing to pieces and devouring a mass of dried buffalo meat but he looked up grinned and nodded his head as if to say that he believed larry was right and that in his opinion being roasted torn tortured and skivered was rather a pleasant prospect than otherwise  i have two reasons for bein hopeful observed big ben after a short silence  one is that i never got into a scrape in my life that i didnt get out of somehow or another and the other reason is that i have observed signs on the trees that tell me the enemies for whom the redskins are seeking are aware of their bein on the trail and will give them a warm reception perhaps sooner than they expect  what signs do you refer to asked will osten  i see no sign of man having been here  perhaps not and by good luck neither do the injuns for why they cant read handwritin as is not meant for em but i know somethin of the tribe they are after an one or two small marks on the trees tell me that they are not far distant  no doubt they will attack the camp at night  ochone groaned larry an wont they brain an scalp us wid the rest an our hands tied so that we cant do nothin to help ourselves  it is possible they may returned the trapper and if they do we cant help it but let me warn you all comrades if we are attacked suddenly let each man drop flat on the grass where he sits or stands it is our only chance  poor larry ohale was so overcome by the gloomy prospects before him that he dropped flat on his back then and there and gave vent to a grievous sigh after which he lay perfectly still gazing up at the stars and thinking of ould ireland  being possessed of that happy temperament which can dismiss care at the shortest possible notice and being also somewhat fatigued he soon fell sound asleep  his companions were about to follow his example when they heard a whizzing sound which induced them suddenly to sink down among the grass  at the same moment an appalling shriek rudely broke the silence of the night and two of the sentinels fell transfixed with arrows  one of these lay dead where he fell but the other sprang up and ran quickly with staggering gait after his comrades who at the first alarm had leaped up and bounded into the nearest underwood followed by a shower of arrows  that these deadly messengers had not been sent after them in vain was evinced by the yells which succeeded their discharge  a moment after several dark and naked forms glided swiftly over the camp in pursuit  one of these pausing for one moment beside the dead indian seized him by the hair passed his knife swiftly round the head so as to cut the skin all round tore off the scalp and stuck it under his girdle as he leaped on in pursuit  fortunately the prisoners were not observed  larry on being awakened by the yell had half raised himself but recollecting big bens caution dropped down again and remained perfectly still  the attacking party had of course seen the sentinels fall and the rest of the warriors spring up and dart away and naturally supposing doubtless that no one would be so foolish as to remain in the camp they had passed on without discovering the prisoners  when they had all passed and the sounds of the fight were at a little distance big ben leaped up and exclaimed  comrades look sharp moments are golden  theyll be back like a shot here larry grip this in yer hand an stick the point of it agin that tree  while he spoke in a cool calm almost jocular tone the trapper acted with a degree of rapidity and vigour which showed that he thought the crisis a momentous one  with his fettered hands he plucked the knife from the girdle of the dead indian and gave it to larry ohale who at once seized it with his right hand and as directed thrust the point against the stem of a neighbouring tree  the trapper applied the stout cords that bound him to its edge and after a few seconds of energetic sawing was free  he instantly liberated his companions  now lads said he down the stream and into the water as fast as you can  our hero and larry being utterly ignorant of the manners and habits of the people amongst whom they were thrown obeyed with the docility of little childrenshowing themselves thereby to be real men  bunco before darting away seized an indian gun powderhorn and shotbelt which had been left behind  the attack had been so sudden and unexpected that many of the savages had found it as much as they could do to save themselves leaving their arms behind them  of course therefore no one had thought of encumbering himself with the weapons of the prisoners  big ben had thought of all this  his wits had long been sharpened by practice  he also knew that his white comrades would think only of escaping and that there was no time to waste in telling them to look after their weapons  giving them therefore the general direction to rush down the banks of the stream and get into the water he quietly but quickly seized his own piece and the guns of our hero and the irishman together with one of the large powderhorns and bulletpouches of the warparty also two smaller horns and pouches  the securing of these cost him only a few seconds  when will osten and larry had run at full speed for several hundred yards down the stream which flowed near to the spot where the warparty had encamped they stopped to take breath and receive further instructions  the active trapper and bunco were at their heels in a moment  you forgot your guns said the trapper with a quiet chuckle handing one to larry and the other to will  what nixt asked larry with a strange mixture of determination and uncertainty in his tonethe former being founded on his character the latter on his ignorance  follow me  dont touch a twig or a blade o grass on the banks an make as little noise as you can  running water leaves no trail  saying this big ben stepped into the stream which was a small shallow one and flowed for nearly half a mile through a sort of meadow among the mountains  down this they all waded carefully avoiding the banks until they reached a narrow part where the stream tumbled over a precipice  here the trapper paused and was about to give some directions to his comrades when the sound of constrained breathing was heard near to him  with a sudden demonstration of being about to fire he turned and cocked his gun  the sharp click was no sooner heard than three indians burst out from beneath the bushes which overhung the water and springing up the bank fled for their lives  the trapper could not refrain from chuckling  these said he are some of the rascals that caught us making their escape by the same way that we are but they dont know the ground as well as i do and apparently have got perplexed at the top o the fall tis well  if the redskins pursue they will find the trail here as clear as a kings highwaysee what a gap in the bushes they have made in their fright at the sound o my lock  well well its not many men that have pluck to keep quiet wi that sound in their ears and the muzzle pointed at their heads  all we have to do now is to descend the precipice without disturbing the shrubs and then  a sound of horses galloping arrested him  hist dont move  at that moment about a dozen of the horses belonging to the warparty came thundering down along the banks of the stream  they had broken loose and were flying from the indians who had attempted to catch them on nearing the precipice over which the stream leaped with noisy petulance the snorting steeds drew up in alarm as if undecided which way to turn  a rare chance cried the trapper  every man for himselfkeep well up the hill comrades an hem them in  saying this he ran up the bank the others followed and in a few minutes they drove the steeds into a corner from which they made a sudden rush but as the long halter of each was trailing at its side no difficulty was experienced in securing several of them as they passed by  next moment the fugitives were mounted and hastening away from the scene of their late adventure as fast as the rugged nature of the ground would permit  it is not necessary that we should follow our adventurers in all their windings through the mighty fastnesses of the far west  suffice it to say that they made good their escape from the indians and that for many days they travelled through scenes so beautiful and varied that they have been spoken of by those who know them well as a perfect paradise  every description of lovely prospect met their admiring eyes in endless succession but so wary were the lower animals and so few the human inhabitants that those realms were to all appearance absolute solitudescreated apparently for no end or purpose  nevertheless there was enough there to tell the christian philosopher that god had made the deserts for the enjoyment of his creatures for although not always visible or audible myriads of living beings were therefrom the huge buffalo and grizzly bear to the sandfly and mosquitowhich rejoiced in the green pastures and luxuriated beside the sweet waters of the land  one afternoon the travellers came upon a small plain which reminded them somewhat of the prairies  the first glance showed them that it was crowded with buffalos  instantly a sensation of wild excitement passed through their frames and showed itself in various ways  the irishman uttered a shout of delight and suggested an immediate onslaught but it is due to his wisdom to say that the shout was a subdued one and the suggestion was humbly made  our hero became restless and flushed while the eyes of bunco and big ben alone served as outlets to the fire which burned within  the plain was surrounded by low wooded hills and had a lake on one side winding with many an inlet amongst the hills and into the plain while here and there a tiny promontory richly clothed with pines and aspens stretched out into the water  among the bluffs or wooded islets of the plain were to be seen several herds of bulls feeding about a mile off and other bands in the distance  tighten your girths said big ben dismounting  the horse which the trapper had secured though not his own was almost equal to it in point of size and strength  he eyed it with evident satisfaction as he tightened the girth saying that if it wasnt for the difference in colour he would have thought it was the old one  the others having also seen to their harness mounted and the cavalcade advanced at a walking pace into the plain  when they arrived within quarter of a mile of the largest band the buffalo began to move slowly off  the scattered groups seeing the horsemen drew together and soon forming a large band went off at a slow lumbering canter  the trapper breaking into a trot led the way taking care to increase his speed gently so as to gain on them insensibly until he had got within about two hundred yards of the nearest when he went off at full speed with a wild hurrah  the others followed brandishing their arms and cheering in the excitement of the moment while they hammered the horses ribs violently with their unarmed heels  as they closed with them the herd broke into separate bands and each man selecting the animal nearest to him pursued it with reckless indifference to badgerholes  fortunately for the riders the horses being accustomed to the work knew the danger and kept a sharp lookout on their own account  soon several shots told that the slaughter had begun but each hunter was quickly separated from the other and none knew aught of the success of the rest until the pun was over  there was something particularly ludicrous in the appearance of the bulls as they lumbered along in their heavy gallop their small hindquarters covered with short hair being absurdly disproportioned to the enormous front with its hump and shaggy main  as they galloped along their fringed dewlaps and long beards swayed from side to side and their little eyes glanced viciously as they peeped from out a forest of hair at the pursuing foe  one of the bulls suddenly took it into his head to do more than peep  he raised his tail stiff in the aira sign of wicked intentionsturned round and received larrys horse on his forehead  larry described the segment of a pretty large circle in the air and fell flat on his back but he jumped up unhurt caught his horse which was only a little stunned and remounting continued the pursuit of the bull and killed it  he then pulled up and looked round to see how it fared with his companions  ben and bunco were not in sight but he observed will osten in hot pursuit of a large wolf  with a wild cheer he made after him and by making a detour came in front of the wolf and turned it  will fired at it quite close but missed larry who had reloaded also fired and missed  then they loaded and fired again without success so they endeavoured to ride over the animal which they succeeded in doing as well as in running against each other violently more than once but without hurting the wolf which dodged between the horses legs snarling viciously  this game went on until the horses began to get exhausted  then the wolf made straight off over the plain and gained the mountains still hotly followed however until it became evident to the pursuers that their steeds were blown and that the wolf was distancing them at every stride  when they at length unwillingly pulled up the shades of evening were beginning to descend on the scene and neither buffalo nor comrades were within range of their vision  humph weve got lost because of that rascal grumbled will osten  bad luck to it exclaimed his companion  have you any idea of the way back asked will with a look of perplexity  not in the laste said larry its always the way when a man goes on a wildgoose chase hes sure to come to grief an a wildwolf chase seems to belong to the same family  will was too much vexed to reply so he urged his steed to a gallop and tried to retrace his way to the little plain but the more they wandered the deeper did they appear to stray into the mountains  meanwhile the trapper and bunco having cut off the best parts of the animals they had killed made their encampment on the highest bluff they could find near the lake and prepared supper looking out now and then for their absent comrades  as the evening wore on they became anxious and went out to search for them but it was not till the following morning that they were discovered almost falling out of their saddles from exhaustion and wandering about they scarce knew whither conducting them to the camp the trapper and bunco gave them food and then allowed them to sleep until the sun was high after which with recruited energies and spirits they resumed their journey  thus they travelled for many a daynow scaling rugged mountain passes where it seemed doubtful whether the horses would be able to clamber anon traversing rich meadows and frequently meeting with and shooting deer bears rocky mountain goats and the other wild inhabitants of the region  but in course of time they reached a particularly barren part of the mountains to travel through which was a matter of extreme difficulty while to add to their hardships game became very scarce  one evening they met with an adventure of a rather warm description through the carelessness of larry which wellnigh cost them their lives  they had reached a forest of small pines through which they proceeded several miles and then finding that the trees grew so close together as to render progress very difficult they resolved to encamp where they were and accordingly cut down a clear space in one part of which they fastened the horses and at the other end made the camp the weather had for a considerable time been hot and dry and mosquitoes and gadflies were very troublesome  they therefore lighted a fire for the horses as well as for themselves in order to let the poor creatures get the benefit of the smoke which as long as it lasted effectually cleared away the flies  it was larrys duty that night to hobble and secure the horses but larry was fatigued and particularly anxious to commence supper with as little delay as possible  he therefore fastened the horses so insecurely that one of them got loose and without being perceived kicked about some of the blazing embers in his anxiety to get into the thickest of the smoke and so find relief from his tormentors these embers set fire to the dry moss  while the travellers were busy with supper they were startled by a loud crackling sound  before any of them could jump up they heard a roar which was followed by a mighty illumination  one of the neighbouring pines had caught fire and blazed up as if it had been guncotton  the moment was critical  the little wind there was blew from the burning tree towards the spot where they sat  they had scarcely realised what had occurred when another and another of the trees flashed up for although green they burned like the driest timber  to unloose and drive the horses out of danger and carry off their camp equipage in time was impossible  big ben seeing this at a glance seized his axe and shouted to the others to assist he sprang at the intervening trees and exerting his enormous strength to the uttermost cut them down as if they had been willowwands fortunately they were small some of them were lopped through with a single crashing blow  our hero was not slow to emulate ben and although not so expert he did such good execution that in a few minutes there was a wide gap between the camp and the burning trees  but the horses meanwhile were in danger of being suffocated and the dry moss under foot was burning so fiercely that the fire threatened to spread in spite of their exertions  seeing this bunco and larryfirst casting loose the horsesran with their kettles and mugs to a neighbouring stream for water which they poured on the moss  by this time they were nearly surrounded by fire and smoke the flames roared with appalling fury the horse that had done all the mischief got burnt about the legs threw himself down in the very midst of the fire and rolled in agony  axes and kettles were instantly dropped and all sprang to the rescue grasped the creature by the head and tail but could not drag him out  in desperation larry seized a stick and so belaboured him that he leaped up and rushed out of the smoke and flames terribly singed indeed but not much hurt otherwise  after this the fire was again attacked and gradually its progress was cut off so that our travellers were ultimately enabled to remove to a place of safety but the flames had only been checked they soon spread again and away to leeward of them set the whole region on fire  from their new encampment that night they could see rolling clouds of smoke mingling with tongues of flame which shot up ever and anon above the trees and brought out in strong relief or cast into deep shadow the crags gorges and caverns of the mountainspresenting a scene of terrible devastation and indescribable sublimity    chapter five  describes a quiet nook and shows how larry came by a double loss besides telling of wonderful discoveries of more kinds than one  we must guard the reader at this point from supposing that our adventurers were always tumbling out of fryingpans into fires or that they never enjoyed repose  by no means  the duty which lies upon us to recount the most piquant and stirring of the incidents in their journeying necessitates the omission of much that is deeply interesting though unexciting and peaceful  for instanceon one occasion larry and bunco were deputed to fish for trout while our hero and the trapper went after deer  the place selected by the anglers was a clear quiet pool in a small but deep rivulet which flowed down the gentle slope of a wooded hill  the distant surroundings no doubt were wild enough but the immediate spot to which we refer might have been a scene in bonnie scotland and would have gladdened the heart of a painter as being his beau ideal perhaps of a quiet nook  the day was quiet too the little birds apparently were very happy and the sun was very brightso bright that it shone through the mirrorlike surface of the pool right down to the bottom and there revealed several large fat trout which were teazed and tempted and even exhorted to meet their fate by the earnest larry the converse on the occasion too was quiet and peaceful  it was what we may style a lazy sort of day and the anglers felt lazy and so did the fish for although they saw the baits which were held temptingly before their noses they refused to bite  trout in those regions are not timid  we speak from personal experience  they saw larry and bunco sitting astride the trunk of a fallen tree with their toes in the water bending earnestly over the pool just as distinctly as these worthies saw the fish but they cared not a drop of water for them larry therefore sought to beguile the time and entertain his friend by giving him glowing accounts of men and manners in the green isle  so this pleasant peaceful day passed by and pats heart had reached a state of sweet tranquillity when happening to bend a little too far over the pool in order to see a peculiarly large trout which was looking at him he lost his balance and fell into it head first with a heavy plunge which scattered its occupants right and left  bunco chuckled immensely as he assisted to haul him out and even ventured to chaff him a little  yoos good for dive me tink  true for ye lad said larry smiling benignantly as he resumed his seat on the treetrunk and squeezed the water out of his garments  i was always good at that an its so hot here that i took a sudden fancy to spaik to the fishes but the dirty spalpeens are too quick for me  i do belaive theyre comin back  look there at that wansix pound av hes an ounce  not only did the sixpounder return to the pool almost immediately after larry left it but a large number of his brethren bore him company and took up their former position as if nothing had happened  nay more the surprise had apparently so far stirred them up and awakened them to a perception of their opportunities that the sixpounder languidly swallowed buncos hook and was in a moment whisked out of his native pool and landed on the bankfor the anglers fished with stout cord and unbending rods  musha but yeve got im exclaimed larry  yoos better take noder dive suggested his friend  hooroo shouted larry as he whipped another large fish out of the pool  this however was the last for some time  the trout ere long appeared to have settled down into their former lazy condition and the anglers hopes were sinking when it suddenly occurred to the irishman that if the fish were stirred up with a pole they might be again roused to an appreciation of their advantages  accordingly a pole was cut the trout were judiciously stirred up and several of them actually took the bait in the course of the afternoonwhether under the influence of the unwonted excitement we do not pretend to say but certain it is that before sunset an excellent dish was secured for supper  equally peaceful and pleasant were the experiences of our hero and the trapper on that tranquil day  they wandered about in a state of silent happiness all the forenoon then they shot a grizzly bear the claws and teeth of which were claimed by will as he had drawn first blood  after that a deer chanced to come within range of the trapper who brought it down cut off the best parts of the meat and kindling a fire on the spot sat down with his companion to a fat venison steak and a pipe  this sort o life is what i calls happiness said big ben puffing out a cloud through the hazy curls of which he gazed at a sunny landscape of unrivalled beauty  so it is assented will osten with enthusiasm  an yet pursued big ben thoughtfully when i come to think ont this sort o life would be no happiness to an old man or to a weak one  no nor to a woman added will  not so sure o that said the trapper ive knowd injun women as was about as good hunters as their husbands an enjoyed it quite as much  that may be so ben but women of the civilised world would scarcely think this a happy sort of life  praps not returned ben  happiness is a queer thing after all ive often thought that its neither huntin nor farmin nor fair weather nor foul that brings it about in the heart o man or woman but that it comes natral to man woman and child when they does what is best suited to their minds and bodies and when they does it in the right way  which is very much like saying observed will that happiness consists in obeying the laws of god both natural and revealed  just so assented the trapper after a few moments consideration though i never quite thought of it in that light before  thus they conversedor rather in somewhat similar strains they chatted for they did not pursue any subject long but allowed their minds to rove where fancy leduntil evening began to close then they carried their meat into camp and closed the day with a sumptuous feast of fish flesh and fowl round a blazing fire while the stream which formed their beverage warbled sweet music in their ears  this reader is a specimen of one of their quiet days and many such they had but as these days of peace bore no proportion to the days of toil and trouble we must beg you to be content with the account of this one as a fair sample of the rest while we carry you over the rocky mountains and bear you down their western slopes towards the pacific ocean  the mountains being crossed the future course of our travellers was down hill but in some respects it was more toilsome than their uphill journey had been  the scenery changed considerably in respect of the character of its vegetation and was even more rugged than heretofore while the trees were larger and the underwood more dense  many a narrow escape had will and his friends during the weeks that followed and many a wild adventure all of which however terminated happilyexcept one to which we now request attention  they had reached the fraser riverthat celebrated stream of british columbia which waters a country that was destined in after years to become one of the great goldmining regions of the world  on the afternoon of which we write the party rode with difficulty down the rugged banks of the river which roaring through a narrow valley had overflowed its banks so that the trail was completely covered the horses being frequently up to the girths in water  in the course of the day they came to a place where the trail passed along the face of a lofty cliff of crumbling slate  the path was only just wide enough for the horses to pass  on the right rose a perpendicular precipice  on the left a few yards below the swollen waters of the fraser roared and boiled down their rocky bed with tremendous velocity  on turning a projection they found the track barred by a huge rock which had recently slipped down the mountain side  as it was impossible to pass the obstacle either above or below there was nothing for it but to cut down trees use them as levers and dislodge the mass  it was discovered when they dismounted to undertake this task that larry ohale was amissing  will osten had just uttered an exclamation of surprise and the others had not had time to reply to the question hallo whats become of larry when that worthys voice was heard shouting in the distance and his horses hoofs were heard clattering along the narrow track as he approached at full gallop  hooroo howld on doctor hi bunco an ben look here  goold avic goold ive got it at long last sure enough  youve got rid of your senses at last said will as his comrade almost rode him down  have a care man  what makes you ride at such a pace  goold goold goold cried the excited irishman plucking a little bag from his breast leaping off his horse and pouring the contentsa mass of glittering lumps and particleson a flat stone  didnt i tell ye i was born to make my fortin out o goold  theres plenty more where that comed from  come back an ill show ee the place  im sorry to disappoint you larry said will examining the socalled gold but i have seen this stuff before and i believe it to be a substance which is not worth its weight in brass  many poor fellows have been deceived by it before now  larrys face elongated very much at this  what say you ben he inquired  i fear me that it ant worth picking up replied the trapper fingering the shining particles  leastwise i once collected a bag o the same an showed it to a man in the settlements who got the credit o bein a knowin fellow in regard to metals  he told me it was somethin that i dont remember the name of but worth nothing so i heaved it away  thus doubly assured larry sighed deeply as he collected the shining metal into the bag and stood eyeing it disconsolately  at this point bunco chuckled  worse luck to it cried larry starting and tossing the bag violently into the stream where it sank and vanished for ever  little did any of the party imagine at that time that they had actually cast away some hundred pounds worth of pure gold yet such was actually the case  as it left larrys hand the bag touched the nose of his horse which shied slipped over the bank fell into the river and was swept away instantly they all clapped their shoulders to the big stone and pushed with such goodwill that it slipped and went crashing into the stream while the party went off at full speed after the horse  the poor animal was found at last stranded amid a mass of driftwood with its saddle and baggage gone but beyond this and the fright no harm was done  misfortins niver come single  tis always the way  howsiver niver say die better luck nixt time yell make yer fortin yit av ye only parsevair an kape up yer heart ould boy  thus soliloquising the unfortunate man remounted his wet and barebacked steed and rode away  time and tide are usually understood to wait for no man we therefore decline to wait either for time or tide but sweeping onward in advance of both convey our readers at once to the sea coast near vancouvers island where our adventurers arrived after an unusual share of toil and trouble and found a small craft about to sail for californiatook passage in her and in due time arrived at san francisco  the goldfever had just set in there  the whole town was in an uproar of confusion  excitable men had given up their ordinary work or shut their shops and gone off to the diggings  ships were lying idle in the bay having been deserted by their crews who had gone to the same point of attraction and new arrivals were constantly swelling the tide of goldseekers  here will osten found his fathers agenta staid old gentleman of spanish extraction who being infirm as well as old was feverproof  being somewhat taciturn however and rendered irritable by the upheavings of social life which were going on around him he only vouchsafed the information that the estate which belonged to the late mr osten was near the goldfields that it was not a rich one by any means and that his advice to will was to go and see it for himself accepting the advice our hero expended the greater part of his remaining cash in purchasing provisions etcetera for the journey to the sacramento river  by steamer they accomplished the first part of it and on horseback progressed northeastward until they drew near to the mighty mountain range named the sierra nevada  on the way they had more than enough of company for men of every clime and of all ages between sixteen and fifty were travelling on every description of horse and mule in the same direction  from most of these however they parted on reaching the entrance to the narrow valley in which the estate was said to lie  is it far up the valley asked will osten of the landlord of the last ranche or inn a small hovel in which they had passed the night  not far replied the innkeeper a shrewd intelligent yankee with a touch of the nasal tone for which the race is noted guess its about three leagues off  a wild gloomy sort o place no doubt asked larry  rayther  itll stand tamin a bit  theres nobody lives in the whole valley xcept a band o miners who have been prospectin all over it an locatin themselves in the house without leave  locatin is it exclaimed larry faix its vacatin it theyll be widout so much as by yer lave this night  have they found much gold do you know asked will osten  believe not replied the innkeeper  its not a likely placethough there may be some for gold has been found below this as you would see i spose when you passed the diggers on cocktail creek  bidding the host goodbye our hero and his friends rode off to take possession of the estate  they were well armed for in these days might not right was the law of the land  it was evening before they reached the head of the valley where stood the house or wooden cottage which had been the abode of wills eccentric old relative  the scenery was savage and forbidding in the extreme lofty mountains rose on every side and only a small portion of the land in the neighbourhood of the dwelling had been brought under cultivation the house itself was a low longshaped building and stood on the banks of a stream which gushed and tumbled furiously along its rocky bed as if in hot haste to escape from the dark mountain gorges which gave it birth  a hut near by was the residence of an old native who had been the owners only servant and a few cattle grazing in the meadow behind the house were tended by him with as much solicitude as though his late master had been still alive  the only cheering point in the scene was a gleam of ruddy light which shot from a window of the house and lost itself in the deepening gloom of evening  a most lugubrious spot said will surveying it sadly as he rode forward  faix id recommend ye to sell it to the miners for whativer itll fetch said larry in a disappointed tone  theyre a jovial set of squatters whatever else they may be said big ben as an uproarious chorus issued from the house  hallo  bunco what dye hear lad  buncos visage displayed at that moment a compound expression of surprise and deep attention  again the chorus swelled out and came down on the breeze inducing bunco to mutter a few words to big ben in his native tongue  what is it inquired will eagerly on beholding the huge frame of the trapper quivering with suppressed laughter  nothin nothin said ben dismounting only the redskins ears are sharp and he has heard surprisin sounds  go with him on foot  ill hold the horses  come long foller me quick as you can said bunco in a whisperno take gumno use for dem  filled with surprise and curiosity will and larry followed their comrade who went straight towards the window from which the light streamed  a voice was heard singing within but it was not loud and the air could not be distinguished until the chorus burst forth from a number of powerful lungs  hearts of oak are our ships jolly tars are our men  at the first note larry sprang past his companions and peeped into the room  the sight that met his gaze was indeed well calculated to strike him dumb for there in a circle on the floor with the remains of a roast of beef in the centreredshirted longbooted uncombed and deeply bronzedsat six old comrades whom they had not seen for such a length of time that they had almost forgotten their existencenamely captain dall long david cupples old peter captain blathers muggins and buckawanga  they were seated in every variety of attitude round a packingbox which did duty for a table and each held in his hand a tin mug from which he drained a long draught at the end of the chorus  the last shout of the chorus was given with such vigour that larry ohale was unable to restrain himself  he flung open the door leaped into the room with a cheer and a yell that caused every man to spring up and seize the nearest weapon and captain dall in a burst of fiery indignation was in the act of bringing a huge mass of firewood down on the irishmans skull when will osten sprang in and arrested his arm  at the same moment muggins recognised his old messmate and rushing at him seized him with a hug worthy of a black bear  to describe the scene of surprise confusion and delight that followed were impossible  the questions put that were never answered the answers given to questions never put the exclamations the cross purposes the inextricable conglomeration of past present and future historypublic personal and local uttered ejaculated and gasped in short or incomplete or disjointed sentencesall this baffles description  after a few minutes however they quieted down and while the new arrivals attacked the roast of beef their former messmates talked incessantly and all at once  youre the laird of a splendid estate of rocks and scrub said captain dall to will  not to mention the river replied will smiling  without fish in it ha groaned cupples  but lots o goold suggested larry with a wink give us a drop o yer grog lads its dry work meetin so many friends all at wanst  nothin but water here said muggins  what wos ye singin like that on cowld wather  we wos returned muggins  an whats more said old peter weve got used to it an dont feel the want of grog at all  whats in a name as jonathan edwards says in his play of have it yer own way or somethin like that  why if you call it grog an make believe it goes down likelike  wather suggested larry well well lets have a drop whativer it is  but how comes it to pass inquired will that we should all meet here just as people are made to do in a novel or at the end of the last scene in a play  nothing more natural said captain blathers  you know when we were cast adrift by the scoundrels that took my ship captain dall mr cupples and i made the coast and got to san francisco where we remained working at what we could to scrape together a little money before leaving for england as we had no heart for the goldfields  some months after that we were surprised to see old peter and muggins wandering about the town like beggars  they had come in a small craft from south america and were very glad to join us  we were soon persuaded by them to go to the goldfields and were about to start when we heard of this estate that had been left to a mr osten by his brother  i made inquiries found it was your father it was left to and having heard from muggins of your fathers death i wrote a letter to let you know we were here and to ask advicewhich letter by the way is about half seas over to england by this time if alls well then we agreed to come here and prospect for gold all over the estate the which we have done but without much luck as yet im sorry to say  but you have not yet accounted for the appearance of buckawanga said will  oh as to that muggins recognised him one day in the street  we found he had come over from them rascally cannibal islands in the service of a missionary  what exclaimed will dropping his knife and fork  the missionary you know said captain dall mr westwood who  is heis his familyin san francisco asked will recovering himself and pretending to be busy with his supper  ay he is on his way to englandwaiting for a ship i believe but buckawanga prefers the goldfields and so has come with us as you see  are the westwoods wellall of them  so far as we know they are  but in regard to the gold hereabouts  ay thats the thing said larry who had glanced at our hero with twinkling eyes when reference was made to the westwoods nothin like goold to warm the heart of a poor man an gladden the eyes of a rich wan  its that same asll interest the doctor most  well resumed the captain as i was about to say  didnt i hear you say something about going to san francisco for fresh supplies and more tools a few minutes ago asked will abruptly  you did we are short of provender and hard up for tools  i meant to start tomorrow but now that youve come ill delay  well not delay an hour cried will with unusual energy  it will never do to waste time here when people are making fortunes all round us  the rest of the party can remain to prospectbut you and i captain will start for san francisco tomorrow  ho ho said larry to himself that night as he smoked his pipe after retiring to rest its neck or nothin is itnever ventur never win is the word  well well tis the way o the world  my blessin go wid ye doctor  with this benediction on his lips he turned round shook the ashes out of his pipe and went to sleep    chapter six  in which will makes a retrograde movement and things come to a pretty passa sudden and decisive step  next morning true to his word will osten started off to retrace his steps to san francisco much to the regret as well as surprise of all his friends except larry ohale and bunco both of whom being aware of his motive chuckled mightily in their sleeves but wisely said nothing will was accompanied by captain dall and mr cupples the former of whom gave him an account of his adventures since the period of their separation in the south seas  as most of these adventures however were not particularly striking and as they do not bear upon our tale we will not inflict them on the reader but merely refer to that part of the captains career which was mixed up with our heros new possessions in the grizzly bear gulch as his valley was named  you see doctor said captain dall as they cantered easily over the soft turf of a wide plain which a little beyond the entrance to the gulch spread out for a considerable distance along the base of the sierra nevada you see when we discovered that this valley or gulch as they call it here was yoursor your fathers which i suppose means the same thingcaptain blathers mr cupples muggins old peter and i held a council of war and came to the conclusion that we would go up an have a look at it hopin to find gold but first of all we went to the regular diggins on the sacramento river to learn how to wash out the dirt an make enough to keep us goin  when we had done this an lined our pockets with enough of golddust to set us up we started for grizzly bear gulch where we found nobody but old timothy the native that had been your uncles servant  timothy said will was that his name  no but he could not tell us his name for the good reason that he does not understand a word of english so we christened him timothy and he answers to it  the old man cut up rusty at first and seemed disposed to drive us away but by howling the name of osten into his ears and giving him a little gold we converted him into a friend and got him to allow us to squat in the empty house  then we went off prospecting and found gold sure enough in the stream in front of the door but there was not much in the places we triedlittle more than enough to pay  then you dont think much of the property i suppose said will for it is evident that in regard to agriculture it is not worth a straw  im not so sure of that returned the captain  what do you think mr cupples  the mate whose melancholy tones and expressions had increased with his shoregoing experiences said that he did not know that he was no judge of such matters but that gold might be found in quantity and if so the place would be worth something  a safe conclusion said the captain laughing but that is just the point  gold has turned up in all directions near the valley and why should we not find it there  besides there is a pretty fair bit of land under cultivation and vegetables fetch fabulous prices at the diggins in addition to which there are a good many cattle on the ground and provisions of all kinds are as good as gold just nowso you see i think that even if we dont find more of the dust on it there is some chance that you may raise the wind by the property if you act wisely  well we shall see said will at all events i intend to make the most of my opportunitiesand talking of that captain dall as i see that mr cupples is lagging behind a word in your earill tell you a secret  hereupon our hero made the captain his confidant told him of the object of his journey and begged his advice and assistance both of which the worthy man agreed to give him to any extent at any time and under all circumstancesproving the sincerity of his assurances on the spot by at once offering several pieces of advice  one of these was that will should hasten on the consummation of his wishes without delay  this as may be believed was so consonant with wills own opinion that he accepted it at once and acted upon it then and there as far as was possible by plying whip and spur so vigorously that his steed skimmed over the plain more like a swallow than a quadruped  progressing thus they were not long in reaching the city of sacramento which was four or five days journey from grizzly bear gulch  here they embarked in a small schooner and descended the noble sacramento river into which all the other rivers in california flow  thence they coasted along the bay of san francisco which is a landlocked sea of more than forty miles in length and finally anchored off the town of the same name  and a wonderful town it was  the news of the discovery of gold had drawn so many thousands of ships and men to the port that the hamlet of former days had become a city of tents and iron and wooden edifices of every kind  gold can indeed work wondersand never was its power more wonderfully displayed than in the rapid growth of san francisco  but our hero took small note of such matters  he was bent on a mission which engrossed his whole soul and all his faculties and the fear that the westwoods had found a homewardbound ship and perhaps had already set sail induced him to go about everything he did in feverish haste during the few weeks that had passed since he last saw it the town had so changed its features that will could scarce find his way but at last he managed to discover the office of the agent who had advised him to go and see his property  mr zulino as he was named received his visitor with his wonted crustiness mingled with surprise which was somewhat increased when he found that will could not give a very comprehensible reason for his sudden return to the city  he could give no information as to the westwoods knew nothing about them but advised that will should make inquiry at the principal hotels in the town and at the shipping office adding that he believed one of the ships which had long been lying in the port unable to sail for want of hands had at last succeeded in getting up a crew and was to sail in a day or two for england but he did not know her name or anything about her  it is plain we can make nothing out of mr zulino said will with a look of chagrin on quitting the office  come let us go hunt up the hotels  agreed cried captain dall  mr cupples groaned his readiness to follow so they set off  all that day the three wandered about the city into every hotel and shipping office and every public place they could find until they were thoroughly exhausted but without success  now doctor said the captain wiping his heated brow if we are to gain our ends it is plain that we must feed  i feel like a ships hold without a cargo  see here is a comfortablelooking inn let us go and stow away something solid have a pipe and then turn in so as to go at it fresh tomorrow morning early  very well said will languidly but i cannot rest so do you go and order something while i try to cool myself by taking a stroll up this hill ill be back before supper is ready  i will go with you said mr cupples gloomily  poor will would have gladly gone alone but as he had no good reason for declining the companionship of his tall and solemn friend he merely said very good and walked away  passing over the hill they came to a neat little cottage with a small garden in front in which were a variety of flowers that evidently were well tended  the windows and doors of the cottage were invitingly open  as they passed the gardengate a voice suddenly exclaimed walk in  they stopped abruptly looked at the open door and then at each other in surprise  walk in repeated the voice louder than before  well really i dont see why we should refuse so pressing an invitation said will with a smile  you may go in ill wait for you said mr cupples  in another minute our hero was in the lobby of the cottage and then he discoveredon the words walk in being reiterated very grufflythat it was a grey parrot which had been thus taught to use the language of hospitality  will laughed and was about to turn on his heel when he observed a female reclining on a couch in one of the rooms  she looked up quickly on hearing his step and laugh and will hesitating for a moment advanced with the intention of explaining and apologising  forgive my apparent intrusion madam he said but your parrot deceivedwhatam ifloramiss westwood he exclaimed in amazement leaping forward and seizing her hand  mr osten said flora with a look of unfeigned surprise can it be iidid not knowreally  now reader it would be ungenerous were we to give you a detailed account of all the absurd things that were uttered at the commencement of the conversation  suffice it to say that will and flora stammered and blushed and grew hot and cold and tried to look cool and failed signally and then feeling how very awkward their position was made a desperate effort to be commonplace and so began to talk with intense solicitude about the weather  will soon perceived however that in the circumstances this was utterly ridiculous so he made another effort and asked about floras father and mother and then happy thought he suddenly remembered buckawanga and began to descant upon him after which he naturally slid into ships and voyaging and so came abruptly to the question  by the way miss westwood is it true that you are trying to secure a passage to england just now  we have succeeded in securing one said flora with a deep blush and a peculiar look  we sail tomorrow  tomorrow cried will in consternation  there was for a moment a great swelling of something in our heros breast then a sudden thought occurred never venture never next instant he seized floras hand  oh miss westflora dearest floraforgivenay do not turn away i entreat i beseech  old rascal exclaimed a stern voice at his back at that moment  will sprang up burning with anger and turning sharply round observed the parrot gazing at him in mute surprise  walk inold rascal repeated the bird  will laughed but there was a touch of bitterness in his tone as he turned again to flora who had risen from the couch  this is an awkward interruption flomiss westwood but necessity constrains me  i must i will speak now ifbear with me dear girl i did not mean to be rude but  a footstep was heard in the passage  supper will be cooling i fear said the hollow voice of mr cupples oh  i beg pardon  i did not knowi  will turned and rushed at his friend with savage intentions  at the same moment the figure of a man darkened the doorway  mr cupples vanished out of the house flora glided away and will osten found himself face to face with mr westwood  it might have been expected that the scene which followed would have been an embarrassing one but such was not the case  our hero had reached that point of nervous and mental turmoil and exasperation in which extremes meet  as the strong current of a river meets the rush of the rising tide and at a certain point produces dead calm so the conflicting currents in wills bosom reached the flood and he became desperately serene insomuch that he held out his hand to mr westwood and with a smile of candour and a tone of deep earnestness explained the situation and made a clean breast of it  the result was that mr and mrs westwood received his advances favourably but being naturally cautious and solicitous about the happiness of their daughter they pointed out that it was impossible to come to any conclusion at that time because in the first place will was by his own showing a poor wanderer with only the prospect of an income at his mothers death and without professional practice and in the second place as they were to set sail for england on the morrow there was no time left even for consideration  mr westwood therefore said that he could not permit will to see flora again except to bid her farewell and advised him to have patience until he should return to england where he said frankly he would be happy to see him  will thereupon left the cottage in a state of distraction to lay his case before captain dall  so you see captain he added after detailing all the circumstances there is only one course open to me and that i am resolved to pursue i shall sail for england in thethe whats the name of the ship the westwoods are to sail in  dont know answered the captain  of course notno matter  we shall find out  she sails tomorrow at all events and i go with her  you will go back with mr cupples to grizzly bear gulch work the gold make what you can out of it pay yourselves and hold the estate for me  ill get that legally arranged tonight  youll tell my comrades how sorry i am to leave them so abruptly but under the circumstances they will  softly interrupted captain dall if all this is to be settled tonight we had better set about it at once and not waste time with words  right captain  let us off to search for the captain of the ship  leaving mr cupples to eat the supper alone our hero and his friend went out in hot haste and soon found themselves in the presence of the captain of the roving bess which was to sail next day  by the way whispered will to his friend as they were entering the room in which the skipper sat do you happen to have any cash for i have only twenty pounds  not a rap whispered the captain  you are the captain of the roving bess i am told said will addressing a big rawboned man who sat at a table solacing himself with a glass of spirits and water and a cigar  yaas capn braaown at yr sarvice  captain brown drawled this out so slowly that one might have supposed he did it on principle as a sort of general protest against the highpressure speed and hurry that influenced every one around him  you have passengers going i understand  yaas  reverend genlmn an two ladies  can you take another  a dozen moar if need be  then put my name down  how much is the passage fare  foagsl two hundred cabin three hundred paounds  what exclaimed will  captain brown smiled  you see said he it caunt be done for lesshabliged to give fabulous wages to crew and only too thankful to get em at any price  provisions cost their weight amost in gold  will you be here an hour hence asked our hero  yaas two hours hence drawled captain brown lighting a fresh cigar at the stump of the old one  will osten linked his arm through that of captain dall and hurried him into the street  now to the agent he said  if he fails me all is loststay no i can offer to work my passage  that did not occur to me till now  i shall keep it in reserve  a few minutes more and they stood in the presence of mr zulino  is it possible said will with an anxious expression of face to sell the property in grizzly bear gulch immediately  the dry visage of the agent wrinkled into a sarcastic smile as he replied ha  i see you are like all the restwish to turn everything into gold  well it is possible to sell it i make no doubt because it is well situated and will increase in value but what do you mean by immediately  tonight said will  impossible  whats to be done cried our hero turning to captain dall with a look of such perplexity and disappointment that even the hard heart of mr zulino was touched  why such haste he inquired  because business of the most urgent kind requires that i should embark for england in a vessel which sails tomorrow and i have not money enough to pay for my passage  i can lend you some on the property at a high rate of interest said the agent  then do so my dear sir said will earnestly at any rate of interest you choose and i will sign any papers you may require  my friend here captain dall will see that you are regularly paid  i assure you that i shall never forget the obligation  follow me said mr zulino rising and putting on his hat  he led them to the office of a man who appeared to be connected with the law and who drew up a paper which being duly signed and witnessed mr zulino put in his pocket at the same time handing will osten a cheque for four hundred pounds  now captain said will with a deep sigh of relief as they once more issued into the street well go and enjoy our supper  next morning will osten with a small portmanteau containing his little all in his hand and accompanied by captain dall and mr cupples pushed his way through the crowded streets to the quay where a boat awaited him  once more captain dall he said turning round and grasping his friends hand farewell  i am sorrymore so than i can tellto leave you  may god prosper you wherever you go  remember my messages to our friends at the gulch  tell larry and bunco and the trapper especially that i feel almost like a criminal for giving them the slip thus  but how can i help it  of course of course said captain dall returning the hearty squeeze of wills hand how could you  love like necessity has no lawor rather itself is a law which all must obey  goodbye lad and good luck attend ee  silently shaking hands with mr cupples whose lugubrious expression seemed appropriate to the occasion will leaped into the boat and was soon rowing over the bay to the spot where the roving bess lay with her anchor tripped and her sails loose  on approaching he saw that mr westwood and his wife were pacing the quarterdeck but flora was not visible the reason being that that busy little woman was down in her fathers berth putting it to rightsarranging and rearranging everything and puzzling her brains with numerous little contrivances which were all meant to add to the comfort and snugness of the place wonderfully ingenious contrivances which could not have emanated from the brain of any woman but one who possessed a warm heart an earnest soul a sweet face and a turnedup nose  she was a good deal dishevelled about the head in consequence of her exertions and rather flushed and her eyes were a little moist  perhaps she was sad at the thought of leaving san franciscobut noshe was leaving no friends behind her there  that could not have been the cause  the little round porthole of the berth was open and she stopped ever and anon in the midst of her operations to look out and listen to the variety of shouts and songs that came from the boats vessels and barges in the bay  suddenly she stopped turned her head the least bit to one side and listened intently  my dear said mr westwood to his wife standing on the deck and leaning over the bulwarks exactly above the open port near to which flora stood can that be mr osten in yonder boat  floras bosom heaved and her colour vanished  i think it isstaynoit looks likeyes it is he said mrs westwood  floras face and neck became scarlet  presently the plash of oars were heard near the vessel and next moment a boat approached but not from such a quarter as to be visible from the porthole  mind your starboard oar said a deep voice which caused floras heart to beat against her chest as if that dear little receptacle of good thoughts and warm feelings were too small to contain it and it wanted to get out  good morning mr osten cried mr westwood looking down  good morning sirgood morning mrs westwood answered will looking up  it is very kind of you to take the trouble to come off to bid us goodbye said mr westwood  flora trembled a little and leaned upon the side of the berth  i have not come to say goodbye said will floras eyes opened wide with astonishment i am goingfend off men fend off mind what you are abouti am going he said looking up with a smile to sail with you to england  a peculiar gleam shot from floras eyes the blood mantled again on her brow and sinking into a chair she pressed her hands to her face and buried her head in her fathers pillow    chapter seven  rambling reminiscences of absent friends and a happy termination  on the evening of a cold december daythe last day of the yearmany months after the occurrence of the events narrated in the last chapter old mrs osten sat in her drawingroom toasting her toes before a cheerful fire  the widow looked very happy and to say truth she had good reason for being so for her stalwart son had come home to her safe and sound and was at that moment sitting by her side talking in a most amazing way about his florareferring to her as a sort of captive bird which had now no chance of escaping saying that he meant to take her to paris and switzerland and rome and in summer to the english lakes and killarney and the scotch highlands  in fact mother said will after that little event comes off which is fixed to take place next week i mean to act the part of wandering will over again under entirely new and much more interesting circumstances  ah mother he continued with enthusiasm how little did i think when i was travelling through the wild regions of the far west that i was being led to the spot where i should find such a wife  yes dear you were indeed led said mrs osten for that wild region was the very last place in the world to which you would have thought of going to look for a good wife had you been guided by your own wisdom  true mother most true  gold is much more plentiful in that land than wives either good or bad  i wonder how my old comrades are getting on there now  you remember larry mother and bunco  how i wish i could have had them all here at our wedding  you would have delighted in old captain dall and captain blathers too hes not a bad fellow though rather wild but big ben would have pleased you mostby the way this is the last night of the year  i doubt not they will be remembering me tonight and drinking my health in clear cold water from the crystal springs of the sierra nevada  come i will pledge them in the same beverage said will seizing a glass of water that stood at his elbow may success in the highest sense of the word attend them through life  amen murmured the widow as will drained the glass i hope they may get plenty of gold without catching the goldfever which is just another name for the love of gold and that you know is the root of all evil  but go on telling me about your adventures will i never tire of hearing you relate them  well mother ill begin again but if you will be for ever interrupting me with questions and remarks about flora i shall never get to the end of them  now then listen  hereupon will began to talk and his mother to listen with we need scarcely say intense interest  thus was the last night of that year passed in the drawingroom  let us see how it was spent in the kitchen  yes jemimar said maryann with her mouth full of buttered toast i always said it and i always thought it and i always knowed it that master will would come ome and marry a sweet beautiful young lady which as come true if ever a profit spoke since the day of jackariahlet me fill your cup my dear praps youll and me the kettle richards  the worthy coachman rose with alacrity to obey and jemima accepted the proffered cup of tea in the midst of a vain attempt to quiet the baby richards which happened to be unusually restive that night  to think too continued maryann with a laugh that i should ave gone an mistook the dear creetur at first for a cannibal  maryhann said jemima solemnly i dont believe theres no such things as cannibals  no more do i jemimardid you speak mr richards inquired maryann with a sudden assumption of dignity  the coachman who was devotedly engaged with his fifth slice of buttered toast protested solemnly that he had not spoken but admitted that he had experienced a tendency to chokeowing to crumbsjust at the point when maryann happened to allude to the cannibals  maryann had a suspicion that the tendency to choke was owing to other causes than crumbs but as she could not prove her point and as the baby richards took it into his head at that moment to burst into an unaccountable and vehement fit of laughter she merely tossed her head and resumed her observations  no jemimar nothing will ever convince me that there are any savages so depravated as to prefer a slice of uman flesh to a good beefsteak an its my belief that that himperent irishman larry oale inwented it all to gammon us  i quite agree with you maryhann said jemima who indeed always agreed with any proposition her friend chose to put forth an i old that it is contrairy to uman reason to imagin such beastliness much less to do it  here richards had the temerity to observe that he wasnt quite sure that such things were never done for said he i eard mr osten himself say as ow hed seen em do it an surely he wouldnt go for to tell a lie  at which remark jemima advised him to hold his tongue and maryann replied with an expression of scorn that she wondered to ear im  did he suppose master will didnt sometimes indulge in a little armless jesting like other people  she would have added more but unfortunately the crumbs got into richards throat again causing that sceptical man to grow red in the face and give vent to sounds like mild choking  owever observed jemima it dont matter now as mr william and is bride are safe ome again and if mr oale also was fond of a joke like other people there is no arm in that  poor fellow i ope es well an mr bunco too though he is a red hindian  ear ear said richards suddenly seizing his cup let us drink their ealth an the ealth of all their comrades for this is the last night of the year an by all accounts they wont likely be spendin it in the midst o such comforts an blessins as we does  come lasses drink it merrily fill yer glasses let the teapot circle round  the tone in which this proposal was made and the fact that it was the last night of the year induced maryann to respond with gracious condescension  well richards im agreeable  here then said richards raising his cup on high i give you the ealth of mr larry oale mr bunco an all absent friendswishin em luck an lots o gold  an a appy deliverance from these orrible countries added maryann  i agree with you maryhann said jemima draining her cup to the dregs in honour of the toast  but how did larry and his friends spend that last night of the year in the faroff golden land  let larry speak for himself in a letter which was received by will osten many months afterwards and which we now give verbatim et literatim  the letter in question was written in a remarkably cramped hand on several very dirty sheets of blue ruled foolscap folded with much care and crookedness and fastened with a red wafer which bore the distinct impression of an extremely hard knuckle  it ran thus  grizlie bar gultch first janooary  dear mister osten i taik up my pen the its litil i has to do wid sitch things to let yoo no that this coms hopin your al wel as it leeves usbarrin bunko who

fitein also to richards an his beter haf gemima  shees a good sowl too av she wasnt aflikted wid too ardint a desir to wair some of her husbands garmints so no more at present from loh  we can add little to the record so graphically penned by larry ohale and it were well perhaps that having spun our yarn out to the end we should follow his example and write no more  but we feel that it would be unjust to the memory of our hero were we to dismiss him without a few words as to his subsequent career  it happens sometimes though we believe not frequently that those who begin life with what may be called a wild burst settle down at last into quiet domestic men whose chief delight it is to fight their battles oer again with sympathetic comrades and to wander in dreams  such was the case with will osten  flora acted the part of a bestbower anchor to him all through life and held him fast but if the whole truth must be told it is our duty to add that will did not strain hard at the cable  he rode easily in the calm harbour of home which was seldom ruffled with galesmatrimonial or otherwise  the success of his californian estate was so great that besides setting up in life the most of the comrades who had followed his fortunes it placed himself beyond the necessity of working for his daily bread will did not however lead an idle life on that account  he recognised the great truth that he was answerable to his creator for the management of his time and talents just as much as the man who has to earn his bread in the sweat of his brow and he made it his chief aim in life to act the part of a faithful steward  that he did not succeed in this to the full extent of his wishes is certain nevertheless his success must have been considerable if we are to believe the opinion of his friends who used to say of him with enthusiasm that he was a blessing to the community in the midst of which he dwelt for in imitation of the master whom he served he went about continually doing good  in process of time several little boats if we may be allowed the expression appeared in the harbour and cast anchor alongside of will or rather attached themselves to the anchor which held him fast and flora was quite able to hold them allthough it must be admitted that she had infinitely more trouble with the little boats than she had with the big ship for they had all wandering wills of their own and from the time of their first appearance evinced a strong tendency to strain with tremendous vigour at their cables  indeed on several occasions one or two of the boats attempted actually to cut their cables and make off as the old ship had done before them but wills wisdom and floras winning ways prevailed and it was found that having been trained in the way in which they should go from the commencement they did not depart from that way when they grew old  in reference to the early existence of this little flotilla we may with propriety quote the opinion of maryannthan whom there could not be a better witness for she dwelt in wills house and nursed them all as she had nursed their father before themsuperintended of course by old mrs osten who dwelt in a cottage of her own hard by and watched the rise and progress of her descendants for many a year with keen felicity  maryann in talking over matters with her faithful bosom friend was wont to say  yes jemimar i never had two opinions about it theyre the beautifulest an sweetest children i ever did ave had to do withjust as master will their papa was simularly so but im free to confess that they all has a surprisin sperrit  theres master william now i cant abear to call him will because that was the name as is father went by and i old that in a sense it is sacred theres master william though es only jist out o frocks an frilled trousers and noo into blue tights an brass buttons there e is goin about the country on a pony as isnt much bigger than a noofoundland dog but goes over the edges an ditches in a way as makes my blood to curdle an my skin to creep with that dear boy on is back and is tail flyin beind an shoutin with a sort of wild delight that i do think is wickedi do indeed jemimar i give you my word i think it sinful though of course e dont mean it so poor child and is father cheerin im on in a way that must sear is conscience wuss than a red ot iron wich is mother echoes too it is quite past my compreension  then e comes ome sich a figur with oles in is trousers an is ats squeezed flat an is jackets torn  but master charles aint a bit better  though es scarcely able to walk e can ride like a jockey an needs more mendin of is close than any six ordinary boys  miss flora too would be just as wild if she werent good and bidable wich is er salvation an the babyoh you wouldnt believe it didnt i catch that hinfant only the other day tryin to throw a summerset in its bed in imitation of master william an yesterday morning i caught master charles trying to teach it to ang on to the closerope in the nursery by its toes  its an awful trainin the poor things is gettinan the only comfort i ave in em is that their dear mother do constantly teach em the biblewich condemns all sich thingsan she do manage to make em fond o wisitin an considerin of the poor  to which observations jemima holding up her hands and gazing at her bosom friend in sympathy would reply that her own sentiments was hidentically simular that things in general was to her most amazin and that there was no accountin for nothin in this life but that watever came of it she oped the family would live long an appy in a world wich was she must confess a most perplexing mixture of good and evil though of course she wasnt rightly able to understand or explain that but she was sure of this anyhow that although she was by no means able to explain erself as well as she could wish she knew that she wished well to every one who stuck to the golden rule like mr and mrs osten  with which sentiment good reader we shall conclude this chronicle of the life and adventures of wandering will and respectfully bid you farewell  the end
