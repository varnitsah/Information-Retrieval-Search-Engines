the passing of marcus o’brien             106 the wit of porportuk                      124  lost face   it was the end  subienkow had travelled a long trail of bitterness and horror homing like a dove for the capitals of europe and here farther away than ever in russian america the trail ceased  he sat in the snow arms tied behind him waiting the torture  he stared curiously before him at a huge cossack prone in the snow moaning in his pain the men had finished handling the giant and turned him over to the women that they exceeded the fiendishness of the men the man’s cries attested  subienkow looked on and shuddered  he was not afraid to die  he had carried his life too long in his hands on that weary trail from warsaw to nulato to shudder at mere dying  but he objected to the torture  it offended his soul  and this offence in turn was not due to the mere pain he must endure but to the sorry spectacle the pain would make of him  he knew that he would pray and beg and entreat even as big ivan and the others that had gone before  this would not be nice  to pass out bravely and cleanly with a smile and a jest—ah that would have been the way  but to lose control to have his soul upset by the pangs of the flesh to screech and gibber like an ape to become the veriest beast—ah that was what was so terrible  there had been no chance to escape  from the beginning when he dreamed the fiery dream of poland’s independence he had become a puppet in the hands of fate  from the beginning at warsaw at st petersburg in the siberian mines in kamtchatka on the crazy boats of the furthieves fate had been driving him to this end  without doubt in the foundations of the world was graved this end for him—for him who was so fine and sensitive whose nerves scarcely sheltered under his skin who was a dreamer and a poet and an artist  before he was dreamed of it had been determined that the quivering bundle of sensitiveness that constituted him should be doomed to live in raw and howling savagery and to die in this far land of night in this dark place beyond the last boundaries of the world  he sighed  so that thing before him was big ivan—big ivan the giant the man without nerves the man of iron the cossack turned freebooter of the seas who was as phlegmatic as an ox with a nervous system so low that what was pain to ordinary men was scarcely a tickle to him  well well trust these nulato indians to find big ivan’s nerves and trace them to the roots of his quivering soul  they were certainly doing it  it was inconceivable that a man could suffer so much and yet live  big ivan was paying for his low order of nerves  already he had lasted twice as long as any of the others  subienkow felt that he could not stand the cossack’s sufferings much longer  why didn’t ivan die  he would go mad if that screaming did not cease  but when it did cease his turn would come  and there was yakaga awaiting him too grinning at him even now in anticipation—yakaga whom only last week he had kicked out of the fort and upon whose face he had laid the lash of his dogwhip  yakaga would attend to him  doubtlessly yakaga was saving for him more refined tortures more exquisite nerveracking  ah that must have been a good one from the way ivan screamed  the squaws bending over him stepped back with laughter and clapping of hands  subienkow saw the monstrous thing that had been perpetrated and began to laugh hysterically  the indians looked at him in wonderment that he should laugh  but subienkow could not stop  this would never do  he controlled himself the spasmodic twitchings slowly dying away  he strove to think of other things and began reading back in his own life  he remembered his mother and his father and the little spotted pony and the french tutor who had taught him dancing and sneaked him an old worn copy of voltaire  once more he saw paris and dreary london and gay vienna and rome  and once more he saw that wild group of youths who had dreamed even as he the dream of an independent poland with a king of poland on the throne at warsaw  ah there it was that the long trail began  well he had lasted longest  one by one beginning with the two executed at st petersburg he took up the count of the passing of those brave spirits  here one had been beaten to death by a jailer and there on that bloodstained highway of the exiles where they had marched for endless months beaten and maltreated by their cossack guards another had dropped by the way  always it had been savagery—brutal bestial savagery  they had died—of fever in the mines under the knout  the last two had died after the escape in the battle with the cossacks and he alone had won to kamtchatka with the stolen papers and the money of a traveller he had left lying in the snow  it had been nothing but savagery  all the years with his heart in studios and theatres and courts he had been hemmed in by savagery  he had purchased his life with blood  everybody had killed  he had killed that traveller for his passports  he had proved that he was a man of parts by duelling with two russian officers on a single day  he had had to prove himself in order to win to a place among the furthieves  he had had to win to that place  behind him lay the thousandyearslong road across all siberia and russia  he could not escape that way  the only way was ahead across the dark and icy sea of bering to alaska  the way had led from savagery to deeper savagery  on the scurvyrotten ships of the furthieves out of food and out of water buffeted by the interminable storms of that stormy sea men had become animals  thrice he had sailed east from kamtchatka  and thrice after all manner of hardship and suffering the survivors had come back to kamtchatka  there had been no outlet for escape and he could not go back the way he had come for the mines and the knout awaited him  again the fourth and last time he had sailed east  he had been with those who first found the fabled seal islands but he had not returned with them to share the wealth of furs in the mad orgies of kamtchatka he had sworn never to go back  he knew that to win to those dear capitals of europe he must go on  so he had changed ships and remained in the dark new land  his comrades were slavonian hunters and russian adventurers mongols and tartars and siberian aborigines and through the savages of the new world they had cut a path of blood  they had massacred whole villages that refused to furnish the furtribute and they in turn had been massacred by ships’ companies  he with one finn had been the sole survivor of such a company  they had spent a winter of solitude and starvation on a lonely aleutian isle and their rescue in the spring by another furship had been one chance in a thousand  but always the terrible savagery had hemmed him in  passing from ship to ship and ever refusing to return he had come to the ship that explored south  all down the alaska coast they had encountered nothing but hosts of savages  every anchorage among the beetling islands or under the frowning cliffs of the mainland had meant a battle or a storm  either the gales blew threatening destruction or the war canoes came off manned by howling natives with the warpaint on their faces who came to learn the bloody virtues of the searovers’ gunpowder  south south they had coasted clear to the mythland of california  here it was said were spanish adventurers who had fought their way up from mexico  he had had hopes of those spanish adventurers  escaping to them the rest would have been easy—a year or two what did it matter more or less—and he would win to mexico then a ship and europe would be his  but they had met no spaniards  only had they encountered the same impregnable wall of savagery  the denizens of the confines of the world painted for war had driven them back from the shores  at last when one boat was cut off and every man killed the commander had abandoned the quest and sailed back to the north  the years had passed  he had served under tebenkoff when michaelovski redoubt was built  he had spent two years in the kuskokwim country  two summers in the month of june he had managed to be at the head of kotzebue sound  here at this time the tribes assembled for barter here were to be found spotted deerskins from siberia ivory from the diomedes walrus skins from the shores of the arctic strange stone lamps passing in trade from tribe to tribe no one knew whence and once a huntingknife of english make and here subienkow knew was the school in which to learn geography  for he met eskimos from norton sound from king island and st lawrence island from cape prince of wales and point barrow  such places had other names and their distances were measured in days  it was a vast region these trading savages came from and a vaster region from which by repeated trade their stone lamps and that steel knife had come  subienkow bullied and cajoled and bribed  every farjourneyer or strange tribesman was brought before him  perils unaccountable and unthinkable were mentioned as well as wild beasts hostile tribes impenetrable forests and mighty mountain ranges but always from beyond came the rumour and the tale of whiteskinned men blue of eye and fair of hair who fought like devils and who sought always for furs  they were to the east—far far to the east  no one had seen them  it was the word that had been passed along  it was a hard school  one could not learn geography very well through the medium of strange dialects from dark minds that mingled fact and fable and that measured distances by “sleeps” that varied according to the difficulty of the going  but at last came the whisper that gave subienkow courage  in the east lay a great river where were these blueeyed men  the river was called the yukon  south of michaelovski redoubt emptied another great river which the russians knew as the kwikpak  these two rivers were one ran the whisper  subienkow returned to michaelovski  for a year he urged an expedition up the kwikpak  then arose malakoff the russian halfbreed to lead the wildest and most ferocious of the hell’s broth of mongrel adventurers who had crossed from kamtchatka  subienkow was his lieutenant  they threaded the mazes of the great delta of the kwikpak picked up the first low hills on the northern bank and for half a thousand miles in skin canoes loaded to the gunwales with tradegoods and ammunition fought their way against the fiveknot current of a river that ran from two to ten miles wide in a channel many fathoms deep  malakoff decided to build the fort at nulato  subienkow urged to go farther  but he quickly reconciled himself to nulato  the long winter was coming on  it would be better to wait  early the following summer when the ice was gone he would disappear up the kwikpak and work his way to the hudson bay company’s posts  malakoff had never heard the whisper that the kwikpak was the yukon and subienkow did not tell him  came the building of the fort  it was enforced labour  the tiered walls of logs arose to the sighs and groans of the nulato indians  the lash was laid upon their backs and it was the iron hand of the freebooters of the sea that laid on the lash  there were indians that ran away and when they were caught they were brought back and spreadeagled before the fort where they and their tribe learned the efficacy of the knout  two died under it others were injured for life and the rest took the lesson to heart and ran away no more  the snow was flying ere the fort was finished and then it was the time for furs  a heavy tribute was laid upon the tribe  blows and lashings continued and that the tribute should be paid the women and children were held as hostages and treated with the barbarity that only the furthieves knew  well it had been a sowing of blood and now was come the harvest  the fort was gone  in the light of its burning half the furthieves had been cut down  the other half had passed under the torture  only subienkow remained or subienkow and big ivan if that whimpering moaning thing in the snow could be called big ivan  subienkow caught yakaga grinning at him  there was no gainsaying yakaga  the mark of the lash was still on his face  after all subienkow could not blame him but he disliked the thought of what yakaga would do to him  he thought of appealing to makamuk the headchief but his judgment told him that such appeal was useless  then too he thought of bursting his bonds and dying fighting  such an end would be quick  but he could not break his bonds  caribou thongs were stronger than he  still devising another thought came to him  he signed for makamuk and that an interpreter who knew the coast dialect should be brought  “oh makamuk” he said “i am not minded to die  i am a great man and it were foolishness for me to die  in truth i shall not die  i am not like these other carrion”  he looked at the moaning thing that had once been big ivan and stirred it contemptuously with his toe  “i am too wise to die  behold i have a great medicine  i alone know this medicine  since i am not going to die i shall exchange this medicine with you”  “what is this medicine” makamuk demanded  “it is a strange medicine”  subienkow debated with himself for a moment as if loth to part with the secret  “i will tell you  a little bit of this medicine rubbed on the skin makes the skin hard like a rock hard like iron so that no cutting weapon can cut it  the strongest blow of a cutting weapon is a vain thing against it  a bone knife becomes like a piece of mud and it will turn the edge of the iron knives we have brought among you  what will you give me for the secret of the medicine”  “i will give you your life” makamuk made answer through the interpreter  subienkow laughed scornfully  “and you shall be a slave in my house until you die”  the pole laughed more scornfully  “untie my hands and feet and let us talk” he said  the chief made the sign and when he was loosed subienkow rolled a cigarette and lighted it  “this is foolish talk” said makamuk  “there is no such medicine  it cannot be  a cutting edge is stronger than any medicine”  the chief was incredulous and yet he wavered  he had seen too many deviltries of furthieves that worked  he could not wholly doubt  “i will give you your life but you shall not be a slave” he announced  “more than that”  subienkow played his game as coolly as if he were bartering for a foxskin  “it is a very great medicine  it has saved my life many times  i want a sled and dogs and six of your hunters to travel with me down the river and give me safety to one day’s sleep from michaelovski redoubt”  “you must live here and teach us all of your deviltries” was the reply  subienkow shrugged his shoulders and remained silent  he blew cigarette smoke out on the icy air and curiously regarded what remained of the big cossack  “that scar” makamuk said suddenly pointing to the pole’s neck where a livid mark advertised the slash of a knife in a kamtchatkan brawl  “the medicine is not good  the cutting edge was stronger than the medicine”  “it was a strong man that drove the stroke”  subienkow considered “stronger than you stronger than your strongest hunter stronger than he”  again with the toe of his moccasin he touched the cossack—a grisly spectacle no longer conscious—yet in whose dismembered body the painracked life clung and was loth to go  “also the medicine was weak  for at that place there were no berries of a certain kind of which i see you have plenty in this country  the medicine here will be strong”  “i will let you go down river” said makamuk “and the sled and the dogs and the six hunters to give you safety shall be yours”  “you are slow” was the cool rejoinder  “you have committed an offence against my medicine in that you did not at once accept my terms  behold i now demand more  i want one hundred beaver skins”  makamuk sneered  “i want one hundred pounds of dried fish”  makamuk nodded for fish were plentiful and cheap  “i want two sleds—one for me and one for my furs and fish  and my rifle must be returned to me  if you do not like the price in a little while the price will grow”  yakaga whispered to the chief  “but how can i know your medicine is true medicine” makamuk asked  “it is very easy  first i shall go into the woods—”  again yakaga whispered to makamuk who made a suspicious dissent  “you can send twenty hunters with me” subienkow went on  “you see i must get the berries and the roots with which to make the medicine then when you have brought the two sleds and loaded on them the fish and the beaver skins and the rifle and when you have told off the six hunters who will go with me—then when all is ready i will rub the medicine on my neck so and lay my neck there on that log  then can your strongest hunter take the axe and strike three times on my neck you yourself can strike the three times”  makamuk stood with gaping mouth drinking in this latest and most wonderful magic of the furthieves  “but first” the pole added hastily “between each blow i must put on fresh medicine  the axe is heavy and sharp and i want no mistakes”  “all that you have asked shall be yours” makamuk cried in a rush of acceptance  “proceed to make your medicine”  subienkow concealed his elation  he was playing a desperate game and there must be no slips  he spoke arrogantly  “you have been slow  my medicine is offended  to make the offence clean you must give me your daughter”  he pointed to the girl an unwholesome creature with a cast in one eye and a bristling wolftooth  makamuk was angry but the pole remained imperturbable rolling and lighting another cigarette  “make haste” he threatened  “if you are not quick i shall demand yet more”  in the silence that followed the dreary northland scene faded before him and he saw once more his native land and france and once as he glanced at the wolftoothed girl he remembered another girl a singer and a dancer whom he had known when first as a youth he came to paris  “what do you want with the girl” makamuk asked  “to go down the river with me”  subienkow glanced over her critically “she will make a good wife and it is an honour worthy of my medicine to be married to your blood”  again he remembered the singer and dancer and hummed aloud a song she had taught him  he lived the old life over but in a detached impersonal sort of way looking at the memorypictures of his own life as if they were pictures in a book of anybody’s life  the chief’s voice abruptly breaking the silence startled him  “it shall be done” said makamuk  “the girl shall go down the river with you  but be it understood that i myself strike the three blows with the axe on your neck”  “but each time i shall put on the medicine” subienkow answered with a show of illconcealed anxiety  “you shall put the medicine on between each blow  here are the hunters who shall see you do not escape  go into the forest and gather your medicine”  makamuk had been convinced of the worth of the medicine by the pole’s rapacity  surely nothing less than the greatest of medicines could enable a man in the shadow of death to stand up and drive an oldwoman’s bargain  “besides” whispered yakaga when the pole with his guard had disappeared among the spruce trees “when you have learned the medicine you can easily destroy him”  “but how can i destroy him” makamuk argued  “his medicine will not let me destroy him”  “there will be some part where he has not rubbed the medicine” was yakaga’s reply  “we will destroy him through that part  it may be his ears  very well we will thrust a spear in one ear and out the other or it may be his eyes  surely the medicine will be much too strong to rub on his eyes”  the chief nodded  “you are wise yakaga  if he possesses no other devilthings we will then destroy him”  subienkow did not waste time in gathering the ingredients for his medicine he selected whatsoever came to hand such as spruce needles the inner bark of the willow a strip of birch bark and a quantity of mossberries which he made the hunters dig up for him from beneath the snow  a few frozen roots completed his supply and he led the way back to camp  makamuk and yakaga crouched beside him noting the quantities and kinds of the ingredients he dropped into the pot of boiling water  “you must be careful that the mossberries go in first” he explained  “and—oh yes one other thing—the finger of a man  here yakaga let me cut off your finger”  but yakaga put his hands behind him and scowled  “just a small finger” subienkow pleaded  “yakaga give him your finger” makamuk commanded  “there be plenty of fingers lying around” yakaga grunted indicating the human wreckage in the snow of the score of persons who had been tortured to death  “it must be the finger of a live man” the pole objected  “then shall you have the finger of a live man”  yakaga strode over to the cossack and sliced off a finger  “he is not yet dead” he announced flinging the bloody trophy in the snow at the pole’s feet  “also it is a good finger because it is large”  subienkow dropped it into the fire under the pot and began to sing  it was a french lovesong that with great solemnity he sang into the brew  “without these words i utter into it the medicine is worthless” he explained  “the words are the chiefest strength of it  behold it is ready”  “name the words slowly that i may know them” makamuk commanded  “not until after the test  when the axe flies back three times from my neck then will i give you the secret of the words”  “but if the medicine is not good medicine” makamuk queried anxiously  subienkow turned upon him wrathfully  “my medicine is always good  however if it is not good then do by me as you have done to the others  cut me up a bit at a time even as you have cut him up”  he pointed to the cossack  “the medicine is now cool thus i rub it on my neck saying this further medicine”  with great gravity he slowly intoned a line of the “marseillaise” at the same time rubbing the villainous brew thoroughly into his neck  an outcry interrupted his playacting  the giant cossack with a last resurgence of his tremendous vitality had arisen to his knees  laughter and cries of surprise and applause arose from the nulatos as big ivan began flinging himself about in the snow with mighty spasms  subienkow was made sick by the sight but he mastered his qualms and made believe to be angry  “this will not do” he said  “finish him and then we will make the test  here you yakaga see that his noise ceases”  while this was being done subienkow turned to makamuk  “and remember you are to strike hard  this is not babywork  here take the axe and strike the log so that i can see you strike like a man”  makamuk obeyed striking twice precisely and with vigour cutting out a large chip  “it is well”  subienkow looked about him at the circle of savage faces that somehow seemed to symbolize the wall of savagery that had hemmed him about ever since the czar’s police had first arrested him in warsaw “take your axe makamuk and stand so  i shall lie down  when i raise my hand strike and strike with all your might  and be careful that no one stands behind you  the medicine is good and the axe may bounce from off my neck and right out of your hands”  he looked at the two sleds with the dogs in harness loaded with furs and fish  his rifle lay on top of the beaver skins  the six hunters who were to act as his guard stood by the sleds  “where is the girl” the pole demanded  “bring her up to the sleds before the test goes on”  when this had been carried out subienkow lay down in the snow resting his head on the log like a tired child about to sleep  he had lived so many dreary years that he was indeed tired  “i laugh at you and your strength o makamuk” he said  “strike and strike hard”  he lifted his hand  makamuk swung the axe a broadaxe for the squaring of logs  the bright steel flashed through the frosty air poised for a perceptible instant above makamuk’s head then descended upon subienkow’s bare neck  clear through flesh and bone it cut its way biting deeply into the log beneath  the amazed savages saw the head bounce a yard away from the bloodspouting trunk  there was a great bewilderment and silence while slowly it began to dawn in their minds that there had been no medicine  the furthief had outwitted them  alone of all their prisoners he had escaped the torture  that had been the stake for which he played  a great roar of laughter went up  makamuk bowed his head in shame  the furthief had fooled him  he had lost face before all his people  still they continued to roar out their laughter  makamuk turned and with bowed head stalked away  he knew that thenceforth he would be no longer known as makamuk  he would be lost face the record of his shame would be with him until he died and whenever the tribes gathered in the spring for the salmon or in the summer for the trading the story would pass back and forth across the campfires of how the furthief died peaceably at a single stroke by the hand of lost face  “who was lost face” he could hear in anticipation some insolent young buck demand “oh lost face” would be the answer “he who once was makamuk in the days before he cut off the furthief’s head”     trust   all lines had been cast off and the seattle no 4 was pulling slowly out from the shore  her decks were piled high with freight and baggage and swarmed with a heterogeneous company of indians dogs and dogmushers prospectors traders and homewardbound goldseekers  a goodly portion of dawson was lined up on the bank saying goodbye  as the gangplank came in and the steamer nosed into the stream the clamour of farewell became deafening  also in that eleventh moment everybody began to remember final farewell messages and to shout them back and forth across the widening stretch of water  louis bondell curling his yellow moustache with one hand and languidly waving the other hand to his friends on shore suddenly remembered something and sprang to the rail  “oh fred” he bawled  “oh fred”  the “fred” desired thrust a strapping pair of shoulders through the forefront of the crowd on the bank and tried to catch louis bondell’s message  the latter grew red in the face with vain vociferation  still the water widened between steamboat and shore  “hey you captain scott” he yelled at the pilothouse  “stop the boat”  the gongs clanged and the big stern wheel reversed then stopped  all hands on steamboat and on bank took advantage of this respite to exchange final new and imperative farewells  more futile than ever was louis bondell’s effort to make himself heard  the seattle no 4 lost way and drifted downstream and captain scott had to go ahead and reverse a second time  his head disappeared inside the pilothouse coming into view a moment later behind a big megaphone  now captain scott had a remarkable voice and the “shut up” he launched at the crowd on deck and on shore could have been heard at the top of moosehide mountain and as far as klondike city  this official remonstrance from the pilothouse spread a film of silence over the tumult  “now what do you want to say” captain scott demanded  “tell fred churchill—he’s on the bank there—tell him to go to macdonald it’s in his safe—a small gripsack of mine  tell him to get it and bring it out when he comes”  in the silence captain scott bellowed the message ashore through the megaphone—  “you fred churchill go to macdonald—in his safe—small gripsack—belongs to louis bondell—important  bring it out when you come  got it”  churchill waved his hand in token that he had got it  in truth had macdonald half a mile away opened his window he’d have got it too the tumult of farewell rose again the gongs clanged and the seattle no 4 went ahead swung out into the stream turned on her heel and headed down the yukon bondell and churchill waving farewell and mutual affection to the last  that was in midsummer  in the fall of the year the w h willis started up the yukon with two hundred homewardbound pilgrims on board among them was churchill  in his stateroom in the middle of a clothesbag was louis bondell’s grip  it was a small stout leather affair and its weight of forty pounds always made churchill nervous when he wandered too far from it  the man in the adjoining stateroom had a treasure of golddust hidden similarly in a clothesbag and the pair of them ultimately arranged to stand watch and watch  while one went down to eat the other kept an eye on the two stateroom doors  when churchill wanted to take a hand at whist the other man mounted guard and when the other man wanted to relax his soul churchill read fourmonths’ old newspapers on a camp stool between the two doors  there were signs of an early winter and the question that was discussed from dawn till dark and far into the dark was whether they would get out before the freezeup or be compelled to abandon the steamboat and tramp out over the ice  there were irritating delays  twice the engines broke down and had to be tinkered up and each time there were snow flurries to warn them of the imminence of winter  nine times the w h willis essayed to ascend the fivefinger rapids with her impaired machinery and when she succeeded she was four days behind her very liberal schedule  the question that then arose was whether or not the steamboat flora would wait for her above the box cañon  the stretch of water between the head of the box cañon and the foot of the white horse rapids was unnavigable for steamboats and passengers were transhipped at that point walking around the rapids from one steamboat to the other there were no telephones in the country hence no way of informing the waiting flora that the willis was four days late but coming  when the w h willis pulled into white horse it was learned that the flora had waited three days over the limit and had departed only a few hours before  also it was learned that she would tie up at tagish post till nine o’clock sunday morning  it was then four o’clock saturday afternoon  the pilgrims called a meeting  on board was a large peterborough canoe consigned to the police post at the head of lake bennett  they agreed to be responsible for it and to deliver it  next they called for volunteers  two men were needed to make a race for the flora  a score of men volunteered on the instant  among them was churchill such being his nature that he volunteered before he thought of bondell’s gripsack  when this thought came to him he began to hope that he would not be selected but a man who had made a name as captain of a college football eleven as a president of an athletic club as a dogmusher and a stampeder in the yukon and moreover who possessed such shoulders as he had no right to avoid the honour  it was thrust upon him and upon a gigantic german nick antonsen  while a crowd of the pilgrims the canoe on their shoulders started on a trot over the portage churchill ran to his stateroom  he turned the contents of the clothesbag on the floor and caught up the grip with the intention of entrusting it to the man next door  then the thought smote him that it was not his grip and that he had no right to let it out of his possession  so he dashed ashore with it and ran up the portage changing it often from one hand to the other and wondering if it really did not weigh more than forty pounds  it was halfpast four in the afternoon when the two men started  the current of the thirty mile river was so strong that rarely could they use the paddles  it was out on one bank with a towline over the shoulders stumbling over the rocks forcing a way through the underbrush slipping at times and falling into the water wading often up to the knees and waist and then when an insurmountable bluff was encountered it was into the canoe out paddles and a wild and losing dash across the current to the other bank in paddles over the side and out towline again  it was exhausting work  antonsen toiled like the giant he was uncomplaining persistent but driven to his utmost by the powerful body and indomitable brain of churchill  they never paused for rest  it was go go and keep on going  a crisp wind blew down the river freezing their hands and making it imperative from time to time to beat the blood back into the numbed fingers  as night came on they were compelled to trust to luck  they fell repeatedly on the untravelled banks and tore their clothing to sheds in the underbrush they could not see  both men were badly scratched and bleeding  a dozen times in their wild dashes from bank to bank they struck snags and were capsized  the first time this happened churchill dived and groped in three feet of water for the gripsack  he lost half an hour in recovering it and after that it was carried securely lashed to the canoe  as long as the canoe floated it was safe  antonsen jeered at the grip and toward morning began to curse it but churchill vouchsafed no explanations  their delays and mischances were endless  on one swift bend around which poured a healthy young rapid they lost two hours making a score of attempts and capsizing twice  at this point on both banks were precipitous bluffs rising out of deep water and along which they could neither tow nor pole while they could not gain with the paddles against the current  at each attempt they strained to the utmost with the paddles and each time with heads nigh to bursting from the effort they were played out and swept back  they succeeded finally by an accident in the swiftest current near the end of another failure a freak of the current sheered the canoe out of churchill’s control and flung it against the bluff  churchill made a blind leap at the bluff and landed in a crevice  holding on with one hand he held the swamped canoe with the other till antonsen dragged himself out of the water  then they pulled the canoe out and rested  a fresh start at this crucial point took them by  they landed on the bank above and plunged immediately ashore and into the brush with the towline  daylight found them far below tagish post  at nine o’clock sunday morning they could hear the flora whistling her departure  and when at ten o’clock they dragged themselves in to the post they could barely see the flora’s smoke far to the southward  it was a pair of wornout tatterdemalions that captain jones of the mounted police welcomed and fed and he afterward averred that they possessed two of the most tremendous appetites he had ever observed  they lay down and slept in their wet rags by the stove  at the end of two hours churchill got up carried bondell’s grip which he had used for a pillow down to the canoe kicked antonsen awake and started in pursuit of the flora  “there’s no telling what might happen—machinery break down or something” was his reply to captain jones’s expostulations  “i’m going to catch that steamer and send her back for the boys”  tagish lake was white with a fall gale that blew in their teeth  big swinging seas rushed upon the canoe compelling one man to bale and leaving one man to paddle  headway could not be made  they ran along the shallow shore and went overboard one man ahead on the towline the other shoving on the canoe  they fought the gale up to their waists in the icy water often up to their necks often over their heads and buried by the big crested waves  there was no rest never a moment’s pause from the cheerless heartbreaking battle  that night at the head of tagish lake in the thick of a driving snowsquall they overhauled the flora  antonsen fell on board lay where he had fallen and snored churchill looked like a wild man  his clothes barely clung to him  his face was iced up and swollen from the protracted effort of twentyfour hours while his hands were so swollen that he could not close the fingers  as for his feet it was an agony to stand upon them  the captain of the flora was loth to go back to white horse  churchill was persistent and imperative the captain was stubborn  he pointed out finally that nothing was to be gained by going back because the only ocean steamer at dyea the athenian was to sail on tuesday morning and that he could not make the back trip to white horse and bring up the stranded pilgrims in time to make the connection  “what time does the athenian sail” churchill demanded  “seven o’clock tuesday morning”  “all right” churchill said at the same time kicking a tattoo on the ribs of the snoring antonsen  “you go back to white home  we’ll go ahead and hold the athenian”  antonsen stupid with sleep not yet clothed in his waking mind was bundled into the canoe and did not realize what had happened till he was drenched with the icy spray of a big sea and heard churchill snarling at him through the darkness—  “paddle can’t you  do you want to be swamped”  daylight found them at caribou crossing the wind dying down and antonsen too far gone to dip a paddle  churchill grounded the canoe on a quiet beach where they slept  he took the precaution of twisting his arm under the weight of his head  every few minutes the pain of the pent circulation aroused him whereupon he would look at his watch and twist the other arm under his head  at the end of two hours he fought with antonsen to rouse him  then they started  lake bennett thirty miles in length was like a millpond but half way across a gale from the south smote them and turned the water white  hour after hour they repeated the struggle on tagish over the side pulling and shoving on the canoe up to their waists and necks and over their heads in the icy water toward the last the goodnatured giant played completely out  churchill drove him mercilessly but when he pitched forward and bade fair to drown in three feet of water the other dragged him into the canoe  after that churchill fought on alone arriving at the police post at the head of bennett in the early afternoon  he tried to help antonsen out of the canoe but failed  he listened to the exhausted man’s heavy breathing and envied him when he thought of what he himself had yet to undergo antonsen could lie there and sleep but he behind time must go on over mighty chilcoot and down to the sea  the real struggle lay before him and he almost regretted the strength that resided in his frame because of the torment it could inflict upon that frame  churchill pulled the canoe up on the beach seized bondell’s grip and started on a limping dogtrot for the police post  “there’s a canoe down there consigned to you from dawson” he hurled at the officer who answered his knock  “and there’s a man in it pretty near dead  nothing serious only played out  take care of him  i’ve got to rush  goodbye  want to catch the athenian”  a mile portage connected lake bennett and lake linderman and his last words he flung back after him as he resumed the trot  it was a very painful trot but he clenched his teeth and kept on forgetting his pain most of the time in the fervent heat with which he regarded the gripsack it was a severe handicap  he swung it from one hand to the other and back again  he tucked it under his arm  he threw one hand over the opposite shoulder and the bag bumped and pounded on his back as he ran along  he could scarcely hold it in his bruised and swollen fingers and several times he dropped it  once in changing from one hand to the other it escaped his clutch and fell in front of him tripped him up and threw him violently to the ground  at the far end of the portage he bought an old set of packstraps for a dollar and in them he swung the grip  also he chartered a launch to run him the six miles to the upper end of lake linderman where he arrived at four in the afternoon  the athenian was to sail from dyea next morning at seven  dyea was twentyeight miles away and between towered chilcoot  he sat down to adjust his footgear for the long climb and woke up  he had dozed the instant he sat down though he had not slept thirty seconds  he was afraid his next doze might be longer so he finished fixing his footgear standing up  even then he was overpowered for a fleeting moment  he experienced the flash of unconsciousness becoming aware of it in midair as his relaxed body was sinking to the ground and as he caught himself together he stiffened his muscles with a spasmodic wrench and escaped the fall  the sudden jerk back to consciousness left him sick and trembling  he beat his head with the heel of his hand knocking wakefulness into the numbed brain  jack burns’s packtrain was starting back light for crater lake and churchill was invited to a mule  burns wanted to put the gripsack on another animal but churchill held on to it carrying it on his saddlepommel  but he dozed and the grip persisted in dropping off the pommel one side or the other each time wakening him with a sickening start  then in the early darkness churchill’s mule brushed him against a projecting branch that laid his cheek open  to cap it the mule blundered off the trail and fell throwing rider and gripsack out upon the rocks  after that churchill walked or stumbled rather over the apology for a trail leading the mule  stray and awful odours drifting from each side of the trail told of the horses that had died in the rush for gold  but he did not mind  he was too sleepy  by the time long lake was reached however he had recovered from his sleepiness and at deep lake he resigned the gripsack to burns  but thereafter by the light of the dim stars he kept his eyes on burns  there were not going to be any accidents with that bag  at crater lake the packtrain went into camp and churchill slinging the grip on his back started the steep climb for the summit  for the first time on that precipitous wall he realized how tired he was  he crept and crawled like a crab burdened by the weight of his limbs  a distinct and painful effort of will was required each time he lifted a foot  an hallucination came to him that he was shod with lead like a deepsea diver and it was all he could do to resist the desire to reach down and feel the lead  as for bondell’s gripsack it was inconceivable that forty pounds could weigh so much  it pressed him down like a mountain and he looked back with unbelief to the year before when he had climbed that same pass with a hundred and fifty pounds on his back if those loads had weighed a hundred and fifty pounds then bondell’s grip weighed five hundred  the first rise of the divide from crater lake was across a small glacier here was a welldefined trail  but above the glacier which was also above timberline was naught but a chaos of naked rock and enormous boulders  there was no way of seeing the trail in the darkness and he blundered on paying thrice the ordinary exertion for all that he accomplished  he won the summit in the thick of howling wind and driving snow providentially stumbling upon a small deserted tent into which he crawled  there he found and bolted some ancient fried potatoes and half a dozen raw eggs  when the snow ceased and the wind eased down he began the almost impossible descent  there was no trail and he stumbled and blundered often finding himself at the last moment on the edge of rocky walls and steep slopes the depth of which he had no way of judging  part way down the stars clouded over again and in the consequent obscurity he slipped and rolled and slid for a hundred feet landing bruised and bleeding on the bottom of a large shallow hole  from all about him arose the stench of dead horses  the hole was handy to the trail and the packers had made a practice of tumbling into it their broken and dying animals  the stench overpowered him making him deadly sick and as in a nightmare he scrambled out  halfway up he recollected bondell’s gripsack  it had fallen into the hole with him the packstrap had evidently broken and he had forgotten it  back he went into the pestilential charnelpit where he crawled around on hands and knees and groped for half an hour altogether he encountered and counted seventeen dead horses and one horse still alive that he shot with his revolver before he found bondell’s grip  looking back upon a life that had not been without valour and achievement he unhesitatingly declared to himself that this return after the grip was the most heroic act he had ever performed  so heroic was it that he was twice on the verge of fainting before he crawled out of the hole  by the time he had descended to the scales the steep pitch of chilcoot was past and the way became easier  not that it was an easy way however in the best of places but it became a really possible trail along which he could have made good time if he had not been worn out if he had had light with which to pick his steps and if it had not been for bondell’s gripsack  to him in his exhausted condition it was the last straw  having barely strength to carry himself along the additional weight of the grip was sufficient to throw him nearly every time he tripped or stumbled  and when he escaped tripping branches reached out in the darkness hooked the grip between his shoulders and held him back  his mind was made up that if he missed the athenian it would be the fault of the gripsack  in fact only two things remained in his consciousness—bondell’s grip and the steamer  he knew only those two things and they became identified in a way with some stern mission upon which he had journeyed and toiled for centuries  he walked and struggled on as in a dream  as part of the dream was his arrival at sheep camp  he stumbled into a saloon slid his shoulders out of the straps and started to deposit the grip at his feet  but it slipped from his fingers and struck the floor with a heavy thud that was not unnoticed by two men who were just leaving  churchill drank a glass of whisky told the barkeeper to call him in ten minutes and sat down his feet on the grip his head on his knees  so badly did his misused body stiffen that when he was called it required another ten minutes and a second glass of whisky to unbend his joints and limber up the muscles  “hey not that way” the barkeeper shouted and then went after him and started him through the darkness toward canyon city  some little husk of inner consciousness told churchill that the direction was right and still as in a dream he took the cañon trail  he did not know what warned him but after what seemed several centuries of travelling he sensed danger and drew his revolver  still in the dream he saw two men step out and heard them halt him  his revolver went off four times and he saw the flashes and heard the explosions of their revolvers  also he was aware that he had been hit in the thigh  he saw one man go down and as the other came for him he smashed him a straight blow with the heavy revolver full in the face  then he turned and ran  he came from the dream shortly afterward to find himself plunging down the trail at a limping lope  his first thought was for the gripsack  it was still on his back  he was convinced that what had happened was a dream till he felt for his revolver and found it gone  next he became aware of a sharp stinging of his thigh and after investigating he found his hand warm with blood  it was a superficial wound but it was incontestable  he became wider awake and kept up the lumbering run to canyon city  he found a man with a team of horses and a wagon who got out of bed and harnessed up for twenty dollars  churchill crawled in on the wagonbed and slept the gripsack still on his back  it was a rough ride over waterwashed boulders down the dyea valley but he roused only when the wagon hit the highest places  any altitude of his body above the wagonbed of less than a foot did not faze him  the last mile was smooth going and he slept soundly  he came to in the grey dawn the driver shaking him savagely and howling into his ear that the athenian was gone  churchill looked blankly at the deserted harbour  “there’s a smoke over at skaguay” the man said  churchill’s eyes were too swollen to see that far but he said “it’s she  get me a boat”  the driver was obliging and found a skiff and a man to row it for ten dollars payment in advance  churchill paid and was helped into the skiff  it was beyond him to get in by himself  it was six miles to skaguay and he had a blissful thought of sleeping those six miles  but the man did not know how to row and churchill took the oars and toiled for a few more centuries  he never knew six longer and more excruciating miles  a snappy little breeze blew up the inlet and held him back  he had a gone feeling at the pit of the stomach and suffered from faintness and numbness  at his command the man took the baler and threw salt water into his face  the athenian’s anchor was upanddown when they came alongside and churchill was at the end of his last remnant of strength  “stop her  stop her” he shouted hoarsely  “important message  stop her”  then he dropped his chin on his chest and slept  when half a dozen men started to carry him up the gangplank he awoke reached for the grip and clung to it like a drowning man  on deck he became a centre of horror and curiosity  the clothing in which he had left white horse was represented by a few rags and he was as frayed as his clothing  he had travelled for fiftyfive hours at the top notch of endurance  he had slept six hours in that time and he was twenty pounds lighter than when he started  face and hands and body were scratched and bruised and he could scarcely see  he tried to stand up but failed sprawling out on the deck hanging on to the gripsack and delivering his message  “now put me to bed” he finished “i’ll eat when i wake up”  they did him honour carrying him down in his rags and dirt and depositing him and bondell’s grip in the bridal chamber which was the biggest and most luxurious stateroom in the ship  twice he slept the clock around and he had bathed and shaved and eaten and was leaning over the rail smoking a cigar when the two hundred pilgrims from white horse came alongside  by the time the athenian arrived in seattle churchill had fully recuperated and he went ashore with bondell’s grip in his hand  he felt proud of that grip  to him it stood for achievement and integrity and trust  “i’ve delivered the goods” was the way he expressed these various high terms to himself  it was early in the evening and he went straight to bondell’s home  louis bondell was glad to see him shaking hands with both hands at the same time and dragging him into the house  “oh thanks old man it was good of you to bring it out” bondell said when he received the gripsack  he tossed it carelessly upon a couch and churchill noted with an appreciative eye the rebound of its weight from the springs  bondell was volleying him with questions  “how did you make out  how’re the boys  what became of bill smithers is del bishop still with pierce  did he sell my dogs  how did sulphur bottom show up  you’re looking fine  what steamer did you come out on”  to all of which churchill gave answer till half an hour had gone by and the first lull in the conversation had arrived  “hadn’t you better take a look at it” he suggested nodding his head at the gripsack  “oh it’s all right” bondell answered  “did mitchell’s dump turn out as much as he expected”  “i think you’d better look at it” churchill insisted  “when i deliver a thing i want to be satisfied that it’s all right  there’s always the chance that somebody might have got into it when i was asleep or something”  “it’s nothing important old man” bondell answered with a laugh  “nothing important” churchill echoed in a faint small voice  then he spoke with decision “louis what’s in that bag  i want to know”  louis looked at him curiously then left the room and returned with a bunch of keys  he inserted his hand and drew out a heavy colt’s revolver  next came out a few boxes of ammunition for the revolver and several boxes of winchester cartridges  churchill took the gripsack and looked into it  then he turned it upside down and shook it gently  “the gun’s all rusted” bondell said  “must have been out in the rain”  “yes” churchill answered  “too bad it got wet  i guess i was a bit careless”  he got up and went outside  ten minutes later louis bondell went out and found him on the steps sitting down elbows on knees and chin on hands gazing steadfastly out into the darkness     to build a fire   day had broken cold and grey exceedingly cold and grey when the man turned aside from the main yukon trail and climbed the high earthbank where a dim and littletravelled trail led eastward through the fat spruce timberland  it was a steep bank and he paused for breath at the top excusing the act to himself by looking at his watch  it was nine o’clock  there was no sun nor hint of sun though there was not a cloud in the sky  it was a clear day and yet there seemed an intangible pall over the face of things a subtle gloom that made the day dark and that was due to the absence of sun  this fact did not worry the man  he was used to the lack of sun  it had been days since he had seen the sun and he knew that a few more days must pass before that cheerful orb due south would just peep above the skyline and dip immediately from view  the man flung a look back along the way he had come  the yukon lay a mile wide and hidden under three feet of ice  on top of this ice were as many feet of snow  it was all pure white rolling in gentle undulations where the icejams of the freezeup had formed  north and south as far as his eye could see it was unbroken white save for a dark hairline that curved and twisted from around the sprucecovered island to the south and that curved and twisted away into the north where it disappeared behind another sprucecovered island  this dark hairline was the trail—the main trail—that led south five hundred miles to the chilcoot pass dyea and salt water and that led north seventy miles to dawson and still on to the north a thousand miles to nulato and finally to st michael on bering sea a thousand miles and half a thousand more  but all this—the mysterious farreaching hairline trail the absence of sun from the sky the tremendous cold and the strangeness and weirdness of it all—made no impression on the man  it was not because he was long used to it  he was a newcomer in the land a chechaquo and this was his first winter  the trouble with him was that he was without imagination  he was quick and alert in the things of life but only in the things and not in the significances  fifty degrees below zero meant eighty odd degrees of frost  such fact impressed him as being cold and uncomfortable and that was all  it did not lead him to meditate upon his frailty as a creature of temperature and upon man’s frailty in general able only to live within certain narrow limits of heat and cold and from there on it did not lead him to the conjectural field of immortality and man’s place in the universe  fifty degrees below zero stood for a bite of frost that hurt and that must be guarded against by the use of mittens earflaps warm moccasins and thick socks  fifty degrees below zero was to him just precisely fifty degrees below zero that there should be anything more to it than that was a thought that never entered his head  as he turned to go on he spat speculatively  there was a sharp explosive crackle that startled him  he spat again  and again in the air before it could fall to the snow the spittle crackled  he knew that at fifty below spittle crackled on the snow but this spittle had crackled in the air  undoubtedly it was colder than fifty below—how much colder he did not know  but the temperature did not matter  he was bound for the old claim on the left fork of henderson creek where the boys were already  they had come over across the divide from the indian creek country while he had come the roundabout way to take a look at the possibilities of getting out logs in the spring from the islands in the yukon  he would be in to camp by six o’clock a bit after dark it was true but the boys would be there a fire would be going and a hot supper would be ready  as for lunch he pressed his hand against the protruding bundle under his jacket  it was also under his shirt wrapped up in a handkerchief and lying against the naked skin  it was the only way to keep the biscuits from freezing  he smiled agreeably to himself as he thought of those biscuits each cut open and sopped in bacon grease and each enclosing a generous slice of fried bacon  he plunged in among the big spruce trees  the trail was faint  a foot of snow had fallen since the last sled had passed over and he was glad he was without a sled travelling light  in fact he carried nothing but the lunch wrapped in the handkerchief  he was surprised however at the cold  it certainly was cold he concluded as he rubbed his numbed nose and cheekbones with his mittened hand  he was a warmwhiskered man but the hair on his face did not protect the high cheekbones and the eager nose that thrust itself aggressively into the frosty air  at the man’s heels trotted a dog a big native husky the proper wolfdog greycoated and without any visible or temperamental difference from its brother the wild wolf  the animal was depressed by the tremendous cold  it knew that it was no time for travelling  its instinct told it a truer tale than was told to the man by the man’s judgment  in reality it was not merely colder than fifty below zero it was colder than sixty below than seventy below  it was seventyfive below zero  since the freezingpoint is thirtytwo above zero it meant that one hundred and seven degrees of frost obtained  the dog did not know anything about thermometers  possibly in its brain there was no sharp consciousness of a condition of very cold such as was in the man’s brain  but the brute had its instinct  it experienced a vague but menacing apprehension that subdued it and made it slink along at the man’s heels and that made it question eagerly every unwonted movement of the man as if expecting him to go into camp or to seek shelter somewhere and build a fire  the dog had learned fire and it wanted fire or else to burrow under the snow and cuddle its warmth away from the air  the frozen moisture of its breathing had settled on its fur in a fine powder of frost and especially were its jowls muzzle and eyelashes whitened by its crystalled breath  the man’s red beard and moustache were likewise frosted but more solidly the deposit taking the form of ice and increasing with every warm moist breath he exhaled  also the man was chewing tobacco and the muzzle of ice held his lips so rigidly that he was unable to clear his chin when he expelled the juice  the result was that a crystal beard of the colour and solidity of amber was increasing its length on his chin  if he fell down it would shatter itself like glass into brittle fragments  but he did not mind the appendage  it was the penalty all tobaccochewers paid in that country and he had been out before in two cold snaps  they had not been so cold as this he knew but by the spirit thermometer at sixty mile he knew they had been registered at fifty below and at fiftyfive  he held on through the level stretch of woods for several miles crossed a wide flat of niggerheads and dropped down a bank to the frozen bed of a small stream  this was henderson creek and he knew he was ten miles from the forks  he looked at his watch  it was ten o’clock  he was making four miles an hour and he calculated that he would arrive at the forks at halfpast twelve  he decided to celebrate that event by eating his lunch there  the dog dropped in again at his heels with a tail drooping discouragement as the man swung along the creekbed  the furrow of the old sledtrail was plainly visible but a dozen inches of snow covered the marks of the last runners  in a month no man had come up or down that silent creek  the man held steadily on  he was not much given to thinking and just then particularly he had nothing to think about save that he would eat lunch at the forks and that at six o’clock he would be in camp with the boys  there was nobody to talk to and had there been speech would have been impossible because of the icemuzzle on his mouth so he continued monotonously to chew tobacco and to increase the length of his amber beard  once in a while the thought reiterated itself that it was very cold and that he had never experienced such cold  as he walked along he rubbed his cheekbones and nose with the back of his mittened hand  he did this automatically now and again changing hands  but rub as he would the instant he stopped his cheekbones went numb and the following instant the end of his nose went numb  he was sure to frost his cheeks he knew that and experienced a pang of regret that he had not devised a nosestrap of the sort bud wore in cold snaps  such a strap passed across the cheeks as well and saved them  but it didn’t matter much after all  what were frosted cheeks  a bit painful that was all they were never serious  empty as the man’s mind was of thoughts he was keenly observant and he noticed the changes in the creek the curves and bends and timberjams and always he sharply noted where he placed his feet  once coming around a bend he shied abruptly like a startled horse curved away from the place where he had been walking and retreated several paces back along the trail  the creek he knew was frozen clear to the bottom—no creek could contain water in that arctic winter—but he knew also that there were springs that bubbled out from the hillsides and ran along under the snow and on top the ice of the creek  he knew that the coldest snaps never froze these springs and he knew likewise their danger  they were traps  they hid pools of water under the snow that might be three inches deep or three feet  sometimes a skin of ice half an inch thick covered them and in turn was covered by the snow  sometimes there were alternate layers of water and iceskin so that when one broke through he kept on breaking through for a while sometimes wetting himself to the waist  that was why he had shied in such panic  he had felt the give under his feet and heard the crackle of a snowhidden iceskin  and to get his feet wet in such a temperature meant trouble and danger  at the very least it meant delay for he would be forced to stop and build a fire and under its protection to bare his feet while he dried his socks and moccasins  he stood and studied the creekbed and its banks and decided that the flow of water came from the right  he reflected awhile rubbing his nose and cheeks then skirted to the left stepping gingerly and testing the footing for each step  once clear of the danger he took a fresh chew of tobacco and swung along at his fourmile gait  in the course of the next two hours he came upon several similar traps usually the snow above the hidden pools had a sunken candied appearance that advertised the danger  once again however he had a close call and once suspecting danger he compelled the dog to go on in front  the dog did not want to go  it hung back until the man shoved it forward and then it went quickly across the white unbroken surface  suddenly it broke through floundered to one side and got away to firmer footing it had wet its forefeet and legs and almost immediately the water that clung to it turned to ice  it made quick efforts to lick the ice off its legs then dropped down in the snow and began to bite out the ice that had formed between the toes  this was a matter of instinct  to permit the ice to remain would mean sore feet  it did not know this  it merely obeyed the mysterious prompting that arose from the deep crypts of its being  but the man knew having achieved a judgment on the subject and he removed the mitten from his right hand and helped tear out the iceparticles  he did not expose his fingers more than a minute and was astonished at the swift numbness that smote them  it certainly was cold he pulled on the mitten hastily and beat the hand savagely across his chest  at twelve o’clock the day was at its brightest  yet the sun was too far south on its winter journey to clear the horizon  the bulge of the earth intervened between it and henderson creek where the man walked under a clear sky at noon and cast no shadow  at halfpast twelve to the minute he arrived at the forks of the creek  he was pleased at the speed he had made  if he kept it up he would certainly be with the boys by six  he unbuttoned his jacket and shirt and drew forth his lunch the action consumed no more than a quarter of a minute yet in that brief moment the numbness laid hold of the exposed fingers  he did not put the mitten on but instead struck the fingers a dozen sharp smashes against his leg  then he sat down on a snowcovered log to eat  the sting that followed upon the striking of his fingers against his leg ceased so quickly that he was startled he had had no chance to take a bite of biscuit  he struck the fingers repeatedly and returned them to the mitten baring the other hand for the purpose of eating  he tried to take a mouthful but the icemuzzle prevented  he had forgotten to build a fire and thaw out  he chuckled at his foolishness and as he chuckled he noted the numbness creeping into the exposed fingers  also he noted that the stinging which had first come to his toes when he sat down was already passing away  he wondered whether the toes were warm or numbed he moved them inside the moccasins and decided that they were numbed  he pulled the mitten on hurriedly and stood up  he was a bit frightened he stamped up and down until the stinging returned into the feet  it certainly was cold was his thought  that man from sulphur creek had spoken the truth when telling how cold it sometimes got in the country and he had laughed at him at the time  that showed one must not be too sure of things  there was no mistake about it it was cold  he strode up and down stamping his feet and threshing his arms until reassured by the returning warmth  then he got out matches and proceeded to make a fire  from the undergrowth where high water of the previous spring had lodged a supply of seasoned twigs he got his firewood  working carefully from a small beginning he soon had a roaring fire over which he thawed the ice from his face and in the protection of which he ate his biscuits  for the moment the cold of space was outwitted  the dog took satisfaction in the fire stretching out close enough for warmth and far enough away to escape being singed  when the man had finished he filled his pipe and took his comfortable time over a smoke  then he pulled on his mittens settled the earflaps of his cap firmly about his ears and took the creek trail up the left fork  the dog was disappointed and yearned back toward the fire  this man did not know cold  possibly all the generations of his ancestry had been ignorant of cold of real cold of cold one hundred and seven degrees below freezingpoint  but the dog knew all its ancestry knew and it had inherited the knowledge  and it knew that it was not good to walk abroad in such fearful cold  it was the time to lie snug in a hole in the snow and wait for a curtain of cloud to be drawn across the face of outer space whence this cold came  on the other hand there was keen intimacy between the dog and the man  the one was the toilslave of the other and the only caresses it had ever received were the caresses of the whiplash and of harsh and menacing throatsounds that threatened the whiplash  so the dog made no effort to communicate its apprehension to the man  it was not concerned in the welfare of the man it was for its own sake that it yearned back toward the fire  but the man whistled and spoke to it with the sound of whiplashes and the dog swung in at the man’s heels and followed after  the man took a chew of tobacco and proceeded to start a new amber beard also his moist breath quickly powdered with white his moustache eyebrows and lashes  there did not seem to be so many springs on the left fork of the henderson and for half an hour the man saw no signs of any  and then it happened  at a place where there were no signs where the soft unbroken snow seemed to advertise solidity beneath the man broke through  it was not deep  he wetted himself halfway to the knees before he floundered out to the firm crust  he was angry and cursed his luck aloud  he had hoped to get into camp with the boys at six o’clock and this would delay him an hour for he would have to build a fire and dry out his footgear  this was imperative at that low temperature—he knew that much and he turned aside to the bank which he climbed  on top tangled in the underbrush about the trunks of several small spruce trees was a highwater deposit of dry firewood—sticks and twigs principally but also larger portions of seasoned branches and fine dry lastyear’s grasses  he threw down several large pieces on top of the snow  this served for a foundation and prevented the young flame from drowning itself in the snow it otherwise would melt  the flame he got by touching a match to a small shred of birchbark that he took from his pocket  this burned even more readily than paper  placing it on the foundation he fed the young flame with wisps of dry grass and with the tiniest dry twigs  he worked slowly and carefully keenly aware of his danger  gradually as the flame grew stronger he increased the size of the twigs with which he fed it  he squatted in the snow pulling the twigs out from their entanglement in the brush and feeding directly to the flame  he knew there must be no failure  when it is seventyfive below zero a man must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire—that is if his feet are wet  if his feet are dry and he fails he can run along the trail for half a mile and restore his circulation  but the circulation of wet and freezing feet cannot be restored by running when it is seventyfive below  no matter how fast he runs the wet feet will freeze the harder  all this the man knew  the oldtimer on sulphur creek had told him about it the previous fall and now he was appreciating the advice  already all sensation had gone out of his feet  to build the fire he had been forced to remove his mittens and the fingers had quickly gone numb  his pace of four miles an hour had kept his heart pumping blood to the surface of his body and to all the extremities  but the instant he stopped the action of the pump eased down  the cold of space smote the unprotected tip of the planet and he being on that unprotected tip received the full force of the blow  the blood of his body recoiled before it  the blood was alive like the dog and like the dog it wanted to hide away and cover itself up from the fearful cold  so long as he walked four miles an hour he pumped that blood willynilly to the surface but now it ebbed away and sank down into the recesses of his body  the extremities were the first to feel its absence  his wet feet froze the faster and his exposed fingers numbed the faster though they had not yet begun to freeze  nose and cheeks were already freezing while the skin of all his body chilled as it lost its blood  but he was safe  toes and nose and cheeks would be only touched by the frost for the fire was beginning to burn with strength  he was feeding it with twigs the size of his finger  in another minute he would be able to feed it with branches the size of his wrist and then he could remove his wet footgear and while it dried he could keep his naked feet warm by the fire rubbing them at first of course with snow  the fire was a success  he was safe  he remembered the advice of the oldtimer on sulphur creek and smiled  the oldtimer had been very serious in laying down the law that no man must travel alone in the klondike after fifty below  well here he was he had had the accident he was alone and he had saved himself  those oldtimers were rather womanish some of them he thought  all a man had to do was to keep his head and he was all right  any man who was a man could travel alone  but it was surprising the rapidity with which his cheeks and nose were freezing  and he had not thought his fingers could go lifeless in so short a time  lifeless they were for he could scarcely make them move together to grip a twig and they seemed remote from his body and from him  when he touched a twig he had to look and see whether or not he had hold of it  the wires were pretty well down between him and his fingerends  all of which counted for little  there was the fire snapping and crackling and promising life with every dancing flame  he started to untie his moccasins  they were coated with ice the thick german socks were like sheaths of iron halfway to the knees and the mocassin strings were like rods of steel all twisted and knotted as by some conflagration for a moment he tugged with his numbed fingers then realizing the folly of it he drew his sheathknife  but before he could cut the strings it happened  it was his own fault or rather his mistake  he should not have built the fire under the spruce tree  he should have built it in the open  but it had been easier to pull the twigs from the brush and drop them directly on the fire  now the tree under which he had done this carried a weight of snow on its boughs  no wind had blown for weeks and each bough was fully freighted  each time he had pulled a twig he had communicated a slight agitation to the tree—an imperceptible agitation so far as he was concerned but an agitation sufficient to bring about the disaster  high up in the tree one bough capsized its load of snow  this fell on the boughs beneath capsizing them  this process continued spreading out and involving the whole tree  it grew like an avalanche and it descended without warning upon the man and the fire and the fire was blotted out  where it had burned was a mantle of fresh and disordered snow  the man was shocked  it was as though he had just heard his own sentence of death  for a moment he sat and stared at the spot where the fire had been  then he grew very calm  perhaps the oldtimer on sulphur creek was right  if he had only had a trailmate he would have been in no danger now  the trailmate could have built the fire  well it was up to him to build the fire over again and this second time there must be no failure  even if he succeeded he would most likely lose some toes his feet must be badly frozen by now and there would be some time before the second fire was ready  such were his thoughts but he did not sit and think them  he was busy all the time they were passing through his mind he made a new foundation for a fire this time in the open where no treacherous tree could blot it out  next he gathered dry grasses and tiny twigs from the highwater flotsam  he could not bring his fingers together to pull them out but he was able to gather them by the handful  in this way he got many rotten twigs and bits of green moss that were undesirable but it was the best he could do  he worked methodically even collecting an armful of the larger branches to be used later when the fire gathered strength and all the while the dog sat and watched him a certain yearning wistfulness in its eyes for it looked upon him as the fireprovider and the fire was slow in coming  when all was ready the man reached in his pocket for a second piece of birchbark  he knew the bark was there and though he could not feel it with his fingers he could hear its crisp rustling as he fumbled for it try as he would he could not clutch hold of it  and all the time in his consciousness was the knowledge that each instant his feet were freezing  this thought tended to put him in a panic but he fought against it and kept calm  he pulled on his mittens with his teeth and threshed his arms back and forth beating his hands with all his might against his sides  he did this sitting down and he stood up to do it and all the while the dog sat in the snow its wolfbrush of a tail curled around warmly over its forefeet its sharp wolfears pricked forward intently as it watched the man  and the man as he beat and threshed with his arms and hands felt a great surge of envy as he regarded the creature that was warm and secure in its natural covering  after a time he was aware of the first faraway signals of sensation in his beaten fingers  the faint tingling grew stronger till it evolved into a stinging ache that was excruciating but which the man hailed with satisfaction  he stripped the mitten from his right hand and fetched forth the birchbark  the exposed fingers were quickly going numb again next he brought out his bunch of sulphur matches  but the tremendous cold had already driven the life out of his fingers  in his effort to separate one match from the others the whole bunch fell in the snow  he tried to pick it out of the snow but failed  the dead fingers could neither touch nor clutch  he was very careful  he drove the thought of his freezing feet and nose and cheeks out of his mind devoting his whole soul to the matches  he watched using the sense of vision in place of that of touch and when he saw his fingers on each side the bunch he closed them—that is he willed to close them for the wires were drawn and the fingers did not obey  he pulled the mitten on the right hand and beat it fiercely against his knee  then with both mittened hands he scooped the bunch of matches along with much snow into his lap  yet he was no better off  after some manipulation he managed to get the bunch between the heels of his mittened hands  in this fashion he carried it to his mouth  the ice crackled and snapped when by a violent effort he opened his mouth  he drew the lower jaw in curled the upper lip out of the way and scraped the bunch with his upper teeth in order to separate a match  he succeeded in getting one which he dropped on his lap  he was no better off  he could not pick it up  then he devised a way  he picked it up in his teeth and scratched it on his leg  twenty times he scratched before he succeeded in lighting it  as it flamed he held it with his teeth to the birchbark  but the burning brimstone went up his nostrils and into his lungs causing him to cough spasmodically  the match fell into the snow and went out  the oldtimer on sulphur creek was right he thought in the moment of controlled despair that ensued after fifty below a man should travel with a partner  he beat his hands but failed in exciting any sensation suddenly he bared both hands removing the mittens with his teeth  he caught the whole bunch between the heels of his hands  his armmuscles not being frozen enabled him to press the handheels tightly against the matches  then he scratched the bunch along his leg  it flared into flame seventy sulphur matches at once  there was no wind to blow them out  he kept his head to one side to escape the strangling fumes and held the blazing bunch to the birchbark  as he so held it he became aware of sensation in his hand  his flesh was burning  he could smell it  deep down below the surface he could feel it  the sensation developed into pain that grew acute  and still he endured it holding the flame of the matches clumsily to the bark that would not light readily because his own burning hands were in the way absorbing most of the flame  at last when he could endure no more he jerked his hands apart  the blazing matches fell sizzling into the snow but the birchbark was alight  he began laying dry grasses and the tiniest twigs on the flame he could not pick and choose for he had to lift the fuel between the heels of his hands  small pieces of rotten wood and green moss clung to the twigs and he bit them off as well as he could with his teeth  he cherished the flame carefully and awkwardly  it meant life and it must not perish  the withdrawal of blood from the surface of his body now made him begin to shiver and he grew more awkward  a large piece of green moss fell squarely on the little fire  he tried to poke it out with his fingers but his shivering frame made him poke too far and he disrupted the nucleus of the little fire the burning grasses and tiny twigs separating and scattering  he tried to poke them together again but in spite of the tenseness of the effort his shivering got away with him and the twigs were hopelessly scattered  each twig gushed a puff of smoke and went out  the fireprovider had failed  as he looked apathetically about him his eyes chanced on the dog sitting across the ruins of the fire from him in the snow making restless hunching movements slightly lifting one forefoot and then the other shifting its weight back and forth on them with wistful eagerness  the sight of the dog put a wild idea into his head  he remembered the tale of the man caught in a blizzard who killed a steer and crawled inside the carcass and so was saved  he would kill the dog and bury his hands in the warm body until the numbness went out of them  then he could build another fire  he spoke to the dog calling it to him but in his voice was a strange note of fear that frightened the animal who had never known the man to speak in such way before  something was the matter and its suspicious nature sensed danger—it knew not what danger but somewhere somehow in its brain arose an apprehension of the man it flattened its ears down at the sound of the man’s voice and its restless hunching movements and the liftings and shiftings of its forefeet became more pronounced but it would not come to the man  he got on his hands and knees and crawled toward the dog  this unusual posture again excited suspicion and the animal sidled mincingly away  the man sat up in the snow for a moment and struggled for calmness  then he pulled on his mittens by means of his teeth and got upon his feet he glanced down at first in order to assure himself that he was really standing up for the absence of sensation in his feet left him unrelated to the earth  his erect position in itself started to drive the webs of suspicion from the dog’s mind and when he spoke peremptorily with the sound of whiplashes in his voice the dog rendered its customary allegiance and came to him  as it came within reaching distance the man lost his control  his arms flashed out to the dog and he experienced genuine surprise when he discovered that his hands could not clutch that there was neither bend nor feeling in the lingers  he had forgotten for the moment that they were frozen and that they were freezing more and more  all this happened quickly and before the animal could get away he encircled its body with his arms  he sat down in the snow and in this fashion held the dog while it snarled and whined and struggled  but it was all he could do hold its body encircled in his arms and sit there  he realized that he could not kill the dog  there was no way to do it  with his helpless hands he could neither draw nor hold his sheathknife nor throttle the animal  he released it and it plunged wildly away with tail between its legs and still snarling  it halted forty feet away and surveyed him curiously with ears sharply pricked forward  the man looked down at his hands in order to locate them and found them hanging on the ends of his arms  it struck him as curious that one should have to use his eyes in order to find out where his hands were  he began threshing his arms back and forth beating the mittened hands against his sides  he did this for five minutes violently and his heart pumped enough blood up to the surface to put a stop to his shivering  but no sensation was aroused in the hands  he had an impression that they hung like weights on the ends of his arms but when he tried to run the impression down he could not find it  a certain fear of death dull and oppressive came to him  this fear quickly became poignant as he realized that it was no longer a mere matter of freezing his fingers and toes or of losing his hands and feet but that it was a matter of life and death with the chances against him this threw him into a panic and he turned and ran up the creekbed along the old dim trail  the dog joined in behind and kept up with him  he ran blindly without intention in fear such as he had never known in his life  slowly as he ploughed and floundered through the snow he began to see things again—the banks of the creek the old timberjams the leafless aspens and the sky  the running made him feel better  he did not shiver  maybe if he ran on his feet would thaw out and anyway if he ran far enough he would reach camp and the boys  without doubt he would lose some fingers and toes and some of his face but the boys would take care of him and save the rest of him when he got there  and at the same time there was another thought in his mind that said he would never get to the camp and the boys that it was too many miles away that the freezing had too great a start on him and that he would soon be stiff and dead  this thought he kept in the background and refused to consider  sometimes it pushed itself forward and demanded to be heard but he thrust it back and strove to think of other things  it struck him as curious that he could run at all on feet so frozen that he could not feel them when they struck the earth and took the weight of his body  he seemed to himself to skim along above the surface and to have no connection with the earth  somewhere he had once seen a winged mercury and he wondered if mercury felt as he felt when skimming over the earth  his theory of running until he reached camp and the boys had one flaw in it he lacked the endurance  several times he stumbled and finally he tottered crumpled up and fell  when he tried to rise he failed  he must sit and rest he decided and next time he would merely walk and keep on going  as he sat and regained his breath he noted that he was feeling quite warm and comfortable  he was not shivering and it even seemed that a warm glow had come to his chest and trunk  and yet when he touched his nose or cheeks there was no sensation  running would not thaw them out  nor would it thaw out his hands and feet  then the thought came to him that the frozen portions of his body must be extending  he tried to keep this thought down to forget it to think of something else he was aware of the panicky feeling that it caused and he was afraid of the panic  but the thought asserted itself and persisted until it produced a vision of his body totally frozen  this was too much and he made another wild run along the trail  once he slowed down to a walk but the thought of the freezing extending itself made him run again  and all the time the dog ran with him at his heels  when he fell down a second time it curled its tail over its forefeet and sat in front of him facing him curiously eager and intent  the warmth and security of the animal angered him and he cursed it till it flattened down its ears appeasingly  this time the shivering came more quickly upon the man  he was losing in his battle with the frost  it was creeping into his body from all sides  the thought of it drove him on but he ran no more than a hundred feet when he staggered and pitched headlong  it was his last panic  when he had recovered his breath and control he sat up and entertained in his mind the conception of meeting death with dignity however the conception did not come to him in such terms  his idea of it was that he had been making a fool of himself running around like a chicken with its head cut off—such was the simile that occurred to him well he was bound to freeze anyway and he might as well take it decently  with this newfound peace of mind came the first glimmerings of drowsiness  a good idea he thought to sleep off to death  it was like taking an anæsthetic  freezing was not so bad as people thought there were lots worse ways to die  he pictured the boys finding his body next day  suddenly he found himself with them coming along the trail and looking for himself  and still with them he came around a turn in the trail and found himself lying in the snow  he did not belong with himself any more for even then he was out of himself standing with the boys and looking at himself in the snow  it certainly was cold was his thought  when he got back to the states he could tell the folks what real cold was  he drifted on from this to a vision of the oldtimer on sulphur creek  he could see him quite clearly warm and comfortable and smoking a pipe  “you were right old hoss you were right” the man mumbled to the oldtimer of sulphur creek  then the man drowsed off into what seemed to him the most comfortable and satisfying sleep he had ever known  the dog sat facing him and waiting the brief day drew to a close in a long slow twilight  there were no signs of a fire to be made and besides never in the dog’s experience had it known a man to sit like that in the snow and make no fire  as the twilight drew on its eager yearning for the fire mastered it and with a great lifting and shifting of forefeet it whined softly then flattened its ears down in anticipation of being chidden by the man  but the man remained silent  later the dog whined loudly  and still later it crept close to the man and caught the scent of death  this made the animal bristle and back away  a little longer it delayed howling under the stars that leaped and danced and shone brightly in the cold sky  then it turned and trotted up the trail in the direction of the camp it knew where were the other foodproviders and fireproviders     that spot   i don’t think much of stephen mackaye any more though i used to swear by him  i know that in those days i loved him more than my own brother  if ever i meet stephen mackaye again i shall not be responsible for my actions  it passes beyond me that a man with whom i shared food and blanket and with whom i mushed over the chilcoot trail should turn out the way he did  i always sized steve up as a square man a kindly comrade without an iota of anything vindictive or malicious in his nature  i shall never trust my judgment in men again  why i nursed that man through typhoid fever we starved together on the headwaters of the stewart and he saved my life on the little salmon  and now after the years we were together all i can say of stephen mackaye is that he is the meanest man i ever knew  we started for the klondike in the fall rush of 1897 and we started too late to get over chilcoot pass before the freezeup  we packed our outfit on our backs part way over when the snow began to fly and then we had to buy dogs in order to sled it the rest of the way  that was how we came to get that spot  dogs were high and we paid one hundred and ten dollars for him  he looked worth it  i say looked because he was one of the finestappearing dogs i ever saw  he weighed sixty pounds and he had all the lines of a good sled animal  we never could make out his breed  he wasn’t husky nor malemute nor hudson bay he looked like all of them and he didn’t look like any of them and on top of it all he had some of the white man’s dog in him for on one side in the thick of the mixed yellowbrownredanddirtywhite that was his prevailing colour there was a spot of coalblack as big as a waterbucket  that was why we called him spot  he was a good looker all right  when he was in condition his muscles stood out in bunches all over him  and he was the strongestlooking brute i ever saw in alaska also the most intelligentlooking  to run your eves over him you’d think he could outpull three dogs of his own weight  maybe he could but i never saw it  his intelligence didn’t run that way  he could steal and forage to perfection he had an instinct that was positively gruesome for divining when work was to be done and for making a sneak accordingly and for getting lost and not staying lost he was nothing short of inspired  but when it came to work the way that intelligence dribbled out of him and left him a mere clot of wobbling stupid jelly would make your heart bleed  there are times when i think it wasn’t stupidity  maybe like some men i know he was too wise to work  i shouldn’t wonder if he put it all over us with that intelligence of his  maybe he figured it all out and decided that a licking now and again and no work was a whole lot better than work all the time and no licking  he was intelligent enough for such a computation  i tell you i’ve sat and looked into that dog’s eyes till the shivers ran up and down my spine and the marrow crawled like yeast what of the intelligence i saw shining out  i can’t express myself about that intelligence  it is beyond mere words  i saw it that’s all  at times it was like gazing into a human soul to look into his eyes and what i saw there frightened me and started all sorts of ideas in my own mind of reincarnation and all the rest  i tell you i sensed something big in that brute’s eyes there was a message there but i wasn’t big enough myself to catch it  whatever it was i know i’m making a fool of myself—whatever it was it baffled me  i can’t give an inkling of what i saw in that brute’s eyes it wasn’t light it wasn’t colour it was something that moved away back when the eyes themselves weren’t moving  and i guess i didn’t see it move either i only sensed that it moved  it was an expression—that’s what it was—and i got an impression of it  no it was different from a mere expression it was more than that  i don’t know what it was but it gave me a feeling of kinship just the same  oh no not sentimental kinship  it was rather a kinship of equality  those eyes never pleaded like a deer’s eyes they challenged  no it wasn’t defiance  it was just a calm assumption of equality  and i don’t think it was deliberate  my belief is that it was unconscious on his part  it was there because it was there and it couldn’t help shining out  no i don’t mean shine  it didn’t shine it moved  i know i’m talking rot but if you’d looked into that animal’s eyes the way i have you’d understand  steve was affected the same way i was  why i tried to kill that spot once—he was no good for anything and i fell down on it  i led him out into the brush and he came along slow and unwilling  he knew what was going on  i stopped in a likely place put my foot on the rope and pulled my big colt’s  and that dog sat down and looked at me  i tell you he didn’t plead  he just looked and i saw all kinds of incomprehensible things moving yes moving in those eyes of his  i didn’t really see them move i thought i saw them for as i said before i guess i only sensed them  and i want to tell you right now that it got beyond me  it was like killing a man a conscious brave man who looked calmly into your gun as much as to say “who’s afraid”  then too the message seemed so near that instead of pulling the trigger quick i stopped to see if i could catch the message  there it was right before me glimmering all around in those eyes of his  and then it was too late  i got scared  i was trembly all over and my stomach generated a nervous palpitation that made me seasick  i just sat down and looked at the dog and he looked at me till i thought i was going crazy  do you want to know what i did  i threw down the gun and ran back to camp with the fear of god in my heart  steve laughed at me but i notice that steve led spot into the woods a week later for the same purpose and that steve came back alone and a little later spot drifted back too  at any rate spot wouldn’t work  we paid a hundred and ten dollars for him from the bottom of our sack and he wouldn’t work  he wouldn’t even tighten the traces  steve spoke to him the first time we put him in harness and he sort of shivered that was all  not an ounce on the traces  he just stood still and wobbled like so much jelly  steve touched him with the whip  he yelped but not an ounce  steve touched him again a bit harder and he howled—the regular long wolf howl  then steve got mad and gave him half a dozen and i came on the run from the tent  i told steve he was brutal with the animal and we had some words—the first we’d ever had  he threw the whip down in the snow and walked away mad  i picked it up and went to it  that spot trembled and wobbled and cowered before ever i swung the lash and with the first bite of it he howled like a lost soul  next he lay down in the snow  i started the rest of the dogs and they dragged him along while i threw the whip into him  he rolled over on his back and bumped along his four legs waving in the air himself howling as though he was going through a sausage machine  steve came back and laughed at me and i apologized for what i’d said  there was no getting any work out of that spot and to make up for it he was the biggest pigglutton of a dog i ever saw  on top of that he was the cleverest thief  there was no circumventing him  many a breakfast we went without our bacon because spot had been there first  and it was because of him that we nearly starved to death up the stewart  he figured out the way to break into our meatcache and what he didn’t eat the rest of the team did  but he was impartial  he stole from everybody  he was a restless dog always very busy snooping around or going somewhere  and there was never a camp within five miles that he didn’t raid  the worst of it was that they always came back on us to pay his board bill which was just being the law of the land but it was mighty hard on us especially that first winter on the chilcoot when we were busted paying for whole hams and sides of bacon that we never ate he could fight too that spot  he could do everything but work  he never pulled a pound but he was the boss of the whole team  the way he made those dogs stand around was an education  he bullied them and there was always one or more of them freshmarked with his fangs  but he was more than a bully  he wasn’t afraid of anything that walked on four legs and i’ve seen him march singlehanded into a strange team without any provocation whatever and put the kibosh on the whole outfit  did i say he could eat  i caught him eating the whip once  that’s straight he started in at the lash and when i caught him he was down to the handle and still going  but he was a good looker  at the end of the first week we sold him for seventyfive dollars to the mounted police  they had experienced dogdrivers and we knew that by the time he’d covered the six hundred miles to dawson he’d be a good sleddog  i say we knew for we were just getting acquainted with that spot  a little later we were not brash enough to know anything where he was concerned  a week later we woke up in the morning to the dangdest dogfight we’d ever heard  it was that spot come back and knocking the team into shape  we ate a pretty depressing breakfast i can tell you but cheered up two hours afterward when we sold him to an official courier bound in to dawson with government despatches  that spot was only three days in coming back and as usual celebrated his arrival with a rough house  we spent the winter and spring after our own outfit was across the pass freighting other people’s outfits and we made a fat stake  also we made money out of spot  if we sold him once we sold him twenty times he always came back and no one asked for their money  we didn’t want the money  we’d have paid handsomely for any one to take him off our hands for keeps’  we had to get rid of him and we couldn’t give him away for that would have been suspicious  but he was such a fine looker that we never had any difficulty in selling him  “unbroke” we’d say and they’d pay any old price for him  we sold him as low as twentyfive dollars and once we got a hundred and fifty for him  that particular party returned him in person refused to take his money back and the way he abused us was something awful  he said it was cheap at the price to tell us what he thought of us and we felt he was so justified that we never talked back  but to this day i’ve never quite regained all the old selfrespect that was mine before that man talked to me  when the ice cleared out of the lakes and river we put our outfit in a lake bennett boat and started for dawson  we had a good team of dogs and of course we piled them on top the outfit  that spot was along—there was no losing him and a dozen times the first day he knocked one or another of the dogs overboard in the course of fighting with them  it was close quarters and he didn’t like being crowded  “what that dog needs is space” steve said the second day  “let’s maroon him”  we did running the boat in at caribou crossing for him to jump ashore two of the other dogs good dogs followed him and we lost two whole days trying to find them  we never saw those two dogs again but the quietness and relief we enjoyed made us decide like the man who refused his hundred and fifty that it was cheap at the price  for the first time in months steve and i laughed and whistled and sang  we were as happy as clams  the dark days were over  the nightmare had been lifted that spot was gone  three weeks later one morning steve and i were standing on the riverbank at dawson  a small boat was just arriving from lake bennett i saw steve give a start and heard him say something that was not nice and that was not under his breath  then i looked and there in the bow of the boat with ears pricked up sat spot  steve and i sneaked immediately like beaten curs like cowards like absconders from justice  it was this last that the lieutenant of police thought when he saw us sneaking  he surmised that there were lawofficers in the boat who were after us  he didn’t wait to find out but kept us in sight and in the m  m saloon got us in a corner  we had a merry time explaining for we refused to go back to the boat and meet spot and finally he held us under guard of another policeman while he went to the boat  after we got clear of him we started for the cabin and when we arrived there was that spot sitting on the stoop waiting for us  now how did he know we lived there  there were forty thousand people in dawson that summer and how did he savve our cabin out of all the cabins  how did he know we were in dawson anyway  i leave it to you but don’t forget what i said about his intelligence and that immortal something i have seen glimmering in his eyes  there was no getting rid of him any more  there were too many people in dawson who had bought him up on chilcoot and the story got around  half a dozen times we put him on board steamboats going down the yukon but he merely went ashore at the first landing and trotted back up the bank  we couldn’t sell him we couldn’t kill him both steve and i had tried and nobody else was able to kill him  he bore a charmed life  i’ve seen him go down in a dogfight on the main street with fifty dogs on top of him and when they were separated he’d appear on all his four legs unharmed while two of the dogs that had been on top of him would be lying dead  i saw him steal a chunk of moosemeat from major dinwiddie’s cache so heavy that he could just keep one jump ahead of mrs dinwiddie’s squaw cook who was after him with an axe  as he went up the hill after the squaw gave up major dinwiddie himself came out and pumped his winchester into the landscape  he emptied his magazine twice and never touched that spot  then a policeman came along and arrested him for discharging firearms inside the city limits  major dinwiddie paid his fine and steve and i paid him for the moosemeat at the rate of a dollar a pound bones and all  that was what he paid for it  meat was high that year  i am only telling what i saw with my own eyes  and now i’ll tell you something also  i saw that spot fall through a waterhole  the ice was three and a half feet thick and the current sucked him under like a straw  three hundred yards below was the big waterhole used by the hospital  spot crawled out of the hospital waterhole licked off the water bit out the ice that had formed between his toes trotted up the bank and whipped a big newfoundland belonging to the gold commissioner  in the fall of 1898 steve and i poled up the yukon on the last water bound for stewart river  we took the dogs along all except spot  we figured we’d been feeding him long enough  he’d cost us more time and trouble and money and grub than we’d got by selling him on the chilcoot—especially grub  so steve and i tied him down in the cabin and pulled our freight  we camped that night at the mouth of indian river and steve and i were pretty facetious over having shaken him  steve was a funny cuss and i was just sitting up in the blankets and laughing when a tornado hit camp  the way that spot walked into those dogs and gave them whatfor was hairraising  now how did he get loose  it’s up to you  i haven’t any theory  and how did he get across the klondike river  that’s another facer  and anyway how did he know we had gone up the yukon  you see we went by water and he couldn’t smell our tracks steve and i began to get superstitious about that dog  he got on our nerves too and between you and me we were just a mite afraid of him  the freezeup came on when we were at the mouth of henderson creek and we traded him off for two sacks of flour to an outfit that was bound up white river after copper  now that whole outfit was lost  never trace nor hide nor hair of men dogs sleds or anything was ever found  they dropped clean out of sight  it became one of the mysteries of the country  steve and i plugged away up the stewart and six weeks afterward that spot crawled into camp  he was a perambulating skeleton and could just drag along but he got there  and what i want to know is who told him we were up the stewart  we could have gone to a thousand other places  how did he know  you tell me and i’ll tell you  no losing him  at the mayo he started a row with an indian dog  the buck who owned the dog took a swing at spot with an axe missed him and killed his own dog  talk about magic and turning bullets aside—i for one consider it a blamed sight harder to turn an axe aside with a big buck at the other end of it  and i saw him do it with my own eyes  that buck didn’t want to kill his own dog  you’ve got to show me  i told you about spot breaking into our meat cache  it was nearly the death of us  there wasn’t any more meat to be killed and meat was all we had to live on  the moose had gone back several hundred miles and the indians with them  there we were  spring was on and we had to wait for the river to break  we got pretty thin before we decided to eat the dogs and we decided to eat spot first  do you know what that dog did he sneaked  now how did he know our minds were made up to eat him  we sat up nights laying for him but he never came back and we ate the other dogs  we ate the whole team  and now for the sequel  you know what it is when a big river breaks up and a few billion tons of ice go out jamming and milling and grinding just in the thick of it when the stewart went out rumbling and roaring we sighted spot out in the middle  he’d got caught as he was trying to cross up above somewhere  steve and i yelled and shouted and ran up and down the bank tossing our hats in the air  sometimes we’d stop and hug each other we were that boisterous for we saw spot’s finish  he didn’t have a chance in a million  he didn’t have any chance at all  after the icerun we got into a canoe and paddled down to the yukon and down the yukon to dawson stopping to feed up for a week at the cabins at the mouth of henderson creek  and as we came in to the bank at dawson there sat that spot waiting for us his ears pricked up his tail wagging his mouth smiling extending a hearty welcome to us  now how did he get out of that ice  how did he know we were coming to dawson to the very hour and minute to be out there on the bank waiting for us  the more i think of that spot the more i am convinced that there are things in this world that go beyond science  on no scientific grounds can that spot be explained  it’s psychic phenomena or mysticism or something of that sort i guess with a lot of theosophy thrown in  the klondike is a good country  i might have been there yet and become a millionaire if it hadn’t been for spot  he got on my nerves  i stood him for two years altogether and then i guess my stamina broke  it was the summer of 1899 when i pulled out  i didn’t say anything to steve  i just sneaked  but i fixed it up all right  i wrote steve a note and enclosed a package of “roughonrats” telling him what to do with it  i was worn down to skin and bone by that spot and i was that nervous that i’d jump and look around when there wasn’t anybody within hailing distance  but it was astonishing the way i recuperated when i got quit of him  i got back twenty pounds before i arrived in san francisco and by the time i’d crossed the ferry to oakland i was my old self again so that even my wife looked in vain for any change in me  steve wrote to me once and his letter seemed irritated  he took it kind of hard because i’d left him with spot  also he said he’d used the “roughonrats” per directions and that there was nothing doing  a year went by  i was back in the office and prospering in all ways—even getting a bit fat  and then steve arrived  he didn’t look me up  i read his name in the steamer list and wondered why  but i didn’t wonder long  i got up one morning and found that spot chained to the gatepost and holding up the milkman  steve went north to seattle i learned that very morning  i didn’t put on any more weight  my wife made me buy him a collar and tag and within an hour he showed his gratitude by killing her pet persian cat  there is no getting rid of that spot  he will be with me until i die for he’ll never die  my appetite is not so good since he arrived and my wife says i am looking peaked  last night that spot got into mr harvey’s henhouse harvey is my nextdoor neighbour and killed nineteen of his fancybred chickens  i shall have to pay for them  my neighbours on the other side quarrelled with my wife and then moved out  spot was the cause of it  and that is why i am disappointed in stephen mackaye  i had no idea he was so mean a man     flush of gold   lon mcfane was a bit grumpy what of losing his tobacco pouch or else he might have told me before we got to it something about the cabin at surprise lake  all day turn and turn about we had spelled each other at going to the fore and breaking trail for the dogs  it was heavy snowshoe work and did not tend to make a man voluble yet lon mcfane might have found breath enough at noon when we stopped to boil coffee with which to tell me  but he didn’t  surprise lake it was surprise cabin to me  i had never heard of it before  i confess i was a bit tired  i had been looking for lon to stop and make camp any time for an hour but i had too much pride to suggest making camp or to ask him his intentions and yet he was my man lured at a handsome wage to mush my dogs for me and to obey my commands  i guess i was a bit grumpy myself he said nothing and i was resolved to ask nothing even if we tramped on all night  we came upon the cabin abruptly  for a week of trail we had met no one and in my mind there had been little likelihood of meeting any one for a week to come  and yet there it was right before my eyes a cabin with a dim light in the window and smoke curling up from the chimney  “why didn’t you tell me—” i began but was interrupted by lon who muttered—  “surprise lake—it lies up a small feeder half a mile on  it’s only a pond”  “yes but the cabin—who lives in it”  “a woman” was the answer and the next moment lon had rapped on the door and a woman’s voice bade him enter  “have you seen dave recently” she asked  “nope” lon answered carelessly  “i’ve been in the other direction down circle city way  dave’s up dawson way ain’t he”  the woman nodded and lon fell to unharnessing the dogs while i unlashed the sled and carried the camp outfit into the cabin  the cabin was a large oneroom affair and the woman was evidently alone in it  she pointed to the stove where water was already boiling and lon set about the preparation of supper while i opened the fishbag and fed the dogs i looked for lon to introduce us and was vexed that he did not for they were evidently old friends  “you are lon mcfane aren’t you” i heard her ask him  “why i remember you now  the last time i saw you it was on a steamboat wasn’t it  i remember    ”  her speech seemed suddenly to be frozen by the spectacle of dread which i knew from the tenor i saw mounting in her eyes must be on her inner vision  to my astonishment lon was affected by her words and manner his face showed desperate for all his voice sounded hearty and genial as he said—  “the last time we met was at dawson queen’s jubilee or birthday or something—don’t you remember—the canoe races in the river and the obstacle races down the main street”  the terror faded out of her eyes and her whole body relaxed  “oh yes i do remember” she said  “and you won one of the canoe races”  “how’s dave been makin’ it lately  strikin’ it as rich as ever i suppose” lon asked with apparent irrelevance  she smiled and nodded and then noticing that i had unlashed the bed roll she indicated the end of the cabin where i might spread it  her own bunk i noticed was made up at the opposite end  “i thought it was dave coming when i heard your dogs” she said  after that she said nothing contenting herself with watching lon’s cooking operations and listening the while as for the sound of dogs along the trail  i lay back on the blankets and smoked and watched here was mystery i could make that much out but no more could i make out  why in the deuce hadn’t lon given me the tip before we arrived  i looked at her face unnoticed by her and the longer i looked the harder it was to take my eyes away  it was a wonderfully beautiful face unearthly i may say with a light in it or an expression or something “that was never on land or sea”  fear and terror had completely vanished and it was a placidly beautiful face—if by “placid” one can characterize that intangible and occult something that i cannot say was a radiance or a light any more than i can say it was an expression  abruptly as if for the first time she became aware of my presence  “have you seen dave recently” she asked me  it was on the tip of my tongue to say “dave who” when lon coughed in the smoke that arose from the sizzling bacon  the bacon might have caused that cough but i took it as a hint and left my question unasked  “no i haven’t” i answered “i’m new in this part of the country—”  “but you don’t mean to say” she interrupted “that you’ve never heard of dave—of big dave walsh”  “you see” i apologised “i’m new in the country  i’ve put in most of my time in the lower country down nome way”  “tell him about dave” she said to lon  lon seemed put out but he began in that hearty genial manner that i had noticed before  it seemed a shade too hearty and genial and it irritated me  “oh dave is a fine man” he said  “he’s a man every inch of him and he stands six feet four in his socks  his word is as good as his bond the man lies who ever says dave told a lie and that man will have to fight with me too as well—if there’s anything left of him when dave gets done with him  for dave is a fighter  oh yes he’s a scrapper from way back  he got a grizzly with a ’38 popgun  he got clawed some but he knew what he was doin’  he went into the cave on purpose to get that grizzly  ’fraid of nothing  free an’ easy with his money or his last shirt an’ match when out of money  why he drained surprise lake here in three weeks an’ took out ninety thousand didn’t he”  she flushed and nodded her head proudly  through his recital she had followed every word with keenest interest  “an’ i must say” lon went on “that i was disappointed sore on not meeting dave here tonight”  lon served supper at one end of the table of whipsawed spruce and we fell to eating  a howling of the dogs took the woman to the door  she opened it an inch and listened  “where is dave walsh” i asked in an undertone  “dead” lon answered  “in hell maybe  i don’t know  shut up”  “but you just said that you expected to meet him here tonight” i challenged  “oh shut up can’t you” was lon’s reply in the same cautious undertone  the woman had closed the door and was returning and i sat and meditated upon the fact that this man who told me to shut up received from me a salary of two hundred and fifty dollars a month and his board  lon washed the dishes while i smoked and watched the woman  she seemed more beautiful than ever—strangely and weirdly beautiful it is true after looking at her steadfastly for five minutes i was compelled to come back to the real world and to glance at lon mcfane  this enabled me to know without discussion that the woman too was real  at first i had taken her for the wife of dave walsh but if dave walsh were dead as lon had said then she could be only his widow  it was early to bed for we faced a long day on the morrow and as lon crawled in beside me under the blankets i ventured a question  “that woman’s crazy isn’t she”  “crazy as a loon” he answered  and before i could formulate my next question lon mcfane i swear was off to sleep  he always went to sleep that way—just crawled into the blankets closed his eyes and was off a demure little heavy breathing rising on the air  lon never snored  and in the morning it was quick breakfast feed the dogs load the sled and hit the trail  we said goodbye as we pulled out and the woman stood in the doorway and watched us off  i carried the vision of her unearthly beauty away with me just under my eyelids and all i had to do any time was to close them and see her again  the way was unbroken surprise lake being far off the travelled trails and lon and i took turn about at beating down the feathery snow with our big webbed shoes so that the dogs could travel  “but you said you expected to meet dave walsh at the cabin” trembled on the tip of my tongue a score of times i did not utter it  i could wait until we knocked off in the middle of the day  and when the middle of the day came we went right on for as lon explained there was a camp of moose hunters at the forks of the teelee and we could make there by dark  but we didn’t make there by dark for bright the leaddog broke his shoulderblade and we lost an hour over him before we shot him  then crossing a timber jam on the frozen bed of the teelee the sled suffered a wrenching capsize and it was a case of make camp and repair the runner  i cooked supper and fed the dogs while lon made the repairs and together we got in the night’s supply of ice and firewood  then we sat on our blankets our moccasins steaming on upended sticks before the fire and had our evening smoke  “you didn’t know her” lon queried suddenly  i shook my head  “you noticed the colour of her hair and eyes and her complexion well that’s where she got her name—she was like the first warm glow of a golden sunrise  she was called flush of gold  ever heard of her”  somewhere i had a confused and misty remembrance of having heard the name yet it meant nothing to me  “flush of gold” i repeated “sounds like the name of a dancehouse girl”  lon shook his head  “no she was a good woman at least in that sense though she sinned greatly just the same”  “but why do you speak always of her in the past tense as though she were dead”  “because of the darkness on her soul that is the same as the darkness of death  the flush of gold that i knew that dawson knew and that forty mile knew before that is dead  that dumb lunatic creature we saw last night was not flush of gold”  “and dave” i queried  “he built that cabin” lon answered “he built it for her    and for himself  he is dead  she is waiting for him there  she half believes he is not dead  but who can know the whim of a crazed mind  maybe she wholly believes he is not dead  at any rate she waits for him there in the cabin he built  who would rouse the dead  then who would rouse the living that are dead  not i and that is why i let on to expect to meet dave walsh there last night  i’ll bet a stack that i’d a been more surprised than she if i had met him there last night”  “i do not understand” i said  “begin at the beginning as a white man should and tell me the whole tale”  and lon began  “victor chauvet was an old frenchman—born in the south of france  he came to california in the days of gold  he was a pioneer he found no gold but instead became a maker of bottled sunshine—in short a grapegrower and winemaker  also he followed gold excitements  that is what brought him to alaska in the early days and over the chilcoot and down the yukon long before the carmack strike  the old town site of ten mile was chauvet’s  he carried the first mail into arctic city  he staked those coalmines on the porcupine a dozen years ago  he grubstaked loftus into the nippennuck country  now it happened that victor chauvet was a good catholic loving two things in this world wine and woman  wine of all kinds he loved but of woman only one and she was the mother of marie chauvet”  here i groaned aloud having meditated beyond selfcontrol over the fact that i paid this man two hundred and fifty dollars a month  “what’s the matter now” he demanded  “matter” i complained  “i thought you were telling the story of flush of gold  i don’t want a biography of your old french winebibber”  lon calmly lighted his pipe took one good puff then put the pipe aside “and you asked me to begin at the beginning” he said  “yes” said i “the beginning”  “and the beginning of flush of gold is the old french winebibber for he was the father of marie chauvet and marie chauvet was the flush of gold what more do you want  victor chauvet never had much luck to speak of he managed to live and to get along and to take good care of marie who resembled the one woman he had loved  he took very good care of her flush of gold was the pet name he gave her  flush of gold creek was named after her—flush of gold town site too  the old man was great on town sites only he never landed them  “now honestly” lon said with one of his lightning changes “you’ve seen her what do you think of her—of her looks i mean  how does she strike your beauty sense”  “she is remarkably beautiful” i said  “i never saw anything like her in my life  in spite of the fact last night that i guessed she was mad i could not keep my eyes off of her  it wasn’t curiosity  it was wonder sheer wonder she was so strangely beautiful”  “she was more strangely beautiful before the darkness fell upon her” lon said softly  “she was truly the flush of gold  she turned all men’s hearts    and heads  she recalls with an effort that i once won a canoe race at dawson—i who once loved her and was told by her of her love for me  it was her beauty that made all men love her  she’d ’a’ got the apple from paris on application and there wouldn’t have been any trojan war and to top it off she’d have thrown paris down  and now she lives in darkness and she who was always fickle for the first time is constant—and constant to a shade to a dead man she does not realize is dead  “and this is the way it was  you remember what i said last night of dave walsh—big dave walsh  he was all that i said and more many times more he came into this country in the late eighties—that’s a pioneer for you he was twenty years old then  he was a young bull  when he was twentyfive he could lift clear of the ground thirteen fiftypound sacks of flour  at first each fall of the year famine drove him out  it was a lone land in those days  no river steamboats no grub nothing but salmon bellies and rabbit tracks  but after famine chased him out three years he said he’d had enough of being chased and the next year he stayed  he lived on straight meat when he was lucky enough to get it he ate eleven dogs that winter but he stayed  and the next winter he stayed and the next  he never did leave the country again  he was a bull a great bull  he could kill the strongest man in the country with hard work  he could outpack a chilcat indian he could outpaddle a stick and he could travel all day with wet feet when the thermometer registered fifty below zero and that’s going some i tell you for vitality  you’d freeze your feet at twentyfive below if you wet them and tried to keep on  “dave walsh was a bull for strength  and yet he was soft and easynatured  anybody could do him the latest shorthorn in camp could lie his last dollar out of him  ‘but it doesn’t worry me’ he had a way of laughing off his softness ‘it doesn’t keep me awake nights’ now don’t get the idea that he had no backbone  you remember about the bear he went after with the popgun  when it came to fighting dave was the blamedest ever  he was the limit if by that i may describe his unlimitedness when he got into action he was easy and kind with the weak but the strong had to give trail when he went by  and he was a man that men liked which is the finest word of all a man’s man  “dave never took part in the big stampede to dawson when carmack made the bonanza strike  you see dave was just then over on mammon creek strikin’ it himself  he discovered mammon creek  cleaned eightyfour thousand up that winter and opened up the claim so that it promised a couple of hundred thousand for the next winter  then summer bein’ on and the ground sloshy he took a trip up the yukon to dawson to see what carmack’s strike looked like  and there he saw flush of gold  i remember the night  i shall always remember  it was something sudden and it makes one shiver to think of a strong man with all the strength withered out of him by one glance from the soft eyes of a weak blond female creature like flush of gold  it was at her dad’s cabin old victor chauvet’s  some friend had brought dave along to talk over town sites on mammon creek  but little talking did he do and what he did was mostly gibberish  i tell you the sight of flush of gold had sent dave clean daffy  old victor chauvet insisted after dave left that he had been drunk  and so he had  he was drunk but flush of gold was the strong drink that made him so  “that settled it that first glimpse he caught of her  he did not start back down the yukon in a week as he had intended  he lingered on a month two months all summer  and we who had suffered understood and wondered what the outcome would be  undoubtedly in our minds it seemed that flush of gold had met her master  and why not  there was romance sprinkled all over dave walsh  he was a mammon king he had made the mammon creek strike he was an old sour dough one of the oldest pioneers in the land—men turned to look at him when he went by and said to one another in awed undertones ‘there goes dave walsh’  and why not  he stood six feet four he had yellow hair himself that curled on his neck and he was a bull—a yellowmaned bull just turned thirtyone  “and flush of gold loved him and having danced him through a whole summer’s courtship at the end their engagement was made known  the fall of the year was at hand dave had to be back for the winter’s work on mammon creek and flush of gold refused to be married right away  dave put dusky burns in charge of the mammon creek claim and himself lingered on in dawson  little use  she wanted her freedom a while longer she must have it and she would not marry until next year  and so on the first ice dave walsh went alone down the yukon behind his dogs with the understanding that the marriage would take place when he arrived on the first steamboat of the next year  “now dave was as true as the pole star and she was as false as a magnetic needle in a cargo of loadstone  dave was as steady and solid as she was fickle and flyaway and in some way dave who never doubted anybody doubted her  it was the jealousy of his love perhaps and maybe it was the message ticked off from her soul to his but at any rate dave was worried by fear of her inconstancy  he was afraid to trust her till the next year he had so to trust her and he was pretty well beside himself  some of it i got from old victor chauvet afterwards and from all that i have pieced together i conclude that there was something of a scene before dave pulled north with his dogs  he stood up before the old frenchman with flush of gold beside him and announced that they were plighted to each other  he was very dramatic with fire in his eyes old victor said  he talked something about ‘until death do us part’ and old victor especially remembered that at one place dave took her by the shoulder with his great paw and almost shook her as he said ‘even unto death are you mine and i would rise from the grave to claim you’  old victor distinctly remembered those words ‘even unto death are you mine and i would rise from the grave to claim you’  and he told me afterwards that flush of gold was pretty badly frightened and that he afterwards took dave to one side privately and told him that that wasn’t the way to hold flush of gold—that he must humour her and gentle her if he wanted to keep her  “there is no discussion in my mind but that flush of gold was frightened she was a savage herself in her treatment of men while men had always treated her as a soft and tender and too utterlyutter something that must not be hurt  she didn’t know what harshness was    until dave walsh standing his six feet four a big bull gripped her and pawed her and assured her that she was his until death and then some  and besides in dawson that winter was a musicplayer—one of those macaronieating greasytenoreyetaliandago propositions—and flush of gold lost her heart to him  maybe it was only fascination—i don’t know sometimes it seems to me that she really did love dave walsh  perhaps it was because he had frightened her with that evenuntodeath risefromthegrave stunt of his that she in the end inclined to the dago musicplayer  but it is all guesswork and the facts are sufficient he wasn’t a dago he was a russian count—this was straight and he wasn’t a professional pianoplayer or anything of the sort  he played the violin and the piano and he sang—sang well—but it was for his own pleasure and for the pleasure of those he sang for  he had money too—and right here let me say that flush of gold never cared a rap for money  she was fickle but she was never sordid  “but to be getting along  she was plighted to dave and dave was coming up on the first steamboat to get her—that was the summer of ’98 and the first steamboat was to be expected the middle of june  and flush of gold was afraid to throw dave down and face him afterwards  it was all planned suddenly  the russian musicplayer the count was her obedient slave  she planned it i know  i learned as much from old victor afterwards  the count took his orders from her and caught that first steamboat down  it was the golden rocket  and so did flush of gold catch it  and so did i  i was going to circle city and i was flabbergasted when i found flush of gold on board  i didn’t see her name down on the passenger list  she was with the count fellow all the time happy and smiling and i noticed that the count fellow was down on the list as having his wife along  there it was stateroom number and all  the first i knew that he was married only i didn’t see anything of the wife    unless flush of gold was so counted  i wondered if they’d got married ashore before starting  there’d been talk about them in dawson you see and bets had been laid that the count fellow had cut dave out  “i talked with the purser  he didn’t know anything more about it than i did he didn’t know flush of gold anyway and besides he was almost rushed to death  you know what a yukon steamboat is but you can’t guess what the golden rocket was when it left dawson that june of 1898  she was a hummer  being the first steamer out she carried all the scurvy patients and hospital wrecks  then she must have carried a couple of millions of klondike dust and nuggets to say nothing of a packed and jammed passenger list deck passengers galore and bucks and squaws and dogs without end  and she was loaded down to the guards with freight and baggage  there was a mountain of the same on the forelowerdeck and each little stop along the way added to it  i saw the box come aboard at teelee portage and i knew it for what it was though i little guessed the joker that was in it  and they piled it on top of everything else on the forelowerdeck and they didn’t pile it any too securely either the mate expected to come back to it again and then forgot about it  i thought at the time that there was something familiar about the big husky dog that climbed over the baggage and freight and lay down next to the box  and then we passed the glendale bound up for dawson  as she saluted us i thought of dave on board of her and hurrying to dawson to flush of gold  i turned and looked at her where she stood by the rail her eyes were bright but she looked a bit frightened by the sight of the other steamer and she was leaning closely to the count fellow as for protection  she needn’t have leaned so safely against him and i needn’t have been so sure of a disappointed dave walsh arriving at dawson  for dave walsh wasn’t on the glendale  there were a lot of things i didn’t know but was soon to know—for instance that the pair were not yet married  inside half an hour preparations for the marriage took place what of the sick men in the main cabin and of the crowded condition of the golden rocket the likeliest place for the ceremony was found forward on the lower deck in an open space next to the rail and gangplank and shaded by the mountain of freight with the big box on top and the sleeping dog beside it  there was a missionary on board getting off at eagle city which was the next step so they had to use him quick that’s what they’d planned to do get married on the boat  “but i’ve run ahead of the facts  the reason dave walsh wasn’t on the glendale was because he was on the golden rocket  it was this way after loiterin’ in dawson on account of flush of gold he went down to mammon creek on the ice  and there he found dusky burns doing so well with the claim there was no need for him to be around  so he put some grub on the sled harnessed the dogs took an indian along and pulled out for surprise lake  he always had a liking for that section  maybe you don’t know how the creek turned out to be a fourflusher but the prospects were good at the time and dave proceeded to build his cabin and hers  that’s the cabin we slept in  after he finished it he went off on a moose hunt to the forks of the teelee takin’ the indian along  “and this is what happened  came on a cold snap  the juice went down forty fifty sixty below zero  i remember that snap—i was at forty mile and i remember the very day  at eleven o’clock in the morning the spirit thermometer at the n a t  t company’s store went down to seventyfive below zero  and that morning near the forks of the teelee dave walsh was out after moose with that blessed indian of his  i got it all from the indian afterwards—we made a trip over the ice together to dyea  that morning mr indian broke through the ice and wet himself to the waist  of course he began to freeze right away  the proper thing was to build a fire  but dave walsh was a bull  it was only half a mile to camp where a fire was already burning  what was the good of building another  he threw mr indian over his shoulder—and ran with him—half a mile—with the thermometer at seventyfive below  you know what that means  suicide  there’s no other name for it  why that buck indian weighed over two hundred himself and dave ran half a mile with him  of course he froze his lungs  must have frozen them near solid  it was a tomfool trick for any man to do  and anyway after lingering horribly for several weeks dave walsh died  “the indian didn’t know what to do with the corpse  ordinarily he’d have buried him and let it go at that  but he knew that dave walsh was a big man worth lots of money a hiyu skookum chief  likewise he’d seen the bodies of other hiyu skookums carted around the country like they were worth something  so he decided to take dave’s body to forty mile which was dave’s headquarters  you know how the ice is on the grass roots in this country—well the indian planted dave under a foot of soil—in short he put dave on ice  dave could have stayed there a thousand years and still been the same old dave  you understand—just the same as a refrigerator  then the indian brings over a whipsaw from the cabin at surprise lake and makes lumber enough for the box  also waiting for the thaw he goes out and shoots about ten thousand pounds of moose  this he keeps on ice too  came the thaw  the teelee broke  he built a raft and loaded it with the meat the big box with dave inside and dave’s team of dogs and away they went down the teelee  “the raft got caught on a timber jam and hung up two days  it was scorching hot weather and mr indian nearly lost his moose meat  so when he got to teelee portage he figured a steamboat would get to forty mile quicker than his raft  he transferred his cargo and there you are forelower deck of the golden rocket flush of gold being married and dave walsh in his big box casting the shade for her  and there’s one thing i clean forgot  no wonder i thought the husky dog that came aboard at teelee portage was familiar  it was peelat dave walsh’s leaddog and favourite—a terrible fighter too  he was lying down beside the box  “flush of gold caught sight of me called me over shook hands with me and introduced me to the count  she was beautiful  i was as mad for her then as ever  she smiled into my eyes and said i must sign as one of the witnesses  and there was no refusing her  she was ever a child cruel as children are cruel  also she told me she was in possession of the only two bottles of champagne in dawson—or that had been in dawson the night before and before i knew it i was scheduled to drink her and the count’s health  everybody crowded round the captain of the steamboat very prominent trying to ring in on the wine i guess  it was a funny wedding  on the upper deck the hospital wrecks with various feet in the grave gathered and looked down to see  there were indians all jammed in the circle too big bucks and their squaws and kids to say nothing of about twentyfive snarling wolfdogs  the missionary lined the two of them up and started in with the service  and just then a dogfight started high up on the pile of freight—peelat lying beside the big box and a whitehaired brute belonging to one of the indians  the fight wasn’t explosive at all  the brutes just snarled at each other from a distance—tapping at each other longdistance you know saying dast and dassent dast and dassent  the noise was rather disturbing but you could hear the missionary’s voice above it  “there was no particularly easy way of getting at the two dogs except from the other side of the pile  but nobody was on that side—everybody watching the ceremony you see  even then everything might have been all right if the captain hadn’t thrown a club at the dogs  that was what precipitated everything  as i say if the captain hadn’t thrown that club nothing might have happened  “the missionary had just reached the point where he was saying ‘in sickness and in health’ and ‘till death us do part’  and just then the captain threw the club  i saw the whole thing  it landed on peelat and at that instant the white brute jumped him  the club caused it their two bodies struck the box and it began to slide its lower end tilting down  it was a long oblong box and it slid down slowly until it reached the perpendicular when it came down on the run  the onlookers on that side the circle had time to get out from under  flush of gold and the count on the opposite side of the circle were facing the box the missionary had his back to it  the box must have fallen ten feet straight up and down and it hit end on  “now mind you not one of us knew that dave walsh was dead  we thought he was on the glendale bound for dawson  the missionary had edged off to one side and so flush of gold faced the box when it struck  it was like in a play  it couldn’t have been better planned  it struck on end and on the right end the whole front of the box came off and out swept dave walsh on his feet partly wrapped in a blanket his yellow hair flying and showing bright in the sun  right out of the box on his feet he swept upon flush of gold  she didn’t know he was dead but it was unmistakable after hanging up two days on a timber jam that he was rising all right from the dead to claim her  possibly that is what she thought  at any rate the sight froze her  she couldn’t move  she just sort of wilted and watched dave walsh coming for her  and he got her it looked almost as though he threw his arms around her but whether or not this happened down to the deck they went together  we had to drag dave walsh’s body clear before we could get hold of her  she was in a faint but it would have been just as well if she had never come out of that faint for when she did she fell to screaming the way insane people do  she kept it up for hours till she was exhausted  oh yes she recovered  you saw her last night and know how much recovered she is she is not violent it is true but she lives in darkness  she believes that she is waiting for dave walsh and so she waits in the cabin he built for her  she is no longer fickle  it is nine years now that she has been faithful to dave walsh and the outlook is that she’ll be faithful to him to the end”  lon mcfane pulled down the top of the blankets and prepared to crawl in  “we have her grub hauled to her each year” he added “and in general keep an eye on her  last night was the first time she ever recognized me though”  “who are the we” i asked  “oh” was the answer “the count and old victor chauvet and me  do you know i think the count is the one to be really sorry for  dave walsh never did know that she was false to him  and she does not suffer  her darkness is merciful to her”  i lay silently under the blankets for the space of a minute  “is the count still in the country” i asked  but there was a gentle sound of heavy breathing and i knew lon mcfane was asleep     the passing of marcus o’brien   “it is the judgment of this court that you vamose the camp    in the customary way sir in the customary way”  judge marcus o’brien was absentminded and mucluc charley nudged him in the ribs  marcus o’brien cleared his throat and went on—  “weighing the gravity of the offence sir and the extenuating circumstances it is the opinion of this court and its verdict that you be outfitted with three days’ grub  that will do i think”  arizona jack cast a bleak glance out over the yukon  it was a swollen chocolate flood running a mile wide and nobody knew how deep  the earthbank on which he stood was ordinarily a dozen feet above the water but the river was now growling at the top of the bank devouring instant by instant tiny portions of the topstanding soil  these portions went into the gaping mouths of the endless army of brown swirls and vanished away  several inches more and red cow would be flooded  “it won’t do” arizona jack said bitterly  “three days’ grub ain’t enough”  “there was manchester” marcus o’brien replied gravely  “he didn’t get any grub”  “and they found his remains grounded on the lower river an’ half eaten by huskies” was arizona jack’s retort  “and his killin’ was without provocation  joe deeves never did nothin’ never warbled once an’ jes’ because his stomach was out of order manchester ups an’ plugs him  you ain’t givin’ me a square deal o’brien i tell you that straight  give me a week’s grub and i play even to win out  three days’ grub an’ i cash in”  “what for did you kill ferguson” o’brien demanded  “i haven’t any patience for these unprovoked killings  and they’ve got to stop  red cow’s none so populous  it’s a good camp and there never used to be any killings  now they’re epidemic  i’m sorry for you jack but you’ve got to be made an example of  ferguson didn’t provoke enough for a killing”  “provoke” arizona jack snorted  “i tell you o’brien you don’t savve you ain’t got no artistic sensibilities  what for did i kill ferguson what for did ferguson sing ‘then i wisht i was a little bird’  that’s what i want to know  answer me that  what for did he sing ‘little bird little bird’  one little bird was enough  i could astood one little bird  but no he must sing two little birds  i gave ’m a chanst  i went to him almighty polite and requested him kindly to discard one little bird  i pleaded with him  there was witnesses that testified to that  “an’ ferguson was no jaythroated songster” some one spoke up from the crowd  o’brien betrayed indecision  “ain’t a man got a right to his artistic feelin’s” arizona jack demanded  “i gave ferguson warnin’  it was violatin’ my own nature to go on listening to his little birds  why there’s music sharps that finestrung an’ keyedup they’d kill for heaps less’n i did  i’m willin’ to pay for havin’ artistic feelin’s  i can take my medicine an’ lick the spoon but three days’ grub is drawin’ it a shade fine that’s all an’ i hereby register my kick  go on with the funeral”  o’brien was still wavering  he glanced inquiringly at mucluc charley  “i should say judge that three days’ grub was a mite severe” the latter suggested “but you’re runnin’ the show  when we elected you judge of this here trial court we agreed to abide by your decisions an’ we’ve done it too b’gosh an’ we’re goin’ to keep on doin’ it”  “mebbe i’ve been a trifle harsh jack” o’brien said apologetically—“i’m that worked up over those killings an’ i’m willing to make it a week’s grub”  he cleared his throat magisterially and looked briskly about him “and now we might as well get along and finish up the business  the boat’s ready  you go and get the grub leclaire  we’ll settle for it afterward”  arizona jack looked grateful and muttering something about “damned little birds” stepped aboard the open boat that rubbed restlessly against the bank  it was a large skiff built of rough pine planks that had been sawed by hand from the standing timber of lake linderman a few hundred miles above at the foot of chilcoot  in the boat were a pair of oars and arizona jack’s blankets  leclaire brought the grub tied up in a floursack and put it on board  as he did so he whispered—“i gave you good measure jack  you done it with provocation”  “cast her off” arizona jack cried  somebody untied the painter and threw it in  the current gripped the boat and whirled it away  the murderer did not bother with the oars contenting himself with sitting in the sternsheets and rolling a cigarette  completing it he struck a match and lighted up  those that watched on the bank could see the tiny puffs of smoke  they remained on the bank till the boat swung out of sight around the bend half a mile below  justice had been done  the denizens of red cow imposed the law and executed sentences without the delays that mark the softness of civilization  there was no law on the yukon save what they made for themselves  they were compelled to make it for themselves  it was in an early day that red cow flourished on the yukon—1887—and the klondike and its populous stampedes lay in the unguessed future  the men of red cow did not even know whether their camp was situated in alaska or in the northwest territory whether they drew breath under the stars and stripes or under the british flag  no surveyor had ever happened along to give them their latitude and longitude  red cow was situated somewhere along the yukon and that was sufficient for them  so far as flags were concerned they were beyond all jurisdiction  so far as the law was concerned they were in noman’s land  they made their own law and it was very simple  the yukon executed their decrees  some two thousand miles below red cow the yukon flowed into bering sea through a delta a hundred miles wide  every mile of those two thousand miles was savage wilderness  it was true where the porcupine flowed into the yukon inside the arctic circle there was a hudson bay company trading post  but that was many hundreds of miles away  also it was rumoured that many hundreds of miles farther on there were missions  this last however was merely rumour the men of red cow had never been there  they had entered the lone land by way of chilcoot and the headwaters of the yukon  the men of red cow ignored all minor offences  to be drunk and disorderly and to use vulgar language were looked upon as natural and inalienable rights  the men of red cow were individualists and recognized as sacred but two things property and life  there were no women present to complicate their simple morality  there were only three logcabins in red cow—the majority of the population of forty men living in tents or brush shacks and there was no jail in which to confine malefactors while the inhabitants were too busy digging gold or seeking gold to take a day off and build a jail  besides the paramount question of grub negatived such a procedure  wherefore when a man violated the rights of property or life he was thrown into an open boat and started down the yukon  the quantity of grub he received was proportioned to the gravity of the offence  thus a common thief might get as much as two weeks’ grub an uncommon thief might get no more than half of that  a murderer got no grub at all  a man found guilty of manslaughter would receive grub for from three days to a week  and marcus o’brien had been elected judge and it was he who apportioned the grub  a man who broke the law took his chances  the yukon swept him away and he might or might not win to bering sea  a few days’ grub gave him a fighting chance  no grub meant practically capital punishment though there was a slim chance all depending on the season of the year  having disposed of arizona jack and watched him out of sight the population turned from the bank and went to work on its claims—all except curly jim who ran the one faro layout in all the northland and who speculated in prospectholes on the sides  two things happened that day that were momentous  in the late morning marcus o’brien struck it  he washed out a dollar a dollar and a half and two dollars from three successive pans  he had found the streak  curly jim looked into the hole washed a few pans himself and offered o’brien ten thousand dollars for all rights—five thousand in dust and in lieu of the other five thousand a half interest in his faro layout  o’brien refused the offer he was there to make money out of the earth he declared with heat and not out of his fellowmen  and anyway he didn’t like faro  besides he appraised his strike at a whole lot more than ten thousand  the second event of moment occurred in the afternoon when siskiyou pearly ran his boat into the bank and tied up  he was fresh from the outside and had in his possession a fourmonthsold newspaper furthermore he had half a dozen barrels of whisky all consigned to curly jim  the men of red cow quit work  they sampled the whisky—at a dollar a drink weighed out on curly’s scales and they discussed the news  and all would have been well had not curly jim conceived a nefarious scheme which was namely first to get marcus o’brien drunk and next to buy his mine from him  the first half of the scheme worked beautifully  it began in the early evening and by nine o’clock o’brien had reached the singing stage  he clung with one arm around curly jim’s neck and even essayed the late lamented ferguson’s song about the little birds  he considered he was quite safe in this what of the fact that the only man in camp with artistic feelings was even then speeding down the yukon on the breast of a fivemile current  but the second half of the scheme failed to connect  no matter how much whisky was poured down his neck o’brien could not be brought to realize that it was his bounden and friendly duty to sell his claim  he hesitated it is true and trembled now and again on the verge of giving in  inside his muddled head however he was chuckling to himself  he was up to curly jim’s game and liked the hands that were being dealt him  the whisky was good  it came out of one special barrel and was about a dozen times better than that in the other five barrels  siskiyou pearly was dispensing drinks in the barroom to the remainder of the population of red cow while o’brien and curly had out their business orgy in the kitchen  but there was nothing small about o’brien  he went into the barroom and returned with mucluc charley and percy leclaire  “business ’sociates of mine business ’sociates” he announced with a broad wink to them and a guileless grin to curly  “always trust their judgment always trust ’em  they’re all right  give ’em some firewater curly an’ le’s talk it over”  this was ringing in but curly jim making a swift revaluation of the claim and remembering that the last pan he washed had turned out seven dollars decided that it was worth the extra whisky even if it was selling in the other room at a dollar a drink  “i’m not likely to consider” o’brien was hiccoughing to his two friends in the course of explaining to them the question at issue  “who me—sell for ten thousand dollars  no indeed  i’ll dig the gold myself an’ then i’m goin’ down to god’s country—southern california—that’s the place for me to end my declinin’ days—an’ then i’ll start    as i said before then i’ll start    what did i say i was goin’ to start”  “ostrich farm” mucluc charley volunteered  “sure just what i’m goin’ to start”  o’brien abruptly steadied himself and looked with awe at mucluc charley  “how did you know  never said so  jes’ thought i said so  you’re a min’ reader charley  le’s have another”  curly jim filled the glasses and had the pleasure of seeing four dollars’ worth of whisky disappear one dollar’s worth of which he punished himself—o’brien insisted that he should drink as frequently as his guests  “better take the money now” leclaire argued  “take you two years to dig it out the hole an’ all that time you might be hatchin’ teeny little baby ostriches an’ pulling feathers out the big ones”  o’brien considered the proposition and nodded approval  curly jim looked gratefully at leclaire and refilled the glasses  “hold on there” spluttered mucluc charley whose tongue was beginning to wag loosely and trip over itself  “as your father confessor—there i go—as your brother—o hell”  he paused and collected himself for another start  “as your frien’—business frien’ i should say i would suggest rather—i would take the liberty as it was to mention—i mean suggest that there may be more ostriches    o hell”  he downed another glass and went on more carefully  “what i’m drivin’ at is    what am i drivin’ at”  he smote the side of his head sharply half a dozen times with the heel of his palm to shake up his ideas  “i got it” he cried jubilantly  “supposen there’s slathers more’n ten thousand dollars in that hole”  o’brien who apparently was all ready to close the bargain switched about  “great” he cried  “splen’d idea  never thought of it all by myself” he took mucluc charley warmly by the hand  “good frien’  good ’s’ciate”  he turned belligerently on curly jim  “maybe hundred thousand dollars in that hole  you wouldn’t rob your old frien’ would you curly  course you wouldn’t  i know you—better’n yourself better’n yourself  le’s have another we’re good frien’s all of us i say all of us”  and so it went and so went the whisky and so went curly jim’s hopes up and down  now leclaire argued in favour of immediate sale and almost won the reluctant o’brien over only to lose him to the more brilliant counterargument of mucluc charley  and again it was mucluc charley who presented convincing reasons for the sale and percy leclaire who held stubbornly back  a little later it was o’brien himself who insisted on selling while both friends with tears and curses strove to dissuade him  the more whiskey they downed the more fertile of imagination they became  for one sober pro or con they found a score of drunken ones and they convinced one another so readily that they were perpetually changing sides in the argument  the time came when both mucluc charley and leclaire were firmly set upon the sale and they gleefully obliterated o’brien’s objections as fast as he entered them  o’brien grew desperate  he exhausted his last argument and sat speechless  he looked pleadingly at the friends who had deserted him  he kicked mucluc charley’s shins under the table but that graceless hero immediately unfolded a new and most logical reason for the sale  curly jim got pen and ink and paper and wrote out the bill of sale  o’brien sat with pen poised in hand  “le’s have one more” he pleaded  “one more before i sign away a hundred thousan’ dollars”  curly jim filled the glasses triumphantly  o’brien downed his drink and bent forward with wobbling pen to affix his signature  before he had made more than a blot he suddenly started up impelled by the impact of an idea colliding with his consciousness  he stood upon his feet and swayed back and forth before them reflecting in his startled eyes the thought process that was taking place behind  then he reached his conclusion  a benevolent radiance suffused his countenance  he turned to the faro dealer took his hand and spoke solemnly  “curly you’re my frien’  there’s my han’  shake  ol’ man i won’t do it  won’t sell  won’t rob a frien’  no sonofagun will ever have chance to say marcus o’brien robbed frien’ cause frien’ was drunk you’re drunk curly an’ i won’t rob you  jes’ had thought—never thought it before—don’t know what the matter ’ith me but never thought it before  suppose jes’ suppose curly my ol’ frien’ jes’ suppose there ain’t ten thousan’ in whole damn claim  you’d be robbed  no sir won’t do it  marcus o’brien makes money out of the groun’ not out of his frien’s”  percy leclaire and mucluc charley drowned the faro dealer’s objections in applause for so noble a sentiment  they fell upon o’brien from either side their arms lovingly about his neck their mouths so full of words they could not hear curly’s offer to insert a clause in the document to the effect that if there weren’t ten thousand in the claim he would be given back the difference between yield and purchase price  the longer they talked the more maudlin and the more noble the discussion became all sordid motives were banished  they were a trio of philanthropists striving to save curly jim from himself and his own philanthropy  they insisted that he was a philanthropist  they refused to accept for a moment that there could be found one ignoble thought in all the world they crawled and climbed and scrambled over high ethical plateaux and ranges or drowned themselves in metaphysical seas of sentimentality  curly jim sweated and fumed and poured out the whisky  he found himself with a score of arguments on his hands not one of which had anything to do with the goldmine he wanted to buy  the longer they talked the farther away they got from that goldmine and at two in the morning curly jim acknowledged himself beaten  one by one he led his helpless guests across the kitchen floor and thrust them outside  o’brien came last and the three with arms locked for mutual aid titubated gravely on the stoop  “good business man curly” o’brien was saying  “must say like your style—fine an’ generous freehanded hospital    hospital    hospitality  credit to you  nothin’ base ’n graspin’ in your makeup as i was sayin’—”  but just then the faro dealer slammed the door  the three laughed happily on the stoop  they laughed for a long time then mucluc charley essayed speech  “funny—laughed so hard—ain’t what i want to say  my idea is    what wash it  oh got it  funny how ideas slip  elusive idea—chasin’ elusive idea—great sport  ever chase rabbits percy my frien’  i had dog—great rabbit dog  whash ’is name  don’t know name—never had no name—forget name—elusive name—chasin’ elusive name—no idea—elusive idea but got it—what i want to say was—o hell”  thereafter there was silence for a long time  o’brien slipped from their arms to a sitting posture on the stoop where he slept gently  mucluc charley chased the elusive idea through all the nooks and crannies of his drowning consciousness  leclaire hung fascinated upon the delayed utterance  suddenly the other’s hand smote him on the back  “got it” mucluc charley cried in stentorian tones  the shock of the jolt broke the continuity of leclaire’s mental process  “how much to the pan” he demanded  “pan nothin’” mucluc charley was angry  “idea—got it—got leghold—ran it down”  leclaire’s face took on a rapt admiring expression and again he hung upon the other’s lips  “    o hell” said mucluc charley  at this moment the kitchen door opened for an instant and curly jim shouted “go home”  “funny” said mucluc charley  “shame idea—very shame as mine  le’s go home”  they gathered o’brien up between them and started  mucluc charley began aloud the pursuit of another idea  leclaire followed the pursuit with enthusiasm  but o’brien did not follow it  he neither heard nor saw nor knew anything  he was a mere wobbling automaton supported affectionately and precariously by his two business associates  they took the path down by the bank of the yukon  home did not lie that way but the elusive idea did  mucluc charley giggled over the idea that he could not catch for the edification of leclaire  they came to where siskiyou pearly’s boat lay moored to the bank  the rope with which it was tied ran across the path to a pine stump  they tripped over it and went down o’brien underneath  a faint flash of consciousness lighted his brain  he felt the impact of bodies upon his and struck out madly for a moment with his fists  then he went to sleep again  his gentle snore arose on the air and mucluc charley began to giggle  “new idea” he volunteered “brand new idea  jes’ caught it—no trouble at all  came right up an’ i patted it on the head  it’s mine  ’brien’s drunk—beashly drunk  shame—damn shame—learn’m lesshon  trash pearly’s boat  put ’brien in pearly’s boat  casht off—let her go down yukon ’brien wake up in mornin’  current too strong—can’t row boat ’gainst current—mush walk back  come back madder ’n hatter  you an’ me headin’ for tall timber  learn ’m lesshon jes’ shame learn ’m lesshon”  siskiyou pearly’s boat was empty save for a pair of oars  its gunwale rubbed against the bank alongside of o’brien  they rolled him over into it  mucluc charley cast off the painter and leclaire shoved the boat out into the current  then exhausted by their labours they lay down on the bank and slept  next morning all red cow knew of the joke that had been played on marcus o’brien  there were some tall bets as to what would happen to the two perpetrators when the victim arrived back  in the afternoon a lookout was set so that they would know when he was sighted  everybody wanted to see him come in  but he didn’t come though they sat up till midnight  nor did he come next day nor the next  red cow never saw marcus o’brien again and though many conjectures were entertained no certain clue was ever gained to dispel the mystery of his passing                                        only marcus o’brien knew and he never came back to tell  he awoke next morning in torment  his stomach had been calcined by the inordinate quantity of whisky he had drunk and was a dry and raging furnace  his head ached all over inside and out and worse than that was the pain in his face  for six hours countless thousands of mosquitoes had fed upon him and their ungrateful poison had swollen his face tremendously it was only by a severe exertion of will that he was able to open narrow slits in his face through which he could peer  he happened to move his hands and they hurt  he squinted at them but failed to recognize them so puffed were they by the mosquito virus  he was lost or rather his identity was lost to him  there was nothing familiar about him which by association of ideas would cause to rise in his consciousness the continuity of his existence  he was divorced utterly from his past for there was nothing about him to resurrect in his consciousness a memory of that past  besides he was so sick and miserable that he lacked energy and inclination to seek after who and what he was  it was not until he discovered a crook in a little finger caused by an unset breakage of years before that he knew himself to be marcus o’brien  on the instant his past rushed into his consciousness  when he discovered a bloodblister under a thumbnail which he had received the previous week his selfidentification became doubly sure and he knew that those unfamiliar hands belonged to marcus o’brien or just as much to the point that marcus o’brien belonged to the hands  his first thought was that he was ill—that he had had river fever  it hurt him so much to open his eyes that he kept them closed  a small floating branch struck the boat a sharp rap  he thought it was some one knocking on the cabin door and said “come in”  he waited for a while and then said testily “stay out then damn you”  but just the same he wished they would come in and tell him about his illness  but as he lay there the past night began to reconstruct itself in his brain  he hadn’t been sick at all was his thought he had merely been drunk and it was time for him to get up and go to work  work suggested his mine and he remembered that he had refused ten thousand dollars for it  he sat up abruptly and squeezed open his eyes  he saw himself in a boat floating on the swollen brown flood of the yukon  the sprucecovered shores and islands were unfamiliar  he was stunned for a time  he couldn’t make it out  he could remember the last night’s orgy but there was no connection between that and his present situation  he closed his eyes and held his aching head in his hands  what had happened  slowly the dreadful thought arose in his mind  he fought against it strove to drive it away but it persisted he had killed somebody  that alone could explain why he was in an open boat drifting down the yukon  the law of red cow that he had so long administered had now been administered to him  he had killed some one and been set adrift  but whom  he racked his aching brain for the answer but all that came was a vague memory of bodies falling upon him and of striking out at them  who were they  maybe he had killed more than one  he reached to his belt  the knife was missing from its sheath  he had done it with that undoubtedly  but there must have been some reason for the killing  he opened his eyes and in a panic began to search about the boat  there was no grub not an ounce of grub  he sat down with a groan  he had killed without provocation  the extreme rigour of the law had been visited upon him  for half an hour he remained motionless holding his aching head and trying to think  then he cooled his stomach with a drink of water from overside and felt better  he stood up and alone on the widestretching yukon with naught but the primeval wilderness to hear he cursed strong drink  after that he tied up to a huge floating pine that was deeper sunk in the current than the boat and that consequently drifted faster he washed his face and hands sat down in the sternsheets and did some more thinking  it was late in june  it was two thousand miles to bering sea  the boat was averaging five miles an hour  there was no darkness in such high latitudes at that time of the year and he could run the river every hour of the twentyfour  this would mean daily a hundred and twenty miles  strike out the twenty for accidents and there remained a hundred miles a day  in twenty days he would reach bering sea  and this would involve no expenditure of energy the river did the work  he could lie down in the bottom of the boat and husband his strength  for two days he ate nothing  then drifting into the yukon flats he went ashore on the lowlying islands and gathered the eggs of wild geese and ducks  he had no matches and ate the eggs raw  they were strong but they kept him going  when he crossed the arctic circle he found the hudson bay company’s post  the brigade had not yet arrived from the mackenzie and the post was completely out of grub  he was offered wildduck eggs but he informed them that he had a bushel of the same on the boat  he was also offered a drink of whisky which he refused with an exhibition of violent repugnance  he got matches however and after that he cooked his eggs  toward the mouth of the river headwinds delayed him and he was twentyfour days on the egg diet  unfortunately while asleep he had drifted by both the missions of st paul and holy cross  and he could sincerely say as he afterward did that talk about missions on the yukon was all humbug  there weren’t any missions and he was the man to know  once on bering sea he exchanged the egg diet for seal diet and he never could make up his mind which he liked least  in the fall of the year he was rescued by a united states revenue cutter and the following winter he made quite a hit in san francisco as a temperance lecturer  in this field he found his vocation  “avoid the bottle” is his slogan and battlecry  he manages subtly to convey the impression that in his own life a great disaster was wrought by the bottle  he has even mentioned the loss of a fortune that was caused by that hellbait of the devil but behind that incident his listeners feel the loom of some terrible and unguessed evil for which the bottle is responsible  he has made a success in his vocation and has grown grey and respected in the crusade against strong drink  but on the yukon the passing of marcus o’brien remains tradition  it is a mystery that ranks at par with the disappearance of sir john franklin     the wit of porportuk   elsoo had been a mission girl  her mother had died when she was very small and sister alberta had plucked elsoo as a brand from the burning one summer day and carried her away to holy cross mission and dedicated her to god  elsoo was a fullblooded indian yet she exceeded all the halfbreed and quarterbreed girls  never had the good sisters dealt with a girl so adaptable and at the same time so spirited  elsoo was quick and deft and intelligent but above all she was fire the living flame of life a blaze of personality that was compounded of will sweetness and daring  her father was a chief and his blood ran in her veins  obedience on the part of elsoo was a matter of terms and arrangement  she had a passion for equity and perhaps it was because of this that she excelled in mathematics  but she excelled in other things  she learned to read and write english as no girl had ever learned in the mission  she led the girls in singing and into song she carried her sense of equity  she was an artist and the fire of her flowed toward creation  had she from birth enjoyed a more favourable environment she would have made literature or music  instead she was elsoo daughter of klakeenah a chief and she lived in the holy cross mission where were no artists but only puresouled sisters who were interested in cleanliness and righteousness and the welfare of the spirit in the land of immortality that lay beyond the skies  the years passed  she was eight years old when she entered the mission she was sixteen and the sisters were corresponding with their superiors in the order concerning the sending of elsoo to the united states to complete her education when a man of her own tribe arrived at holy cross and had talk with her  elsoo was somewhat appalled by him  he was dirty  he was a calibanlike creature primitively ugly with a mop of hair that had never been combed  he looked at her disapprovingly and refused to sit down  “thy brother is dead” he said shortly  elsoo was not particularly shocked  she remembered little of her brother  “thy father is an old man and alone” the messenger went on “his house is large and empty and he would hear thy voice and look upon thee”  him she remembered—klakeenah the headman of the village the friend of the missionaries and the traders a large man thewed like a giant with kindly eyes and masterful ways and striding with a consciousness of crude royalty in his carriage  “tell him that i will come” was elsoo’s answer  much to the despair of the sisters the brand plucked from the burning went back to the burning  all pleading with elsoo was vain  there was much argument expostulation and weeping  sister alberta even revealed to her the project of sending her to the united states  elsoo stared wideeyed into the golden vista thus opened up to her and shook her head  in her eyes persisted another vista  it was the mighty curve of the yukon at tananaw station  with the st george mission on one side and the trading post on the other and midway between the indian village and a certain large log house where lived an old man tended upon by slaves  all dwellers on the yukon bank for twice a thousand miles knew the large log house the old man and the tending slaves and well did the sisters know the house its unending revelry its feasting and its fun  so there was weeping at holy cross when elsoo departed  there was a great cleaning up in the large house when elsoo arrived klakeenah himself masterful protested at this masterful conduct of his young daughter but in the end dreaming barbarically of magnificence he went forth and borrowed a thousand dollars from old porportuk than whom there was no richer indian on the yukon  also klakeenah ran up a heavy bill at the trading post  elsoo recreated the large house  she invested it with new splendour while klakeenah maintained its ancient traditions of hospitality and revelry  all this was unusual for a yukon indian but klakeenah was an unusual indian  not alone did he like to render inordinate hospitality but what of being a chief and of acquiring much money he was able to do it in the primitive trading days he had been a power over his people and he had dealt profitably with the white trading companies  later on with porportuk he had made a goldstrike on the koyokuk river  klakeenah was by training and nature an aristocrat  porportuk was bourgeois and porportuk bought him out of the goldmine  porportuk was content to plod and accumulate  klakeenah went back to his large house and proceeded to spend  porportuk was known as the richest indian in alaska  klakeenah was known as the whitest  porportuk was a moneylender and a usurer klakeenah was an anachronism—a mediæval ruin a fighter and a feaster happy with wine and song  elsoo adapted herself to the large house and its ways as readily as she had adapted herself to holy cross mission and its ways  she did not try to reform her father and direct his footsteps toward god  it is true she reproved him when he drank overmuch and profoundly but that was for the sake of his health and the direction of his footsteps on solid earth  the latchstring to the large house was always out  what with the coming and the going it was never still  the rafters of the great livingroom shook with the roar of wassail and of song  at table sat men from all the world and chiefs from distant tribes—englishmen and colonials lean yankee traders and rotund officials of the great companies cowboys from the western ranges sailors from the sea hunters and dogmushers of a score of nationalities  elsoo drew breath in a cosmopolitan atmosphere  she could speak english as well as she could her native tongue and she sang english songs and ballads  the passing indian ceremonials she knew and the perishing traditions  the tribal dress of the daughter of a chief she knew how to wear upon occasion  but for the most part she dressed as white women dress  not for nothing was her needlework at the mission and her innate artistry  she carried her clothes like a white woman and she made clothes that could be so carried  in her way she was as unusual as her father and the position she occupied was as unique as his  she was the one indian woman who was the social equal with the several white women at tananaw station  she was the one indian woman to whom white men honourably made proposals of marriage  and she was the one indian woman whom no white man ever insulted  for elsoo was beautiful—not as white women are beautiful not as indian women are beautiful  it was the flame of her that did not depend upon feature that was her beauty  so far as mere line and feature went she was the classic indian type  the black hair and the fine bronze were hers and the black eyes brilliant and bold keen as swordlight proud and hers the delicate eagle nose with the thin quivering nostrils the high cheekbones that were not broad apart and the thin lips that were not too thin  but over all and through all poured the flame of her—the unanalysable something that was fire and that was the soul of her that lay mellowwarm or blazed in her eyes that sprayed the cheeks of her that distended the nostrils that curled the lips or when the lip was in repose that was still there in the lip the lip palpitant with its presence  and elsoo had wit—rarely sharp to hurt yet quick to search out forgivable weakness  the laughter of her mind played like lambent flame over all about her and from all about her arose answering laughter  yet she was never the centre of things  this she would not permit  the large house and all of which it was significant was her father’s and through it to the last moved his heroic figure—host master of the revels and giver of the law  it is true as the strength oozed from him that she caught up responsibilities from his failing hands  but in appearance he still ruled dozing ofttimes at the board a bacchanalian ruin yet in all seeming the ruler of the feast  and through the large house moved the figure of porportuk ominous with shaking head coldly disapproving paying for it all  not that he really paid for he compounded interest in weird ways and year by year absorbed the properties of klakeenah  porportuk once took it upon himself to chide elsoo upon the wasteful way of life in the large house—it was when he had about absorbed the last of klakeenah’s wealth—but he never ventured so to chide again  elsoo like her father was an aristocrat as disdainful of money as he and with an equal sense of honour as finely strung  porportuk continued grudgingly to advance money and ever the money flowed in golden foam away  upon one thing elsoo was resolved—her father should die as he had lived  there should be for him no passing from high to low no diminution of the revels no lessening of the lavish hospitality  when there was famine as of old the indians came groaning to the large house and went away content  when there was famine and no money money was borrowed from porportuk and the indians still went away content  elsoo might well have repeated after the aristocrats of another time and place that after her came the deluge  in her case the deluge was old porportuk  with every advance of money he looked upon her with a more possessive eye and felt bourgeoning within him ancient fires  but elsoo had no eyes for him  nor had she eyes for the white men who wanted to marry her at the mission with ring and priest and book  for at tananaw station was a young man akoon of her own blood and tribe and village  he was strong and beautiful to her eyes a great hunter and in that he had wandered far and much very poor he had been to all the unknown wastes and places he had journeyed to sitka and to the united states he had crossed the continent to hudson bay and back again and as sealhunter on a ship he had sailed to siberia and for japan  when he returned from the goldstrike in klondike he came as was his wont to the large house to make report to old klakeenah of all the world that he had seen and there he first saw elsoo three years back from the mission  thereat akoon wandered no more  he refused a wage of twenty dollars a day as pilot on the big steamboats  he hunted some and fished some but never far from tananaw station and he was at the large house often and long  and elsoo measured him against many men and found him good  he sang songs to her and was ardent and glowed until all tananaw station knew he loved her  and porportuk but grinned and advanced more money for the upkeep of the large house  then came the death table of klakeenah  he sat at feast with death in his throat that he could not drown with wine  and laughter and joke and song went around and akoon told a story that made the rafters echo  there were no tears or sighs at that table it was no more than fit that klakeenah should die as he had lived and none knew this better than elsoo with her artist sympathy  the old roystering crowd was there and as of old three frostbitten sailors were there fresh from the long traverse from the arctic survivors of a ship’s company of seventyfour  at klakeenah’s back were four old men all that were left him of the slaves of his youth  with rheumy eyes they saw to his needs with palsied hands filling his glass or striking him on the back between the shoulders when death stirred and he coughed and gasped  it was a wild night and as the hours passed and the fun laughed and roared along death stirred more restlessly in klakeenah’s throat  then it was that he sent for porportuk  and porportuk came in from the outside frost to look with disapproving eyes upon the meat and wine on the table for which he had paid  but as he looked down the length of flushed faces to the far end and saw the face of elsoo the light in his eyes flared up and for a moment the disapproval vanished  place was made for him at klakeenah’s side and a glass placed before him  klakeenah with his own hands filled the glass with fervent spirits  “drink” he cried  “is it not good”  and porportuk’s eyes watered as he nodded his head and smacked his lips  “when in your own house have you had such drink” klakeenah demanded  “i will not deny that the drink is good to this old throat of mine” porportuk made answer and hesitated for the speech to complete the thought  “but it costs overmuch” klakeenah roared completing it for him  porportuk winced at the laughter that went down the table  his eyes burned malevolently  “we were boys together of the same age” he said “in your throat is death  i am still alive and strong”  an ominous murmur arose from the company  klakeenah coughed and strangled and the old slaves smote him between the shoulders  he emerged gasping and waved his hand to still the threatening rumble  “you have grudged the very fire in your house because the wood cost overmuch” he cried  “you have grudged life  to live cost overmuch and you have refused to pay the price  your life has been like a cabin where the fire is out and there are no blankets on the floor”  he signalled to a slave to fill his glass which he held aloft  “but i have lived  and i have been warm with life as you have never been warm  it is true you shall live long  but the longest nights are the cold nights when a man shivers and lies awake  my nights have been short but i have slept warm”  he drained the glass  the shaking hand of a slave failed to catch it as it crashed to the floor  klakeenah sank back panting watching the upturned glasses at the lips of the drinkers his own lips slightly smiling to the applause  at a sign two slaves attempted to help him sit upright again  but they were weak his frame was mighty and the four old men tottered and shook as they helped him forward  “but manner of life is neither here nor there” he went on  “we have other business porportuk you and i tonight  debts are mischances and i am in mischance with you  what of my debt and how great is it”  porportuk searched in his pouch and brought forth a memorandum  he sipped at his glass and began  “there is the note of august 1889 for three hundred dollars  the interest has never been paid  and the note of the next year for five hundred dollars  this note was included in the note of two months later for a thousand dollars  then there is the note—”  “never mind the many notes” klakeenah cried out impatiently  “they make my head go around and all the things inside my head  the whole the round whole  how much is it”  porportuk referred to his memorandum  “fifteen thousand nine hundred and sixtyseven dollars and seventyfive cents” he read with careful precision  “make it sixteen thousand make it sixteen thousand” klakeenah said grandly  “odd numbers were ever a worry  and now—and it is for this that i have sent for you—make me out a new note for sixteen thousand which i shall sign  i have no thought of the interest  make it as large as you will and make it payable in the next world when i shall meet you by the fire of the great father of all indians  then the note will be paid  this i promise you  it is the word of klakeenah”  porportuk looked perplexed and loudly the laughter arose and shook the room  klakeenah raised his hands  “nay” he cried  “it is not a joke i but speak in fairness  it was for this i sent for you porportuk make out the note”  “i have no dealings with the next world” porportuk made answer slowly  “have you no thought to meet me before the great father” klakeenah demanded  then he added “i shall surely be there”  “i have no dealings with the next world” porportuk repeated sourly  the dying man regarded him with frank amazement  “i know naught of the next world” porportuk explained  “i do business in this world”  klakeenah’s face cleared  “this comes of sleeping cold of nights” he laughed  he pondered for a space then said “it is in this world that you must be paid  there remains to me this house  take it and burn the debt in the candle there”  “it is an old house and not worth the money” porportuk made answer  “there are my mines on the twisted salmon”  “they have never paid to work” was the reply  “there is my share in the steamer koyokuk  i am half owner”  “she is at the bottom of the yukon”  klakeenah started  “true i forgot  it was last spring when the ice went out”  he mused for a time while the glasses remained untasted and all the company waited upon his utterance  “then it would seem i owe you a sum of money which i cannot pay    in this world”  porportuk nodded and glanced down the table  “then it would seem that you porportuk are a poor business man” klakeenah said slyly  and boldly porportuk made answer “no there is security yet untouched”  “what” cried klakeenah  “have i still property  name it and it is yours and the debt is no more”  “there it is”  porportuk pointed at elsoo  klakeenah could not understand  he peered down the table brushed his eyes and peered again  “your daughter elsoo—her will i take and the debt be no more  i will burn the debt there in the candle”  klakeenah’s great chest began to heave  “ho ho—a joke  ho ho ho” he laughed homerically  “and with your cold bed and daughters old enough to be the mother of elsoo  ho ho ho”  he began to cough and strangle and the old slaves smote him on the back  “ho ho” he began again and went off into another paroxysm  porportuk waited patiently sipping from his glass and studying the double row of faces down the board  “it is no joke” he said finally “my speech is well meant”  klakeenah sobered and looked at him then reached for his glass but could not touch it  a slave passed it to him and glass and liquor he flung into the face of porportuk  “turn him out” klakeenah thundered to the waiting table that strained like a pack of hounds in leash  “and roll him in the snow”  as the mad riot swept past him and out of doors he signalled to the slaves and the four tottering old men supported him on his feet as he met the returning revellers upright glass in hand pledging them a toast to the short night when a man sleeps warm  it did not take long to settle the estate of klakeenah  tommy the little englishman clerk at the trading post was called in by elsoo to help  there was nothing but debts notes overdue mortgaged properties and properties mortgaged but worthless  notes and mortgages were held by porportuk  tommy called him a robber many times as he pondered the compounding of the interest  “is it a debt tommy” elsoo asked  “it is a robbery” tommy answered  “nevertheless it is a debt” she persisted  the winter wore away and the early spring and still the claims of porportuk remained unpaid  he saw elsoo often and explained to her at length as he had explained to her father the way the debt could be cancelled  also he brought with him old medicinemen who elaborated to her the everlasting damnation of her father if the debt were not paid one day after such an elaboration elsoo made final announcement to porportuk  “i shall tell you two things” she said  “first i shall not be your wife  will you remember that  second you shall be paid the last cent of the sixteen thousand dollars—”  “fifteen thousand nine hundred and sixtyseven dollars and seventyfive cents” porportuk corrected  “my father said sixteen thousand” was her reply  “you shall be paid”  “how”  “i know not how but i shall find out how  now go and bother me no more  if you do”—she hesitated to find fitting penalty—“if you do i shall have you rolled in the snow again as soon as the first snow flies”  this was still in the early spring and a little later elsoo surprised the country  word went up and down the yukon from chilcoot to the delta and was carried from camp to camp to the farthermost camps that in june when the first salmon ran elsoo daughter of klakeenah would sell herself at public auction to satisfy the claims of porportuk  vain were the attempts to dissuade her  the missionary at st george wrestled with her but she replied—  “only the debts to god are settled in the next world  the debts of men are of this world and in this world are they settled”  akoon wrestled with her but she replied “i do love thee akoon but honour is greater than love and who am i that i should blacken my father”  sister alberta journeyed all the way up from holy cross on the first steamer and to no better end  “my father wanders in the thick and endless forests” said elsoo  “and there will he wander with the lost souls crying till the debt be paid then and not until then may he go on to the house of the great father”  “and you believe this” sister alberta asked  “i do not know” elsoo made answer  “it was my father’s belief”  sister alberta shrugged her shoulders incredulously  “who knows but that the things we believe come true” elsoo went on “why not  the next world to you may be heaven and harps    because you have believed heaven and harps to my father the next world may be a large house where he will sit always at table feasting with god”  “and you” sister alberta asked  “what is your next world”  elsoo hesitated but for a moment  “i should like a little of both” she said  “i should like to see your face as well as the face of my father”  the day of the auction came  tananaw station was populous  as was their custom the tribes had gathered to await the salmonrun and in the meantime spent the time in dancing and frolicking trading and gossiping then there was the ordinary sprinkling of white adventurers traders and prospectors and in addition a large number of white men who had come because of curiosity or interest in the affair  it had been a backward spring and the salmon were late in running  this delay but keyed up the interest  then on the day of the auction the situation was made tense by akoon  he arose and made public and solemn announcement that whosoever bought elsoo would forthwith and immediately die  he flourished the winchester in his hand to indicate the manner of the takingoff  elsoo was angered thereat but he refused to speak with her and went to the trading post to lay in extra ammunition  the first salmon was caught at ten o’clock in the evening and at midnight the auction began  it took place on top of the high bank alongside the yukon  the sun was due north just below the horizon and the sky was lurid red  a great crowd gathered about the table and the two chairs that stood near the edge of the bank  to the fore were many white men and several chiefs  and most prominently to the fore rifle in hand stood akoon  tommy at elsoo’s request served as auctioneer but she made the opening speech and described the goods about to be sold she was in native costume in the dress of a chief’s daughter splendid and barbaric and she stood on a chair that she might be seen to advantage  “who will buy a wife” she asked  “look at me  i am twenty years old and a maid  i will be a good wife to the man who buys me  if he is a white man i shall dress in the fashion of white women if he is an indian i shall dress as”—she hesitated a moment—“a squaw  i can make my own clothes and sew and wash and mend  i was taught for eight years to do these things at holy cross mission  i can read and write english and i know how to play the organ  also i can do arithmetic and some algebra—a little  i shall be sold to the highest bidder and to him i will make out a bill of sale of myself  i forgot to say that i can sing very well and that i have never been sick in my life  i weigh one hundred and thirtytwo pounds my father is dead and i have no relatives who wants me”  she looked over the crowd with flaming audacity and stepped down  at tommy’s request she stood upon the chair again while he mounted the second chair and started the bidding  surrounding elsoo stood the four old slaves of her father  they were agetwisted and palsied faithful to their meat a generation out of the past that watched unmoved the antics of younger life  in the front of the crowd were several eldorado and bonanza kings from the upper yukon and beside them on crutches swollen with scurvy were two broken prospectors  from the midst of the crowd thrust out by its own vividness appeared the face of a wildeyed squaw from the remote regions of the upper tananaw a strayed sitkan from the coast stood side by side with a stick from lake le barge and beyond a halfdozen frenchcanadian voyageurs grouped by themselves  from afar came the faint cries of myriads of wildfowl on the nestinggrounds  swallows were skimming up overhead from the placid surface of the yukon and robins were singing  the oblique rays of the hidden sun shot through the smoke highdissipated from forest fires a thousand miles away and turned the heavens to sombre red while the earth shone red in the reflected glow  this red glow shone in the faces of all and made everything seem unearthly and unreal  the bidding began slowly  the sitkan who was a stranger in the land and who had arrived only half an hour before offered one hundred dollars in a confident voice and was surprised when akoon turned threateningly upon him with the rifle  the bidding dragged  an indian from the tozikakat a pilot bid one hundred and fifty and after some time a gambler who had been ordered out of the upper country raised the bid to two hundred elsoo was saddened her pride was hurt but the only effect was that she flamed more audaciously upon the crowd  there was a disturbance among the onlookers as porportuk forced his way to the front  “five hundred dollars” he bid in a loud voice then looked about him proudly to note the effect  he was minded to use his great wealth as a bludgeon with which to stun all competition at the start  but one of the voyageurs looking on elsoo with sparkling eyes raised the bid a hundred  “seven hundred” porportuk returned promptly  and with equal promptness came the “eight hundred” of the voyageur  then porportuk swung his club again  “twelve hundred” he shouted  with a look of poignant disappointment the voyageur succumbed  there was no further bidding  tommy worked hard but could not elicit a bid  elsoo spoke to porportuk  “it were good porportuk for you to weigh well your bid  have you forgotten the thing i told you—that i would never marry you”  “it is a public auction” he retorted  “i shall buy you with a bill of sale  i have offered twelve hundred dollars  you come cheap”  “too damned cheap” tommy cried  “what if i am auctioneer  that does not prevent me from bidding  i’ll make it thirteen hundred”  “fourteen hundred” from porportuk  “i’ll buy you in to be my—my sister” tommy whispered to elsoo then called aloud “fifteen hundred”  at two thousand one of the eldorado kings took a hand and tommy dropped out  a third time porportuk swung the club of his wealth making a clean raise of five hundred dollars  but the eldorado king’s pride was touched  no man could club him  and he swung back another five hundred  elsoo stood at three thousand  porportuk made it thirtyfive hundred and gasped when the eldorado king raised it a thousand dollars porportuk again raised it five hundred and again gasped when the king raised a thousand more  porportuk became angry  his pride was touched his strength was challenged and with him strength took the form of wealth  he would not be ashamed for weakness before the world  elsoo became incidental  the savings and scrimpings from the cold nights of all his years were ripe to be squandered  elsoo stood at six thousand  he made it seven thousand and then in thousanddollar bids as fast as they could be uttered her price went up  at fourteen thousand the two men stopped for breath  then the unexpected happened  a still heavier club was swung  in the pause that ensued the gambler who had scented a speculation and formed a syndicate with several of his fellows bid sixteen thousand dollars  “seventeen thousand” porportuk said weakly  “eighteen thousand” said the king  porportuk gathered his strength  “twenty thousand”  the syndicate dropped out  the eldorado king raised a thousand and porportuk raised back and as they bid akoon turned from one to the other half menacingly half curiously as though to see what manner of man it was that he would have to kill  when the king prepared to make his next bid akoon having pressed closer the king first loosed the revolver at his hip then said  “twentythree thousand”  “twentyfour thousand” said porportuk  he grinned viciously for the certitude of his bidding had at last shaken the king  the latter moved over close to elsoo  he studied her carefully for a long while  “and five hundred” he said at last  “twentyfive thousand” came porportuk’s raise  the king looked for a long space and shook his head  he looked again and said reluctantly “and five hundred”  “twentysix thousand” porportuk snapped  the king shook his head and refused to meet tommy’s pleading eye  in the meantime akoon had edged close to porportuk  elsoo’s quick eye noted this and while tommy wrestled with the eldorado king for another bid she bent and spoke in a low voice in the ear of a slave  and while tommy’s “going—going—going—” dominated the air the slave went up to akoon and spoke in a low voice in his ear  akoon made no sign that he had heard though elsoo watched him anxiously  “gone” tommy’s voice rang out  “to porportuk for twentysix thousand dollars”  porportuk glanced uneasily at akoon  all eyes were centred upon akoon but he did nothing  “let the scales be brought” said elsoo  “i shall make payment at my house” said porportuk  “let the scales be brought” elsoo repeated  “payment shall be made here where all can see”  so the gold scales were brought from the trading post while porportuk went away and came back with a man at his heels on whose shoulders was a weight of golddust in moosehide sacks  also at porportuk’s back walked another man with a rifle who had eyes only for akoon  “here are the notes and mortgages” said porportuk “for fifteen thousand nine hundred and sixtyseven dollars and seventyfive cents”  elsoo received them into her hands and said to tommy “let them be reckoned as sixteen thousand”  “there remains ten thousand dollars to be paid in gold” tommy said  porportuk nodded and untied the mouths of the sacks  elsoo standing at the edge of the bank tore the papers to shreds and sent them fluttering out over the yukon  the weighing began but halted  “of course at seventeen dollars” porportuk had said to tommy as he adjusted the scales  “at sixteen dollars” elsoo said sharply  “it is the custom of all the land to reckon gold at seventeen dollars for each ounce” porportuk replied  “and this is a business transaction”  elsoo laughed  “it is a new custom” she said  “it began this spring last year and the years before it was sixteen dollars an ounce  when my father’s debt was made it was sixteen dollars  when he spent at the store the money he got from you for one ounce he was given sixteen dollars’ worth of flour not seventeen  wherefore shall you pay for me at sixteen and not at seventeen”  porportuk grunted and allowed the weighing to proceed  “weigh it in three piles tommy” she said  “a thousand dollars here three thousand here and here six thousand”  it was slow work and while the weighing went on akoon was closely watched by all  “he but waits till the money is paid” one said and the word went around and was accepted and they waited for what akoon should do when the money was paid  and porportuk’s man with the rifle waited and watched akoon  the weighing was finished and the golddust lay on the table in three darkyellow heaps  “there is a debt of my father to the company for three thousand dollars” said elsoo  “take it tommy for the company and here are four old men tommy  you know them  and here is one thousand dollars  take it and see that the old men are never hungry and never without tobacco”  tommy scooped the gold into separate sacks  six thousand dollars remained on the table  elsoo thrust the scoop into the heap and with a sudden turn whirled the contents out and down to the yukon in a golden shower  porportuk seized her wrist as she thrust the scoop a second time into the heap  “it is mine” she said calmly  porportuk released his grip but he gritted his teeth and scowled darkly as she continued to scoop the gold into the river till none was left  the crowd had eyes for naught but akoon and the rifle of porportuk’s man lay across the hollow of his arm the muzzle directed at akoon a yard away the man’s thumb on the hammer  but akoon did nothing  “make out the bill of sale” porportuk said grimly  and tommy made out the till of sale wherein all right and title in the woman elsoo was vested in the man porportuk  elsoo signed the document and porportuk folded it and put it away in his pouch  suddenly his eyes flashed and in sudden speech he addressed elsoo  “but it was not your father’s debt” he said “what i paid was the price for you  your sale is business of today and not of last year and the years before  the ounces paid for you will buy at the post today seventeen dollars of flour and not sixteen  i have lost a dollar on each ounce  i have lost six hundred and twentyfive dollars”  elsoo thought for a moment and saw the error she had made  she smiled and then she laughed  “you are right” she laughed “i made a mistake  but it is too late you have paid and the gold is gone  you did not think quick  it is your loss  your wit is slow these days porportuk  you are getting old”  he did not answer  he glanced uneasily at akoon and was reassured  his lips tightened and a hint of cruelty came into his face  “come” he said “we will go to my house”  “do you remember the two things i told you in the spring” elsoo asked making no movement to accompany him  “my head would be full with the things women say did i heed them” he answered  “i told you that you would be paid” elsoo went on carefully  “and i told you that i would never be your wife”  “but that was before the bill of sale”  porportuk crackled the paper between his fingers inside the pouch  “i have bought you before all the world  you belong to me  you will not deny that you belong to me”  “i belong to you” elsoo said steadily  “i own you”  “you own me”  porportuk’s voice rose slightly and triumphantly  “as a dog i own you”  “as a dog you own me” elsoo continued calmly  “but porportuk you forget the thing i told you  had any other man bought me i should have been that man’s wife  i should have been a good wife to that man  such was my will  but my will with you was that i should never be your wife wherefore i am your dog”  porportuk knew that he played with fire and he resolved to play firmly “then i speak to you not as elsoo but as a dog” he said “and i tell you to come with me”  he half reached to grip her arm but with a gesture she held him back  “not so fast porportuk  you buy a dog  the dog runs away  it is your loss  i am your dog  what if i run away”  “as the owner of the dog i shall beat you—”  “when you catch me”  “when i catch you”  “then catch me”  he reached swiftly for her but she eluded him  she laughed as she circled around the table  “catch her” porportuk commanded the indian with the rifle who stood near to her  but as the indian stretched forth his arm to her the eldorado king felled him with a fist blow under the ear  the rifle clattered to the ground  then was akoon’s chance  his eyes glittered but he did nothing  porportuk was an old man but his cold nights retained for him his activity  he did not circle the table  he came across suddenly over the top of the table  elsoo was taken off her guard  she sprang back with a sharp cry of alarm and porportuk would have caught her had it not been for tommy  tommy’s leg went out porportuk tripped and pitched forward on the ground  elsoo got her start  “then catch me” she laughed over her shoulder as she fled away  she ran lightly and easily but porportuk ran swiftly and savagely  he outran her  in his youth he had been swiftest of all the young men  but elsoo dodged in a willowy elusive way  being in native dress her feet were not cluttered with skirts and her pliant body curved a flight that defied the gripping fingers of porportuk  with laughter and tumult the great crowd scattered out to see the chase it led through the indian encampment and ever dodging circling and reversing elsoo and porportuk appeared and disappeared among the tents elsoo seemed to balance herself against the air with her arms now one side now on the other and sometimes her body too leaned out upon the air far from the perpendicular as she achieved her sharpest curves  and porportuk always a leap behind or a leap this side or that like a lean hound strained after her  they crossed the open ground beyond the encampment and disappeared in the forest  tananaw station waited their reappearance and long and vainly it waited  in the meantime akoon ate and slept and lingered much at the steamboat landing deaf to the rising resentment of tananaw station in that he did nothing  twentyfour hours later porportuk returned  he was tired and savage  he spoke to no one but akoon and with him tried to pick a quarrel  but akoon shrugged his shoulders and walked away  porportuk did not waste time  he outfitted half a dozen of the young men selecting the best trackers and travellers and at their head plunged into the forest  next day the steamer seattle bound up river pulled in to the shore and wooded up  when the lines were cast off and she churned out from the bank akoon was on board in the pilothouse  not many hours afterward when it was his turn at the wheel he saw a small birchbark canoe put off from the shore  there was only one person in it  he studied it carefully put the wheel over and slowed down  the captain entered the pilothouse  “what’s the matter” he demanded “the water’s good”  akoon grunted  he saw a larger canoe leaving the bank and in it were a number of persons  as the seattle lost headway he put the wheel over some more  the captain fumed  “it’s only a squaw” he protested  akoon did not grunt  he was all eyes for the squaw and the pursuing canoe  in the latter six paddles were flashing while the squaw paddled slowly  “you’ll be aground” the captain protested seizing the wheel  but akoon countered his strength on the wheel and looked him in the eyes the captain slowly released the spokes  “queer beggar” he sniffed to himself  akoon held the seattle on the edge of the shoal water and waited till he saw the squaw’s fingers clutch the forward rail  then he signalled for full speed ahead and ground the wheel over  the large canoe was very near but the gap between it and the steamer was widening  the squaw laughed and leaned over the rail  “then catch me porportuk” she cried  akoon left the steamer at fort yukon  he outfitted a small polingboat and went up the porcupine river  and with him went elsoo  it was a weary journey and the way led across the backbone of the world but akoon had travelled it before  when they came to the headwaters of the porcupine they left the boat and went on foot across the rocky mountains  akoon greatly liked to walk behind elsoo and watch the movements of her there was a music in it that he loved  and especially he loved the wellrounded calves in their sheaths of softtanned leather the slim ankles and the small moccasined feet that were tireless through the longest days  “you are light as air” he said looking up at her  “it is no labour for you to walk  you almost float so lightly do your feet rise and fall you are like a deer elsoo you are like a deer and your eyes are like deer’s eyes sometimes when you look at me or when you hear a quick sound and wonder if it be danger that stirs  your eyes are like a deer’s eyes now as you look at me”  and elsoo luminous and melting bent and kissed akoon  “when we reach the mackenzie we will not delay” akoon said later  “we will go south before the winter catches us  we will go to the sunlands where there is no snow  but we will return  i have seen much of the world and there is no land like alaska no sun like our sun and the snow is good after the long summer”  “and you will learn to read” said elsoo  and akoon said “i will surely learn to read”  but there was delay when they reached the mackenzie  they fell in with a band of mackenzie indians and hunting akoon was shot by accident  the rifle was in the hands of a youth  the bullet broke akoon’s right arm and ranging farther broke two of his ribs  akoon knew rough surgery while elsoo had learned some refinements at holy cross  the bones were finally set and akoon lay by the fire for them to knit  also he lay by the fire so that the smoke would keep the mosquitoes away  then it was that porportuk with his six young men arrived  akoon groaned in his helplessness and made appeal to the mackenzies  but porportuk made demand and the mackenzies were perplexed  porportuk was for seizing upon elsoo but this they would not permit  judgment must be given and as it was an affair of man and woman the council of the old men was called—this that warm judgment might not be given by the young men who were warm of heart  the old men sat in a circle about the smudgefire  their faces were lean and wrinkled and they gasped and panted for air  the smoke was not good for them  occasionally they struck with withered hands at the mosquitoes that braved the smoke  after such exertion they coughed hollowly and painfully  some spat blood and one of them sat a bit apart with head bowed forward and bled slowly and continuously at the mouth the coughing sickness had gripped them  they were as dead men their time was short  it was a judgment of the dead  “and i paid for her a heavy price” porportuk concluded his complaint “such a price you have never seen  sell all that is yours—sell your spears and arrows and rifles sell your skins and furs sell your tents and boats and dogs sell everything and you will not have maybe a thousand dollars  yet did i pay for the woman elsoo twentysix times the price of all your spears and arrows and rifles your skins and furs your tents and boats and dogs  it was a heavy price”  the old men nodded gravely though their weazened eyeslits widened with wonder that any woman should be worth such a price  the one that bled at the mouth wiped his lips  “is it true talk” he asked each of porportuk’s six young men  and each answered that it was true  “is it true talk” he asked elsoo and she answered “it is true”  “but porportuk has not told that he is an old man” akoon said “and that he has daughters older than elsoo”  “it is true porportuk is an old man” said elsoo  “it is for porportuk to measure the strength his age” said he who bled at the mouth  “we be old men  behold  age is never so old as youth would measure it”  and the circle of old men champed their gums and nodded approvingly and coughed  “i told him that i would never be his wife” said elsoo  “yet you took from him twentysix times all that we possess” asked a oneeyed old man  elsoo was silent  “it is true”  and his one eye burned and bored into her like a fiery gimlet  “it is true” she said  “but i will run away again” she broke out passionately a moment later “always will i run away”  “that is for porportuk to consider” said another of the old men  “it is for us to consider the judgment”  “what price did you pay for her” was demanded of akoon  “no price did i pay for her” he answered  “she was above price  i did not measure her in golddust nor in dogs and tents and furs”  the old men debated among themselves and mumbled in undertones  “these old men are ice” akoon said in english  “i will not listen to their judgment porportuk  if you take elsoo i will surely kill you”  the old men ceased and regarded him suspiciously  “we do not know the speech you make” one said  “he but said that he would kill me” porportuk volunteered  “so it were well to take from him his rifle and to have some of your young men sit by him that he may not do me hurt  he is a young man and what are broken bones to youth”  akoon lying helpless had rifle and knife taken from him and to either side of his shoulders sat young men of the mackenzies  the oneeyed old man arose and stood upright  “we marvel at the price paid for one mere woman” he began “but the wisdom of the price is no concern of ours  we are here to give judgment and judgment we give  we have no doubt  it is known to all that porportuk paid a heavy price for the woman elsoo wherefore does the woman elsoo belong to porportuk and none other”  he sat down heavily and coughed  the old men nodded and coughed  “i will kill you” akoon cried in english  porportuk smiled and stood up  “you have given true judgment” he said to the council “and my young men will give to you much tobacco  now let the woman be brought to me”  akoon gritted his teeth  the young men took elsoo by the arms  she did not resist and was led her face a sullen flame to porportuk  “sit there at my feet till i have made my talk” he commanded  he paused a moment  “it is true” he said “i am an old man  yet can i understand the ways of youth  the fire has not all gone out of me  yet am i no longer young nor am i minded to run these old legs of mine through all the years that remain to me  elsoo can run fast and well  she is a deer  this i know for i have seen and run after her  it is not good that a wife should run so fast  i paid for her a heavy price yet does she run away from me  akoon paid no price at all yet does she run to him  “when i came among you people of the mackenzie i was of one mind  as i listened in the council and thought of the swift legs of elsoo i was of many minds  now am i of one mind again but it is a different mind from the one i brought to the council  let me tell you my mind  when a dog runs once away from a master it will run away again  no matter how many times it is brought back each time it will run away again  when we have such dogs we sell them  elsoo is like a dog that runs away  i will sell her  is there any man of the council that will buy”  the old men coughed and remained silent  “akoon would buy” porportuk went on “but he has no money  wherefore i will give elsoo to him as he said without price  even now will i give her to him”  reaching down he took elsoo by the hand and led her across the space to where akoon lay on his back  “she has a bad habit akoon” he said seating her at akoon’s feet  “as she has run away from me in the past in the days to come she may run away from you  but there is no need to fear that she will ever run away akoon  i shall see to that  never will she run away from you—this is the word of porportuk  she has great wit  i know for often has it bitten into me  yet am i minded myself to give my wit play for once and by my wit will i secure her to you akoon”  stooping porportuk crossed elsoo’s feet so that the instep of one lay over that of the other and then before his purpose could be divined he discharged his rifle through the two ankles  as akoon struggled to rise against the weight of the young men there was heard the crunch of the broken bone rebroken  “it is just” said the old men one to another  elsoo made no sound  she sat and looked at her shattered ankles on which she would never walk again  “my legs are strong elsoo” akoon said  “but never will they bear me away from you”  elsoo looked at him and for the first time in all the time he had known her akoon saw tears in her eyes  “your eyes are like deer’s eyes elsoo” he said  “is it just” porportuk asked and grinned from the edge of the smoke as he prepared to depart  “it is just” the old men said  and they sat on in the silence
