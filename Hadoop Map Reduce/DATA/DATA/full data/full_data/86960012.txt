86960012	the cinema murder  by e phillips oppenheim  1917     book i    chapter i  with a somewhat prolonged grinding of the brakes and an unnecessary amount of fuss in the way of letting off steam the afternoon train from london came to a standstill in the station at detton magna an elderly porter putting on his coat as he came issued with the dogged aid of one bound by custom to perform a hopeless mission from the small redbrick lamp room the station master occupying a position of vantage in front of the shed which enclosed the booking office looked up and down the lifeless row of closed and streaming windows with an expectancy dulled by daily disappointment for the passengers who seldom alighted on this occasion no records were broken a solitary young man stepped out on to the wet and flinty platform handed over the half of a thirdclass return ticket from london passed through the two open doors and commenced to climb the long ascent which led into the town  he wore no overcoat and for protection against the inclement weather he was able only to turn up the collar of his wellworn blue serge coat the damp of a ceaselessly wet day seemed to have laid its cheerless pall upon the whole exceedingly ugly landscape the hedges blackened with smuts from the colliery on the other side of the slope were dripping also with raindrops the road flinty and light grey in colour was greasy with repellentlooking mudthere were puddles even in the asphaltcovered pathway which he trod on either side of him stretched the shrunken unpastorallooking fields of an industrial neighbourhood the townvillage which stretched up the hillside before him presented scarcely a single redeeming feature the small grey stone houses hard and unadorned were interrupted at intervals by rows of brandnew redbrick cottages in the background were the tall chimneys of several factories on the left a colliery shaft raised its smokeblackened finger to the lowering clouds  after his first glance around at these familiar and unlovely objects philip romilly walked with his head a little thrown back his eyes lifted as though with intent to the melancholy and watery skies he was a young man well above medium height slim almost inclined to be angular yet with a good carriage notwithstanding a stoop which seemed more the result of an habitual depression than occasioned by any physical weakness his features were large his mouth querulous a little discontented his eyes filled with the light of a silent and rebellious bitterness which seemed somehow to have found a more or less permanent abode in his face his clothes although they were neat had seen better days he was ungloved and he carried under his arm a small parcel which appeared to contain a book carefully done up in brown paper  as he reached the outskirts of the village he slackened his pace standing a little way back from the road from which they were separated by an ugly gravelled playground were the familiar school buildings with the usual inscription carved in stone above the door he laid his hand upon the wooden gate and paused from inside he could catch the drone of childrens voices he glanced at his watch it was barely twenty minutes past four for a moment he hesitated then he strolled on and turning at the gate of an adjoining cottage the nearest to the schools of a little unlovely row he tried the latch found it yield to his touch and stepped inside he closed the door behind him and turned with a little weary sigh of content towards a large easychair drawn up in front of the fire for a single moment he seemed about to throw himself into its depthshis long fingers indeed a little blue with the cold seemed already on their way towards the genial warmth of the flames then he stopped short he stood perfectly still in an attitude of arrested motion his eyes wonderingly at first and then with a strange unanalysable expression seeming to embark upon a lengthened a scrupulous an almost horrified estimate of his surroundings  to the ordinary observer there would have been nothing remarkable in the appearance of the little room save its entirely unexpected air of luxury and refinement there was a small chippendale sideboard against the wall a round gatelegged table on which stood a blue china bowl filled with pink roses a couple of luxurious easychairs some old prints upon the wall on the sideboard was a basket as yet unpacked filled with hothouse fruit and on a low settee by the side of one of the easychairs were a little pile of reviews several volumes of poetry and a couple of library books in the centre of the mantelpiece was a photograph the photograph of a man a little older perhaps than this newlyarrived visitor with rounder face dressed in country tweeds a flower in his buttonhole the picture of a prosperous man yet with a curious almost disturbing likeness to the pale overnervous looseframed youth whose eye had been attracted by its presence and who was gazing at it spellbound  douglas he muttered douglas  he flung his hat upon the table and for a moment his hand rested upon his forehead he was confronted with a mystery which baffled him a mystery whose sinister possibilities were slowly framing themselves in his mind while he stood there he was suddenly conscious of the sound of the opening gate brisk footsteps up the tiled way the soft swirl of a womans skirt the latch was raised the door opened and closed the newcomer stood upon the threshold gazing at him  philip she exclaimed why philip  there was a curious change in the girls tone from almost glad welcome to a note of abrupt fear in that last pronouncement of his name she stood looking at him the victim apparently of so many emotions that there was nothing definite to be drawn either from her tone or expression she was a young woman of medium height and slim delicate figure attractive with large discontented mouth full clear eyes and a wealth of dark brown hair she was very simply dressed and yet in a manner which scarcely suggested the schoolteacher to the man who confronted her his left hand gripping the mantelpiece his eyes filled with a flaming jealousy there was something entirely new in the hang of her wellcut skirt the soft colouring of her lownecked blouse the greater animation of her piquant face with its somewhat dazzling complexion his hand flashed out towards her as he asked his question  what does it mean beatrice  she showed signs of recovering herself with a little shrug of the shoulders she turned towards the door which led into an inner room  let me get you some tea philip she begged you look so cold and wet  stay here please he insisted  she paused reluctantly there was a curious lack of anything peremptory in his manner yet somehow although she would have given the world to have passed for a few moments into the shelter of the little kitchen beyond she was impelled to do as he bade her  dont be silly philip she said petulantly you know you want some tea and so do i sit down please and make yourself comfortable why didnt you let me know you were coming  perhaps it would have been better he agreed quietly however since i am here answer my question  she drew a little breath after all although she was lacking in any real strength of character she was filled with a certain compensatory doggedness his challenge was there to be faced there was no way out of it she would have lied willingly enough but for the sheer futility of falsehood she commenced the task of bracing herself for the struggle  you had better she said frame your question a little more exactly i will then try to answer it  he was stung by her altered demeanour embarrassed by an avalanche of words a hundred questions were burning upon his lips it was by a great effort of selfcontrol that he remained coherent  the last time i visited you he began was three months ago your cottage then was furnished as one would expect it to be furnished you had a deal dresser a deal table one rather hard easychair and a very old wicker one you had if i remember rightly a strip of linoleum upon the floor and a single rug your flowers were from the hedges and your fruit from the one apple tree in the garden behind your clothesam i mistaken about your clothes or are you dressed more expensively  i am dressed more expensively she admitted  you and i both know the value of these things he went on with a little sweep of the hand we know the value of them because we were once accustomed to them because we have both since experienced the passionate craving for them or the things they represent chippendale furniture a turkey carpet roses in january hothouse fruit bartolozzi prints do not march with an income of fifty pounds a year  they do not she assented equably all the things which you see here and which you have mentioned are presents  his forefinger shot out with a sudden vigour towards the photograph  from him  from douglas she admitted from your cousin  he took the photograph into his hand looked at it for a moment and dashed it into the grate the glass of the frame was shivered into a hundred pieces the girl only shrugged her shoulders she was holding herself in reserve as for him his eyes were hot there was a dry choking in his throat he had passed through many weary and depressed days struggling always against the grinding monotony of life and his surroundings now for the first time he felt that there was something worse  what does it mean he asked once more  she seemed almost to dilate as she answered him her feet were firmly planted upon the ground there was a new look in her face a look of decision she was more or less a coward but she felt no fear she even leaned a little towards him and looked him in the face  it means she pronounced slowly exactly what it seems to mean  the words conveyed horrible things to him but he was speechless he could only wait  you and i philip she continued have beenwell i suppose we should call it engagedfor three years during those three years i have earned by disgusting and wearisome labour just enough to keep me alive in a world which has had nothing to offer me but ugliness and discomfort and misery you as you admitted last time we met have done no better you have lived in a garret and gone often hungry to bed for three years this has been going on all that time i have waited for you to bring something human something reasonable something warm into my life and you have failed i have passed in those three years from twentythree to twentysix in three more i shall be in my thirtieth yearthat is to say the best time of my life will have passed you see i have been thinking and i have had enough  he stood quite dumb the girls newlyrevealed personality seemed to fill the room he felt crowded out she was at that stage absolutely mistress of the situation she passed him carelessly by flung herself into the easychair and crossed her legs as though he were looking at some person in another world he realized that she was wearing shoes of shapely cut and silk stockings  our engagement she went on was at first the dearest thing in life to me it could have been the most wonderful thing in life i am only an ordinary person with an ordinary character but i have the capacity to love unselfishly and i am at heart as faithful and as good as any other woman but there is my birthright i have had three years of sordid and utterly miserable life teaching squalid dirty unlovable children things they had much better not know i have lived here here in detton magna among the smuts and the mists where the flowers seem withered and even the meadows are stony where the people are hard and coarse as their ugly houses where virtue is ugly and vice is ugly and living is ugly and death is fearsome and now you see what i have chosennot in a moments folly mind because i am not foolish not in a moments passion either because until now the only real feeling i have had in life was for you but i have chosen and i hold to my choice  they wont let you stay here he muttered  they neednt she answered calmly there are other ways in which i can at least earn as much as the miserable pittance doled out to me here i have avoided even considering them before shall i tell you why because i didnt want to face the temptation they might bring with them i always knew what would happen if escape became hopeless its the ugliness i cant standthe ugliness of cheap food cheap clothes uncomfortable furniture coarse voices coarse friends if i would have them how do you suppose i have lived here these last three years a teacher in the national schools look up and down this long dreary street at the names above the shops at the villas in which the tradespeople live and ask yourself where my friends were to come from the clergyman perhaps he is over seventy a widower and he never comes near the place why id have been content to have been patronized if there had been anyone here to do it who wore the right sort of clothes and said the right sort of thing in the right tone but the otherswell thats done with  he remained curiously dumb his eyes were fixed upon the fragments of the photograph in the grate in a corner of the room an oldfashioned clock ticked wheezily a lump of coal fell out on the hearth which she replaced mechanically with her foot his silence seemed to irritate and perplex her she looked away from him drew her chair a little closer to the fire and sat with her head resting upon her hands her tone had become almost meditative  i knew that this would come one day she went on why dont you speak and get it over are you waiting to clothe your phrases are you afraid of the naked words im not let me hear them dont be more melodramatic than you can help because as you know i am cursed with a sense of humour but dont stand there saying nothing  he raised his eyes and looked at her in silence an alternative which she found it hard to endure then after a moments shivering recoil into her chair she sprang to her feet  listen she cried passionately i dont care what you think i tell you that if you were really a man if you had a mans heart in your body youd have sinned yourself before nowrobbed some one murdered them torn the things that make life from the fate that refuses to give them what is it they pay you she went on contemptuously at that miserable art school of yours sixty pounds a year how much do you get to eat and drink out of that what sort of clothes have you to wear are you content yet even you have been better off than i you have always your chance your play may be accepted or your stories published i havent even had that forlorn hope but even you philip may wait too long there are too many laws nowadays for life to be lived naturally if i were a man a man like you id break them  her taunts apparently moved him no more than the inner tragedy which her words had revealed he did not for one moment give any sign of abandoning the unnatural calm which seemed to have descended upon him he took up his hat from the table and thrust the little brown paper parcel which he had been carrying into his pocket his eyes for a single moment met the challenge of hers and again she was conscious of some nameless inexplicable fear  perhaps he said as he turned away i may do that  his hand was upon the latch before she realized that he was actually going she sprang to her feet abuse scorn upbraidings even violenceshe had been prepared for all of these there was something about this selfrestraint however this strange brooding silence which terrified her more than anything she could have imagined  philip she shrieked youre not going youre not going like this you havent said anything  he closed the door with firm fingers her knees trembled she was conscious of an unexpected weakness she abandoned her first intention of following him and stood before the window holding tightly to the sash he had reached the gate now and paused for a moment looking up the long windy street then he crossed to the other side of the road stepped over a stile and disappeared walking without haste with firm footsteps along a cindered path which bordered the sluggishlooking canal he had come and gone and she knew what fear was    chapter ii  the railway station at detton magna presented if possible an even more dreary appearance than earlier in the day as the time drew near that night for the departure of the last train northwards its long strip of flinty platform was utterly deserted around the three flickering gaslamps the drizzling rain fell continuously the weary porter came yawning out of his lamp room into the booking office where the station master sat alone his chair turned away from the open wicket window to the smouldering embers of the smoky fire  no passengers tonight seemingly the latter remarked to his subordinate  not a sign of one was the reply that young chap who came down from london on a oneday return excursion hasnt gone back either thatll do his ticket in  the outside door was suddenly opened and closed the sound of footsteps approaching the ticket window was heard a long white hand was thrust through the aperture a voice was heard from the invisible outside  third to detton junction please  the stationmaster took the ticket from a little rack received the exact sum he demanded swept it into the till and resumed his place before the fire the porter with the lamp in his hand lounged out into the bookinghall the prospective passenger however was nowhere in sight he looked back into the office  was that jim spender going up to see his barmaid again he asked his superior  the station master yawned drowsily  didnt notice he answered what an old woman youre getting george want to know everybodys business dont you  the porter withdrew a little huffed when a few minutes later the train drew in he even avoided ostentatiously a journey to the far end of the platform to open the door for the solitary passenger who was standing there he passed up the train and slammed the door without even glancing in at the window then he stood and watched the red lights disappear  was it jim the station master asked him on their way out  didnt notice his subordinate replied a little curtly maybe it was and maybe it wasnt good night                                       philip romilly sat back in the corner of his empty thirdclass carriage peering out of the window in which he could see only the reflection of the feeble gaslamp there was no doubt about it howeverthey were moving the first stage of his journey had commenced the blessed sense of motion after so long waiting at first soothed and then exhilarated him in a few moments he became restless he let down the rainblurred window and leaned out the cool dampness of the night was immensely refreshing the rain softened his hot cheeks he sat there peering away into the shadows struggling for the sight of definite objectsa tree a house the outline of a fieldanything to keep the other thoughts away the thoughts that came sometimes like the aftermath of a grisly unrealisable nightmare then he felt chilly drew up the window thrust his hands into his pockets from which he drew out a handsome cigarette case struck a match and smoked with vivid appreciation of the quality of the tobacco examined the crest on the case as he put it away and finally patted with surreptitious eagerness the flat morocco letter case in his inside pocket  at the junction he made his way into the refreshment room and ordered a long whisky and soda which he drank in a couple of gulps then he hastened to the booking office and took a firstclass ticket to liverpool and a few minutes later secured a seat in the long northbound express which came gliding up to the side of the platform he spent some time in the lavatory washing arranging his hair straightening his tie after which he made his way into the elaborate diningcar and found a comfortable corner seat the luxury of his surroundings soothed his jagged nerves the car was comfortably warmed the electric light upon his table was softly shaded the steward who waited upon him was swiftfooted and obsequious and seemed entirely oblivious of philips shabby halfsoaked clothes he ordered champagne a little vaguely and the wine ran through his veins with a curious potency he ate and drank now and then mechanically now and then with the keenest appetite afterwards he smoked a cigar drank coffee and sipped a liqueur with the appreciation of a connoisseur a fellow passenger passed him an evening paper which he glanced through with apparent interest before he reached his journeys end he had ordered and drunk another liqueur he tipped the steward handsomely it was the first wellcooked meal which he had eaten for many months  arrived at liverpool he entered a cab and drove to the adelphi hotel he made his way at once to the office his clothes were dry now and the rest and warmth had given him more confidence  you have a room engaged for me i think he said mr douglas romilly i sent some luggage on  the man merely glanced at him and handed him a ticket  number sixtyseven sir on the second floor he announced  a porter conducted him upstairs into a large wellfurnished bedroom a fire was blazing in the grate a dressingcase a steamer trunk and a hatbox were set out at the foot of the bedstead  the heavier luggage labelled for the hold sir the man told him is downstairs and will go direct to the steamer tomorrow morning that was according to your instructions i believe  quite right philip assented what time does the boat sail  three oclock sir  philip frowned this was his first disappointment he had fancied himself on board early in the day the prospect of a long mornings inaction seemed already to terrify him  not till the afternoon he muttered  matter of tide sir the man explained you can go on board any time after eleven oclock in the morning though very much obliged to you sir  the porter withdrew entirely satisfied with his tip philip romilly locked the door after him carefully then he drew a bunch of keys from his pocket and after several attempts opened both the steamer trunk and the dressingcase he surveyed their carefully packed contents with a certain grim and fantastic amusement handled the silver brushes shook out a purple brocaded dressinggown laid out a suit of clothes for the morrow even selected a shirt and put the links in it finally he wandered into the adjoining bathroom took a hot bath packed away at the bottom of the steamer trunk the clothes which he had been wearing went to bedand slept    chapter iii  the sun was shining into his bedroom when philip romilly was awakened the next morning by a discreet tapping at the door he sat up in bed and shouted come in he had no occasion to hesitate for a moment he knew perfectly well where he was he remembered exactly everything that had happened the knocking at the door was disquieting but he faced it without a tremor the floor waiter appeared and bowed deferentially  there is a gentleman on the telephone wishes to speak to you sir he announced i have connected him with the instrument by your side  to speak with me philip repeated are you quite sure  yes sir mr douglas romilly he asked for he said that his name was mr gayes i believe  the man left the room and philip took up the receiver for a moment he sat and thought the situation was perplexing in a sense ominous yet it had to be faced he held the instrument to his ear  hullo whos that he enquired  that mr romilly was the reply in a mans pleasant voice mr douglas romilly  yes  good im gayesmr gayes of gayes brothers my people wrote me last night from leicester that you would be here this morning you are crossing arent you on the elletania  philip remained monosyllabic  yes he admitted cautiously  cant you come round and see us this morning mr gayes invited and look here mr romilly in any case i want you to lunch with me at the club my car shall come round and fetch you at any time you say  sorry philip replied i am very busy this morning and i am engaged for lunch  oh come thats too bad the other protested i really want to have a chat with you on business matters mr romilly will you spare me half an hour if i come round  tell me exactly what it is you want philip insisted  oh just the usual thing was the cheerful answer we hear you are off to america on a buying tour our last advices dont indicate a very easy market over there i am not at all sure that we couldnt do better for you here and give you better terms  philip began to feel more sure of himself the situation after all he realized was not exactly alarming  very kind of you he said my arrangements are all made now though and i cant interfere with them  well im going to bother you with a few quotations anyway see here ill just run round to see you my car is waiting at the door now i wont keep you more than a few minutes  dont come before twelve philip begged i shall be busy until then  at twelve oclock precisely then was the reply i shall hope to induce you to change your mind about luncheon its quite a long time since we had you at the club goodby  philip set down the telephone he was still in his pajamas and the morning was cold but he suddenly felt a great drop of perspiration on his forehead it was the sort of thing this which he had expectedhad been prepared for in factbut it was none the less in its way gruesome there was a further knock at the door and the waiter reappeared  can i bring you any breakfast sir he enquired  what time is it  halfpast nine sir  bring me some coffee and rolls and butter philip ordered  he sprang out of bed bathed dressed and ate his breakfast then he lit a cigarette repacked his dressingcase and descended into the hall he made his way to the hall porters enquiry office  i am going to pay some calls in the city he announcedmr romilly is my nameand i may not be able to get back here before my boat sails i am going on the elletania can i have my luggage sent there direct  by all means sir  every article is properly labelled philip continued those in my bedroomnumber sixtysevenare for the cabin and those you have in your charge are for the hold  that will be quite all right sir the man assured him pocketing his liberal tip i will see to the matter myself  philip paid his bill at the office and breathed a little more freely as he left the hotel passing a large plateglass window he stopped suddenly and stared at his own reflection there was something unfamiliar in the hang of his wellcut clothes and fashionable homburg hat it was like the shadow of some one else passingsome one to whom those clothes belonged then he remembered remembered with a cold shiver which blanched his cheeks and brought a little agonised murmur to his lips the moment passed however crushed down stifled as he had sworn that he would stifle all such memories he turned in at a barbers shop had his hair cut and yielded to the solicitations of a fluffyhaired young lady who was dying to go to america if only somebody would take her and who was sure that he ought to have a manicure before his voyage afterwards he entered a call office and rang up the hotel on the telephone  mr romilly speaking he announced will you kindly tell mr gayes if he calls to see me that i have been detained in the city and shall not be back  the man took down the message philip strolled out once more into the streets wandering aimlessly about for an hour or more by this time it was nearly one oclock and selecting a restaurant he entered and ordered luncheon once more it came over him as he looked around the place that he had after all only a very imperfect hold upon his own identity it seemed impossible that he philip romilly should be there ordering precisely what appealed to him most without thought or care of the cost he ate and drank slowly and with discrimination and when he left the place he felt stronger he sought out a firstclass tobacconists bought some cigarettes and enquired his way to the dock at a few minutes after two he passed up the gangway and boarded the great steamer one of the little army of linencoated stewards enquired the number of his room and conducted him below  anything i can do for you sir before your luggage comes on the man asked civilly  philip shook his head and wandered up on deck again where there were already a fair number of passengers in evidence he leaned over the side watching the constant stream of porters bearing supplies and the steerage passengers passing into the forepart of the ship with every moment his impatience grew he looked at his watch sometimes half a dozen times in ten minutes changed his position continually started violently whenever he heard an unexpected footstep behind him finally he broke a promise he had made to himself he bought newspapers took them into a sheltered corner and tore them open column by column he searched them through feverishly running his finger down one side and up the next it seemed impossible to find nowhere the heading he dreaded to see to realize that they were entirely empty of any exciting incident he satisfied himself at last however the disappearance of a halfstarved art teacher had not yet blazoned out to a sympathetic world it was so much to the good there was a touch upon his shoulder and he felt a chill of horror when he turned around it was the steward who had conducted him below holding out a telegram  i beg your pardon sir he said telegram just arrived for you  he passed on almost at once in search of some one else philip stood for several moments perfectly still he looked at the inscriptiondouglas romillyset his teeth and tore open the envelope  understood you were returning to factory before leaving am posting a few final particulars to waldorf hotel new york staff joins me in wishing you bon voyage  philip felt his heart cease its pounding felt an immense sense of relief it was a wonderful thing this message it cleared up one point on which he had been anxious and unsettled it was taken for granted at the works then that he had come straight to liverpool he walked up and down the deck on the side remote from the dock driving this into his mind  everything was wonderfully simplified if only he could get across once reach new york meanwhile he looked at his watch again and discovered that it wanted but ten minutes to three he made his way back down to his stateroom which was already filled with his luggage he shook out an ulster from a bundle of wraps and selected a tweed cap already there was a faint touch of the sea in the river breeze and he was impatient for the immeasurable open spaces the salt wind the rise and fall of the great ship then as he stood on the threshold of his cabin he heard voices  down in number 110 eh  yes sir he heard his stewards voice reply mr romilly has just gone down youve only a minute sir before the last call for passengers  thats all right the voice which had spoken to him over the telephone that morning replied id just like to shake hands with him and wish him bon voyage  philips teeth came together in a little fury of anger it was maddening this to be trapped when only a few minutes remained between him and safety his brain worked swiftly he took his chance of finding the next stateroom empty as it happened to be and stepped quickly inside he kept his back to the door until the footsteps had passed he heard the knock at his stateroom stepped back into the corridor and passed along a little gangway to the other side of the ship he hurried up the stairs and into the smokingroom the bugle was sounding now and hoarse voices were shouting  every one for the shore last call for the shore  give me a brandy and soda he begged the steward who was just opening the bar  the man glanced at the clock and obeyed philip swallowed half of it at a gulp then sat down with the tumbler in his hand all of a sudden something disappeared from in front of one of the portholes his heart gave a little jump they were moving he sprang up and hurried to the doorway slowly but unmistakably they were gliding away from the dock already a lengthening line of people were waving their handkerchiefs and shouting farewells around them in the river little tugs were screaming and the ropes from the dock had been thrown loose philip stepped to the rail his heart growing lighter at every moment his ubiquitous steward laden with hand luggage paused for a moment  i sent a gentleman down to your stateroom just before the steamer started sir he announced gentleman of the name of gayes who wanted to say goodby to you  bad luck philip answered i must have just missed him  the steward turned around and pointed to the quay  there he is sirelderly gentleman in a grey suit and a bunch of violets in his buttonhole hes looking straight at you  philip raised his cap and waved it with enthusiasm after a moments hesitation the other man did the same the steward collected his belongings and shuffled off  he picked you out sir all right he remarked as he disappeared in the companionway  philip turned away with a little final wave of the hand  glad i didnt miss him altogether he observed cheerfully goodafternoon mr gayes goodby england    chapter iv  mr raymond greene very soon after the bugle had sounded for dinner that evening took his place at the head of one of the small tables in the saloon and wished every one good evening it was perfectly apparent that he meant to enjoy the trip that he was prepared to like his fellow passengers and that he wished them to know it even the somewhat melancholylooking steward who had been waiting for his arrival cheered up at the sight of his beaming face and the other four occupants of the table returned his salutation according to their lights  two vacant places i am sorry to see mr greene observed one of them i can answer for though the young lady who is to sit on my right will be down directlymiss elizabeth dalstan the great actress you know she is by way of being under my charge very charming and talented young lady she is let us see who our other absentee is  he stretched across and glanced at the name upon the card  mr douglas romilly he read out quite a good nameenglish without a doubt i have crossed with you before havent i sir he went on affably turning to his nearest neighbour on the left  a burly manychinned american signified his assent  why i should say so he admitted and id like a fivedollar bill mr greene for every film ive seen of yours in the united states  mr greene beamed with satisfaction  well i am glad to hear youve come across my stuff he declared ive made some name for myself on the films and i am proud of it raymond greene it is at your service  joseph p hyams mine the large american announced watching the disappearance of his soup plate with an air of regret im in the clothing business if my wife were here shed say you wouldnt think it to look at me never was faddy about myself though he added with a glance at mr greenes very correct dinner attire  you ought to remember me mr greene one of the two men remarked from the righthand side of the table ive played golf with you at baltusrol more than once  mr greene glanced surreptitiously at the card and smiled  why its james p busby of course he exclaimed your fathers the busby iron works isnt he  the young man nodded  and this is mr caroll one of our engineers he said indicating a rather roughlooking personage by his side  delighted to meet you both mr greene assured them say i remember your golf mr busby youre some driver eh and those long putts of yoursyou never took three on any green that i can remember  been playing in england the

berlin wednesday night and i did business in vienna last monday ah here comes miss dalstan  he rose ceremoniously to his feet a young lady who was still wearing her travelling clothes smiled at him delightfully and sank into the chair by his side during the little stir caused by her arrival no one paid any attention to the man who had slipped into the other vacant place opposite mr greene however when he had finished making known his companions wants to the steward welcomed philip romilly genially  now were a full table he declared thats what i like i only hope well keep it up all the voyage mind therell be a forfeit for the first one that misses a meal mr romilly isnt it he went on glancing at his lefthand neighbours card once more my names raymond greene i am an old traveller and theres nothing i enjoy more outside my business than these little ocean trips especially when they come after a pretty strenuous time on shore crossed many times sir  never before philip answered  first trip eh mr greene remarked mildly interested well well youve some surprises in store for you then let me make you acquainted with your opposite neighbour miss elizabeth dalstan i dare say even if you havent been in the states you know some of our principal actresses by name  philip raised his head and caught a glimpse of a rather pale face a mass of deep brown hair a pleasant smile from a very shapely mouth and the rather intense regard of a pair of wonderfully soft eyes whose colour at that moment he was not able to determine  i have had the pleasure of seeing miss dalstan on the stage he observed  capital mr raymond greene exclaimed we havent met before have we mr romilly something kind of familiar in your face you are not by way of being in the profession are you  romilly

gratified smile well i can see that we are going to be quite a friendly party thats mr busby on your right mr romillysome golfer i can tell youand his friend mr caroll alongside the lady next you  my

chicago  capital mr raymond greene repeated now we are all more or less a family party what did you say your line of business was mr romilly  i dont remember mentioning it philip observed but i am a manufacturer of boots and shoes  elizabeth dalstan looked across at him a little curiously one might have surmised that she was in some way disappointed  coming over to learn a thing or two from us eh mr greene went on you use all our machinery dont you well theres paul lawton on board from brockton i should think he has one of the biggest plants in massachusetts i must make you acquainted with him  philip frowned slightly  that is very kind of you mr greene he acknowledged but do you know i would very much rather not talk business with any one while i am on the steamer i am a little overworked and i need the rest  elizabeth dalstan looked at her visàvis with some renewal of her former interest she saw a young man who was without doubt goodlooking although he certainly had an overtired and somewhat depressed appearance his cheeks were colourless and there were little dark lines under his eyes as though he suffered from sleeplessness he was cleanshaven and he had the sensitive mouth of an artist his forehead was high and exceptionally good his air of breeding was unmistakable  you do look a little fagged mr raymond greene observed sympathetically well these are strenuous days in business we all have to stretch out as far as we can go and keep stretched out or else some one else will get ahead of us business been good with you this fall mr romilly  very fair thank you philip answered a little vaguely tell me miss dalstan he went on leaning slightly towards her and with a note of curiosity in his tone i want to know your candid opinion of the last act of the play i saw you inhendersons second wife i made up my mind that if ever i had the privilege of meeting you i would ask you that question  i know exactly why she declared with a quick little nod of appreciation listen  they talked together for some time earnestly mr greene addressed his conversation to his neighbours lower down the table it was not until the arrival of dessert that philip and his visàvis abandoned their discussion  tell me have you written yourself mr romilly elizabeth dalstan asked him with interest  i have made an attempt at it he confessed  most difficult thing in the whole world to write a play mr raymond greene intervened seeing an opportunity to join once more in the conversation most difficult thing in the world i should say now with pictures its entirely different the slightest little happening in everyday life may give you the start and then there you arethe whole thing unravels itself now let me give you an example he went on helping himself to a little more whisky and soda only yesterday afternoon on our way up to liverpool the train got pulled up somewhere in derbyshire and i sat looking out of the window it was a dreary neighbourhood a miserable afternoon and we happened to be crossing a rather high viaduct down below were some meadows and a canal and by the side of the canal a path at a certain pointi should think about half a mile from where the train was standingthis path went underneath a rude bridge built of bricks and covered over with turf well as i sat there i could see two men both approaching the bridge along the path from opposite directions one was tall dressed in light tweeds a goodlooking fellowlooked like one of your country squires except that he was a little on the thin side the other was a sombrelooking person dressed in dark clothes about your height and build i should say mr romilly well they both disappeared under that bridge at the same moment and i dont know why but i leaned forward to see them come out the train was there for quite another two minutes perhaps more there wasnt another soul anywhere in sight and it was raining as it only can rain in england  mr raymond greene paused every one at the table had been listening intently he glanced around at their rapt faces with satisfaction he was conscious of the artists dramatic touch once more it had not failed him he had excited interest in philip romillys eyes there was something even more than interest it seemed almost as though he were trying to project his thoughts back and conjure up for himself the very scene which was being described to him the young man was certainly in a very delicate state of health mr greene decided  you are keeping us in suspense sir the elderly lady complained leaning forward in her place please go on what happened when they came out  that mr raymond greene said impressively is the point of the story the train remained standing there as i have said for several minutesas many minutes in fact as it would have taken them seconds to have traversed that tunnel notwithstanding that they neither of them appeared again i sat there believe me with my eyes fastened upon that path and when the train started i leaned out of the window until we had rounded the curve and we were out of sight but i never saw either of those two men again now theres the beginning of a film story for you what do you want more than that theres dramatic interest surprise an original situation  after all i suppose the explanation was quite a simple one mr busby remarked they were probably acquaintances and they stayed to have a chat  mr raymond greene shook his head doubtfully  all i can say to that is that it was a queer place to choose for a little friendly conversation he pronounced they were both tall menabout the same height i should sayand it would have been impossible for them to have even stood upright  you mentioned the fact did you not the lady who called herself miss pinsent observed that it was raining heavily at the time perhaps they stayed under the bridge to shelter  thats something i never thought of mr greene admitted perhaps for the reason that they both of them seemed quite indifferent to the rain the young man in the dark clothes hadnt even an umbrella i must admit that i allowed my thoughts to travel in another direction professional instinct you see it was a fairly broad canal and the water was nearly up to the towingpath id lay a wager it was twelve or fifteen feet deep supposing those two men had met on that narrow path and quarrelled supposing  dont  mr raymond greene stopped short he gazed in amazement at elizabeth dalstan who had suddenly clutched his hand there was something in her face which puzzled as well as startled him she had been looking at her opposite neighbour but she turned back towards the narrator of this thrilling story as the monosyllable broke from her lips  please stop she begged you are too dramatic mr greene you really frighten me  frighten you he repeated my dear miss dalstan  i suppose it is very absurd of me she went on smiling appealingly at him but your words were altogether too graphic i cant bear to think of what might have taken place underneath that tunnel you must remember that i saw it too dont go on dont talk about it any more i am going upstairs for my cigarette are you coming to get my chair for me mr greene or must i rely upon the deck steward  mr raymond greene was a very gallant man and he did not hesitate for a moment he sprang to his feet and escorted the young lady from the saloon he glanced back as he left the table to nod his adieux to the little company whom he had taken under his charge philip romilly was gazing steadfastly out of the porthole  kind of delicate young fellow that he remarked nice face too cant help thinking that ive met or seen some one like him lately    chapter v  philip romilly found himself alone at last with the things which he had craveddarkness solitude the rushing of the salt wind the sense of open spaces on the other the sheltered side of the steamer long lines of passengers were stretched in wicker chairs smoking and drinking their coffee but where he was no one came save an occasional promenader yet even here was a disappointment he had come for peace for a brief escape from the thrall of memories which during the last few hours had become charged with undreamedof horrorsand there was to be no peace in the shadowy darkness which rested upon the whitechurned sea flying past him he saw again with horrible distinctness the face the figure of the man who for those few brief minutes he had hated with a desperate and passionate hatred he saw the broken photograph the glass splintered into a thousand pieces he saw the man himself choking sinking down beneath the black waters heard the stifled cry from his palsied lips saw the slow dawning agony of death in his distorted features some one was playing a mandolin down in the second class he heard the feet of a dancer upon the deck the little murmur of applause well after all this was life it was a rebuke of fate to his own illogical and useless vapourings men died every second whilst women danced and no one who knew life had any care save for the measure of their own days some freakish thought pleaded stridently his own justification his mind travelled back down the gloomy avenues of his past along those last aching years of grinding and undeserved poverty he remembered his upbringing his widowed mother a woman used to every luxury struggling to make both ends meet in a suburban street in a hired cottage filled with hired furniture he remembered his schooldays devoid of pocket money unable to join in the sports of others slaving with melancholy perseverance for a scholarship to lighten his mothers burden always there was the same ghastly crushing penuriousness the struggle to make a living before his schooldays were well over the unbought books he had fingered at the bookstalls and let drop again the coarse clothes he had been compelled to wear the scanty food he had eaten the narrow driving ways of poverty culminating in his mothers death and his own fearhe at the age of nineteen yearslest the money for her funeral should not be forthcoming if there were any hell surely he had lived in it this other whose flames mocked him now could be no worse sin crime he remembered the words of the girl who during these latter years had represented to him what there might have been of light in life he remembered and it seemed to him that he could meet that ghostly image which had risen from the black waters without shrinking almost contemptuously fate had mocked him long enough it was time indeed that he helped himself  he swung away from the solitude to the other side of the steamer paused in a sheltered spot while he lit a cigarette and paced up and down the more frequented ways a soft voice from an invisible mass of furs and rugs called to him  mr romilly please come and talk to me my rug has slippedthank you so much take this chair next mine for a few minutes wont you mr greene has rushed off to the smoking room i think he has just been told that there is a rival cinema producer on board and he is trying to run him to ground  philip settled himself without hesitation in the vacant place  one is forced to envy mr raymond greene he sighed to have work in life which one loves as he does his is the rarest form of happiness  what about your own she asked him but you are a manufacturer are you not somehow or other that surprises me  and me he acknowledged frankly i mean that i wonder i have persevered at it so long  but you are a very young man  young or old he answered i am one of those who have made a false start in life i am on my way to new things do you think miss dalstan that your country is a good place for one to visit who seeks new things  she turned in her chair a little more towards him against the background of empty spaces the pale softness of her face seemed to gain a new attractiveness  well that depends she said reflectively upon what these new things might be which you desire for an ambitious business man america is a great country  but supposing one had finished with business he persisted supposing one wanted to develop tastes and a gift for another method of life  then i should say that new york is the one place in the world she told him you are speaking of yourself  yes  you have ambitions i am sure she continued tell me are they literary  i would like to call them so he admitted i have written a play and three stories so bad that no one would produce the play or publish the stories  you have brought them with you  he shook his head  no they are where i shall never see them again  never see them again she repeated puzzled  i mean that i have left them at home i have left them there perhaps to a certain extent deliberately he went on you see the idea is still with me i think that i shall rewrite them when i have settled down in america i fancy that i shall find myself in an atmosphere more conducive to the sort of work i want to do i would rather not be handicapped by the ghosts of my old failures  ones ghosts are hard sometimes to escape from she whispered  he clutched nervously at the end of his rug she looked up and down along the row of chairs there were one or two slumbering forms but most were empty there were no promenaders in sight  you know she asked her voice still very low why i left the saloon a little abruptly this evening  why he demanded  because she went on i could see the effect which mr raymond greenes story had upon you because i also was in that train and i have better eyesight than mr greene you were one of the two men who were walking along the towpath  well he muttered  you have nothing to tell me  nothing  she waited for a moment  at least you have not attempted to persuade me that you lingered underneath that bridge to escape from the rain she remarked  if i cannot tell you the truth he promised i am not going to tell you a lie but apart from that i admit nothing i do not even admit that it was i whom you saw  she laid her hand upon his the touch of her fingers was wonderful cool and soft and somehow reassuring he felt a sense of relaxation felt the strain of living suddenly grow less  you know she said all my friends tell me that i am a restful person you are living at high pressure are you not try and forget it fate makes queer uses of all of us sometimes she sends her noblest sons down into the shadows and pitchforks her outcasts into the high places of life those do best who learn to control themselves to live and think for the best  go on talking to me he begged is it your voice i wonder that is so soothing or just what you say  she smiled reassuringly  you are glad because you have found a friend she told him and a friend who even if she does not understand does not wish to understand do you see  i wish i felt that i deserved it he groaned  she laughed almost gaily  what a sorting up there would be of our places in life she declared if we all had just what we deserved now give me your arm i want to walk a little while we walk if you like i will try to tell you what i can about new york it may interest you  they walked up and down the deck and by degrees their conversation drifted into a discussion of such recent plays as were familiar to both of them at the far end of the ship she clung to him once or twice as the wind came booming over the freshening waves she weighed and measured his criticisms of the plays they spoke of and in the main approved of them when at last she stopped outside the companionway and bade him good night the deck was almost deserted they were near one of the electric lights and he saw her face more distinctly than he had seen it at all realised more adequately its wonderful charm the large firm mouth womanly and tender though it was was almost the mouth of a protector she smiled at him as one might smile at a boy  you are to sleep well she said firmly those are my orders good night  she gave him her handa womans soft and delicate fingers yet clasping his with an almost virile strength and friendliness she left him with just that feeling about herthat she was expansive in her heart her sympathies even her brain and peculiar gifts of apprehension she left him too with a curious sense of restfulness as though suddenly he had become metamorphosed into the woman and had found a sorelyneeded guardian he abandoned without a second thought his intention of going to the smokingroom and sitting up late the thought of his empty stateroom a horror to him a few hours ago seemed suddenly almost alluring and he made his way there cheerfully he felt the sleep already upon his eyes    chapter vi  all the physical exhilaration of his unlived youth seemed to be dancing in philip romillys veins when he awoke the next morning to find an open porthole the blue sea tossing away to infinity and his stewards cheerful face at his bedside  bathroom steward says if you are ready sir he can arrange for your bath now the man announced  philip sprang out of bed and reached for his bond street dressinggown  ill bring you a cup of tea when you get back sir the steward continued the bathrooms are exactly opposite  the sting of the salt water seemed to complete his newfound lightheartedness philip dressed and shaved whistling softly all the time to himself he even found a queer sort of interest in examining his stock of ties and other garments the memory of elizabeth dalstans words was still in his brain they had become the text of his life this he told himself was his birthday he even accepted without a tremor a letter and telegram which the steward brought him  these were in the rack for you sir he said i meant to bring them down last night but we had a busy start off  philip took them up on deck to read he tore open the telegram first and permitted himself a little start when he saw the signature it was sent off from detton magna  why did you not come as promised what am i to do beatrice  the envelope of the letter he opened with a little more compunction it was written on the printed notepaper of the douglas romilly shoe company and was of no great length  dear mr romilly  i understood that you would return to the factory this evening for a few minutes before taking the train to liverpool there were one or two matters upon which i should like some further information but as time is short i am writing to you at the waldorf hotel at new york  i see that the acceptances due next 4th are unusually heavy but i think i understood you to say that you had spoken to mr henshaw at the bank concerning these and in any case i presume there would be no difficulty  wishing you every success on the other side and a safe return  i am  your obedient servant  jl potts  there is not the slightest doubt philip said to himself as he tore both communications into pieces and watched them flutter away downwards that i am on my way to new york if only one knew what had become of that poor halfstarved art master  he went down to breakfast and afterwards strolled aimlessly about the deck his sense of enjoyment was so extraordinarily keen that he found it hard to settle down to any of the usual light occupations of idle travellers he was content to stand by the rail and gaze across the sea a new wonder to him or to lie about in his steamer chair and listen with halfclosed eyes to the hissing of the spray and the faint music of the wind his mind turned by chance to one of those stories of which he had spoken a sudden new vigour of thought seemed to rend it inside out almost in those first few seconds he thought of the garret in which it had been written the wretched surroundings the odoriferous food the thick crockery the smokepalled vista of roofs and chimneys the genius of a stevenson would have become dwarfed in such surroundings a phrase a happy idea suddenly caught his fancy he itched for a pencil and paper then he looked up to find the one thing wanting elizabeth dalstan followed by a maid carrying rugs and cushions had paused smiling by his side  you have slept and you are better she said pleasantly now for the next few minutes you must please devote yourself to making me comfortable put everything down phoebe mr romilly will look after me  for a moment he paused before proceeding to his task  i want to look at you he confessed remember i have only seen you under the electric lights of the saloon or in that queer violet gloom of last night why you have quite light hair and i thought it was dark  she laughed goodhumouredly and turned slowly around  here i am she announced a much bephotographed person almost plain some journalists have dared to call me but for my expression on flowing lines as you see because i always wear such loose clothes and yet believe me slim as a matter of fact she went on pensively i am rather proud of my figure a little journalist who had annoyed me and to whom i was rude once called it ample no one has ever ventured to say more the critics who love me and they most of them love me because i am so exceptionally polite to them and tell them exactly what to say about every new play allude to my physique as grecian  but your eyes he exclaimed last night i thought they were grey this morningwhy surely they are brown  you see that is all according to the light she confided if any one does try to write a description of me they generally evade the point by calling them brownygrey a young man who was in love with me she sighed but that was long ago used to say that they reminded him of fallen leaves in a place where the sunlight sometimes is and sometimes isnt and now if you please i want to be made exceedingly comfortable i want you to find the deck steward and see that i have some beef tea as quickly as possible i want my box of cigarettes on one side and my vanity case on the other and i should like to listen to the plot of your play  he obeyed her behests with scrupulous care leaned back in his chair and brought into the foreground of his mind the figures of those men and women who had told his story finding them to his dismay unexpectedly crude and unlifelike and the story itself was unhappiness so necessary after all they suddenly seemed to crumble away into insignificance these men and women of his creation in their place he could almost fancy a race of larger beings a more extensive canvas a more splendid a riper and richer vocabulary  nothing that i have ever done he sighed is worth talking to you about but if you are going to be my friend  well  if you are going to be my friend he went on with almost inspired conviction i shall write something different  one can rebuild she murmured one can sometimes use the old pieces life and chess are both like that  would you help me i wonder he asked impulsively  she looked away from him out across the steamer rail she seemed to be measuring with her eyes the roll of the ship as it rose and fell in the trough of the sea  you are a strange person she said tell me are you in the habit of becoming suddenly dependent upon people  not i he assured her if i were to tell you how my last ten years have been spent you would not believe me you couldnt if i were to speak of a tearing unutterable loneliness if i were to speak of povertynot the poverty you know anything about but the poverty of bare walls of coarse food and little enough of it of everything cheap and miserable and soiled and secondhandnothing fresh nothing real  he stopped abruptly  but i forgot he muttered i cant explain  is one to understand she asked a little puzzled that you have had difficulties in your business  i have never been in business he answered quickly my name is romilly but i am not romilly the manufacturer for the last eight years i have lived in a garret in london teaching false art in a thirdrate school some of the time doing pennyaline journalistic work when i got the chance clerk for a month or two in a brewers office and sacked for incapacitythose are a few of the real threads in my life  at the present moment then she observed you are an impostor  exactly he admitted and i should probably have been repenting it by now but for your words last night  she smiled at him and the sun shone once more it wasnt an ordinary smile at all it was just as though she were letting him into the light of her understanding as though some one from the world entrance into which he had craved had stooped down to understand and was telling him that all was well he drew his chair a little closer to hers  we are all more or less impostors she said does any one i wonder go about the world telling everybody what they really are how they really live dear me how unpleasant and uncomfortable it would be you are so wise my new friend you know the value of impulses you tell me the truth and i am your friend i do not need facts because facts count for little i judge by what lies behind and i understand do not weary me with explanations i like what you have told me only of course your work must have suffered from surroundings like that will it be better for you now  i shall land in new york he told her with at least a thousand pounds that is about as much as i have spent in ten years there is the possibility of other money concerning thatwell i cant make up my mind the thousand pounds of course is stolen  so i gathered she remarked do you continue may i ask to be douglas romilly the manufacturer  he shook his head a little vaguely  i havent thought he confessed but of course i dont i have risked everything for the chance of a new life i shall start it in a new way and under a new name  he was suddenly conscious of her pity of a moistness in her eyes as she looked at him  i think she said that you must have been very miserable above all things now whatever you may have done for your liberty dont be fainthearted if you are in trouble or danger you must come to me you promise  if i may he assented fervently  now i must hear the play as it stood in your thoughts when you wrote it she insisted i have a fancy that it will sound a little gloomy am i right  he laughed  of course you are how could i write in any other way except through the darkened spectacles however theres a way outof altering it i mean i feel flashes of it already listen  the story expanded with relation he no longer felt confined to its established lines every now and then he paused to tell her that this or that was new and she nodded appreciatively they walked for a time watched the seagulls and bade their farewell to the irish coast  you will have to rewrite that play for me she said a little abruptly as she paused before the companionway i am going down to my room for a few minutes before lunch now afterwards i shall bring up a pencil and paper we will make some notes together  philip walked on to the smoking room he could scarcely believe that the planks he trod were of solid wood raymond greene met him at the entrance and slapped him on the back  just in time for a cocktail before lunch he exclaimed i was looking everywhere for a pal two martinis dry as you like jim he added turning round to the smoking room steward sure you wont join us lawton  darent was the laconic answer from the man whom he had addressed  bythebye mr raymond greene went on let me make you two acquainted this is mr douglas romilly an english boot manufacturermr paul lawton of brockton mr lawton owns one of the largest boot and shoe plants in the states the introducer went on you two ought to find something to talk about  philip held out his hand without a single moments hesitation he was filled with a new confidence  i should be delighted to talk with mr lawton on any subject in the world he declared except our respective businesses  i am very glad to meet you sir the other replied shaking hands heartily i dont follow that last stipulation of yours though  it simply means that i am taking seven days holiday philip explained gaily seven days during which i have passed my word to myself to neither talk business nor think business your very good health mr raymond greene he went on drinking his cocktail with relish if we meet on the other side mr lawton well compare notes as much as you like  thats all right sir the other agreed i dont know as youre not right we americans do hang round our businesses and thats a fact still theres a little matter of lasts i should like to have a word or two with you about some time  a little matter of what philip asked vaguely  lasts the other repeated thats where your people and ours look different ways chiefly that and a little matter of manipulation of our machinery  just so philip assented swallowing the rest of his cocktail what about luncheon theres nothing in the world to give you an appetite like this sea air  im with you mr raymond greene chimed in you two can have your trade talk later on  he took his young friends arm and they descended the stairs together  what the mischief is a last he inquired  i havent the least idea philip replied carelessly something to do with boots and shoes isnt it  his questioner stared at him for a moment and then laughed  say youre a young man of your word he remarked appreciatively    chapter vii  philip romilly was accosted late that afternoon by two young women whose presence on board he had noticed with a certain amount of disapproval they were obviously of the chorusgirl type a fact which they seemed to lack the ambition to conceal after several wouldbe ingratiating giggles they finally pulled up in front of him whilst he was promenading the deck  you are mr romilly arent you one of them asked bob millet told us you were going to be on this steamer you know bob dont you  philip for a moment was taken aback  bob millet he repeated thoughtfully  of course good old bob i dont mind confessing the young woman went on that though we were all out one night togethertrocadero empire and murrays afterwardsi should never have recognised you seems to me youve got thinner and more seriouslooking  i am afraid my own memory is also at fault philip remarked a little stiffly  i am violet fox the young woman who had accosted him continued this my friend hilda mason shes a dear girl but a little shy arent you hilda  thats just because i told her that we ought to wait until you remembered us the slighter young woman with the very obvious peroxidised hair protested  didnt seem to be any use waiting for that her friend retorted briskly hilda and i are dying for a cocktail mr romilly  he led them with an unwillingness of which they seemed frankly unaware towards the lounge they drank two cocktails and found themselves unfortunately devoid of cigarettes a misfortune which it became his privilege to remedy they were very friendly young ladies if a little slangy invited him around to their staterooms and offered to show him the runs around new york philip escaped after about an hour and made his way to where elizabeth was reclining in her deck chair  that fellow romilly he declared irritably the other one i mean seems to have had the vilest tastes if i am to be landed with any more of his ridiculous indiscretions i think i shall have to go overboard there was an enterprising gentleman named gayes in liverpool who nearly drove me crazy then theres this mr lawton who wants to talk about lasts and finally it seems that i dined at the trocadero and spent the evening at the empire and murrays with the two very obviouslooking young ladies who accosted me just now i am beginning to believe that douglas life was not above suspicion  she smiled at him tolerantly an unopened book lay by her side she seemed to have been spending the last quarter of an hour in thought  i am rather relieved to hear she confessed that those two young people are a heritage from the other mr romilly no dont sit down she went on i want you to do something for me go into the library and on the lefthand side as you enter you will see all the wireless news read the bottom item and then come back to me  he turned slowly away all his newfound buoyancy of spirits had suddenly left him he cursed the imagination which lifted his feet from the white decks and dragged his eyes from the sparkling blue sea to the rainsoaked smutblackened fields riven by that long thread of bleak turgid water the horrors of a murderous passion beat upon his brain he saw himself hastening grim and blind on his devilsped mission then the haze faded from before his eyes somehow or other he accomplished his errand he was in the library standing in front of those many sheets of typewritten messages passing them all over heedless of what their message might be until he came to the last and most insignificant four lines almost overlapped by another sheet    strange disappearance of a london art teacher    suicide feared    acting upon instructions received the police   are investigating a somewhat curious case of   disappearance philip romilly a teacher of art in   a london school visited detton magna on friday   afternoon and apparently started for a walk along   the canal bank towards dusk nothing has since   been heard of him or his movements and   arrangements have been made to drag the canal   at a certain point  the letters seemed to grow larger to him as he stood and read he remained in front of the message for an inordinately long time again his imagination was at work he saw the whole ghastly business the police on the canal banks watching the slow progress of the men with their drags bringing to the surface all the miserable refuse of the turgid waters the dripping black mud perhaps at last  he was back again on the deck walking quite steadily yet seeing little he made his way to the smoking room asked almost indifferently for a brandy and soda and drained it to the last drop then he walked up the deck to where elizabeth was seated and dropped into a chair by her side  so i am missing he remarked almost in his ordinary tone i really had no idea that i was a person of such importance fancy reading of my own disappearance within a few days of its taking place in the middle of the atlantic  there was probably some one there who gave information she suggested  there was the young lady whom i went to visit he assented she probably watched me cross the road and turn in at that gate and take the path by the canal side yes she may even have gone to the station to see whether i took the only other train back to london and found that i did not she knew too that i could only have had a few shillings in my pocket and that my living depended upon being in london for my school the next morning yes the whole thing was reasonable  and they are going to drag the canal elizabeth said thoughtfully  a difficult business he assured her it is one of the most ghastly illconstructed filthiest strips of water you ever looked upon it has been the garbage depository of the villages through which it makes its beastly way for generations i dont envy the men who have to handle the drags  you do not believe then that they will find anythinginteresting  he shrugged his shoulders  that type of man he continued must have a morbid mind there will be dead animals without a doubt wornout boots filthy and decomposed articles of clothing  dont she interrupted you know what i mean do leave off painting your ghastly pictures you know quite well what i mean philip romilly is here by my side what can they hope to find there in his place  his evil moments for that afternoon were over he answered her almost carelessly  not what they are looking for have you brought the paper and pencil you spoke of i have an ideai am getting fresh ideas every moment now that i picture you as my heroine it is queer isnt it how naturally you fall into the role  she drew a little nearer to him he was conscious of a mysterious and unfamiliar perfume perhaps from the violets half hidden in her furs or was it something in her hair it reminded him a little of the world the keys into which he had grippedthe world of joyousness of lighthearted pleasures the sunlit world into which he had only looked through other mens eyes  perhaps you knew that i was somewhere across the threshold she suggested did you drag your mona wholly from your brain or has she her prototype somewhere in your world  he shook his head  therein lies the weakness of all that i have ever written he declared there have been so few in my world from whom i could garner even the gleanings of a personality they are all my men and women artificially made not born twentythree shillings a week has kept me well outside the locked doors  yet you know in many ways she reflected mona is like me  like you because she was a helper of men he assented swiftly a woman of large sympathies appealing to me i suppose because in my solitude thoughts of my own weakness taunted me weakness because i couldnt break out i mean perhaps for that reason the thought of a strong woman fascinated me a woman large in thoughts and ways a woman to whom purposes and tendencies counted most i dreamed of a woman sweetly omnipotent strong without a shadow of masculinity that is where my mona was to be different from all other created figures  chance she declared is a wonderful thing chance has pitchforked you here absolutely to my side i the one woman who could understand what you mean who could give your mona life dont think i am vain she went on i can assure you that my head isnt the least turned because i have been successful i simply know listen i have few engagements in new york i should not be going back at all but to see my mother who is too delicate to travel and who is miserable when i am away for long take this pencil and paper let us leave off dreaming for a little time and give ourselves up to technicalities i want to draft a new first act and a new last one not so very different from your version and yet with changes which i want to explain as we go on bring your chair a little nearerso now take down these notes  they worked until the first gong for dinner rang she sat up in her chair with a happy little laugh  isnt it wonderful she exclaimed i never knew time to pass so quickly there isnt any pleasure in the world like this she added a little impulsively the pleasure of letting your thoughts run out to meet some one elses some one who understands take care of every line we have written my friend  we might go on after dinner he suggested eagerly  she shook her head  id rather not she admitted my brain is too full i have a hundred fancies dancing about i even find myself as we sit here rehearsing my gestures tuning myself to a new outlook oh you most disturbing personintellectually of course i mean she added laughing into his face take off my rugs and help me up no well leave them there perhaps after dinner we might walk for a little time  but the whole thing is tingling in my brain he protested couldnt we go into the library we could find a corner by ourselves  she turned and looked at him standing up now the wind blowing her skirts her eyes glowing her lips a little parted then for the first time he understood her beauty understood the peculiar qualities of it the dissensions of the press as to her appearance the supreme charm of a woman possessed of a sweet and passionate temperament turning her face towards the longwishedfor sun even the greater things caught hold of him in that moment and he felt dimly what was coming  do you really wish to work she asked  he looked away from her  no he answered a little thickly we will talk if you will  they neither of them moved the atmosphere had suddenly become charged with a force indescribable almost numbing in the far distance they saw the level line of lights from a passing steamer mr raymond greene with his hands in his ulster pockets suddenly spotted them and did for them what they seemed to have lost the power to do  hullo he exclaimed ive been looking for you two everywhere i dont want to hurt that smoking room stewards feelings hes not bad at his job but he added confidentially dropping his voice and taking them both by the arm i have made a cocktail down in my stateroomits there in the shaker waiting for us something i cant talk about ive given lawton one and hes following me about like a dog come right this way both of you steady across the gangwayshes pitching a little why you look kind of scared mr romilly been to sleep either of you  philips laugh was almost too long to be natural elizabeth as though by accident had dropped her veil mr raymond greene bubbling over with good nature and anticipation led them towards the stairs    chapter viii  mr raymond greene could scarcely wait until philip had taken his place at the dinner table that evening to make known his latest discovery  say mr romilly he exclaimed leaning a little forward do you happen to have seen the wireless messages todaythose tissue sheets that are stuck up in the library  philip set down the menu in which he had been taking an unusual interest  yes i looked through them this afternoon he acknowledged  theres a little one at the bottom looks as though it had been shoved in at the last moment i dont know whether you noticed it it announced the mysterious disappearance of a young man of the same name as your ownan art teacher from london i think he was i wondered whether it might have been any relation  i read the message philip admitted it certainly looks as though it might have referred to my cousin  mr raymond greene became almost impressive in his interested earnestness  talk about coincidences he continued do you remember last night talking about subjects for cinema plays i told you of a little incident i happened to have noticed on the way from london to liverpool about the two men somewhere in derbyshire whom i had seen approaching a tunnel over a canalthey neither of them came out you know all the time that the train was standing there  philip helped himself a little absently to whisky and soda from the bottle in front of him  i remember your professional interest in the situation he confessed  i felt at the time mr raymond greene went on eagerly that there was something queer about the affair listen i have been putting two and two together and it seems to me that one of those men might very well have been this missing mr romilly  philip shook his head pensively  i dont think so he ventured  whats that you dont think so the cinema magnate exclaimed why not mr romilly its exactly the districtat detton magna the message said in derbyshireand it was a canal too one of the filthiest i ever saw cant you realise the dramatic interest of the situation now that you are confronted with this case of disappearance i have been asking myself ever since i strolled up into the library before dinner and read this noticewhat about the other man  philip had commenced a leisurely consumption of his first course and answered without undue haste  well he said if this young man romilly is my cousin it would be the second or third time already that he has disappeared he is an illbalanced neurotic sort of creature at times he accepts helpeven solicits itfrom his more prosperous relations and at times he wont speak to us but of one thing i am perfectly convinced and that is that there is no man in the world who would be less likely to make away with himself he has a nervous horror of death or pain of any sort and in his peculiar way he is much too fond of life ever to dream of voluntarily shortening it on the other hand he is always doing eccentric things he probably set out to walk to londoni have known him do it beforeand will turn up there in a fortnights time  mr raymond greene seemed rather to resent having cold water poured upon his melodramatic imaginings he turned to elizabeth who had remained silent during the brief colloquy  what do you think miss dalstan he asked dont you think that under the circumstances i ought to give information to the british police  she laughed at him quite goodnaturedly and yet in such a way that a less sensitive man than mr raymond greene might well have been conscious of the note of ridicule  no wonder you are such a great success in your profession she observed you carry the melodramatic instinct with you day by day you see everything through the dramatists spectacles  thats all very well mr greene protested but you saw the two men yourself and youve probably read about the case of mysterious disappearance surely you must admit that the coincidence is interesting  alas she went on shaking her head i am afraid i must throw cold water upon your vivid imaginings you see my eyesight is better than yours and i could see the two men distinctly whilst you could only see their figures one of them the betterdressed was fair and obviously affluent and the other was a labourer neither of them could in any way have answered the description of the missing man  mr raymond greene was a little dashed  you didnt say so at the time he complained  i really wasnt sufficiently interested she told him besides without knowing anything of mr romillys cousin i dont think any person in the world could have had the courage to seek an exit from his troubles by means of that canal  but my point mr raymond greene persisted is that it wasnt suicide at all i maintain that the situation as i saw it presented all the possibilities of a different sort of crime  my cousin hadnt an enemy in the world except himself philip intervened  and i would give you the filming of my next play for nothing elizabeth ventured if either of those two men could possibly have been an art teacher can i have a little more oil with my salad please steward and i should like some french white wine  mr raymond greene took what appeared to be a positive disappointment very goodnaturedly  well he said i dare say you are both right and in any case i shouldnt like to persist in a point of view which might naturally enough become distressing to our young friend here tell you what ill do to show my penitence i shall order a bottle of wine and well drink to the welfare of the missing mr philip romilly wherever he may be pommery steward and bring some ice along  philip pushed away his whisky and soda  just in time he remarked ill drink to poor philips welfare with pleasure although he hasnt been an unmixed blessing to his family  the subject passed away with the drinking of the toast and with the necessity for a guard upon himself gone philip found himself eating and drinking mechanically watching all the time the woman who sat opposite to him who had now engaged mr raymond greene in an animated conversation on the subject of the suitability for filming of certain recent plays he was trying with a curious intentness to study her dispassionately to understand the nature of the charm on which dramatic critics had wasted a wealth of adjectives and of which he himself was humanly and personally conscious she wore a highnecked gown of some soft black material with a little lace at her throat fastened by her only article of jewellery a pearl pin her hair was arranged in coils with a simplicity and a precision which to a more experienced observer would have indicated the possession of a maid of no ordinary qualities her mouth became more and more delightful every time he studied it her voice even her method of speech were entirely natural and with a peculiarly fascinating inflexion at times she looked and spoke with the lighthearted gaiety of a child then again there was the grave and cultured woman apparent in her wellbalanced and thoughtful criticisms when at the end of the meal she rose to leave the table he found himself surprised at her height and the slim perfection of her figure his first remark when he joined her upon the stairs was an almost abrupt expression of his thoughts  tell me he exclaimed why were all my first impressions of you wrong tonight you are a revelation to me you are amazingly different  she laughed at him  i really cant do more than show you myself as i am she expostulated  ah but you are so many women he murmured  of course if you are going to flatter me give me a cigarette from my case please and strike a match and if you dont mind struggling with this wind and the darkness we will have our walk there she added as they stood in the companionway now dont you feel as though we were facing an adventure we shant be able to see a yard ahead of us and the wind is singing  they passed through up the companionway she took his arm and he suddenly felt the touch of her warm fingers feeling for his other hand he gripped them tightly and his last impression of her face before they plunged into the darkness was of a queer softness as though she were giving herself up to some unexpected but welcome emotion her eyes were half closed she had the air of one wrapped in silence so they walked almost the whole length of the deck philip indeed had no impulse or desire for speech all his aching nerves were soothed into repose the last remnants of his ghostly fears had been swept away they were on the windward side of the ship untenanted save now and then by the shadowy forms of other promenaders the whole experience even the regular throbbing of the engines the swish of the sea the rising and falling of a lantern bound to the top of a fishing smack by which they were passing the distant chant of the changing watch all the night sights and sounds of the seaborne hostel were unfamiliar and exhilarating and inside his hand even though given him of her great pity a womans fingers lay in his  she spoke at last a little abruptly  there is something i must know about she said  you have only to ask he assured her  dont be afraid she continued i wish to ask you nothing which might give you pain but i must knowyou see i am really such a ordinary womani must know about some one whom you went to visit that day didnt you at detton magna  he answered her almost eagerly  i want to talk about beatrice he declared i want to tell you everything about her i know that you will understand we were brought up together in the same country place we were both thrown upon the world about the same time that was one thing i suppose which made us kindly disposed towards one another we corresponded always i commenced my unsuccessful fight in london i livedi cant tell you howweek by week month by month i ate coarse food i was a hangeron to the fringe of everything in life which appealed to me fed intellectually on the crumbs of free libraries and picture galleries i met no one of my own stationi was at a public school and my people were gentlefolkor tastes i had no friends in london before whom i dared present myself no money to join a club where i might have mixed with my fellows no one to talk to or exchange a single idea withand i wasnt always the gloomy sort of person i have become in my younger days i loved companionship and the womenmy landladys daughter with dyed hair a loud voice slatternly in the morning a flagrant imitation of her less honest sisters at night who else where was i to meet women when i didnt even know men i spent my poor holidays at detton magna our very loneliness brought beatrice and me closer together we used to walk in those ugly fields around detton magna and exchanged the story of our woes she was a teacher at the national school the children werent pleasant their parents were worse the drudgery was horrible and there wasnt any escape for her sometimes she would sob as we sat side by side she too wanted something out of life as i did and there seemed nothing but that black wall always before us i think that we clung together because we shared a common misery we talked endlessly of a way out for me what was there there was no one to robi wasnt clever enough there was no way i could earn money honestly or dishonestly and for her buried in that derbyshire village amongst the collieries where there was scarcely a person who hadnt the taint of the place upon themwhat chance was there for her there was nothing she could do either i knew in my heart that we were both ready for evil things if by evil things we could make our escape and we couldnt so we tried to lose ourselves in the only fields left for such as we we read poetry we tried to live in that unnatural world where the brains only are nourished and the body languishes it was a morbid unhealthy existence but i plodded along and so did she then her weekly letters became different for the first time she wrote me with reserves i took a days vacation and i went down to detton magna to see what had happened  that was the day she interrupted softly when  that was the day he assented i remember so well getting out of the train and walking up that long miserable street school wasnt over and i went straight to her cottage as i have often done before there was a change her cheap furniture had gone it was like one of those little rooms we had dreamed of there was a soft carpet upon the floor chippendale furniture flowers hothouse fruit and on the mantelpiecethe photograph of a man  he paused and they took the whole one long turn along the windswept shadowy deck in silence  presently she came he continued the change was there too she was dressed simply enough but even i in my inexperience knew the difference she came inshe who had spoken of suicide a short time agosinging softly to herself she saw me our eyes met and the story was told i knew and she knew that i knew  it seemed as though something in his tone might have grated upon her gently but with a certain firmness she drew her hand away from his  you were very angry i suppose she murmured  some instinct told him exactly what was passing in her thoughts in a moment he was on the defensive  i think he said that if it had been any other manbut listen the photograph which i took from the mantelpiece and threw into the fire was the photograph of my own cousin his father and my father were brought up together my father chose the church his founded the factory in which most of the people in detton magna were employed when my grandfather died it was found that he was penniless the whole of his money had gone towards founding the douglas romilly shoe company i wont weary with the details the business prospered but we remained in poverty when my mother died i was left with nothing my uncle made promises and never kept them he too died my cousin and i quarrelled he and his father both held that the money advanced by my grandfather had been a gift and not a loan they offered me a pittance well i refused anything i spoke plain words and that was an end of it and then i came back and i saw his picture my cousins picture upon the mantelpiece i can see it now and it looks hateful to me all the old fires burned up in me i remembered my fathers deatha pauper he was i remembered how near i had been to starvation i remembered the years i had spent in a garret whilst douglas had idled time away at oxford had left there to trifle with the business his father had founded had his west end club hunters and shooting it was a vicious mad jealous hatred perhaps but i claim that it was human i went out of that little house and it seemed to me that there was a new lust in my heart a new craving desire if i had thrown myself into that canal they might well have called it temporary insanity i didnt but i was mad all the same anything else i didwas temporary insanity  her hand suddenly came back again and she leaned towards him through the darkness  you poor child she whispered stop there please dont be afraid to think youve told me this you see i am of the world and i know that we are all only human now twice up and down the deck and not a word then i shall ask you something  so they passed on side by side the touch of her fingers keeping this new courage alive in his heart his head uplifted even to the stars towards which their rolling mast pointed it was wonderful thisto tell the truth to open the door of his heart  now i am going to ask you something she said when they turned for the third time you may think it a strange question but you must please answer it to me it is rather important just what were your feelings for beatrice  i think i was fond of her he answered thoughtfully i know that i hated her when she came in from the schoolhousewhen i understood both of us in the days of our joint poverty had scoffed at principles had spoken boldly enough of sin but i can only say that when she came when i looked into her eyes i seemed to have discovered a new horror in life i cant analyse it i am not sure even now that i was not more of a beast that i had thought myself i am not sure that part of my rage was not because she had escaped and i couldnt  but your personal feelingsthat is what i want to know about she persisted  he dug down into his consciousness to satisfy her  think of what my life in london had been he reminded her there wasnt a single woman i knew with whom i could exchange a word all the time i loved beautiful things and beautiful women and the thought of them i have gone out into the streets at nights sometimes and hung around the entrances to theatres and restaurants just for the pleasure of looking at them with other men it didnt do me any good you know but the desire was there i wanted a companion like those other men had beatrice was the only woman i knew i didnt choose her it wasnt the selective instinct that made her attractive to me it was because she was the only one i never felt anything great when i was with her he went on hoarsely i knew very well that ours were ordinary feelings she was in the same position that i was there was no one else for her either do you want me to go on  she hesitated  dont be afraidi am not quite mad he continued only ill answer for you the part of your question you dont put into words beatrice was nothing to me but an interpretress of her sex i never loved her if i had we might in our misery have done the wildest the most foolish things i will tell you why i know so clearly that i never loved her i have known it since you have been kind to me since i have realised what a wonderful thing a woman can be what a world she can make for the man who cares whom she cares for  her fingers gripped his tightly  and now she said i know all that i want to know and all that it is well for us to speak of just now dear friend will you remember that you are sharing your burden with me and that i who am accounted something in the world and who know life pretty thoroughly believe in you and hope for you  they paused for a moment by the side of the steamer rail she understood so well his speechlessness she drew her hand away from his and held it to his lips  please kiss my fingers she begged that is just the seal of our friendship in these days see how quickly we seem to plough our way through the water listen to the throbbing of that engine always towards a new world for you my friend it is to be an undiscovered country be brave keep on being brave and remember  the words seemed to die away upon her lips a shower of spray came glittering into the dim light like flakes of snow falling with unexpected violence close to them he drew her cloak around her and moved back  now she said i think we will smoke and perhaps if you made yourself very agreeable to the steward in the smoking room you could get some coffee  one moment he pleaded remember what dont you realise that there is just one word i still need one little word to crown all that you have said  she turned her head towards him the trouble and brooding melancholy seemed to have fallen from his face she realised more fully its sensitive lines its poetic almost passionate charm she was carried suddenly away upon a wave of the emotion which she herself had created  oh but you know she faltered you see i trust you even to know when  now your arm please until we reach the smoking room and mindi must have coffee    chapter ix  philip romilly on the last day of the voyage experienced to the full that peculiar sensation of unrest which seems inevitably to prevail when an oceangoing steamer is being slowly towed into port the winds of the ocean had been left behind there was a new but pleasant chill in the frosty sunlit air the great buildings of new york at which he had been gazing for hours were standing heterogeneous but magnificent clearcut against an azure sky the ferry boats with their amazing human cargo seemed to be screeching a welcome as they churned their way across the busy river wherever he looked there was something novel and interesting yet nothing sufficiently arresting to enable him to forget that he was face to face now with the first crisis of his new life since that brief wireless message on the first day out there had been nothing disquieting in the daily bulletins of news and he had been able to appreciate to the full the soothing sense of detachment the friendliness of his fellow voyagers immeasurably above all the daily association with elizabeth he felt like one awaking from a dream as he realised that these things were over at the first sight of land it was as though a magicians wand had been waved a charm broken his fellow passengers in unfamiliar costumes were standing about with their eyes glued upon the distant docks a queer sense of ostracism possessed him perhaps after all it had been a dream from which he was now slowly awaking  he wandered into the lounge to find elizabeth surrounded by a little group of journalists she nodded to him pleasantly and waved a great bunch of longstemmed pink roses which one of them had brought to her her greeting saved him from despair she at least was unchanged  see how my friends are beginning to spoil me she cried out really i cant tell any of you a thing more she went on turning back to them only this and i am sure it ought to be interesting i have discovered a new dramatist and i am going to produce a play of his within three months i hope i shant tell you his name and i shant tell you anything about the play except that i find more promise in it than anything i have seen or read for months mr romilly please wait for me she called after him i want to point out some of the buildings to you  a dark young man wearing eyeglasses with a notebook and pencil in his hand swung around  is this mr douglas romilly he enquired of the romilly shoe company i am from the new york star pleased to meet you mr romilly you are over here on business we understand  philip was taken aback and for the moment remained speechless  wed like to know your reason mr romilly for paying us a visit the young man continued in your own words how long a trip do you intend to make anyway what might your output be in england per week womens shoes and misses isnt it  elizabeth intervened swiftly shaking her finger at the journalist  mr harris she said mr romilly is my friend and i am not going to have him spend these few impressive moments when he ought to be looking about him at the harbour telling you silly details about his business you can call upon him at his hotel if you likethe waldorf he is going to i believeand i am sure he will tell you anything you want to know  thats all right miss dalstan the young man declared soothingly see you later mr romilly he added maybe youll let us have a few of your impressions to work in with the other stuff  romilly made light of the matter but there was a slight frown upon his forehead as they passed along the curiously stationary deck  i am afraid he observed that this is going to be a terribly hard country to disappear in  dont you believe it she replied cheerfully you arrive here today and you are in request everywhere tomorrow you are forgottensome one else arrives that newspaper man scarcely remembers your existence at the present moment he has discovered mr raymond greene tell me why do you look so white and unhappy  i am sorry the voyage is over he confessed  so am i for that matter she assented i have loved every minute of the last few days but then we knew all the time didnt we that it was just an interlude the things which lie before us are so full of interest  it is the next few hours which i fear he muttered gloomily  she laughed at him  foolish if there had been any one on this side who wanted to ask you disagreeable questions they wouldnt have waited to meet you on the quay theyd have come down the harbour and held us up dont think about that for a moment think instead of all the wonderful things we are going to do you will be occupied every minute of the time until i come back to new york and i shall be so anxious to see the result you wont disappoint me will you  i will not he promised it was only for just a moment that i felt an idiot its exciting you know this new atmosphere and the voyage was so wonderful such a perfect rest its like waking up and the daylight seems a little crude  she held out her hand  you see the gangways are going down she pointed out i can see many of my friends waiting remember with your new life begins our new alliance good luck to you dear friend  their fingers were locked for a moment together he looked earnestly into her eyes  whatever the new life may mean for me he said fervently i shall owe to you  a little rush of people came up the gangway and elizabeth was speedily surrounded and carried off they came across one another several times in the custom house and she waved her hand to him gaily philip went through the usual formalities superintended the hoisting of his trunks upon a clumsy motor truck and was himself driven without question from the covered shed adjoining the quay he looked back at the huge side of the steamer the floor of the custom house about which were still dotted little crowds of his fellow passengers it was the disintegration of a wonderful memoryhis farewell                                       at the waldorf he found himself greeted with unexpected cordiality the young gentleman to whom he applied after some hesitation for a room stretched out his hand and welcomed him to america  so you are mr romilly he exclaimed well thats good weve got your roomnumber 602 on the ninth floor  ninth floor philip gasped  if youd like to be higher up we can change you the young man continued amiably been several people here enquiring for you a young man from the boot and shoe trades reporter was here only half an hour ago and heres a cable no mail yet  he handed the key to a small boy and waved philip away the small boy proved fully equal to his mission  you just step this way sir he invited encouragingly those packages of yours will be all right you dont need to worry about them  he led the way down a corridor streaming with human beings into a lift from which it appeared to philip that he was shot on to the ninth floor along a thicklycarpeted way into a goodsized and comfortable bedroom with bathroom attached  your things will be up directly sir the small boy promised holding out his hand ill see after them myself  philip expressed his gratitude in a satisfactory manner and stood for a few moments at the window although it was practically his first glimpse of new york the wonders of the panorama over which he looked failed even to excite his curiosity the clanging of the surface cars the roar and clatter of the overhead railway the hooting of streams of automobiles all apparently being driven at breakneck speed alien sounds though they were fell upon deaf ears he could neither listen nor observe every seconds delay fretted him his plans were all made everything depended upon their being carried out now without the slightest hitch he walked a dozen times to the door waiting for his luggage and when at last it arrived he was on the point of using the telephone he feed the linencoated porters and dismissed them as rapidly as possible then he ransacked the trunks until he found amidst a pile of fashionable clothing a quiet and inconspicuous suit of dark grey in the bathroom he hastily changed his clothes selected an ordinary homburg hat and filled a small leather case with various papers he was on the point of leaving the room when his eyes fell upon the cable he hesitated for a moment gazed at the superscription shrugged his shoulders and tore it open he moved to the window and read it slowly word for word  just seen henshaw most disturbing interview tells me you have had notice to reduce overdraft by february 1st absolutely declines any further advances payments coming in insufficient meet wages and current liabilities no provision for 4th bills amounting sixteen thousand pounds have wired london for accountant await your instructions urgently suggest you cable back the twenty thousand pounds lying our credit new york please reply very worried potts  word by word philip read the cable twice over then it fluttered from his fingers on to the table it told its own story beyond any shadow of a mistake his cousins great wealth was a fiction the business to which his own fortune and the whole of his grandfathers money had been devoted was even now tottering he remembered the rumours he had heard of douglas extravagance his establishment in london the burden of his college debts and then a further light flashed in upon him twenty thousand pounds in americalying there too for douglas under a false name he drew out one of the documents which he had packed and glanced at it more carefully then he replaced it a little dazed douglas had planned to leave england then with this crisis looming over him why philip for a moment sat down on the arm of an easychair a grim sense of humour suddenly parted his lips he threw back his head and laughed douglas romilly had actually been coming to america to disappear it was incredible but it was true  he left the cable carefully open upon the dressingtable and picking up the small leather case left the room he reached the lift happily escaping the observation of the young lady seated at her desk and descended into the hall once amongst the crowd of people who thronged the corridors he found it perfectly simple to leave the hotel by one of the side entrances he walked to the corner of the street and drew a little breath then he lit a cigarette and strolled along broadway curiously lighthearted his spirits rising at every step he was free for ever from that other hateful personality mr douglas romilly of the douglas romilly shoe company had paid his brief visit to america and passed on     book ii     chapter i  after a fortnight of his new life philip took stock of himself and his belongings in the first place then he owned a new name taken bodily from certain documents which he had brought with him from england further as mr merton ware he was the monthly tenant of a small but not uncomfortable suite of rooms on the top story of a residential hotel in the purlieus of broadway he had also apparently been a collector of newspapers of certain dates all of which contained some such paragraph as this    douglas romilly wealthy english boot   manufacturer disappears from the waldorf astoria   hotel walks out of his room within an hour of   landing and has not been heard of since down town   haunts searched foul play feared    superintendent shipman declares himself baffled    early on monday morning the police of the city   were invited to investigate a case of curious   disappearance mr douglas romilly an english   shoe manufacturer who travelled out from england   on board the elletania arrived at the waldorf   hotel at four oclock on saturday afternoon and   was shown to the reservation made for him within   an hour he was enquired for by several callers   who were shown to his room without result the   apartment was found to be empty and nothing has   since been seen or heard of mr romilly the room   assigned to him which could only have been   occupied for a few minutes has been locked up and   the keys handed to the police a considerable   amount of luggage is in their possession and   certain documents of a somewhat curious character   from cables received early this afternoon it   would appear that the douglas romilly shoe   company one of the oldest established firms in   england is in financial difficulties  then there was a paragraph in a paper of later date    no news of douglas romilly    the police have been unable to discover any trace   of the missing englishman from further cables to   hand it appears that he was in possession of a   considerable sum of money which must have been on   his person at the time of disappearance and it is   alleged that there was also a large amount with   which he had intended to make purchases for his   business standing to his credit at a new york   bank nothing has since been discovered however   amongst his belongings of the slightest financial   value nor does any bank in new york admit holding   a credit on behalf of the missing man  perhaps it is time philip murmured that these were destroyed  he tore the newspapers into pieces and threw them into his wastebasket on his writingtable were forty or fifty closely written pages of manuscript in his pocketbook were sixteen hundred dollars and a document indicating a credit for a very much larger amount at the united bank of new york in favor of merton ware and another the remainder of his belongings were negligible he stood at the window and looked out across the city the city into whose labyrinths he was so eager to penetratethe undiscovered country by day and night its voices were in his ears the rattle and roar of the overhead railway the clanging of the street cars the heavy traffic the fainter but never ceasing footfall of the multitudes he had sat there before dawn and watched the queer pinkywhite light steal with ever widening fingers through the darkness heard the yawn of the city as it seemed to shiver and tremble before the battle of the day at twilight he had watched the lights spring up one by one at first like pin pricks in the distance growing and widening until the grotesque shapes of the buildings from which they sprung had faded into nothingness and there was left only a velvet curtain of strangelylit stars at a giddy distance below he could trace the blaze of broadway the blue lights flashing from the electric wires as the cable cars rushed back and forth the red and violet glimmer of the sky signs he knew it all so well by morning by noon and night in rainstorm storms which he had watched come up from oceanwards in drifting clouds of vapour and in sunshine clear brilliant sunshine a little hard and austere to his way of thinking and unseasonable  a week he muttered she said a week tonight i will go out  he looked at himself in the glass he wore no longer the wellcut clothes of mr douglas romillys saville row tailor but a readymade suit of schmitt  mayers business reachmedowns an american felt hat and squaretoed shoes  she said a week he repeated its a fortnight today ill go to the restaurant at the corner i must find out for myself what all this noise means what the city has to say  he turned towards the door and then stopped short for almost the first time since he had taken up his quarters here the lift had stopped outside there was a brief pause then his bell rang for a moment philip hesitated then he stepped forward and opened the door looking out enquiringly at his caller  you mr merton ware  he admitted the fact briefly his visitor was a young woman dressed in a rather shabby black indoor dress over which she wore an apron she was without either hat or gloves her fingers were stained with purple copying ink and her dark hair was untidily arranged  i live two stories down below she announced handing him a little card miss martha grimesthats my nametypewriter and stenographer you see the waiter who brings our meals told me he thought you were some way literary so i just stepped up to show you my prospectus if youve any typewriting you want doing im on the spot and i dont know as youd get it done much cheaper anywhere elseor better  there was nothing particularly ingratiating about miss martha grimes but with the exception of a coloured waiter she happened to be the first human being with whom philip had exchanged a word for several days he felt disinclined to hurry her away  come in he invited holding the door open so you do typing eh what sort of a machine do you use  remington she answered its a bit knocked abouta few of the letters i meanbut ive got some violet ink and i can make a manuscript look all right half a dollar a thousand words and a quarter for carbon copies of course if youd got a lot of stuff she went on her eyes lighting hopefully upon the little collection of manuscript upon his table i might quote you a trifle less  he picked up some of his sheets and glanced at them  sooner or later he admitted i shall have to have this typed it isnt quite ready yet though  he was struck by the curious little light of anticipation which somehow changed her face and which passed away at his last words under pretence of gathering together some of those loose pages he examined her more closely and realised that he had done her at first scant justice she was very thin and the expression of her face was spoilt by the discontented curve of her lips the shape of her head however was good her dark hair notwithstanding its temporary disarrangement was of beautiful quality and her eyes though dull and spiritlesslooking were large and full of subtle promise he replaced the sheets of manuscript  sit down for a moment he begged  id rather stand she replied  just as you please he assented smiling i was just wondering what to do about this stuff  she hesitated for a moment then a little sulkily she seated herself  i suppose you think im a pretty forward young person to come up here and beg for work i dont care if you do she went on swinging her foot back and forth one has to live  i am very pleased that you came he assured her it will be a great convenience to me to have my typing done on the premises and although i am afraid there wont be much of it you shall certainly do what there is  story writer she enquired  i am only a beginner he told her this work i am going to give you is a play  she looked at him with a shade of commiseration in her face  sickening job aint it writing for the stage unless youve got some sort of pull  this is my first effort he explained  well its none of my business she said gloomily all i want is the typing of it only you should see some of the truck ive had ive hated to send in the bill waste of good time and paper i dont suppose yours is like that but there aint much written thats any good anyway  youre a hopeful young person arent you he remarked taking a cigarette from the mantelpiece and lighting it have one  no thank you she replied rising briskly to her feet im not that sort that sits about and smokes cigarettes with strange young men if youll let me know when that works going to be ready ill send the janitor up for it  he smiled deprecatingly  youre not afraid of me by any chance are you he asked  her eyes glowed with contempt as she looked him up and down  afraid of you sir she repeated i should say not ive met all sorts of men and i know something about them  then sit down again please he begged  she hesitated for a moment then subsided once more unwillingly into the chair  dont know as i want to stay up here gossiping she remarked youd much better be getting on with your work give me one of those cigarettes anyway she added abruptly  do you live in the building he enquired as he obeyed her behest  two flats below with pop she replied hes a bad actor very seldom in work and he drinks there are just the two of us now you know as much as is good for you youre english aint you  i am philip admitted  just out too by the way you talk  i have been living in jamaica he told her for many yearsclerk in an office there  better have stayed where you were i should think if youve come here hoping to make a living by that sort of stuff  perhaps youre right he agreed but you see i am herebeen here a week or two in fact  done much visiting around she enquired  ive scarcely been out he confessed you see i dont know the city except from my windows its wonderful from here after twilight  think so she replied dully its a hard hammering brazen sort of place when youre living in it from hand to mouth not but what we dont get along all right she added a little defiantly im not grumbling  i am sure youre not he assented soothingly tell metonight i am a little tired of work i thought of going out be a good samaritan and tell me where to find a restaurant in broadway somewhere where crowds of people go but not what they call a fashionable place i want to get some dinneri havent had anything decent to eat for i dont know how longand i want to breathe the same atmosphere as other people  she looked at him a little enviously  how much do you want to spend she asked bluntly  i dont know that that really matters very much i have some money things are more expensive over here arent they  i should go to the new martin house she advised him right at the corner of this block its real swell and they say the foods wonderful  i could go as i am i suppose he asked glancing down at his clothes  she stared at him wonderingly  say where did you come from she exclaimed you aint supposed to dress yourself out in glad clothes for a broadway restaurant not even the best of them  have you been to this place yourself he enquired  nope  come with me he invited suddenly  she arose at once to her feet and threw the remains of her cigarette into the grate  say mr ware she pronounced i aint that sort and the sooner you know it the better especially if im going to do your work ill be going  look here he remonstrated earnestly you dont seem to understand me altogether what do you mean by saying youre not that sort  you know well enough she answered defiantly i guess youre not proposing to give me a supper out of charity are you  i am asking you to accompany me he declared because i havent spoken to a human being for a week because i dont know a soul in new york because ive got enough money to pay for two dinners and because i am fiendishly lonely  she looked at him and it was obvious that she was more than half convinced her brightening expression transformed her face she was still hesitating but her inclinations were apparent  say you mean that straight she asked you wont turn around afterwards and expect a lot of soft sawder because youve bought me a meal  dont be a silly little fool he answered goodhumouredly all i want from you is to sit by my side and talk and tell me what to order  her face suddenly fell  no good she sighed havent got any clothes  if i am going like this he expostulated why cant you go as you are take your apron off youll be all right  theres my black hat with the ribbon she reminded herself its no style and stella said yesterday she wouldnt be seen in a dime show in it  never you mind about stella he insisted confidently you clap it on your head and come along  she swung towards the door  meet you in the hall in ten minutes she promised cant be any quicker this is your trouble you know i didnt invite myself  philip opened the door a civility which seemed to somewhat embarrass her  i shall be waiting for you he declared cheerfully    chapter ii  philip stepped into his own little bedroom and made scanty preparations for this his first excursion then he made his way down into the shabby hall and was seated there on the worn settee when his guest descended she was wearing a hat which so far as he could judge was almost becoming her gloves notwithstanding their many signs of mending were neat her shoes carefully polished and although her dress was undeniably shabby there was something in her carriage which pleased him her eyes were fixed upon his from the moment she stepped from the lift she was watching for his expression half defiantly half anxiously  well you see what i look like she remarked brusquely you can back out of it if you want to  dont be silly he replied you look quite all right im not much of a beau myself you know i bought this suit over the counter the other day without being measured for it or anything  guess you aint used to readymade clothes she observed as they stepped outside  you see in englandand the colonies he added hastily things arent so expensive as here what a wonderful city this is of yours martha  miss grimes please she corrected him  i beg your pardon he apologised  thats just what i was afraid of she went on querulously youre beginning already you think because youre giving me a meal you can take all sorts of liberties calling me by my christian name indeed  it was entirely a slip he assured her tell me what theatre that is across the way  she answered his question and volunteered other pieces of information philip gazed about him as they walked along broadway with the eager curiosity of a provincial sightseer she laughed at him a little scornfully  youll get used to all the life and bustle presently she told him it wont seem so wonderful to you when you walk along here without a dollar to bless yourself with and your silly plays come tumbling back now this is the martin house my looks good inside dont it  they crossed the threshold philip handed his hat to the attendant and they stood a little undecided at the top of the brilliantlylit room a condescending maître dhotel showed them to a retired table in a distant corner and another waiter handed them a menu  you know half of this is unintelligible to me philip confessed youll have to do the orderingthat was our bargain you know  you must tell me how much you want to spend then she insisted  i will not he answered firmly what i want is a good dinner and for this once in my life i dont care what it costs ive a few hundred dollars in my pocket so you neednt be afraid i shant be able to pay the bill you just order the things you like and a bottle of claret or anything else you prefer  she turned to the waiter and carefully studying the prices she gave him an order  one portion for two remember of the fish and the salad she enjoined two portions of the chicken if you think one wont be enough  she leaned back in her place  its going to cost you when youve paid for the claret a matter of four dollars and fifty cents this dinner she said and i guess youll have to give the waiter a quarter are you scared  he laughed at her once more  not a bit  she looked at his long delicate fingersstudied him for a moment notwithstanding his clothes there was an air of breeding about him unconcealable a thing apart even from his good looks  clerk were you she remarked seems to me youre used to spending two dollars on a meal all right im not  neither am i he assured her one doesnt have much opportunity of spending money injamaica  you seem kind of used to it somehow she persisted have you come into money then  ive saved a little he explained with a rather grim smile and ivewell shall we say come into some  stolen it maybe she observed indifferently  should you be horrified if i told that i had  i dont know she answered im one of those whos lived honest and i sometimes wonder whether it pays  its a great problem he sighed  it is that she admitted gloomily ive got a friendshe used to live in our place just below mestella kimbell her name is she and i learnt our typewriting together and started in the same office we stood it somehow for three years sometimes office work sometimes at home we didnt have much luck it was always better for me than for stella because she was goodlooking and im not  i shouldnt say that he remonstrated youve got beautiful eyes you know  you stop it she warned him firmly my eyes are my own and ill trouble you not to make remarks about them  sorry philip murmured duly crushed  the men were after her all the time the girl continued reminiscently last place we were at a dry goods store not far from here the heads of the departments used to make her life fairly miserable she held out though but what with fines and one thing or another they forced her to leave so i did the same we drifted apart then for a while she got a job at an automobile place and i was working at home i remember the night she came to mei was all alone pop had got a threeline part somewhere and was bragging about it at all the bars in broadway stella came in quite suddenly and almost out of breath  kid she said im through with it  what do you mean i asked her  then she threw herself down on the sofa and she sobbedi never heard a girl cry like that in all my life she shrieked she was pretty nearly in hysterics and i couldnt get a word out of her when she was through at last she was all limp and white she wouldnt tell me anything she simply sat and looked at the stove presently she got up to go i put my hands on her shoulders and i forced her back in the chair  youve got to tell me all about it stella i insisted  and then of course i heard the whole story shed got fired again these men are devils  dont tell me more about it unless you like he begged sympathetically where is she now  in the chorus of three frivolous maids she comes in here regularly  sorry for herself  not she last time i saw her she told me she wouldnt go back into an office or take on typewriting again for anything in the world she was looking prettier than ever too theres a swell chap almost crazy about her shouldnt wonder if she hasnt got an automobile  well she answers our question one way then he remarked thoughtfully tell me miss grimes is everything to eat in america as good as this fish  some cooking here she observed looking rather regretfully at her empty plate i told you things were all right theres grilled chickenmaryland chickencoming and green corn  have i got to eat the corn like that man opposite he asked anxiously  you can eat it how you like she answered  watch me if you want to i dont care i aint tasted green corn since i can remember and im going to enjoy it  you dont like your claret im afraid he remarked  she sipped it and set down the glass a little disparagingly  if you want to know what i would like she said its just a martini cocktail we dont drink wines over here as much as you folk i guess  he ordered the cocktails at once every now and then he watched her she ate delicately but with a healthy and unashamed appetite a little colour came into her cheeks as the room grew warmer her lower lip became less uncompromising suddenly she laid down her knife and fork her eyes were agleam with interest she pulled at his sleeve  say thats stella she exclaimed excitedly look shes coming this way dont she look stunning  a girl undeniably pretty with dark redgold hair wearing a long ermine coat and followed by a fashionably dressed young man was making her way up the room she suddenly recognised philips companion and came towards her with outstretched hand  if it isnt martha she cried isnt this great felix this is miss grimesmartha grimes you know she added calling to the young man who was accompanying her you must rememberwhy whats the matter with you felix  she broke off in her speech her companion was staring at philip who was returning his scrutiny with an air of mild interrogation  say the young man enquired didnt i meet you on the elletania arent you mr douglas romilly  philip shook his head  my name is ware he pronounced merton ware i have certainly never been on the elletania and i dont remember having met you before  the young man whose name was felix appeared almost stupefied  gee whiz he muttered excuse me sir but i never saw such a likeness beforenever  well shake hands with miss grimes quickly and come along stella enjoined remember i only have half an hour for dinner now you coming to see the show martha  not tonight that young woman declared firmly  the two passed on after a few more moments of amiable but on the part of the young man somewhat dazed conversation philip had resumed the consumption of his chicken he raised an overfilled glass to his lips steadily and drank it without spilling a drop  mistook me for some one he remarked coolly  she nodded  man who disappeared from the waldorf astoria they made quite a fuss about him in the newspapers i shouldnt have said you were the least like himto judge by his pictures anyway  philip shrugged his shoulders he seemed very little interested  i dont often read the newspapers so that is stella  that is stella she assented a little defiantly and if i were shei mean if i were as goodlooking as she isid be in her place  i wonder whether you would he observed thoughtfully  oh dont bother me with your problems she replied does it run to coffee  of course it does he agreed and a liqueur if you like  if you mean a cordial ill have some of that green stuff she decided dont know when i shall get another dinner like this again  well that rests with you he assured her i am very lonely just now later on it will be different well come again next week if you like  better see how you feel about it when the time comes she answered practically besides im not sure theyd let me in here again did you see stellas coat fancy feeling fur like that up against your chin fancy  she broke off and sipped her coffee broodingly  those things are immaterial in themselves he reminded her its just a question how much happiness they have brought her whether the thing pays or not  of course it pays she declared almost passionately youve never seen my rooms or my drunken father i can tell you what theyre like though theyre ugly theyre tawdry theyre untidy when ive any work to do theyre scarcely clean our meals are thrown at uswere always behind with the rent there isnt anything to look at or listen to that isnt ugly you havent known what it is to feel the grim pang of a constant hideousness crawling into your senses stupefying you almost with a sort of miseryoh i cant describe it  i have felt all those things he said quietly  what did you do she demanded no perhaps you had luck perhaps its not fair to ask you that it wouldnt apply what should you do if you were me if you had the chance to get out of it all the way that she has  i am not a woman he reminded her simply if i answer you as an outsider a passerbymind though one who thinks about men and womeni should say try one of her lesser sins one of the sins that leaves you clean steal for instance  and go to prison she protested angrily how much better off would you be there i wonder and what about when you came out pooh pay your bill and lets get out of this  he obeyed and they made their way into the crowded street he paused for a moment on the pavement the pleasure swirl was creeping a little into his veins  would you like to go to a theatre he asked  she shook her head  you do as you like im going home you neednt bother about coming with me either  dont be foolish he protested i only mentioned a theatre for your sake come along  they walked down broadway and turned into their own street they entered the tenement building together and stepped into the lift she held out her hand a little abruptly  good night  good night he answered you get out first dont you ill polish that stuff up tonight the first part of it so that you can get on with the typing  some halfdeveloped fear which had been troubling her during the walk home seemed to have passed her face cleared  dont think i am ungrateful she begged as the lift stopped i havent had a good time like this for many months thank you mr ware and good night  she stepped through the iron gates on to her own floor and philip swung up to his rooms somehow he entered almost lightheartedly the roar of the city below was no longer provocative he felt as though he had stretched out a hand towards it as though he were in the way of becoming one of its children    chapter iii  a few nights later philip awoke suddenly to find himself in a cold sweat face to face with all the horrors of an excited imagination once more he felt his hand greedy for the soft flesh of the man he hated tearing its way through the stiff collar felt the demoniacal strength shooting down his arm the fever at his finger tips he saw the terrified face of his victim a strong man but impotent in his grasp heard the splash of the turgid waters saw himself his lust for vengeance unsatisfied peering downwards through the dim and murky gloom it was not only a physical nightmare which seized him his brain too was his accuser he saw with a hideous clarity that even the excuse of motive was denied him it was a sense of personal loss which had driven him out on to that canal path a murderer at heart it was something of which he had been robbed an acute and burning desire for vengeance personal entirely egotistical it was not the wrong to the woman which he resented had there been any wrong it was the agony of his own personal misery he rose from his bed and stamped up and down his little chamber in a fear which was almost hysterical he threw wide open the windows heedless of a driving snowstorm the subdued murmur of the city with its paling lights brought him no relief he longed frantically for some one who knew the truth for elizabeth before any one with her soft cool touch her gentle protective sympathy he was a fool to think he could live alone like this with such a burden to bear perhaps it would not be for long the risks were many at any moment he might hear the lift stop steps across the corridor the ring at his bell the plainlyclad businesslike man outside with his formal questions his grim civility he fumbled about in his little dressingcase until he came to a small box containing several white pills he gripped them in his hand and looked around listening no it was fancy there was still no sound in the building when at last he went back to bed however the little box was tightly clenched in his hands  in the morning he went through his usual programme he arose soon after eight lighted his little spirit lamp made his coffee cut some bread and butter and breakfasted then he lit a cigarette and sat down at his desk his imagination however seemed to have burnt itself out in the night ideas and phrases were denied to him he was thankful about eleven oclock to hear a ring at the bell and find martha grimes outside with a little parcel under her arm she was wearing the same shabby black dress and her fingers were stained with copying ink her almost too luxuriant hair was illarranged and untidy even her eyes seemed to have lost their lustre  ive finished she announced handing him the parcel better look and see whether its all right i cant do it up properly till ive had the whole  he cut the string and looked at a few of the sheets the typing was perfect he began to express his approval but she interrupted him  its better stuff than i expected she declared grudgingly i thought you were only one of these miserable amateurs where did you learn to write like that  somehow her praise was like a tonic  do you like it he asked eagerly  oh my likes or dislikes dont matter she replied its good stuff youll find the account in there if youd like to pay me id like to have the money  he glanced at the neat little bill and took out his pocketbook  sit down for a minute he begged im stuck this morningcant write a line take my easychair and smoke a cigarettei have nothing else to offer you  for a moment she seemed about to refuse then she flung herself into his easychair took a cigarette and holding it between her lips almost scarlet against the pallor of her cheeks stretched upwards towards the match which he was holding  stella and her boy were over to see me last night she announced a little abruptly  the young lady with the ermines he murmured  and her boy felix martin it was through him they camei could see that all right he was trying all the time to pump me about you  about me  oh you neednt trouble to look surprised she remarked i guess you remember the bee he had in his bonnet that night  mistook me for some one didnt he philip murmured  she nodded  kind of queer you dont read our newspapers it was a guy named romillydouglas romillywho disappeared from the waldorf hotel strange thing about it she went on is that i saw photographs of him in the newspapers and i cant recognise even a likeness  this mr felix martin doesnt agree with you apparently philip observed  he dont go by the photographs martha grimes explained he believes that he crossed from liverpool with this mr douglas romilly and that you she continued crossing her legs and smoothing down her skirt to hide her shabby shoes are so much like him that he came down last night to see if there was anything else he could find out from me before he paid a visit to police headquarters  there was a moments silence philip was apparently groping for a match and the girl was keeping her head studiously turned away from him  what business is it of his  there was a reward offered dont know as that would make much difference to felix martin though according to stellas account he is pretty well a millionaire already  it would be more useful to you wouldnt it philip remarked  five hundred dollars martha sighed dont seem to me just now that theres much in the world you couldnt buy with five hundred dollars  well what did you tell mr felix martin  oh i lied sure hed found out the date you came into your rooms herethe day this man romilly disappearedbut i told him that id known you and done work for you before thenlong enough before the elletania ever reached new york that kind of stumped him  why did you do that philip demanded  dunno the girl replied with a shrug of the shoulders just a fancy i guessed you wouldnt want him poking around  but supposing i had been douglas romilly you might at least have divided the reward he reminded her  theres money and money martha declared we spoke of that the other day stellas got moneynow well shes welcome my time will come i suppose but if i cant have clean money i havent made up my mind yet whether i wouldnt rather try the hudson on a foggy morning  well i am not douglas romilly anyway philip announced  she looked up at him almost for the first time since her entrance  i kind of thought you were she admitted i might have saved my lies then  he shook his head  you have probably saved me from more than you know of he replied i am not douglas romilly but  youre not merton ware either she interrupted  quite right he agreed i started life as philip merton ware the day i took these rooms and if the time should come he went on that any one seriously set about the task of finding out exactly who i was before i was merton ware you and i might as well take that little journeywas it to the hudson you said on a foggy morningtogether  they sat in complete silence for several moments then she threw the end of her cigarette into the fire  well im glad i didnt lie for nothing she declared i didnt quite tumble to the douglas romilly stunt though they say he has left his business bankrupt in england and brought a fortune out here you dont look as though you were overdone with it  i certainly havent the fortune that douglas romilly is supposed to have got away with he said quietly i have enough money for my present needs thoughenough bytheby to pay you for this typing he added counting out the money upon the table  any more stuff ready  with luck therell be some this afternoon he promised her i had a bad night last night but i think ill be able to work later in the day  she looked at him curiously at his face absolutely devoid of colour his eyes restless and overbright his long twitching fingers  bad conscience or drugs she asked  bad conscience he acknowledged ive been where you have beenmiss grimes i looked over the edge and i jumped id stay where you are if i were you  maybe i shall maybe i shant she replied doggedly stella wants to bring a boy around to see me you bring him i said ill talk to him then she got a little confused stellas kind in her way she came back after mr martin had gone down the passage see here kid she said you know as well as i do i cant bring any one round to see you while you are sitting around in those rags let me lend you well i stopped her short at that my own plumes or none at all i told her and id just as soon he didnt come anyway  youre a queer girl philip exclaimed wheres your father today  usual place she answeredin bed he never gets up till five  let me order lunch up here for both of us from the restaurant he suggested  she shook her head  no thanks  why not he persisted  im going round to the office to see if i can get any extra work  but youve got to lunch some time he persisted  she laughed a little hardly  have i we girls havent got to eat like you men ill call up towards the evening and see if youve anything ready for me  she was gone before he could stop her he turned back to his desk and seated himself the sight of his last finished sentence presented itself suddenly in a new light there was a suggestiveness about it which was almost poignant he took up his pen and began to write rapidly    chapter iv  it was a few minutes after six that evening when philip was conscious of a knock at his door he swung around in his chair blinking a little  come in  martha grimes entered she was in outdoor apparel that is to say she wore her hat and a long mackintosh she remained standing upon the threshold  just looked up to see if youve got any more work ready she explained  he sprang to his feet and stood there for a moment unsteadily  come in and shut the door he ordered look look he added pointing to his table thirtythree sheets ive been working all the time ive been living i tell you living god knows wherenot in this accursed little world here lets pick up the sheets theres enough work for you  she looked at him curiously  have you been in that chair ever since she asked  ever since he assented enthusiastically  any lunch  not a scrap never thought about it  youll make yourself sick thats what youll do she declared go out and get something at once  never even thought about lunch he repeated half to himself where have you been  some luck she replied first place i dropped in at found there was a girl gone home for the day fainted lots of work to do so they just stuck me down in her chair three dollars they gave me the girls coming back tomorrow though worse luck  when did you have your lunch  havent had any im going to make myself a cup of tea now  he reached for his hat  not on your life he exclaimed come along miss martha grimes i have written linesyou just wait till you type them i tell you its what i have had at the back of my head for months its there now on paperliving flaring words come along  where to  we are going to eat he insisted i am faint and so are you we are going to that same place and well have lunch and dinner in one  nothing doing she snapped youll see some more people who recognise you  he waved his hand contemptuously  who cares if you dont come along with me ill go up town to the waldorf or the ritz carlton ill waste my money and advertise myself come alongthat same little quiet corner i dont suppose your friends will be there again  stella wont she admitted doubtfully shes going to sherrys id just as soon be out she went on ruminatingly shouldnt be surprised if she didnt bring that guy in after all  he had already rung the bell of the lift  look at me she exclaimed ironically nice sort of an object i am to take out got a raincoat onthough its dry enoughbecause my coats gone at the seams  if you dont stop talking like that he declared ill march into one of those great stores and order everything a woman wants to wear look at me did you ever see such clothes  a mans different she protested besides youve got a way with you of looking as though you could wear better clothes if you wanted tosomething superior i dont like it i should like you better if you were common  youre going to like me better he assured her because we are going to have a cocktail together within the next three minutes look at youpale as you can stick i bet you havent had a mouthful of food all day neither have i except a slice of bread and butter with my tea this morning were a nice sort of couple to talk about clothes what we want is food  she swayed for a moment and pretended that she tripped he caught her arm and steadied her she jerked it from him  have your own way she yielded  they reached the corner of the street plunged into the surging crowds of broadway passed into the huge restaurant were once more pounced upon by a businesslike but slightly patronizing maître dhôtel and escorted to a remote table in a sort of annex of the room philip pushed the menu away  two cocktailsthe quickest you ever mixed in your life he ordered quicker than that mind  the man was back again almost at once with two frosted glasses upon a tray they laughed together almost like children as they set them down empty  i know what i want and you too by the look of you he continueda beefsteak with some more of that green corn you gave me the other day and fried potatoes and burgundy well have some oysters first while we wait  she sighed  i dont mean to come here with you again she said a little impatiently i dont know why i give in to you youre not strong you know you are a weak man women will always look after you theyll always help you in troublei suppose theyll always care for you cant think why i do what you want me to guess i was near starving  he laughed  you dont know much about me yet he reminded her  you dont know much about yourself she retorted glibly why according to your own confession you only started life a few weeks ago i fancy what went before didnt count for much youve been fretted and tied up somewhere you havent had the chance of getting big like so many of our american men what are you going to do with this play of yours  miss elizabeth dalstan has promised to produce it he told her  she looked at him in some surprise  elizabeth dalstan she repeated why shes one of our best actresses  i understood so he replied she has heard the storyin fact i wrote out one of the scenes with her she is going to produce it as soon as its finished  well all you poor idiots who write things have some fine tale to tell their typewriter she remarked you seem as though you mean it though where did you meet elizabeth dalstan  i came over with her on the elletania he answered thoughtlessly  she gave a little start then she turned upon him almost in anger  well of all the simpletons she exclaimed so thats the way you give yourself away is it just here from jamaica eh nothing to do with douglas romilly never heard of the elletania did you id like to see you on the grid at police headquarters for five minutes with one of our men asking you a few friendly questions youd look well you would you ought to go about with a nurse  philip had all the appearance of a guilty child  you see he explained penitently i am new to this sort of thing however you know now  still ready to swear that youre not douglas romilly i suppose  on my honour i am not he replied  kind of funny that you should have been on the steamer after all she jeered  perhaps so but i am not douglas romilly he persisted  she was silent for a moment then she shrugged her shoulders  what do i care who your are she said here help me off with this raincoat please its warm in here thank goodness  he looked at her as she sat by his side in her plain black dress and was impressed for the first time with a certain unsuspected grace of outline which made him for the moment oblivious of the shabbiness of her gown  you have rather a nice figure he told her with a sudden impulse of ingenuousness  she turned upon him almost furiously something in his expression however seemed to disarm her she closed her lips again  you are nothing but a child she declared you dont mean anything id be a fool to be angry with you  the waiter brought their steak philip was conscious of something in his companions eyes which almost horrified him it was just that gleam of hungry desire which has starvation for its background  dont lets talk he pleaded there isnt any conversation in the world as good as this  the waiter served them and withdrew casting a curious glance behind they were from his point of view a strange couple for cosmopolitan though the restaurant was money was plentiful in the neighbourhood and clients as shabby as these two seldom presented themselves he pointed them out to a maître dhôtel who in his turn whispered a few words concerning them to a dark lanternjawed man with keen eyes and a hard mouth who was dining by himself the latter glanced at them and nodded  thank you charles he said ive had my eye on them the girls a pauper daughter of that old fool grimes the actor does a little typewritingprecious little i should think from the look of her the mans interesting dont talk about them understand  the maître dhôtel bowed  i understand inspector not much any one can tell you sir  pays his bill in american money i suppose the diner asked  ill ascertain for you mr dane charles replied i believe he is an englishman  name of merton ware the inspector agreed nodding just arrived from jamaica writes some sort of stuff which the girl with him typewrites thats his story hes probably as harmless as a baby  charles bowed and moved away his smile was inscrutable    chapter v  new york became a changed city to philip its roar and its turmoil its babel of tongues speaking to him always in some alien language were suddenly hushed he was no longer conscious of the hard unconcern of a million faces of the crude buildings in the streets the cutting winds the curious depressing sense of being on a desert island the hermit clutching at the sleeves of imaginary multitudes a few minutes journey in a cable car which seemed to crawl a few minutes swift walking along the broad thoroughfare of fifth avenue where his feet seemed to fall upon the air and the passersby seemed to smile upon him like real human beings and he was in her room it was only an hotel sitting room after all but eloquent of her a sitting room filled with great bowls of roses with comfortable easychairs furniture of rosecoloured satin white walls and an english fire upon the grate elizabeth was in new york and the world moved differently  she came out to him from an inner room almost at once his eyes swept over her feverishly he almost held his breath then he gave a great sigh of satisfaction she came with her hands outstretched a welcoming smile upon her lips she was just as he had expected to find her there was nothing in her manner to indicate that they had not parted yesterday  welcome to new york my dramatist she exclaimed i am here you see to the day almost to the hour  he stood there holding her hands his eyes seemed to be devouring her  go on talking to me he begged let me hear you speak you cant thinkyou cant imagine how often in the middle of the night i have waked up and thought of you and the cold shivers have come because after all i fancied that you must be a dream that you didnt really exist that that voyage had never existed go on talking  you foolish person she laughed patting his hands affectionately but then of course you are a little overwrought i am very real i can assure you i have been in chicago playing but there hasnt been a night when i havent thought of the times when we used to talk together in the darkness when you let me into your life and i made up my mind to try and help you foolish person sit down in that great easychair and draw it up to the fire  he sank into it with a little sigh of content she threw herself on to the couch opposite to him her hands drooped down a little wearily on either side her head was thrown back against the background of rosesilk cushions her cheeks seemed unexpectedly pale  i am tired with travelling she murmured and i hate chicago and i have worried about you day by day i have read the papers everything has gone well  so far as i know he answered i did exactly as we plannedor rather as you planned the papers have been full of the disappearance of douglas romilly you read how wonderfully it has all turned out fate has provided him with a real reason for disappearing it seems that the business was bankrupt  you mustnt forget though she reminded him that that also supplies a considerable motive for tracking him down he is supposed to have at least twenty thousand pounds with him  i have all the papers he went on they prove that he knew the state the business was in they prove that he really intended to disappear in new york the money stands to the credit of merton wareand another at a bank with which his firm apparently had had no connections a small bank in wall street  so that she remarked is where you get your pseudonym from  it makes the identification so easy he pointed out and no one knew of it except he i could easily get a witness presently to prove that i am merton ware  you havent drawn the money yet then  i havent been near the bank he replied i still have over a thousand dollarsmoney he had with him sometimes i think that if i could id like to leave that twenty thousand pounds where it is i should like some day if i could do so without suspicion to let the creditors of the firm have it back again what do you think  she nodded  i would rather you didnt touch it yourself she agreed i think youll find too that youll be able to earn quite enough without wanting it nothing disturbing has happened to you at all then  once i had a fright he told her i was in a restaurant close to my hotel i was there with a young woman who is typing the play for me  she looked towards him incredulously  you were there with a typewriter she exclaimed  i suppose it seems queer he admitted it didnt to me she is a plain shabby half starved little thing fighting her own battle bravely she came to me for workshe lives in the flat belowand it seemed to me that she was just as hungry for a kind word as i was lonely and i took her out with me twice i have taken her her name is miss grimes  i am not in the least sure that i approve she said but go on  a friend of hers came into the restaurant a girl in the chorus of a musical comedy here and she had with her a young man i recognised him at once we didnt come across one another much but he was on the steamer  elizabeths face was full of concern  go on  he asked me twice if i wasnt mr romilly i assured him that he was mistaken i dont think i gave myself away the next day he went to see the girl i was with martha grimes  well what did she tell him  she told him that she had been typing my work for over a month that i had come from jamaica and that my name was merton ware  elizabeth gazed into the fire for several moments and philip watched her it was a womans face grave and thoughtful a little perturbed just then as though by some unwelcome thought presently she looked back at him looked into his eyes long and earnestly  my friend she said you are like no one else on earth perhaps you are one of those horrible people who have what they call an unholy influence over my sex you have known this girl for a matter of a few days and she lies for you and theres five hundred dollars reward i suppose she knew about that  yes she knew he admitted she simply isnt that sort i suppose i realised that or i shouldnt have been kind to her  its a puzzle she went on i think there must be something in you of the weakling you know something that appeals to the mothering instinct in women i know that my first feeling for you was that i wanted to help you tell me what you think of yourself mr philip merton ware are you a faithful person are you conscientious have you a heart i wonder how much of the man is there underneath that strong frame of yours are you going to take just the things that are given you in life and make no return for the moment you see i am forgetting that you are my friend and that i like you i am thinking of you from the point of view of an actressas a psychical problem philip you idiot she broke off suddenly stamping her foot dont sit there looking at me with your great eyes tell me you are glad ive come back tell me you feel something for goodness sake  he was on his knees before she could check him his arms his lips praying for her she thrust him back  it was my fault she declared but dont please yes of course you have feelings i dont know why you tempted me to that little outburst  youll tempt me to more than that he cried passionately do you think its for your help that ive thought of you do you think its because youre an angel to me because youve comforted me in my darkest most miserable hours that ive dreamed of you and craved for you theres more than that in my thoughts dear its because you are you yourself that ive longed for you through the aching hours of the night that ive sat and written like a man beside himself just for the joy of thinking that the words i wrote would be spoken by you oh if you want me to tell you what i feel  she suddenly leaned forward took his head between her hands and kissed his forehead  now get back please to your chair she begged youve stilled the horrible miserable little doubt that was tearing at my heartstrings i just had it before once or twice and thenisnt it foolishyour telling me about this little typewriter girl i must go and see her we must be kind to her  he resumed his seat with a little sigh  she thought a great deal more of me and my work when i told her that you were probably going to act in my play  her expression changed she was more serious at the same time more eager  ah the play she exclaimed i can see that you have brought some of it  he drew the roll of manuscript from his pocket  shall i read it he suggested  she almost snatched it away no i cant wait for that give it to me quickly  she leaned forward so that the firelight fell upon the pages little strands of soft brown hair drooped over her face in studying her philip almost forgot his own anxiety he had known so few women yet he had watched so many from afar off endowed them with their natural qualities built up their lives and tastes for them and found them all so sadly wanting to him elizabeth represented everything that was desirable in her sex from the flowing lines of her beautiful body to the sympathy which seemed to be always shining out of her eyes notwithstanding her strength she was so exquisitely and entirely feminine a creature of silk and laces free from any effort of provocativeness yet subtly almost clamorously human he forgot in those few moments that she had become the arbitress of his material fatethat he was a humble author watching the effect of his first attempts upon a mistress in her profession he remembered only that she was the woman who was filling his life stealing into every corner of it permeating him with love pointing him onwards towards a life indescribable unrealisable  she swung suddenly towards him there was a certain amount of enthusiasm in her face but even more marked was her relief  oh i am so glad she cried you know i have had qualms when you told me the story in your own words picking your language so carefully and building it all up before me well you know what i said i gave you more than hopei promised you success and then when i got away into the hard stagey world of chicago and my manager talked business to me and my last playwright preached of technique i began to wonder whether after all you could bring your ideas together like this whether you would have a sense of perspectiveyou know what i mean dont you and you have it and the play is going to be wonderful and i shall produce it why dont you look pleased mr author you are going to be famous  he smiled  i dont care about fame he said and for the rest i think i knew  conceited she exclaimed  it wasnt that he protested it was simply when i sat down in that little room high up over the roofs and buildings of a strange city shut myself in and told myself that it was for youwell the thoughts came too easily they tumbled over one another and when i looked away from my work i saw the people moving around me and i knew that i had made my dreams real and thats the great thing isnt it elizabeth  well  i am lonely in that little room  you lonely taking out typewriters to dine she mocked tenderly  it is lonely he repeated and i am afraid of you here in all this luxury i am so far away i come from my attic to this and i am afraid do you know why  she sat quite still for a moment dimly she felt the presage of a coming change in their relations up to now she had been the mistress she had held him so easily in check with her practised skill with an unfinished sentence a look a touch and now the man was rising up in him and she felt her powers weaken  shall i change my abode she murmured  ah but you would be just as wonderful and as far away even if we changed placesif you sat in my attic and i took your place here that isnt why i torture myself why i am always asking myself if you are real if the things we talk about are real if the things we feel belong to ourselves well up from our own hearts for one another or are just the secondary emotions of other people we catch up without knowing why this is foolish but you understandyou do understand it is because you keep me so far away from yourself when my fingers are burning for yours when even to touch your face to feel your cheek against mine would banish every fear i have ever had elizabeth you do understand i have never kissed you i have never held you for one moment in my armsand i love you  he was leaning over her chair and she held him tightly by the shoulders there was nothing left of that hidden fear in his dark eyes they shone now with another light and she began to tremble  i wanted to wait a little philip but if you feel like thatwell i cant  he took her silently into his arms with the half closing of her eyes the first touch of her responsive lips himself dimly conscious of the change he passed into the world where stronger men live     book iii    chapter i  three months later a very different philip stood in the smaller of a handsome suite of reception rooms in a fashionable fifth avenue hotel he was wearing evening clothes of the most approved cut and carried himself with a dignity and assurance entirely transforming the distinction of birth and breeding little apparent in those halfstarved passionate days of his misery had come easily to the surface his shoulders too seemed to have broadened and his face had lost its cadaverous pallor  the apartment in which he stood was plainly but handsomely furnished as a small withdrawing room on the oak chiffonier stood a silver tray on which were half a dozen frosted cocktails through the curtains was apparent a room beyond in which a round table smothered with flowers was arranged for supper in the distance from the public restaurant came the sound of softly played music philip glanced at the clock the whole of the anxieties of this momentous evening had passed telephone messages had reached him every quarter of an hour the play was a great success elizabeth was coming to him with her producer and a few theatrical friends flushed with triumph they were all to meet for the first time that night the man who for the last three months had lived as a hermitmerton ware the author of the house of shams the newfound dramatist  a maître dhôtel appeared in the space between the two rooms and bowed  everything is quite ready mr ware he said in the friendly yet deferential manner of an american headwaiter wont you take a cocktail sir while you are waiting  very thoughtful of you louis i think i will philip assented taking a little case from his pocket and lighting a cigarette  the man passed him a glass upon a small salver  youll pardon the liberty i am sure sir he continued dropping his voice a little ive just heard that the house of shams seems to be a huge success sir if i might take the liberty of offering my congratulations  philip smiled genially  you are the first louis he said thank you very much indeed  i think you will find the supper everything that could be desired mr ware the man went on our head chef monsieur raconnot has given it his personal attention the wine will be slightly iced as you desired i shall be outside in the corridor to announce the guests  capital louis ware replied sipping his cocktail it will be another quarter of an hour yet before we see anything of them i am afraid  the man disappeared and left philip once more alone he looked through the walls of the room as though indeed he could see into the packed theatre and could hear the cries for author which even then were echoing through the house from the moment when elizabeth abandoning her reserve had given him the love he craved a new strength seemed to have shone out of the man step by step he had thought out subtly and with infinite care every small detail of his life it was he who had elected to live those three months in absolute seclusion it was he indirectly who had arranged that many more photographs of douglas romilly the english shoe manufacturer should appear in the newspapers one moments horror he had certainly had he could see the little paragraph now almost lost in the shoals of more important news    ghastly discovery in a derbyshire canal    yesterday the police recovered the body of a man   who had apparently been dead for some weeks from   a canal close to detton magna the body was   unrecognisable but it is believed that the remains   are those of mr philip romilly the missing art   teacher from london who is alleged to have   committed suicide in january last  the thought of that gruesome find scarcely blanched his cheeks his nerves now were stronger and tenser things he crushed back those memories with all the strength of his will whatever might lie behind he had struck for the future which he meant to live and enjoy they were only weaklings who brooded over an unalterable past it was for the present and the near future that he lived and both in that moment were more alluring than ever before even his intellectual powers seemed to have developed in his newfound happiness the play which he had written every line of which appeared to gain in vital and literary force towards its conclusion was only the first of his children already other images and ideas were flowing into his brain the power of creation was triumphantly throwing out its tendrils he was filled with an amazing and almost inspired confidence he was ready to start upon fresh work that hour tomorrow or when he chose and before him now was the prospect of stimulating companionship elizabeth and he had decided that the time had come for him to take his fate into his hands he was to be introduced to the magnates of the dramatic profession to become a clubman in the worlds most hospitable city to mix freely in the circles where he would find himself in constant association with the keenest brains and most brilliant men of letters in the world he was safe they had both decided it  he walked to the mirror and looked at himself the nervous highlystrung halfstarved neurotic stripling had become the perfectly assured wellmannered and welldressed man of the world he had studied various details with a peculiar care suffered a barber to take summary measures with his overlong black hair had accustomed himself to the use of an eyeglass which hung around his neck by a thin black ribbon men might talk of likenesses men who were close students of their fellows yet there was no living person who could point to him and sayyou are beyond a shadow of doubt a man with whom i travelled on the elletania the thing was impossible  louis once more made a noiseless appearance there was the slightest of frowns upon his face  a gentleman wishes a word with you before the arrival of your guests mr ware he announced  a journalist philip enquired carelessly  i do not think so sir  even as he spoke the door was opened and closed again the man who had entered bowed slightly to philip he was tall and cleanshaven selfassured and with manner almost significantly reserved he held a bowler hat in his hand and glanced towards louis he had the air of being somewhat out of place in so fashionable a rendezvous  good evening mr ware he began could i have just a word with you  philip nodded to louis who at once left the room the newcomer drew a little nearer  my name sir he said is daneedward dane  philip bowed politely he was just a little annoyed at the intrusion an annoyance which he failed altogether to conceal  what do you want with me he asked i am expecting some friends to supper in about ten minutes  ten minutes will perhaps be sufficient for what i have to say the other promised you dont know me then mr ware  never saw you before to the best of my knowledge philip replied nonchalantly are you a journalist  the man laid his hat upon a corner of the table  i am a detective he said attached to the cherry street headquarters your last rooms mr ware were in my beat  philip nodded with some slight indication of interest he faced his ordeal with the courage of a man of steel  that so he remarked indifferently well mr dane i have heard a good deal about you american detectives pleased to meet you what can i do for you  the detective eyed philip steadfastly there was just the shadow of something that looked like admiration in his hard grey eyes  well mr ware he said nothing that need disturb your supper party i am sure over in this country we sometimes do things in an unusual way thats why i am paying you this visit i have been watching you for exactly three months and fourteen days  watching me philip repeated  precisely no idea why i suppose  not the slightest  the detective glanced towards the clock barely two minutes had passed  well he explained i got on your tracks quick enough when you skipped from the waldorf and blossomed out in a secondrate tenement house as merton ware  so i was at the waldorf was i philip murmured  you crossed from liverpool on the elletania the man continued registered at the waldorf as mr douglas romilly of the douglas romilly shoe company went to your room changed your clothes and disappeared of course a disappearance of that sort he went on tolerantly might be possible in london in new york to even attempt it is farcical  dear me remarked philip this is very interesting let me ask you this question though if you were so sure of your facts why didnt you arrest me at once instead of just watching me  the mans eyes were like gimlets he seemed as though he were trying with curious and professional intensity to read the thoughts in philips brain  there is no criminal charge against douglas romilly that i know of he said  theres a considerable reward offered for his discovery philip reminded him  i can claim that at any moment the man replied i have had my reasons for waiting its partly those reasons that have brought me here for one thing mr douglas romilly was supposed to be able to put his hand on a matter of a hundred thousand dollars somewhere in new york you havent shown many signs up till now mr ware of having any such sum in your possession  i see philip assented you wanted the money as well  the creditors of the douglas romilly shoe company are wanting it pretty badly the man proceeded but that wasnt all i wanted to find out what your game was that i dont know even now that is why i have come to you have i the pleasure of speaking to mr douglas romilly  i really dont see philip protested thoughtfully why i should go into partnership with you in this affair you see in the long run our interests might not be altogether identical  mr dane smiled grimly  thats a fairly shrewd calculation mr ware he admitted you aint bound to answer any question you dont want to this is just a friendly chat and no more  besides philip continued lighting another cigarette i think i understood you to say that you had already arrived at the conclusion that i was douglas romilly  not precisely that the detective replied all that i discovered was that you were the man who registered at the waldorf hotel as mr douglas romilly  well the only name i choose to acknowledge at present is the name of merton ware philip declared if you think there is any mystery about me any connection with the gentleman whom i believe you call mr douglas romilly well the matter is one for your investigation you will forgive me if i remind you that my guests will be here in a matter of a few minutes and permit me to ask you one more question why do you come here to me in this very unofficial manner if i am really an impostor you are giving me every opportunity of clearing out  mr edward dane shook his head he was fingering the brim of his hat  oh no mr ware he declared smoothly our detective system may have some faults but when a mans name is put on the list where yours figures he has not one chance in a million of leaving the country or of gaining any place of hiding i shall know where you lunch tomorrow and with whom you dine and with whom you spend your time the law sir will keep its eye upon you  really that seems very friendly philip said coolly shall i have the privilege of your personal surveillance  i think not mr ware to tell you the truth this is rather a ppc visit ive booked my passage  on the elletania sailing tomorrow from new york i am taking a trip over to england to make a few enquiries round about the spot where this mr douglas romilly hails fromdetton magna isnt it  philip made no reply yet even his silence might well have been the silence of indifference  at the last moment the detective concluded it flashed in upon me that there might be some ridiculous explanation of the few little points about your case which i must confess have puzzled me for that reason i decided to seek an interview with you before i left you have however i gather nothing to say to me  nothing at all mr dane except to wish you a pleasant voyage philip declared i wont detain you a moment longer i hear my guests in the corridor good night sir he added opening the door i appreciate your call very much come and see me again when you return from england  mr dane lingered for a moment upon the threshold hat in hand a somewhat ominous figure there was no attempt at a handshake between the two men the detective was imperturbable philip listening to elizabeths voice had shown his first sign of impatience  i shall surely do that mr ware the other promised as he passed out  the door closed philip stood for a moment in the empty room listening to the mans retreating footsteps then he turned slowly around his cheeks were blanched his eyes were glazed with reminiscent horror he looked through the wall of the rooma long way back  we shall find mr ware in here i expect he could hear the voices of his approaching guests  he ground his heel into the carpet and swung around he anticipated louis threw open the curtain and stood there waiting to welcome his guests a smile upon his lips his hands outstretched towards elizabeth    chapter ii  elizabeths face was glowing with joy for the first time philip realised that she too had had her anxieties  you dear dear man she exclaimed to think what you have missed it would have been the evening of your life its a success do you heara great success it was wonderful  he seemed almost to himself to be playing a part he was so calm yet so gracefully happy  i am glad for both our sakes he said  she indicated the others with a little wave of the hand  i dont think you know a soul do you she asked they none of them quite believe in your existence down at the theatre this is my leading man noel bridges you should have seen how splendid he was as carriston  mr noel bridges with a deprecating smile towards elizabeth held out his hand he was tall and of rather a rugged type for the new york stage like the rest of the little party his eyes were full of curiosity as he shook hands with philip  so you are something human after all he remarked we began to think you lived underground and only put your head up every now and then for a little air i am glad to meet you mr ware i enjoy acting in your play very much indeed and i hope its only the first of many  you are very kind philip murmured cordially  elizabeth glanced around the little group  dear me i am forgetting my manners she declared i ought to have presented you to sara denison first sara is really the star of your play mr ware although i have the most work to do she loves her part and has asked about you nearly every day  miss denison a young lady of the smaller gibson type with large eyes and a very constant smile greeted philip warmly  do you know she told him that this is the first time i have ever been in a play in which the author hasnt been round setting us to rights most of the time i cant imagine how you kept away mr ware  perhaps observed philip my absence has contributed to your success i am sure i shouldnt have known what to tell you you see i am so absolutely ignorant of the technique  ive got to shake hands with you mr ware a stout middleaged cleanshaven man with narrow black eyes and pale cheeks declared stepping forward these other folk dont count for much by the side of me i am the manager of the theatre and im thundering glad that your first play has been produced at the new york sir theres good stuff in it and if i am any judge and im supposed to be theres plenty of better stuff behind shake hands if you please sir you know me by namepaul fink i hope youll see my signature at the bottom of a good many fat cheques before youve finished writing plays  thats very nice of you mr fink philip declared now i am sure you all want your supper  at a sign from philip the maître dhôtel handed round the tray of cocktails mr fink raised his glass  heres success to the play he exclaimed and good luck to all of us  he tossed off the contents of the glass and they all followed his example then they took their places at the little round table and the service of supper began the conversation somewhat naturally centered around philip the three strangers were all interested in his personality and the fact that he had no previous work to his credit it was unusual almost dramatic and for a time both elizabeth and he himself found themselves hard put to it to escape the constant wave of goodnatured but very pertinent questions  youll have a dose of our newspapermen tomorrow sir mr fink promised him theyll be buzzing around you all day long theyll want to know everything from where you get your clothes and what cigarettes you smoke to how you like best to do your work and what complexioned typist you prefer theyre some boys i can tell you  philips eyes met elizabeths across the table the same instinct of disquietude kept them both for a moment silent  i am afraid elizabeth sighed that mr ware will find it rather hard to appreciate some of our journalistic friends  theyre good fellows mr fink declared heartily white men all of them so long as you dont try to put em off on a false stunt or anything of that sort theyll sling the ink about some ed harris was in my room just after the second act and he showed me some of his stuff i tell you he means to boost us  elizabeth laid her hand upon her managers arm  theyre delightful every one of them she agreed but mr fink you have such influence with them i wonder if i dare give you just a hint mr ware has passed through some very painful times lately he is so anxious to forget and i really dont wonder at it myself i am sure he will be delighted to talk with all of them as to the future and his future plans but do you think you could just drop them a hint to go quietly as regards the past  mr fink was a little perplexed but inclined to be sympathetic he glanced towards philip who was deep in conversation with sara denison  why ill do my best miss dalstan he promised you know what the boys are though they do love a story  i am not going to have mr wares story published in every newspaper in new york elizabeth said firmly and the newspaper man who worms the history of mr wares misfortunes out of him and then makes use of it will be no friend of mine ask them to be sports mr fink theres a dear  ill do what i can he promised mr ware isnt the first man in the world who has funked the limelight and from what i can see of him it probably wasnt his fault if things did go a little crooked in the past ill do my best miss dalstan i promise you that ill look in at the club tonight and drop a few hints around  elizabeth patted his hand and smiled at him very sweetly the conversation flowed back once more into its former channels became a medley of confused chaff disjointed streams of congratulation of toastdrinking and pleasant speeches then mr fink suddenly rose to his feet  say he exclaimed weve all drunk one anothers healths theres just one other friend i think we ought to take a glass of wine with gee hed give something to be with us tonight youll agree with me miss dalstan i know lets empty a full glass to sylvanus power  there was a curious silence for a second or two then a clamour of assenting voices for a single moment philip felt a sharp pang at his heart elizabeth was gazing steadily out of the room a queer tremble at her lips a look in her eyes which puzzled him a look almost of fear of some sort of apprehension the moment passed but her enthusiasm as she raised her glass was a little overdone her gaiety too easily assumed  why of course she declared fancy not thinking of sylvanus  they drank his health noisily philip set down his glass empty a curious instinct kept his lips sealed he crushed down and stifled the memory of that sudden stab he did not even ask the one natural question  say where is sylvanus power these days mr fink enquired  in honolulu when last i heard elizabeth replied lightly but then one never knows really where he is  philip became naturally the central figure of the little gathering mr fink was anxious to arrange a little dinner to introduce him to some fellow workers noel bridges insisted upon a card for the lambs club and a luncheon there philip accepted gratefully everything that was offered to him it was no good doing things by halves he told himself the days of his solitude were over even when after the departure of his guests he glanced for a moment into the anteroom beyond and remembered those few throbbing moments of suspense they came back to him with a curious sense of unrealitythey belonged surety to some other man living in some other world  you are happy elizabeth murmured as she took his arm and they waited in the portico below for her automobile  he had no longer any idea of telling her of that disquieting visit the touch of her hair blown against his cheek as he had helped her on with her cloak something in her voice some slight diffidence a queer half expostulating look in the eyes that fell with a curious uneasiness before his drove every thought of future danger out of his mind he had at least the present he answered without a moments hesitation  for the first time in my life  she gave the chauffeur a whispered order as she stepped into the car  i have told him to go home by riverside drive she said as they glided off it is a little farther and i love the air at this time of night  he clasped her fingerssuddenly felt with the leaning of her body her heart beating against his with that wave of passion there was an instant and portentous change in their attitudes the soft protectiveness which had sometimes seemed to shine out of her face to envelop him in its warmth had disappeared she was no longer the stronger she looked at him almost with fear and he was electrically conscious of all the vigour and strength of his stunted manhood was master at last of his fate accepting battle willing to fight whatever might come for the sake of the joy of these moments she crept into his arms almost humbly    chapter iii  the success of the house of shams was as immediate and complete as was the social success of its author after a few fainthearted attempts philip and elizabeth both agreed that the wisest course was to play the bold gameto submit himself to the photographer the interviewer and to some judicious extent to the wave of hospitality which flowed in upon him from all sides he threw aside completely and utterly every idea of leading a more or less sheltered life his photograph was in the sunday newspapers and the magazines it was quite easy in satisfying the appetite of journalists for copious personal details especially after the hints dropped by mr fink to keep them carefully off the subject of his immediate past there had been many others in the world who on attaining fame had preferred to gloss over their earlier history it seemed to be tacitly understood amongst this wonderful freemasonry of newspaper men that mr merton ware was to be humoured in this way he was a man of the present character sketches of him were to be all foreground but nevertheless philip had his trials  want to introduce you to one of our chief movie men noel bridges said to him one day in the smoking room of the lambs he is much interested in the play too mr raymond greene shake hands with mr merton ware  mr raymond greene smiling and urbane turned around with outstretched hand which philip courteous and with all that charm of manner which was making him speedily one of the most popular young men in new york grasped cordially  i am very happy to meet you mr greene he said you represent an amazing development i am told that we shall all have to work for you presently or find our occupation gone  with a cool calculation which had come to philip in these days of his greater strength he had purposely extended his sentence conscious although apparently he ignored the fact that all the time mr raymond greene was staring in his face with a bewilderment which was not without its humorous side he was too much a man of the world this great picture producer to be at a loss for words to receive an introduction with any degree of clumsiness  but surely he almost stammered we have met before  philip shook his head doubtfully  i dont think so he said as a matter of fact i am sure we havent because you are one of the men whom i hoped some day to come across over here i couldnt possibly have forgotten a meeting with you  mr raymond greenes blue eyes looked as though they saw visions  but surely he expostulated the elletaniamy table on the elletania when miss dalstan crossed  philip laughed easily  why he exclaimed are you going to be like the others and take me forwasnt it mr romillythe man who disappeared from the waldorf why ive been tracked all round new york because of my likeness to that man  likeness mr raymond greene muttered likeness  there was a moments silence then mr greene knew that the time had arrived for him to pull himself together he had carried his bewilderment to the very limits of good breeding  well well he continued fortunately its six oclock and i can offer you gentlemen a cocktail for upon my word i need it come to look at you mr ware theres a trifle more what i might term savoir faire about you that chap on the boat was a little crude in places but believe me sir he went on thrusting his arm through wares and leading him towards the bar you dont want to be annoyed at those people who have mistaken you for romilly for in the whole course of my life and ive travelled round the world a pretty good deal i never came across a likeness so entirely extraordinary  i have heard other people mention it noel bridges intervened although not quite with the same conviction as you mr greene curiously enough however the photograph of romilly which they sent out from england and which was in all the sunday papers didnt strike me as being particularly like mr ware  it was a damned bad photograph that mr raymond greene pronounced i saw itcouldnt make head nor tail of it myself well the world is full of queer surprises but this is the queerest i ever ran up against believe me mr ware if this man romilly who disappeared had been a millionaire you could have walked into his family circle and been made welcome at the present moment why i dont believe his own wife or sister if he had such appendages would have been able to tell that you werent the man  unfortunately bridges remarked as he sipped the cocktail which the cinema man had ordered this chap romilly was broke wasnt hedid a scoot to avoid the smashup they say that he had a few hundred thousand dollars over here ostensibly for buying material and that he has taken the lot out west  well i must say he didnt seem that sort on the steamer mr raymond greene declared but you never can tell looked to me more like a schoolteacher some day mr ware i want you to come along to my officeits just round the corner in broadway thereand have a chat about the play  you dont want to film us before weve finished its first run surely philip protested laughing give us a chance  well well talk about that the cinema magnate promised  they were joined by other acquaintances and philip presently made his escape one of the moments which he had dreaded more than any other had come and passed even if mr raymond greene had still some slight misgivings he was to all effects and purposes convinced philip walked down the street feeling that one more obstacle in the path of his absolute freedom had been torn away he glanced at his watch and boarded a downtown car descended in the heart of the city region of broadway and threaded his way through several streets until he came to the back entrance of a dry goods store here he glanced once more at his watch and commenced slowly to walk up and down the timekeeper who was standing in the doorway with his hands in his pockets watched him with interest when philip approached for the third time he addressed him in friendly fashion  waiting for one of our gals eh  philip stifled his quick annoyance and answered in as matteroffact a tone as possible  yes how long will it be before they are out from the typewriting department  typewriting department the man repeated well that depends some upon the work theyll be out most likely in ten minutes or so i guessed you were after one of our showroom young ladies we get some real swells down here sometimesmotor cars of their own the typists aint much as a rule its a skinny job theirs  the young ladies from here appear to be prosperous ware remarked i watched them last night coming out my friend happened to be late and i had to leave without seeing her  thats nothing to go by their clothes aint the man replied they spend all their money on their backs instead of putting it inside if its miss grimes youre waiting for youre in luck for here she is first out  philip drew a little into the background the girl came down the stone passage passed the timekeeper without appearing to notice his familiar goodevening and stepped out into the murky street philip who saw her face as she emerged from the gloom gave a little start she seemed paler than ever and she walked with her eyes fixed upon vacancy as though almost unconscious of her whereabouts she crossed the sidewalk without noticing the curbstone and stumbled at the unexpected depth of it philip stepped hastily forward  miss grimes he exclaimed martha why do you look at me as though i were a ghost  she started violently it was certain that she saw him then for the first time  you mr ware sorry i didnt see you  he insisted upon shaking hands there was a little streak of colour in her cheeks now  i came to meet you he explained i came yesterday and missed you i have been to your rooms four times and only found out with difficulty where you were working the last time i called i rang the bell six times but the door was locked  i was in bed she said shortly i cant have gentlemen callers there at all now fathers gone off on tour thank you for coming to meet me but i dont think youd better stop  why not he asked gently  because i dont want to be seen about with you she declared because i dont want you to look at me because i want you to leave me alone she added with a little passionate choke in her voice  he turned and walked by her side  martha he said you were very kind to me when i needed it you were a companion to me when i was more miserable than i ever thought any human being could be i was in a quandary thenin a very difficult position i took a plunge in a way i have been successful  oh we all know that she replied bitterly pictures everywhere notices in the paper all the timeyou and your fine play ive seen it didnt think much of it myself but i suppose im not a judge  tell me why you came out there looking as though youd seen a ghost he asked  discharged she answered promptly  why  fainted yesterday she went on and was a bit wobbly today the head clerk said he wanted some one stronger  brute philip muttered well thats all right martha i have some work for you  dont want to do your work  little fool he exclaimed martha do you know youre the most obstinate pigheaded prejudiced illtempered little beast i ever knew  then go along and leave me she insisted stopping short if im all that  youre also a dear  she drew a little breath and looked at him fiercely  now dont be silly he begged im starving i had no lunch so that i could dine early here we are at durrads  im not going inside there with you she declared  look here he expostulated are we going to do a wrestling act on the sidewalk it will be in all the papers you know  spoil your clothes some wouldnt it she remarked looking at them disparagingly  it would indeed also my temper he assured her we are going to have a cocktail you and i within two minutes young lady and a steak afterwards if you want to go in there with my hand on your neck you can but i think it would look better  she set her feet squarely upon the ground and faced him  mr ware she said i am in ragsany one can see that listen i will not go into a restaurant and sit by your side to have people wonder what woman from the streets you have brought in to give a meal to out of charity do you hear that i can live or i can die just by myself if i cant keep myself ill die but i wont nothing doing you hear  she had been so strong and then something in his eyes that pitying half anxious expression with which he listened suddenly seemed to sap her determination she swayed a little upon her feetshe was indeed very tired and very weak philip took instant advantage of her condition without a moments hesitation he passed his arm firmly through hers and before she could protest she was inside the place being led to a table seated there with her back to the wall with a confused tangle of words still in her throat unuttered then two great tears found their way into her eyes she said nothing because she could not philip was busy talking to the waiter soon there was a cocktail by her side and he was drinking smiling at her perfectly goodnatured obviously accepting her momentary weakness and his triumph as a joke  got you in didnt i he observed pleasantly now remember you told me the way to drink american cocktailsone look one swallow and down they go  she obeyed him instinctively then she took out a miserable little piece of a handkerchief and wiped her eyes  whats gone wrong he asked briskly tell me all about it  father went off on tour she explained he left the rent owing for a month and hes been writing for money all the time the agent who comes round doesnt listen to excuses you pay or out you go into the street ive paid somehow and nearly starved over it then i got this job after worrying about it lord knows how long and this evening im discharged  how much a week was it he enquired with sympathy  ten dollars she replied little enough but i cant live without it  he changed his attitude suddenly realising the volcanic sensitiveness of her attitude towards him and life in general instinctively he felt that at a single illconsidered word she would even then in her moment of weakness have left him have pushed him on one side and walked out to whatever she might have to face  what a fool you are he exclaimed a little brusquely  am i she replied belligerently  of course you are you call yourself a daughter of new york a city whose motto seems to be pretty well every one for himself you know you did my typing all right you know my play was a success you know that i shall have to write another what made you take it for granted that i shouldnt want to employ you and go and hide yourself lock the door when i came to see you because it was past eight oclock and not answer my letters  cant have men callers now dads away she told him a little brusquely its not allowed  oh rubbish he answered irritably that isnt the point youve kept away from me youve deliberately avoided me you knew that i was just as lonely as you were  then she blazed out the sallowness of her cheeks the little dip under her cheekbonesshe had grown thinner during the last week or somade her eyes seem larger and more brilliant than ever  you lonely rubbish why theyre all running after you everywhere quite a social success according to the papers i say aint you afraid  horribly he admitted and about the one person i could have talked to about it chucks me  i dont know anything about you or what youve done she said i only know that the tecs  he laid his hand upon her fingers she snatched them away but accepted his warning they were served then with their meal and their conversation drifted into other channels  well he continued presently in a perfectly matteroffact tone ive found you now and youve got to be sensible its true ive had a stroke of luck but that might fall away at any moment ive typing waiting for you or i can get you a post at the new york theatre youd better first do my typing ill have it in your rooms tomorrow morning by nine oclock and would you like something in advance  no she replied grudgingly ill have what ive earned when ive earned it  he sipped his claret and studied her meditatively  youre not much of a pal are you  she scoffed at him looked him up and down at his wellfitting clothes his general air of prosperity  pal she jeered look at youmerton ware the great dramatist and mea shabby ugly badtempered indifferent typewriter badtempered she repeated yes i am that i didnt start out to be i just havent had any luck  it will all come some day he assured her cheerfully  i think if youd stayed different she went on thoughtfully if you hadnt slipped away into the clouds  shows what a selfish little beast i am cant imagine why you bother about me  shall i tell you why really he asked because you saved mei dont know what from the night we went out i was suffering from a loneliness which was the worst torture i have ever felt it was there in my throat and dragging down my heart and i just felt as though any way of ending it all would be a joy all these millions of hardfaced people intent on their own prosperity or their own petty troubles goaded me i think into a sort of silent fury just that one night i craved like a madman for a single human being to talk towell i shall never forget it martha  miss grimes she interrupted under her breath  he laughed  that doesnt really matter does it he asked youve never been afraid that i should want to make love to you have you  she glanced round into the mirror by their side looked at her wan face the shabby little hat the none too tidily arranged hair which drooped over her ears down at her shapeless jacket her patched skirt the shoes which were in open rebellion then she laughed curiously enough without any note of bitterness  seems queer doesnt it even to think of such a thing ive been up against it pretty hard though a man who gives a meal to a girl even if she is as plain as i am generally seems to think hes bought her in this city even the men who are earning money dont give much for nothing but you are different she admitted ill be fair about ityoure different  youll be waiting for the work at nine oclock tomorrow morning he asked as indifferently as possible  i will she promised  he leaned back and told her little anecdotes about the play things that had happened to him during the last few weeks speaking often of elizabeth dalstan by degrees the nervous unrest seemed to pass away from her when they had finished their meal and drunk their coffee she was almost normal she smoked a cigarette and even accepted the box which he thrust into her hand when he had paid the bill she rose a little abruptly  well she said youve had your way and a kind nice way it was now ill have mine i dont want any politeness when we leave this place i am going to walk home and i am going to walk home alone  thats lucky he replied because i have to be at the theatre in ten minutes to meet a cinema man button up your coat and have a good nights sleep  they left the place together she turned away with a farewell nod and walked rapidly eastwards he watched her cross the road a poor little waif she seemed except that something had gone from her face which had almost terrified him she carried herself he fancied with more buoyancy with infinitely more confidence and he drew a sigh of relief as he called for a taxi    chapter iv  elizabeth paused for breath at the top of the third flight of stairs she leaned against the iron balustrade  you poor dear she exclaimed how many times a day did you have to do this  i didnt go out very often he reminded her and it wasnt every day that the lift was out of order its only one more flight  she looked up the stairs sighed and raised her smart grey tailormade skirt a little higher over her shoes  well she announced heroically lead on if they would sometimes dust these stepsbut after all it doesnt matter to you now does it fancy that poor girl though  he smiled a little grimly  a few flights of stairs arent the worst things she has had to face im afraid he said  i am rather terrified of her elizabeth confided supporting herself by her companions shoulder i think i know that ultraindependent type kick me if i put my foot in it is this the door  philip nodded and knocked softly there was a sharp come in  put the key down please the figure at the typewriter said as they entered  the words had scarcely left marthas lips before she turned around conscious of some other influence in the room philip stepped forward  miss grimes he said i have brought miss dalstan in to see you she wants  he paused something in the stony expression of the girl who had risen to her feet and stood now facing them her ashen paleness unrelieved by any note of colour her hands hanging in front of her patched and shabby frock seemed to check the words upon his lips her voice was low but not soft it seemed to create at once an atmosphere of anger and resentment  what do you want she demanded  i hope you dont mindi am so anxious that you should do some work for me elizabeth explained when mr ware first brought me in his play i noticed how nicely it was typewritten you must have been glad to find it turn out such a success  i take no interest in my work when once it is typed martha grimes declared and i am very sorry but i do not like to receive visitors i am very busy mr ware knows quite well that i like to be left alone  elizabeth smiled at her delightfully  but it isnt always good for us is it she reminded her to live exactly as we would like or to have our own way in all things  there was a moments rather queer silence martha grimes seemed to be intent upon studying the appearance of her visitor the very beautiful woman familiar to nearly every one in new york perhaps at that moment americas most popular actress her eyes seemed to dwell upon the little strands of fair hair that escaped from beneath her smart but simple hat to take in the slightly deprecating lift of the eyebrows the very attractive half appealing smile the smart grey tailormade gown with the bunch of violets in her waistband elizabeth was as quietly dressed as it was possible for her to be but her appearance nevertheless brought a note of some other world into the shabby little apartment  its the only thing i ask of life martha said the only thing i get i want to be left alone and i will be left alone if there is any more work i will do it if there isnt i can find some somewhere else but visitors i dont want and wont have  elizabeth was adorably patient she surreptitiously drew towards her a cane chair a doubtfullooking article of furniture upon which she seated herself slowly and with great care  well she continued with unabated pleasantness that is reasonable as far as it goes only we didnt quite understand and it is such a climb up here isnt it i came to talk about some work but i must get my breath first  miss dalstan thought perhaps philip intervened diffidently that you might consider accepting a post at the theatre they always keep two stenographers there and one of them fills up her time by private work generally work for some one connected with the theatre in your case you could of course go on with mine only when i hadnt enough for you and of course i cant compose as fast as you can type there would be something else and the salary would be regular  i should like a regular post the girl admitted sullenly so would any one whos out of work of course  the salary elizabeth explained is twentyfive dollars a week the hours are nine to six you have quite a comfortable room there but when you have private work connected with the theatre you can bring it home if you wish mr ware tells me that you work very quickly you will finish all that you have for him today wont you  i shall have it finished in half an hour  then will you be at the new york theatre tomorrow morning at nine oclock elizabeth suggested there are some parts to be copied it will be very nice indeed if you like the work and i think you will  the girl stood there irresolute it was obvious that she was trying to bring herself to utter some form of thanks then there was a loud knock at the door which was opened without waiting for any reply the janitor stood there with a small key in his hand which he threw down upon a table  key of number two hundred miss he said let me have it back again tonight  he closed the door and departed  two hundred philip exclaimed why thats my old room the one up above  i must see it elizabeth insisted do please let us go up there i meant to ask you to show it me  you are not thinking of moving are you miss grimes philip enquired  she snatched at the key but he had just possessed himself of it and was swinging it from his forefinger  i dont know she snapped i was going up there anyway you cant have the key today  why not philip asked in surprise  never mind there are some things of mine up there i  she broke off they both looked at her perplexed philip shook his head goodnaturedly  miss grimes he said you forget that the rooms are mine till next quarter day i promise you we will respect any of your belongings we may find there come along elizabeth  well see you as we come down the latter promised nodding pleasantly  i dont know as you will the girl retorted fiercely i may not be here  they climbed the last two flights of stairs together  what an extraordinary young woman elizabeth exclaimed is there any reason for her being quite so rude to me  none that i can conceive he answered she is always like that  and yet you took an interest in her  why not she is human soured by misfortune if you like with an immense stock of bravery and honesty underneath it all she has had a drunken father practically upon her hands and lifes been pretty sordid for her here we are  he fitted the key into the lock and swung the door open the clear afternoon light shone in upon the little shabby room and its worn furniture there were one or two insignificant belongings of philips still lying about the place and on the writingtable exactly opposite the spot where he used to sit a little blue vase in which was a bunch of violets somehow or other it was the one arresting object in the room they both of them looked at it in equal amazement  is any one living here elizabeth enquired  not to my knowledge he replied no one could take it on without my signing a release  they moved over to the desk elizabeth stooped down and smelt the violets lifted them up and looked at the cut stalks  is this where you used to sit and write she asked  he nodded  but i never had any flowers here he observed gazing at them in a puzzled manner  elizabeth looked at the vase and set it down then she turned towards her companion and shook her head  oh my dear philip she sighed you really dont know what makes that girl so uncouth  you mean martha of course i dont you think that she  rubbish  he stopped short in sudden confusion elizabeth passed her arm through his she replaced the vase very carefully looked once more around the room and led him to the door  never mind she said it isnt anything serious of course but its wonderful philip what memories a really lonely woman will live on what she will do to keep that little natural vein of sentiment alive in her and how fiercely she will fight to conceal it you can go on down and wait for me in the hall i am going in to say goodby to miss martha grimes i think that this time i shall get on better with her    chapter v  philip waited nearly a quarter of an hour for elizabeth when at last she returned she was unusually silent they drove off together in her automobile she held his fingers under the rug  philip dear she said i think it is time that you and i were married  he turned and looked at her in amazement there was a smile upon her lips but rather a plaintive one he had a fancy somehow that there had been tears in her eyes lately  elizabeth  if we are ever going to be she went on softly why shouldnt we be married quietly as people are sometimes and then tell every one afterwards  he held the joy away from him struggling hard for composure  but a little time ago he reminded her you wanted to wait  yes she confessed i too had mymy what shall i call itfearmy ghost in the background  ah but not like mine he faltered his voice unsteady with a surging flood of passion elizabeth if you really mean it if you are going to take the risk of finding yourself the wife of the villain in a cause célèbre whywhyyou know very well that even the thought of it can draw me up into heaven but dearmy sweetheartremember weve played a bold game or rather i have with your encouragement but were not safe yet  do you know anything that i dont she asked feverishly  well i suppose i do he admitted it isnt necessarily serious he went on quickly as he saw the colour fade from her cheeks but on the very night that our play was produced whilst i was waiting about for you all at the restaurant a man came to see me he is one of the keenest detectives in new yorkedward dane his name is he knew perfectly well that i was the man who had disappeared from the waldorf he told me so to my face  then why didnt hewhy didnt he do something  because he was clever enough to suspect that there was something else behind it all philip said grimly you see hed discovered that i hadnt used any of the money he couldnt fit in any of my doings with the reports theyd had about douglas somehow or otheri cant tell howanother suspicion seems to have crept into the mans brain all the time he talked to me i could see him trying to read in my face whether there wasnt something else hed stumbled across a puzzle of which the pieces didnt fit he has gone to englandgone to detton magnagone to see whether there are any missing pieces to be found he may be back any day now  but what could he discover she faltered  god knows philip groaned theres the whole ghastly truth there if fortune helped him and he were clever enough if by any devilish chance the threads came into his hand i dont thinki dont think there was ever any fear from the other side i had all the luck but elizabeth sometimes i am terrified of this man dane i didnt mean to tell you this but its too late now do you know that i am watched day by day i pretend not to notice iti am even able now and then to shut it out from my own thoughtsbut wherever i go theres some one shadowing me some one walking in my footsteps im perfectly certain that if you were to go to police headquarters here you could find out where i have spent almost every hour since i took that room in monmouth house  she gripped his fingers fiercely  philip philip  he leaned forward gazing with peculiar almost passionate intentness into the faces of the people as they swept along broadway  look at them elizabeth he muttered look at that mob of men and women sweeping along the pavements there every kind and shape of man every nationality every age they are like the little flecks on the top of a wave i watched them when i first came and i felt almost reckless youd think a man could plunge in there and be lost wouldnt you he cant i tried it is there anywhere else in the world i wonder is there anywhere in the living world where one can throw off everything of the past where one can take up a new life and memory doesnt come  she shook her head she was more composed now the moment of feverish excitement had passed her shrewd and level common sense had begun to reassert itself  there isnt any such place philip she told him and if there were it wouldnt be worth while your trying to find it we are both a little hysterical this evening weve lost our sense of proportion youve played for your stake you mustnt quail if the worst should come you must brave it out i believe even then you would be safe but it wont comeit shant  he gripped her hands they were slowing up now caught in a maze of heavy traffic a few blocks from the theatre his voice was firm he had regained his selfcontrol  what an idiot i have been he exclaimed scornfully never mind thats past there is just one more serious word though dear  she responded immediately to the change in his manner and smiled into his face  well  my only real problem he went on earnestly is this dare i hold you to your word elizabeth dare i for instance say yes to the wonderful suggestion of yoursmake you my wife and risk having people look at you in years to come point at you with pity and say that you married a murderer who died a shameful death fancy how the tragedy of that would lie across your lifeyou who are so wonderful and so courted and so clever  isnt that my affair philip she asked calmly  no he answered its mine  she turned and laughed at him for a moment she was her old self again  you refuse me  his eyes glowed  well wait he said hoarsely till dane comes back from england  the car had stopped outside the theatre hat in hand and with his face wreathed in smiles the commissionaire had thrown open the door the people on the pavement were nudging one anothera famous woman was about to descend she turned back to philip  come in with me she begged somehow i feel cold and lonely tonight it hasnt anything to do with what we were talking about but i feel as though something were going to happen that something were coming out of the shadows something that threatens either you or me im silly but come  she clung to him as they crossed the pavement for once she forgot to smile at the little curious crowd she was absorbed in herself and her feelings  life is so hard sometimes she exclaimed as they lingered for a moment near the box office theres that poor girl philip friendless and lonely what she must suffer god help hergod help us all i am sick with loneliness myself philip dont leave me alone come with me to my room i only want to see if there are any letters well go somewhere near and dine first before i change philip what is the matter with me i dont want to go a step alone i dont want to be alone for a moment  he laughed reassuringly and drew her closer to him she led the way down the passage towards her own suite of apartments they passed one or two of the officials of the theatre whom she greeted with something less than her usual charm of manner as they reached the managers office there was the sound of loud voices and the door was thrown open mr fink appeared and with him a somewhat remarkable figurea tall immensely broad illdressed man with a strong rugged face and a mass of grey hair a huge man who seemed somehow or other to proclaim himself of a bigger and stronger type than those others amongst whom he moved he had black eyes and the heavy jaw of an irishman his face was curiously unwrinkled he stood there blocking the way his great hands suddenly thrust forward  betty by the lord that loves us he exclaimed heres luck i was on my way out to search for you got here on the chicago limited at four oclock give me your hands and say that you are glad to see me  if elizabeth were glad she showed no sign of it she seemed to have become rooted to the spot suddenly dumb philip by her side heard the quick indrawing of her breath  sylvanus she murmured you why i thought you were in china  theres no place on gods earth can hold me for long was the boisterous reply i did my business there in three days and caught a japanese boat back such a voyage and such food but new york will make up for that youve got a great play they tell me i must hear all about it shake my hands first though girl as though you were glad to see me you seem to have shrunken since i saw you lastto have grown smaller didnt london agree with you  the moment of shock had passed elizabeth had recovered herself she gave the newcomer her hands quite frankly she even seemed in a measure glad to see him  these unannounced comings and goings of yours from the ends of the earth are so upsetting to your friends she declared  and this gentleman who is he  elizabeth laughed softly  i neednt tell you mr ware she said turning to philip that this dear man here is an eccentric i dare say youve heard of him it is mr sylvanus power and sylvanus this is mr merton ware the author of our playthe house of shams  philip felt his hand held in a grasp which firm though it was seemed to owe its vigour rather to the long powerful fingers than to any real cordiality mr sylvanus power was studying him from behind his bushy eyebrows  so youre merton ware he observed i havent seen your play yethope to tonight an englishman eh  yes i am english philip assented coolly you come from the west dont you  there was a moments silence elizabeth laughed softly  oh theres no mistake about mr power she declared he brings the breezy west with him to wall street or broadway paris or london you cant shake it off or blow it away  and i dont know as i am particularly anxious to either mr power pronounced are you going to your rooms here betty if so ill come along i guess mr ware will excuse you  philip was instantly conscious of the antagonism in the others manner as yet however he felt little more than amusement he glanced towards elizabeth and the look in her face startled him the colour had once more left her cheeks and her eyes were full of appeal  if you wouldnt mind she begged mr power is a very old friend and we havent met for so long  you neednt expect to see anything more of miss dalstan tonight either of you the newcomer declared drawing her hand through his arm except on the stage that is i am going to take her out and give her a little dinner directly au revoir fink ill see you tonight here goodday to you mr ware  philip stood for a moment motionless the voice of mr sylvanus power was no small thing and he was conscious that several of the officials of the place and the man in the box office had heard every word that had passed he felt somehow curiously ignored he watched the huge figure of the westerner with elizabeth by his side disappear down the corridor mr fink who had also been looking after them turned towards him  say thats some man sylvanus power he exclaimed admiringly he is one of our multimillionaires mr ware what do you think of him  so far as one can judge from a few seconds conversation philip remarked he seems to possess all the qualities essential to the production of a multimillionaire in this country  mr fink grinned  sounds a trifle sarcastic but i guess hes a new type to you he observed tolerantly  absolutely philip acknowledged as he turned and made his way slowly out of the theatre    chapter vi  philips disposition had been so curiously affected by the emotions of the last few months that he was not in the least surprised to find himself that evening torn by a very curious and unfamiliar spasm of jealousy after an hour or so of indecision he made his way as usual to the theatre but instead of going at once to elizabeths room he slipped in at the back of the stalls the house was crowded and seated in the stage box alone and gloomy his somewhat austere demeanour intensified by the severity of his evening clothes sat sylvanus power with the air of a conqueror philip unaccountably restless left his seat in a very few minutes and making his way to the box office scribbled a line to elizabeth the official to whom he handed it looked at him in surprise  wont you go round yourself mr ware he suggested miss dalstan has another ten minutes before she is on  philip shook his head  im looking for a man i know he replied evasively ill be somewhere about here in five minutes  the answer came in less than that time it was just a scrawled line in pencil  forgive me dear i will explain everything in the morning if you will come to my rooms at eleven oclock this evening i have a hateful duty to perform and i cannot see you  philip impatient of the atmosphere of the theatre wandered out into the streets with the note in his pocket broadway was thronged with people a heterogeneous slowlymoving throng the hardest crowd to apprehend to understand of any in the world he looked absently into the varying stream of faces stared at the whirling skysigns the lights flashing from the tall buildings heard snatches of the music from the open doors of the cafes and restaurants men and even women elbowed him unresenting out of the way without the semblance of an apology it seemed to him that his presence there part of the drifting pandemonium of the pavement was in a sense typical of his own existence in new york he had given so much of his life into anothers hands and now the anchor was dragging he was suddenly confronted with the possibility of a rift in his relations with elizabeth with a sudden surging doubt not of elizabeth herself but simply a feeling of insecurity with regard to their future he only realised in those moments how much he had leaned upon her how completely she seemed to have extended over him and his troubled life some sort of sheltering influence to which he had succumbed with an effortless an almost fatalistic impulse finding there at any rate a refuge from the horrors of his empty days it was all abstract and impersonal at first this jealousy which had come so suddenly to disturb the serenity of an almost too perfect day but as the hours passed it seemed to him that his thoughts dwelt more often upon the direct cause of his brief separation from elizabeth he turned in at one of the clubs of which he had been made a member and threw himself gloomily into an easychair his thoughts had turned towards the grim masterful personality of the man who seemed to have obtruded himself upon their lives what did it mean when elizabeth told him she was engaged for tonight she was supping with him somewhereprobably at that moment seated opposite to him at a small roseshaded table in one of the many restaurants of the city which they had visited together he sylvanus power his supplanter was occupying the place that belonged to him ordering her supper humouring her little preferences perhaps sharing with her that little glow of relief which comes with the hour of rest after the strain of the days work the suggestion was intolerable tomorrow he would have an explanation elizabeth belonged to him the sooner the world knew it the better and this man first of all he read her few lines again hastily pencilled and evidently written standing up there was a certain ignominy in being sent about his business just because this colossus from the west had appeared and claimedwhat not his righthe could have no right what then  philip ordered a drink tore open an evening paper and tried to read the letters danced before his eyes the whisky and soda stood neglected at his elbow afterwards he found himself looking into space there was something cynical challenging almost in the manner in which that man had taken elizabeth away from him had acknowledged his introduction even had treated the author of a play a writer as some sort of a mountebank making his living by catering for the amusements of the world how did that man regard such gifts as his he wonderedsylvanus power of whom he had seen it written that he was one of the conquerors of nature a hard but splendid utilitarian the builder of railways in china and bridges for the transit of his metals amid the clouds of the mountain tops in the mans absence his harshness almost uncouthness seemed modified he was a rival without a doubt and tonight a favoured one how well had he known elizabeth for how long was it true that rumour he had once heardthat the first step in her fortunes had been due to the caprice of a millionaire he found the room stifling but the thought of the streets outside unnerved him he looked about for some distraction  the room was beginning to fillactors musicians a few journalists a great many men of note in the world of bohemia kept streaming in one or two of them nodded to him several paused to speak  hullo ware noel bridges exclaimed not often you give us a look in what are you doing with yourself here all alone  philip turned to answer him and suddenly felt the fire blaze up again he saw his questioners frown saw him even bite his lip as though conscious of having said a tactless thing the actor probably understood the whole situation well enough  i generally go into the lotus philip lied tonight i had a fancy to come here  the lotus is too far up town for us fellows bridges remarked we need a drink a little supper and to see our pals quickly when the nights work is over i hear great things of the new play mr ware but i dont know when youll get a chance to produce it were you in the house tonight  only for a moment  going stronger than ever bridges continued impressively yes thanks ill take a scotch highball he added in response to philips mute invitation plenty of ice mick there wasnt a seat to be had in the house and i wouldnt like to say what old fink had to go through before he could get his box for the great sylvanus  his box philip queried  the theatre belongs to sylvanus power you know bridges explained he built it five years ago  for a speculation  the actor fidgeted for a moment with his tumbler  no for miss dalstan he replied  philip set his teeth hard the temptation to pursue the conversation was almost overpowering the young man himself though a trifle embarrassed seemed perfectly willing to talk at least it was better to know the truth then another impulse suddenly asserted itself whatever he was to know he must learn from her lips and from hers only  well i should think its turned out all right he remarked  noel bridges shrugged his shoulders  the rent if it were figured out at a fair interest on the capital would be something fabulous he declared you see the place was extravagantly builtwithout any regard to cost the dressing rooms as you may have noticed are wonderful and all the appointments are unique i dont fancy the old mans ever had a quarters rent yet thats paid him one per cent on the money see you later perhaps mr ware the young man concluded setting down his tumbler im going in to have a grill why dont you come along  philip hesitated for a second and then somewhat to the others surprise assented he was conscious that he had been perhaps just a little unresponsive to the many courtesies which had been offered him here and at the other kindred clubs they had been ready to receive him with open arms this little fraternity of brainworkers and his response had been perhaps a little doubtful not from any lack of appreciation but partly from that curious diffidence so hard to understand but so fundamentally english and partly because of that queer sense of being an impostor which sometimes swept over him a sense that he was after all only the ghost of another man living a subjective life that reason it out however he might there was something of the fraud in any personality he might adopt and yet deep down in his heart he was conscious of so earnest a desire to be really one of them this goodnatured goodhearted gayspirited little throng with their delightful intimacies their keen interest in each others welfare their potent almost mysterious geniality which seemed to draw the stranger of kindred tastes so closely under its influence philip as he sat at the long table with a dozen or so other men did his best that night to break through the fetters tried hard to remember that his place amongst them after all was honest enough they were writers and actors and journalists well he too was a writer he had written a play which they had welcomed with open arms as they had done him in this world of bohemia if anywhere he surely had a right to lift up his head and breatheand he would do it he sat with them smoking and talking until the little company began to thin out establishing all the time a new reputation doing a great deal to dissipate that little sense of disappointment which his former nonresponsiveness had created  hes a damned good fellow after all one of them declared as at last he left the room he is losing his britishness every day he stays here  been through rough times they say another remarked  he is one of those an elder member pronounced taking his pipe for a moment from his mouth who was never made for happiness you can always read those men you can see it behind their eyes  nevertheless philip walked home a saner and a better man he felt somehow warmed by those few hours of companionship the senseless part of his jealousy was gone his trust in elizabeth reestablished he looked at the note once more as he undressed at eleven oclock on the following morning in her rooms    chapter vii  something of his overnights optimism remained with philip when at eleven oclock on the following morning he was ushered into elizabeths rooms it was a frame of mind however which did not long survive his reception from the moment of his arrival he seemed to detect a different atmosphere in his surroundingsthe demeanour of phoebe his staunch ally who admitted him without her usual welcoming smile the unanalysable sense of something wanting in the dainty little room overfilled with strongsmelling hothouse flowers in the entrance and welcome of elizabeth herself his eyes had ached for the sight of her he was so sure that he would know everything the moment she spoke yet her coming brought only confusion to his senses she was differentunexpectedly bewilderingly different she had lost that delicate serenity of manner that almost protective affection which he had grown to lean upon and expect she entered dressed for the street smoking a cigarette which was in itself unusual with dark rings under her eyes which seemed to be looking all around the room on some pretext or other but never at him  am i late she asked a little breathlessly i am so sorry tell me have you anything particular to do  nothing he answered  i want to go out of the cityinto the country at once she told him feverishly the car is waiting i ordered it for a quarter to eleven let us start  of course if you wish it he assented  he opened the door but before she passed through he leaned towards her she shook her head his heart sank what could there be more ominous than this  i am not well she muttered dont take any notice of anything i say or do for a little time i am like this sometimestemperamental i suppose all great actresses are temperamental i suppose i am a great actress do you think i am philip  he was following her downstairs now he found it hard however to imitate the flippancy of her tone  the critics insist upon it he observed drily evidently your audience last night shared their opinion  she nodded  i love them to applaud like that and yetaudiences dont really know do they perhaps  she relapsed into silence and they took their places in the car she settled herself down with a little sigh of content and drew the rug over her  as far as you can go john she told the man but you must get back at six oclock the country mindnot the shore  they started off  so you were there last night she murmured leaning back amongst the cushions with an air of relief  i was there for a few moments i wrote my note to you in the box office  she shook the memory away  and afterwards  i went to one of the clubs downtown  what did you do there she enquired gossip  some of the men were very kind to me he said i had supper with noel bridges amongst others  well she asked almost defiantly  i dont understand  she looked intently at him for a moment  i forgot she went on you are very chivalrous arent you you wouldnt ask questions see i am going to close my eyes it is too horrible here and all through brooklyn when we are in the lanes i can talk this is just one of those days i wish that we were in england all our country is either suburban or too wild and restless can you be content with silence for a little time  of course he assured her besides you forget that i am in a strange country everything is worth watching  they passed over brooklyn bridge and for an hour or more they made slow progress through the wideflung environs of the city at last however the endless succession of factories and small tenement dwellings lay behind them they passed houses with real gardens through stretches of wood whose leaves were opening whose branches were filled with the sweetsmelling sap of springtime elizabeth seemed to wake almost automatically from a kind of stupor she pushed back her veil and philip stealing eager glances towards her was almost startled by some indefinable change her face seemed more delicate almost the face of an invalid and she lay back there with halfclosed eyes the strength of her mouth seemed to have dissolved and its sweetness had become almost pathetic there were signs of a great weariness about her the fingers which reached out for the little speakingtube seemed to have become thinner  take the turn to the left john she instructed the one to bay shore go slowly by the lake and stop where i tell you  they left the main road and travelled for some distance along a lane which with its bramblegrown fences and meadows beyond was curiously reminiscent of england they passed a country house built of the wood which was still a little unfamiliar to philip but wonderfully homelike with its cluster of outbuildings its trim lawns and the turret clock over the stable entrance then through the leaves of an avenue of elms they caught occasional glimpses of the blue waters of the lake which they presently skirted elizabeths eyes travelled over its placid surface idly yet with a sense of passive satisfaction in a few minutes they passed into the heart of a little wood and she leaned forward  stop here close to the side of the road john stop your engine please and go and sit by the lake  the man obeyed at once with the unquestioning readiness of one used to his mistress whims for several minutes she remained silent she had the air of one drinking in with almost passionate eagerness the sedative effect of the stillness the soft spring air the musical country sounds the ripple of the breeze in the trees the humming of insects the soft splash of the lake against the stony shore philip himself was awakened into a peculiar sense of pleasure by this almost his first glimpse of the country since his arrival in new york a host of half forgotten sensations warmed his heart he felt suddenly intensely sympathetic perhaps more genuinely tender than he had ever felt before towards the woman by his side whose hour of suffering it was his hand slipped under the rug and held her fingers which clutched his in instantaneous response her lips seemed unlocked by his slight action  i came here alone two years ago she told him and since then often sometimes to study a difficult part sometimes only to think one moment  she released her fingers from his drew out the hatpins from her hat unwound the veil and threw them both on to the opposite seat then she laid her hands upon her forehead as though to cool it the little breeze from the lake rippled through her hair bringing them every now and then faint whiffs of perfume from the bordering gardens  there she exclaimed with a little murmur of content thats a mans action isnt it now i think i am getting brave i have something to say to you philip  he felt her fingers seeking his again and held them tightly it was curious how in that moment of crisis his thoughts seemed to wander away he was watching the little flecks of gold in her hair wondering if he had ever properly appreciated the beautiful curve of her neck even her voice seemed somehow attuned to the melody of their surroundings the confused song of the birds the sighing of the lake the passing of the west wind through the trees and shrubs around  philip she began clinging closely to him i have brought you here to tell you a story which perhaps you will think when you have heard it might better have been told in my dressingroom well i couldnt besides i wanted to get away it is about sylvanus power  he sat a little more upright his nerves were tingling now with eagerness  yes  i met him she continued eight years ago out west when i was in a travelling show i accepted his attentions at first carelessly enough i did not realise the sort of man he was he was a great personage even in those days and i suppose my head was a little turned then he began to follow us everywhere there was a scandal of course in the end i left the company and came to new york he went to china where he has always had large interests when i heard that he had sailedi remember reading it in the paperi could have sobbed with joy  philip moved a little uneasily in his place some instinct told him however how greatly she desired his silencethat she wanted to tell her story her own way  then followed three miserable years during which i saw little of him i knew that i had talent i was always sure of making a living but i got no further it didnt seem possible to get any further nothing that i could do or say seemed able to procure for me an engagement in new york think of me for a moment now philip as a woman absolutely and entirely devoted to her work i loved it it absorbed all my thoughts it was just the one thing in life i cared anything about i simply ached to get at new york and i couldnt all the time i had to play on tour and you wont quite understand this dear but there is nothing so wearing in life as for any one with my cravings for recognition there to be always playing on the road  she paused for a few minutes there was a loud twittering of birds a rabbit who had stolen carefully through the undergrowth scurried away a car had come through the wood and swept past them bringing with it some vague sense of disturbance it was some little time before she settled down again to her story  at the end of those three years she went on sylvanus power had become richer stronger more masterful than ever i was beginning to lose heart he was clever he studied my every weakness he knew quite well that with me there was only one way and he laid his schemes with regard to me just in the same fashion as he schemed to be a conqueror of men to build up those millions we were playing near new york and one day he asked me to motor in there and lunch with him i accepted it was in the springtime almost on such a day as this we motored up in one of his wonderful cars we lunchedi remember how shabby i feltat the best restaurant in new york where i was waited upon like a queen somehow or other the man had always the knack of making himself felt wherever he went he strode the very streets of new york like one of its masters and the people seemed to recognise it afterwards he took me into broadway and he ordered the car to stop outside the theatre where i am now playing i looked at it and i remember i gave a little cry of interest  this is the new theatre that every one is talking about isnt it i asked him eagerly  it is he answered would you like to see inside  of course i was half crazy with curiosity the doors flew open before him and he took me everywhere you know yourself what a magnificent place it isthat marvellous stage the auditorium all in dark green satin the seats like armchairs the dressing rooms like boudoirsthe wonderful spaciousness of it it took my breath away i had never imagined such splendour when we had finished looking over the whole building i clutched his arm  i cant believe that it isnt some sort of fairy palace i exclaimed and to think that no one knows who owns the place or when it is going to be opened  ill tell you all about that he answered i built it i own it and it will be opened just when you accept my offer and play in it  it all seemed too amazing for a time i couldnt speak coherently then i remember thinking that whatever happened whatever price i had to pay i must stand upon the stage of that theatre and win my lips were quite dry his great voice seemed to have faded into a whisper  your offer i repeated  yourself he answered gruffly  there was a silence which seemed to philip interminable all the magic of the place had passed away its music seemed no longer to be singing happiness into his heart then at last he realised that she was waiting for him to speak  he wantedto marry you he faltered  he had a wife already  splash john was throwing stones into the lake a pastime of which he was getting a little tired a huge thrush was thinking about commencing to build his nest and in the meantime sat upon a fallen log across the way and sang about it a little treeclimbing bird ran round and round the trunk of the nearest elm staring at them every time he appeared with his tiny black eyes a squirrel almost overhead who had long since come to the conclusion that they were harmless decided now that they had the queerest manners of any two young people he had ever watched from his leafy throne and finally abandoned his position elizabeth had been staring down the road ever since the last words had passed her lips she turned at last and looked at her companion he was once more the refugee the halfstarved man flying from horrors greater even than he had known she began to tremble  philip she cried say anything but speak to me  like a flash he seemed to pass from his own almost the hermits way of looking out upon life from the oldfashioned standpoint of his inherent puritanism into a closer sympathy with those others the men and women of the world into which he had so lately entered the men and women who had welcomed him so warmheartedly human beings all of them who lived and loved with glad hearts and much kindliness the contrast was absurd the story itself suddenly so reasonable no other woman on tour would have kept sylvanus power waiting for three years only elizabeth could have done that it was such a human little problem people didnt live in the clouds he wasnt fit for the clouds himself nevertheless when he tried to speak his throat was hard and dry and at the second attempt he began instead to laugh she gripped his arm  philip she exclaimed be reasonable say what you like but look and behave like a human being dont make that noise she almost shrieked  he stopped at once  forgive me he begged humbly i cant help it i seem to be playing hide and seek with myself you havent finished the story yetif there is anything more to tell me  she drew herself up she spoke absolutely without faltering  i accepted sylvanus powers terms she went on he placed large sums of money in finks hands to run the theatre there was a wonderful opening you were not interested then or you might have heard of it i produced a new play of clyde fitchs it was a great triumph the house was packed sylvanus power sat in his box it was to be his night through it all i fought like a woman in a nightmare i didnt know what it meant i knew hundreds of women who had done in a small way what i was prepared to do magnificently in all my acquaintance i think that i scarcely knew one who would have refused to do what i was doing and all the time i was in a state of fierce revolt i had moments when my lifes ambitions when new york itself the mecca of my dreams and that marvellous theatre with its marble and silk seemed suddenly to dwindle to a miserable contemptible little dolls house and then again i played and i felt my soul as i played and the old dreams swept over me and i said that it wasnt anything to do with personal vanity that made me crave for the big gifts of success that it was my art and that i must find myself in my art or die  the blood was flowing in his veins again she was coming back to him he was ashamedhe with his giant load of sin his voice trembled with tenderness  go on he begged  i think that the reason i played that night as though i were inspired was because of the great passionate craving at my heart for forgetfulness to shut out the memory of that man who sat almost gloomily alone in his box waiting and then after it was all over the wonder and the glory of it he appeared suddenly in my dressingroom elbowing his way through excited journalists kicking bouquets of flowers from his path we stood for a moment face to face he came nearer i shrank away i was terrified he looked at me in cold surprise  three minutes he exclaimed to say goodby im off to china stick at it youve done well for a start but remember a new york audience wants holding choose your plays carefully trust fink  youre going away i almost shrieked  he glanced at his watch leaned over and kissed me on the forehead  ill barely make that boat he muttered and rushed out  philip was breathless the strange untold passion of the whole thing was coming to him in waves of wonderful suggestion  finish he cried impatiently finish  that is the end she said i played for two years and a half with scarcely a pause then i came to europe for a rest and travelled back with you on the elletania last night i saw sylvanus power again for the first time dont speak my story is in two halves that is the first the second is just one question that will come before we reach homejohn she called  the man approached promptlyhe was quite weary of throwing stones  take us somewhere to lunch his mistress directed and get back to new york at six oclock    chapter viii  it was not until they were crossing brooklyn bridge on their way into the city that she asked him that question they crawled along one of an interminable tangled line of vehicles of all sorts and conditions the trains rattling overhead and endless streams of earnest people passing along the footway below them the evening sunlight flashed upon the murky waters glittered from the windows of the tall buildings and shone a little mercilessly upon the unlovely purlieus of the great human hive the wind had turned cool and elizabeth with a little shiver had drawn her furs around her neck all through the day during the luncheon in an unpretentious little inn and the leisurely homeward drive she had been once more entirely herself pleasant and sympathetic ignoring absolutely the intangible barrier which had grown up between them soon to be thrown down for ever or to remain for all time  we left our heroine she said at an interesting crisis in her career i am waiting to hear from youwhat would you have done in her place  he answered her at once and he spoke from the lesser heights he was fiercely jealous  it is not a reasonable question he declared i am not a woman i am just a man who has led an unusually narrow and cramped life until these last few months  that is scarcely fair she objected you profess to have lovedto love still i hope that in itself makes a man of any one then you too have sinned you too are one of those who have yielded to passion of a sort therefore your judgment ought to be the better worth having  he winced as though he had been struck and looked at her with eyes momentarily wild he felt that the deliberate cruelty of her words was of intent an instinct of her brain defying for the moment her heart  i dont know he faltered i wont answer your question i cant you see the love you speak of is my love for you you ask me to ignore thati who am clinging on to life by one rope  you are like all men she sighed we do not blame you for itperhaps we love you the morebut when a great crisis comes you think only of yourselves you disappoint me a little philip i fancied that you might have thought a little of me something of sylvanus power  i havent your sympathy for other people he declared hoarsely  no she assented sympathy is the one thing a man lacks it isnt your fault philip you are to be pitied for it and after all it is a womans gift isnt it  there followed then a silence which seemed interminable it was not until they were nearing the theatre that he suddenly spoke with a passion which startled her  tell me he insisted last night i cant help asking i was in hell  he told himself afterwards that there couldnt be any possible way of reconciling cruelty so coldblooded with all that he knew of elizabeth she behaved as though his question had fallen upon deaf ears the car had stopped before the entrance to the theatre she stepped out even before he could assist her hurried across the pavement and looked back at him for one moment only before she plunged into the dark passage she nodded and there was an utterly meaningless smile upon her lips  goodby she said do you mind telling john he neednt wait for me  then she disappeared he stood motionless upon the pavement a little dazed two or three people jostled against him a policeman glanced at him curiously a lady with very yellow hair winked in his face philip pulled himself together and simultaneously felt a touch upon his elbow he glanced into the face of the girl who had accosted him and for a moment he scarcely recognised her  wish youd remember youre in new york and not one of your own sleepy old towns miss grimes remarked brusquely youll have a policeman say youre drunk in a minute if you stand there letting people shove you around  he fell into step by her side and they walked slowly along martha was plainly dressed but she was wearing new clothes new shoes and a new hat  dont stare at me as though you never saw me out of a garret before she went on a little sharply your friend miss dalstan is a lady who understands things when i arrived at the theatre this morning i found that it was to be a permanent job all right and there was a little advance for me waiting in an envelope that fat old mr fink began to cough and look at my clothes so i got one in first this is for me to make myself look smart enough for your theatre i suppose i said give me an hour off and ill do it so he grinned and here i am done a good days work too copying the parts of your play for a road company and answering letters whats wrong with you  the very sound of her voice was a tonic he almost smiled as he answered her  just a sort of hankering for the moon and a sudden fear lest i mightnt get it  youre spoilt thats whats the matter with you she declared brusquely  it never occurred to me he said gloomily that life had been overkind  oh cut it out she answered here you are not only set on your feet but absolutely held up there all the papers full of merton wares brilliant play and merton ware the new dramatist with his social giftssuch an acquisition to new york society why it isnt so very long ago after all that you hadnt a soul in new york to speak to i saw something in your face that night i thought you were hungry so you were only it wasnt for food it cheered you up even to talk with me and look at you today clubs and parties and fine friends and there you were half dazed in broadway be careful man you dont know what it is to be down and out you havent been as near it as i have anyway or youd lift your head up and be thankful  martha he began earnestly  miss grimes she interrupted firmly dont let there be any mistake about that i hate familiarity  miss grimes then he went on you talk about my friends quite right i should think i have been introduced to nearly a thousand people since the night my play was produced i have dined at a score of houses and many scores of restaurants the people are pleasant enough too but all the time its merton ware the dramatist they are patting on the back they dont know anything about merton ware the man perhaps there are some of them would be glad to but you see its too soon and they seem to live too quickly here to make friends i am almost as lonely as i was so far as regards ordinary companionship last night i felt the first little glow of real friendlinessjust the men down at the club  youve put all your eggs into one basket thats what youve done she declared  thats true enough he groaned  and like all menselfish brutes she proceeded deliberatelyyou expect everything fancy expecting everything from a woman like miss dalstan why you arent worthy of it you know  perhaps not he admitted but you see miss grimes there is something in life which seems to have passed you by up till now  has it indeed she objected you think ive never had a young man eh perhaps youre right havent found much time for that sort of rubbish anyway this is where i hop on a trolley car  wait a moment he begged dont leave me yet youve nothing to do have you  nothing particular she confessed except go home and cook my dinner  look here he went on eagerly i feel like work ive got the second act of my new play in my mind come round with me and let me try dictating it ill give you something to eat in my rooms its for the theatre mind i never tried dictating i believe i could do it to you  in your rooms she repeated a little doubtfully  they wont talk scandal about us miss grimes he assured her to tell you the truth i want to be near the telephone  in case she rings you up eh  thats so i said something i ought not to have done i ought to have waited for her but it was something that had been tearing at me ever since last night and i couldnt bear it  some blunderers you men miss grimes sighed well im with you  he led her almost apologetically to the lift of the handsome building in which his new rooms were situated they were very pleasant bachelor rooms with black oak walls and green hangings prints upon the wall a serviceable writingtable and a deep green carpet she looked around her and at the servant who had come forward at their entrance with a little sniff  shall you be changing tonight sir he asked  not tonight philip answered quickly tell the waiter to send up a simple dinner for twoi cant bother to order and two cocktails he added as an afterthought  martha stared after the disappearing manservant disparagingly  some style she muttered a manservant eh dont know as i ever saw one before off the stage  dont be silly he remonstrated he has four other flats to look after besides mine its the way one lives nowadays cheaper than ordinary hotels or rooms take off your coat  she obeyed him depositing it carefully in a safe place then she strolled around the room finding pictures little to her taste and finally threw herself into an easychair  are we going to work before we eat she asked  no afterwards he told her have a cigarette  she held it between her fingers but declined a match  ill wait for the cocktails she decided now listen here mr ware theres a word or two id like to say to you  go ahead he invited listlessly  you men she continued looking him squarely in the face think a lot too much of yourselves you think so much of yourselves that as often as not youve no time to think of other folk a month or so ago who were you you were hiding in a cheap tenement house scared out of your wits dressed pretty near as shabbily as i was with a detective on your track and with no idea of what you were going to do for a living and now look at you whos done it all  of course my play being successful he began  she broke in at once  you and your play who took your play who produced it at the new york theatre and acted in it so that people couldnt listen without a sob in their throats and a tingling all over yours isnt the only play in the world i bet miss dalstan has a box full of them she probably chose yours because she knew that you were feeling pretty miserable because shed got sorry for you coming over on the steamer because she has a great big heart and is always trying to do something for others shes made a man of you oh i know a bit about plays i know that with the royalties youre drawing you can well afford rooms like these and anything else you want but that isnt all shes done shes introduced you to her friends shes taken more notice of you than any man around she takes you out automobile driving she lets you spend all your spare time in her rooms she dont mind what people say you dine with her and take her home after the play you have more of her than any other person alive say what i want to ask isdo you think youre properly grateful  i couldnt ever repay miss dalstan he acknowledged a little sadly but  look here no buts she interrupted you think i dont know anything perhaps i dont and perhaps i do i was standing in the door of the office when you two came in from your automobile drive this afternoon i saw her come away without wishing you goodby then i saw her turn and nod looking just as usual and i saw her face afterwards if i had had you my man as close to me then as you are now id have boxed your ears  he moved uneasily in his chair there was no doubt about the girls earnestness she was leaning a little forward and her brown eyes were filled with a hard accusing light there was a little spot of colour even in her sallow cheeks she was unmistakably angry  id like to know who you are and what you think yourself to make a woman look like that she wound up  the waiter entered with the cocktails and began to lay the cloth for dinner philip paced the room uneasily until he had gone  look here my little friend he said when at last the door was closed theres a great deal of sound common sense in what you say i may be an egoisti dare say i am ive been through the proper training for it and ive started life again on a pretty onesided basis perhaps buthave you ever been jealous  me jealous she repeated scornfully what of i wonder  there was a suspicious glitter in her eyes a queer little tremble in her tone his question however was merely perfunctory she represented little more to him at that moment than the incarnation of his own conscience  very likely you havent he went on you are too independent ever to care much for any one well ive been half mad with jealousy since last night that is the truth of it theres another man wants her the man who built the theatre for her she told me about him yesterday while we were out together  dont you want her to be happy the girl asked bluntly  of course i do  then leave her alone to choose dont go about looking as though you had a knife in your heart if you find her turn for a moment to some one else you dont want her to choose you do you just because you are a weakling because her great kind heart cant bear the thought of making you miserable stand on your feet like a man and take your luck can i take off my hat i cant eat in this  the waiter had entered with the dinner merton opened the door of his room and paced up and down for a few moments thoughtfully when she reappeared she took the seat opposite philip and suddenly smiled at him an exceedingly rare but most becoming performance her mouth seemed at once to soften and even her eyes laughed at him  here you ask me to dine she said because you are lonely and i do nothing but scold you never mind i was typewriting something of yours this morningive forgotten the words but it was something about the discipline of affection you can take my scolding that way if i didnt adore miss dalstan and if you hadnt been kind to me i should never take the trouble to make myself disagreeable  he smiled back at her readily falling in with her altered mood she seemed to have talked the illhumour out of her blood and during the service of the meal she told him of the comfort of her work the charm of the other girl in the room with whom she was already discussing a plan to share an apartment when she came to speak however remotely of miss dalstan her voice seemed instinctively to soften philip found himself wondering what had passed between the two women in those few moments when elizabeth had left him and gone back to marthas room by some strange miracle the strong sweet understanding woman had simply taken possession of the friendless child the thought of her sat now in marthas heart an obsession almost a worship perhaps that was why the sense of companionship between the two notwithstanding certain obvious disparities seemed to grow stronger every moment  they drank their coffee and smoked cigarettes afterwards in lazy fashion suddenly martha sprang up  say i came here to work she exclaimed  and i brought you under false pretences he confessed my brains not working i cant dictate well try another evening you dont mind  of course not she answered glancing at the clock ill be going  wait a little time longer he begged  she resumed her seat there was only one heavily shaded lamp burning on the table and through the little cloud of tobacco smoke she watched him his eyes were sometimes upon the timepiece sometimes on the telephone he seemed always although his attitude was one of repose to be listening waiting it was halfpast ninethe middle of the second act they knew quite well that for a quarter of an hour elizabeth would be in her dressing room she could ring up if she wished the seconds ticked monotonously away martha found herself too sharing that curiously intense desire to hear the ring of the telephone nothing happened a quarter to ten came and passed she rose to her feet  i am going home right now she announced  he reached for his hat  ill come with you he suggested a little halfheartedly  youll do nothing of the sort she objected or if you do ill never come inside your rooms again understand that i dont want any of these society tricks see me home indeed id have you know that im better able to take care of myself in the streets of new york than you are so thank you for your dinner and just you sit down and listen for that telephone it will ring right presently and if it doesnt go to bed and say to yourself that whatever she decides is best she knows which way her happiness lies you dont and its she who counts much more than you leave off thinking of yourself quite so much and shake hands with me please mr ware  he gripped her hand opened the door and watched her sail down towards the lift whistling to herself her hands in her coat pockets then he turned back into the room and locked himself in    chapter ix  the slow fever of inaction fretting in philips veins culminated soon after marthas departure in a passionate desire for a movement of some sort the very silence of the room maddened him the unresponsivelooking telephone the fire which had burned itself out the dropping even of the wind which at intervals during the evening had flung a rainstorm against the windowpane at midnight he could bear it no longer and sallied out into the streets again that curious desire for companionship was upon him a strange heritage for one who throughout the earlier stages of his life had been content with and had even sought a grim and unending solitude he boarded a surface car for the sake of sitting wedged in amongst a little crowd of people and he entered his club noting the number of hats and coats in the cloakroom with a queer sense of satisfaction he no sooner made his appearance in the main room than he was greeted vociferously from half a dozen quarters he accepted every hospitality that was offered to him drinking cheerfully with new as well as old acquaintances presently noel bridges came up and gripped his shoulder  come and have a grill with us ware he begged theres seymour and richmond here from the savage club and a whole crowd of us hullo freddy he went on greeting the man with whom philip had been talking why dont you come and join us too well have a rubber of bridge afterwards  thats great the other declared come on ware well rag old honeybrook into telling us some of his stories  the little party gathered together at the end of the common table philip had already drunk much more than he was accustomed to but the only result appeared to be some slight slackening of the tension in which he had been living his eyes flashed and his tongue became more nimble he insisted upon ordering wine he had had no opportunity yet of repaying many courtesies they drank his health forced him into the place of honour by the side of honeybrook veteran of the club and ate their meal to the accompaniment of ceaseless bursts of laughter chaff the popping of corks mock speeches badinage of every sort philip felt somehow that his brain had never been clearer he not only held his own but he earned a reputation for a sense of humour previously denied to him and in the midst of it all the door opened and closed and a huge man dressed in plain dinner clothes still wearing his theatre hat with a coat upon his arm and a stick in his hand passed through the door and stood for a moment gazing around him  say thats sylvanus power one of the young men at the table exclaimed looks a trifle grim doesnt he  its the old man right enough noel bridges murmured wonder what he wants down here it isnt in his beat  honeybrook the great new york raconteur father of the club touched philip upon the shoulder  hey presto he whispered we who think so much of ourselves have become pigmies upon the face of the earth there towers the representative of modern omnipotence those are the handsgrim stronglooking hands arent theythat grip the levers of modern american life rodin ought to do a statue of him as he stands thereart and letters growing smaller as he grows larger we exist for him he builds theatres for our plays museums for our pictures libraries for our books  seems to me he is looking for one of us noel bridges remarked  some pose isnt it a younger member of the party exclaimed reverently as he lifted his tankard  all these things were a matter of seconds during which sylvanus power did indeed stand without moving looking closely about the room then his eye at last lit upon the end of the table where philip and his friends were seated he approached them without a word noel bridges ventured upon a greeting  coming to join us mr power he asked  sylvanus power if he heard the question ignored it his eyes had rested upon philip he stood over the table now looming before them massive in his way aweinspiring  ware he said ive been looking for you  instinctively philip rose to his feet tall though he was he had to look up at the other man and his slender body seemed in comparison like a willow wand nevertheless the light in his eyes was illuminative there was no shrinking away he stood there with the air of one prepared to welcome to incite and provoke storm whatever might be brewing  i have been to your rooms sylvanus power went on they knew nothing about you there  they wouldnt philip replied i go where i choose and when i choose what do you want with me  conversation in the room was almost suspended those in the immediate locality well acquainted with the gossip of the city held the key to the situation every one for a moment however was spellbound they felt the coming storm but they were powerless  i sought you out ware sylvanus power continued his harsh voice ringing through the room to tell you what probably every other man here knows except you if you know it youre a fool and im here to tell you so  have you been drinking philip asked calmly  maybe i have sylvanus power answered but whisky cant cloud my brain or stop my tongue youre looking at my little toy here he went on twirling in his right hand a heavy malacca cane with a leaden top i killed a man with that once  the weapon seems sufficient for the purpose philip answered indifferently  any other man sylvanus power went on would have sat in the chair for that not i you dont know as much of me as you need to merton ware im no whippersnapper of a penslinger earning a few paltry dollars by writing doggerel for women and mountebanks to act ive hewn my way with my right arm and my brain from the streets to the palace they say that money talks by god if it does i ought to shout for ive more million dollars than there are men in this room  nevertheless philip said growing calmer as he recognised the mans condition you are a very insufferable fellow  there had been a little murmur throughout the room at the end of sylvanus powers last blatant speech but at philips retort there was a hushed almost an awed silence mr honeybrook rose to his feet  sir he said turning to power to the best of my belief you are not a member of this club  i am a member of any club in america i choose to enter the intruder declared as for you writing and acting popinjays i could break the lot of you if i chose i came to see you ware come out from your friends and talk to me  philip pushed back his chair made his way deliberately round the head of the table brushing aside several arms outstretched to prevent his going sylvanus power stood in an open space between the tables swinging his cane with its ugly top in the middle of his hand he watched philips approach and lowered his head a little like a bull about to charge  if you have anything to say to me philip observed coolly i am here but i warn you that there is one subject which is never discussed within these walls if you transgress our unwritten rule i shall neither listen to what you have to say nor will you be allowed to remain here  and what is that subject sylvanus power thundered  no womans name is mentioned here philip told him calmly  several of the men had sprung to their feet it seemed from powers attitude as though murder might be done philip however stood his ground almost contemptuously his frame tense and poised his fists clenched suddenly the strain passed the man whose face for a moment had been almost black with passion lowered his cane swayed a little upon his feet and recovered himself  so you know what ive come here to talk about young man he demanded  one can surmise philip replied if you think it worth while i will accompany you to my rooms or to yours  philip in those few seconds made a reputation for himself which he never lost the little company of men looked at one another in mute acknowledgment of a courage which not one of them failed to appreciate  ill take you at your word sylvanus power decided grimly here boys he went on moving towards the table where philip had been seated give me a drinksome rye whisky im dry  not a soul stirred even noel bridges remained motionless heselton the junior manager of the theatre met the millionaires eye and never flinched mr honeybrook knocked the ash from his cigar and accepted the role of spokesman  mr power he said we are a hospitable company here and we are at all times glad to entertain our friends at the same time the privileges of the club are retained so far as possible for those who conform to a reasonable standard of good manners  there was a sudden thumping of hands upon the table until the glasses rattled powers face showed not a single sign of anger he was simply puzzled he had come into touch with something which he could not understand there was bridges earning a salary at his theatre to be thrown out into the streets or made a star of according to his whim heselton a family man drawing his salary and a good one too also from the theatre men whose faces were familiar to himsome of them he knew on newspapers in which he owned a controlling interest the power of which he had bragged was a real enough thing what had come to these men that they failed to recognise itto this slim young boy of an englishman that he dared to defy him  pretty queer crowd you boys he muttered  philip who had been waiting by the door came a few steps back again  mr power he said i dont know much about you and you dont seem to know anything at all about us i am only at present a member by courtesy of this club but it isnt often that any one has reason to complain of lack of hospitality here if you take my advice youll apologise to these gentlemen for your shockingly bad behaviour when you came in tell them that you werent quite yourself and ill stand you a drink myself  that goes honeybrook assented gravely its up to you sir  mr sylvanus power felt that he had wandered into a culdesac he had found his way into one of those branch avenues leading from the great road of his imperial success he was man enough to know when to turn back  gentlemen he said i offer you my apologies i came here in a furious temper and a little drunk i retract all that i said ill drink to your club if youll allow me the privilege  willing hands filled his tumbler and grateful ones forced a glass between philips fingers none of them really wanted sylvanus power for an enemy  heres looking at you all the latter said luck he muttered glancing towards philip  they all drank as though it were a rite philip and sylvanus power set their glasses down almost at the same moment philip turned towards the door  i am at your service now mr power he announced good night you fellows  there was a new ring of friendliness in the hearty response which came from every corner of the room  goodnight ware  so long old fellow  good night old chap  there was a little delay in the cloakroom while the attendant searched for philips hat which had been temporarily misplaced honeybrook who had followed the two men out of the room fumbling for a moment in his locker and coming over to philip dropped something into the latters overcoat pocket  rather like a scene in a melodrama isnt it ware he whispered but i know a little about sylvanus power its only a last resource mind    chapter x  philip fetched his hat and the two men stepped out on to the pavement a servant in quiet grey livery held open the door of an enormous motor car sylvanus power beckoned his companion to precede him  home he told the man unless he added turning to philip youd rather go to your rooms  i am quite indifferent philip replied  they drove off in absolute silence a silence which remained unbroken until they passed through some elaborate iron gates and drew up before a mansion in fifth avenue  youll wait sylvanus power ordered and take this gentleman home this way sir  the doors rolled open before them philip caught a vista of a wonderful hall with a domed roof and stained glass windows and a fountain playing from some marble statuary at the further end a personage in black took his coat and hat the door of a dining room stood open a table covered with a profusion of flowers was laid and places set for two mr sylvanus power turned abruptly to a footman  you can have that cleared away he directed harshly no supper will be required  he swung around and led the way into a room at the rear of the hall a room which in comparison with philips confused impressions of the rest of the place was almost plainly furnished there was a small oak sideboard upon which was set out whisky and soda and cigars a great desk covered with papers before which a young man was seated two telephone instruments and a phonograph the walls were lined with books the room itself was long and narrow power turned to the young man  you can go to bed george he ordered disconnect the telephones  the young man gathered up some papers locked the desk in silence bowed to his employer and left the room without a word power waited until the door was closed then he stood up with his back to the fireplace and pointed to a chair  you can sit if you like he invited drink or smoke if you want to youre welcome  thank you philip replied id rather stand  you dont want even to take a chair in my house i suppose mr sylvanus power went on mockingly or drink my whisky or smoke my cigars eh  from the little i have seen of you philip confessed my inclinations are certainly against accepting any hospitality at your hands  thats a playwriting trick i suppose sylvanus power sneered stringing out your sentences as pat as butter its not my way theres the truth always at the back of my head and the words ready to fit it but they come as they please  i seem to have noticed that philip observed  what sort of a man are you anyway the other demanded his heavy eyebrows suddenly lowering his wonderful keen eyes riveted upon philip can i buy you i wonder or threaten you  that rather depends upon what it is you want from me  i want you to leave this country and never set foot in it again thats what i want of you i want you to get back to your london slums and write your stuff there and have it played in your own poky little theatres i want you out of new york and i want you out quick  then i am afraid philip regretted that we are wasting time i havent the least intention of leaving new york  well well go through the rigmarole power continued gruffly weve got to understand one another theres my cheque book in that safe a million dollars if you leave this countryalonewithin twentyfour hours and stay away for the rest of your life  philip raised his eyebrows he was lounging slightly against the desk  i should have no use for a million dollars mr power he said if i had i should not take it from you and further the conditions you suggest are absurd  bribery no good eh mr power observed what about threats there was a man once who wrote a letter to a certain woman which i found i killed him a few days afterwards there was a sort of a scuffle but it was murder right enough i am nearer the door than you are and i should say about three times as strong how would a fight suit you  wares hand was in his overcoat pocket  not particularly he answered besides it wouldnt be fair you see i am armed and youre not  as though for curiosity he drew from his pocket the little revolver which honeybrook had slipped into it power looked at it and shrugged his shoulders  well leave that out then for the moment he said now listen to me im off on another tack now eight years ago i met elizabeth dalstan i was thirtyeight years old theni am fortysix now you young men nowadays go through your life they tell me with a woman on your hands most of the time waste yourself out in a score of passions go through the same old rigmarole once a year or something like it i was married when i was twentyfour i got married to lay my hands on the first ten thousand dollars i needed my wife left me fifteen years ago you may have read of her she was a storekeepers daughter then she has a flat in paris now a country house in england a villa at monte carlo and another at florence she lives her life i live mine shes the only woman id ever spoken a civil word to until i met elizabeth dalstan or since  philip was interested despite his violent antipathy to the man  a singular record of fidelity he remarked suavely  if youd drop that playacting talk and speak like a man id like you better sylvanus power continued there it is in plain words i lived with my wife until we quarrelled and she left me and while she lived with me i thought no more of women than cats when she went i thought id done with the sex elizabeth dalstan happened along and i found i hadnt even begun eight years ago we met i offered her at once everything i could offer nothing doing we dont need to tell one another that she isnt that sort i went off and left her spent a winter in siberia and came home by china i suppose there were women there and in paris i was there for a month i didnt see them then america elizabeth dalstan was still touring not doing much good for herself i hung around for a time tried my luck once moreno go then i went back to europe offered my wife ten million and an income for a divorce it didnt suit her so i came back again the third time i found elizabeth discouraged if ever a man found a woman at the right time i did she is ambitiouslord knows why i hate acting and the theatres and everything to do with them however i tried a new move i built that theatre in new yorkthere isnt another place like it in the worldand offered it to her for a birthday present then she began to hesitate  look here philip broke in i know all this i know everything you have told me and everything you can tell me what about it what have you got to say to me  this sylvanus power declared striking the desk with his clenched fist i have only had one consolation all the time i have been waitingthere has been no other man elizabeth isnt that sort each time i was separated and came back i just looked at her and i knew thats why i have been patient that is why i havent insisted upon my debt being paid you understand that  i hear what you say  power crossed the room helped himself to whisky and returned to his place with the tumbler in his hand there was a brief silence a little clock upon the mantelpiece struck two the street sounds outside had ceased save for the hoot of an occasional taxicab philip was conscious of a burning desire to get away this man this great lump of power and success standing like a colossus in his wonderful home infuriated him that a man should live who thought he had a right such as he claimed was maddening  well power proceeded setting down the tumbler empty you wont be bought how am i going to get you out of the way  you cant do it philip asserted i am going tomorrow morning to elizabeth and i am going to pray her to marry me at once  power swayed for a single moment upon his feet the teeth gleamed between his slightly parted lips his great arm was outstretched its bursting muscles showing against the sleeve of his dinner coat his chest was heaving  if you do it he shouted ill close the theatre tomorrow and sack every one in it ill buy any theatre in new york where you try to present your nambypamby play ill buy every manager she goes to for an engagement every newspaper that says a word of praise of any work of yours i tell you ill stand behind the scenes and pull the strings which shall bring you and her to the knowledge of what failure and want mean ill give up the great things in life ill devote every dollar i have every thought of my brain every atom of my power to bringing you two face to face with misery thats if i keep my hands off you i maynt do that  philip shrugged his shoulders  if i put you in a play he said which is where you really belong people would find you humorous your threats dont affect me at all mr power elizabeth can choose  power leaned over to the switch and turned on an electric light above philips head  blast you let me look at you he thundered youre a whitefaced sickly creature to call yourself a man cant you see this thing as i see it youre the sort thats had women and plenty of them another will do for you and my god she is the only one ive looked ati sylvanus power mindi who have ruled fate and ruled men all my lifei want her dont be a fool get out of my path ive crushed a hundred such men as you in my day  philip took up his hat  we are wasting time he observed you are a cruder person than i thought you mr power i am sorry for you if thats anything  sorry for me you  very philip continued you see youve imbibed a false view of life youve placed yourself amongst the gods and your feet really are made of very sticky clay shall i find my own way out  you can find your way to hell power roared use your toy pistol if you want to youre going where youll never need it again  he took a giant stride a stride which was more like the spring of a maddened bull towards philip the veneer of a spurious civilisation seemed to have fallen from him he was the great and splendid animal transformed with an overmastering passion there was murder in his eyes his great right arm with its long hairy fingers and its single massive ring was like the limb of some prehistoric creature philips brain and his feet however were alike nimble he sprang a little on one side and though that first blow caught him just on the edge of the shoulder and sent him spinning round and round he saved himself by clutching at the desk fortunately it was his left arm that hung helpless by his side his fingers groped feverishly in the cavernous folds of his overcoat pocket power who had dashed against the wall smashing the glass of one of the pictures had already recovered his balance and turned around the little revolver with whose use philip was barely acquainted flashed suddenly out in the lamplight even in that lurid moment he kept his nerve he aimed at the right arm outstretched to strike him and pulled the trigger through the little mist of smoke he saw a spasm of pain in his assailants face felt the thundering crash of his other arm striking him on the side of the head the room spun round there was a second almost of unconsciousness when he came to he was lying with his finger pressed against the electric bell power was clutching the desk for support and gasping the sober person in black with a couple of footmen behind were already in the room their master turned to them  there has been an accident here he groaned nothing serious take that gentleman and put him in the car its waiting outside for him telephone round for doctor renshaw  for a single moment the majordomo hesitated the weapon was still smoking in philips hand then powers voice rang out again in furious command  do as i tell you he ordered if theres one of you here opens his lips about this he leaves my service tomorrow not a dollar of pension mind he added his voice shaking a little  the servant bowed sombrely  your orders shall be obeyed sir he promised  he took up the telephone and signed to one of the footmen who helped philip to the door a moment afterwards the latter sank back amongst the cushions a little dizzy and breathless but revived almost instantly by the cool night air he gave the chauffeur his address and the car glided through the iron gates and down fifth avenue    chapter xi  philip was awakened the next morning by the insistent ringing of the telephone at his elbow he took up the receiver conscious of a sharp pain in his left shoulder as he moved  is this mr merton ware a mans smooth voice enquired  yes  i am speaking for mr sylvanus power mr sylvanus power regrets very much that he is unable to lunch with mr ware as arranged today but he is compelled to go to philadelphia on the morning train he will be glad to meet mr ware anywhere a week today and know the result of the matter which was discussed last night  to whom am i speaking philip demanded i dont know anything about lunching with mr power today  i am mr powers secretary george lunt was the reply mr powers message is very clear he wishes you to know that he will not be in new york until a week today  how is mr power philip enquired  he met with a slight accident last night the voice continued and is obliged to wear his arm in a sling except for that he is quite well he has already left for philadelphia by the early train he was anxious that you should know this  thank you very much philip murmured a little dazed  he sprang out of bed dressed quickly hurried over his coffee and rolls boarded a crosstown car and arrived at the monmouth house flats just in time to meet martha grimes issuing into the street she was not at all the same martha she was very neatly dressed her shoes were nicely polished her clothes well brushed her gloves new and she wore a bunch of freshlooking violets in her waistband she started in surprise as philip accosted her  whatever are you doing back in the slums she demanded any fresh trouble  nothing particular philip replied turning round and falling into step with her i cant see my way thats all and i want to talk to you youre the most human person i know and you understand elizabeth  gee she smiled this is the lion and the mouse with a vengeance you can walk with me if you like as far as the block before the theatre im not going to arrive there with you and i tell you so straight  no followers eh  theres no reason to set people talking she declared their tongues wag fast enough at the theatre as it is ive only been there for one days work and it seems to me ive heard the inside history of every one connected with the place  that makes what i have to say easier he remarked just what do they say about miss dalstan and mr sylvanus power  she looked at him indignantly  if you think youre going to worm things out of me  dont be foolish he interrupted a little wearily how could you know anything you are only the echo of a thousand voices i could find out if i went where they gossip i dont in effect i dont care but i am up against a queer situation i want to know just what people think of them afterwards ill tell you the truth  well they profess to think she said slowly that the theatre belongs to miss dalstan and that she  stop please he interrupted i know you hate saying it and i know quite well what you mean well what about that  it isnt my affair  it isnt true he told her  whether its true or not she is one of the best women in the world martha declared vigorously  there isnt any doubt about that either he assented this is the situation listen sylvanus power has been in love with elizabeth for the best part of his life he built that theatre for her and offered itat a price she accepted his terms when the time came for payment he saw her flinch he went away again and has just come back she is face to face now with a decision a decision to which she is partly committed in the meantime during these last few months elizabeth and i have become great friends you know that i care for her i think that she cares for me she has to make up her mind martha which is she to choose  how do you want me to answer that the girl asked slackening her pace a little im not miss dalstan  from her point of view he explained eagerly this man power is madly and i believe truly in love with her in his way he is great in his way too he is a potentate he can give her more than luxury more even than success you know elizabeth he went on she is one of the finest women who ever breathed an idealist but a seeker after big things she deserves the big things is she more likely to find them with me or with him  powers wife is still alive she ruminated  and wont accept a divorce at present he observed if ever she does of course he will marry her that has to be taken into account not morally but the temporal side of it we know perfectly well that whatever elizabeth decides she couldnt possibly do wrong  martha smiled a little grimly  thats what it is to be born in the clouds she said there is no sin for a good woman  he looked at her appreciatively  i wonder how i knew that you would understand this he sighed  suddenly he clutched at her arm she glanced up in surprise he was staring at a passerby her eyes followed his in a neat morning suit with a black bowler hat and wellpolished shoes a cigar in his mouth and a general air of prosperity mr edward dane was strolling along broadway he passed without a glance at either of them for a moment philip faltered then he set his teeth and walked on there was an ashen shade in his face the girl looked at him and shook her head  mr ware she said we havent talked much about it but there is something there behind isnt there something you are terrified about something that might come even now  she knows about it he interposed quickly  would it be very bad if it came  hideous  if she were your wife  she would be notorious it would ruin her  do you think then she asked quietly that you needed to come and ask my advice  he walked on with his head high looking upwards with unseeing eyes a little vista of that undisturbed supper table on the other side of the marble hall a dim perspective of those eight years of waiting flitted through his brain the lord of that fifth avenue mansion was in earnest right enough and he had so much to offer  it will break me if i have to give her up he said simply i believe i should have gone overboard crossing the atlantic but for her  there are some women she sighed the best of all women the joy of whose life seems to be sacrifice that sounds queer dont it but its true theyre happy in misfortune so long as they are helping some one else she is wonderful elizabeth dalstan she may even be one of those youll find that out youd better find out for yourself there isnt any one can help you very much  i am not sure that you havent he said now ill go where did you get your violets martha  had them in water since last night havent you  she made a little grimace at him  a very polite young gentleman at the box office sent us each a bunch directly we started work yesterday ive only had a few words with him yet but evathats the other girlshes plagued to death with fellows already so im going to take him out one evening  philip stopped short they were approaching the theatre  not a step further he declared solemnly i wouldnt spoil your prospects for worlds run along my little cynic and warm your hands lifes good at your agebetter than when i found you eh  you dont think i am ungrateful she asked a little wistfully  he shook his head  you couldnt be that martha good luck to you  she turned away with a little farewell wave of the hand and was lost at once in the surging stream of people philip summoned a taxicab sat far back in the corner and drove to his rooms he hesitated for a moment before getting out crossed the pavement quickly hurried into the lift and arriving upstairs let down the latch of the outside door edward dane was back in new york for a moment the memory of the great human drama in which he found himself a somewhat pathetic figure seemed swallowed up by this sudden resurrection of a grisly tragedy he looked around his room a little helplessly against his will that hideous vision which had loomed up before him in so many moments of depression was slowly reforming itself this time not in the still watches of the night but in the broad daylight with the spring sunshine to cheer his heart the roar of a friendly city in his ears it was no time for dreams this and yet he felt the misery sweeping in upon him felt all the cold shivers of his ineffective struggles slowly that fateful panorama unfolded itself before his memory he saw himself step out with glad relief from the uncomfortable nauseous thirdclass carriage and clutching his humble little present in his hand cross the flinty platform climb the long rainswept hill keeping his head upraised though the very sky seemed grimy battling against the miserable depression of that everlasting ugliness before him at least there was his one companion there would be kind words sympathy a cheerful fireside a little dreaming a little wandering into that world which they had made for themselves with the help of such treasures as that cheap little volume he carried and then the last few steps the open door the room its air at first of wonderful comfort and then the queer note of luxury obtruding itself disquietingly the picture on the mantelpiece her coming he had never been in love with beatrice he knew that now perfectly well he had simply clung to her because she was the only living being who knew and understood because they had mingled their thoughts and trodden the path of misery together removed now from that blaze of passion smouldering perhaps in him through previous years of discontent but which leaped into actual and effective life for the first time in those few moments he realised a certain justice in her point of view a certain hard logic in the way she had spoken of life and their relations there had been so little real affection between them so little had passed which might have constituted a greater bond it was his passionate outburst of revolt against life whose drear talons seemed to have fastened themselves into his very soul which had sent him out with murder in his brain to seek the man who had robbed him of the one thing which stood between him and despair the pentup fury of a lifetime which had tingled in his blood and had given him the strength of the navvy in those few minutes by the canal side  he covered his face with his hands strode around the room gazing wildly out over the city trying to listen to the clanging of the surface cars the rumble of the overhead railway in the distance the breaking of the long ceaseless waves of human feet upon the pavement it was useless no effort of his will could keep from his brain the haunting memory of those final momentsthe mans face handsome and wellsatisfied at first the careless greeting the sudden change the surprise the apprehension the ghastly fear the agony he heard the low gurgling shriek of terror he looked into the eyes with the fear of hell before them then he heard the splash of the black filthy water  there was a cry it was several seconds before he realised that it had broken from his lips he looked around him like a hunted creature there was another terror nowthe gloomy court with its ugly miserable paraphernaliathe death uglier still death in disgrace a sordid ghastly thing and in his brain too there was so much dawning so many wonderful ideas craving for fulfilment these few months had been months of marvellous development the power of the writer had seemed to grow hour by hour his brain was full of fancies exquisite fancies some of them it was a new world growing up around him and within him too beautiful a world to leave yet in those breathless moments fear was the dominant sensation he felt a coward to his fingertips  he walked up and down the room feverishly as a man might pace a prison in the first few moments of captivity there was no escape if he disappeared again it would only rivet suspicion the more closely there was no place to which he could fly no shelter save on the other side of the life which he had just begun to love his physical condition began to alarm him he felt his forehead by accident and found it damp with sweat his heart was beating irregularly with a spasmodic vigour which brought pain he caught sight of his terrorstricken face in the lookingglass and the craving to escape from his frenzied solitude overcame all his other resolutions he rushed to the telephone spoke with phoebe waited breathlessly whilst she fetched his mistress to the instrument  i want to see you he begged as soon as he was conscious of her presence at the other end i want to see you at once  has anything happened she asked quickly  yes he almost groaned i cant tell you  i will be with you in ten minutes she promised  he set the receiver down those ten minutes were surely the longest which had ever ticked their way into eternity and then she came he heard the lift stop and his door open there was a moments breathless silence as their eyes met then a little gathering together of the lines of her forehead a half querulous half sympathetic smile she shook her head at him  youve had one of those silly nervous attacks she declared tell me at once why  dane is backi saw him on the pavement this morning he exclaimed he has been to england to find out  she made him sit down and seated herself by his side  listen she said dane came back on the orinoco the day before yesterday i saw his name in the paper if his voyage to england had been a success which it could not have been you would have heard from him before now  i didnt think of that he muttered  i have never asked you she went on to tell me exactly what happened behind there i dont want to know only i have a consciousnessi had from the first when you began to talk to me about itthat your fears were exaggerated if you have been allowed to remain safe all this time you will be safe always i feel it and i am always right in these things now use your own common sense tell me truthfully dont you think it is very improbable that anything could be discovered  that anything could be proved he admitted eagerly yes  then dont be silly no one is likely to make accusations and attempt a case unless they had a definite end in view we are safe even from the elletania people mr raymond greene has ceased to talk of your wonderful resemblance to douglas romilly phoebethe only one who could really knowwill never open her lips now take me for a little walk we will look in the shops in fifth avenue and lunch at the ritzcarlton go and brush yourself and make yourself look respectable ill have a cigarette and read the paper no i wont ill look over these loose sheets and see how you are getting on  he disappeared into his room for a few minutes when he returned she was entirely engrossed she looked up at him with something almost of reverence in her face  when did you write this she asked  yesterday most of it he answered there is more of iti havent finished yet when you send me away this afternoon i shall go on that is only the beginning i have a great idea dawning  what you have written is wonderful she said simply it makes me feel almost humble makes me feel that the very best actress in the world remains only an interpretress yes i can say those words you have written but they can never be mine i want to be something more than an intelligent parrot philip why cant you teach me to feel and think things like that  you he murmured as he took her arm and led her to the door you could feel all the sweetest and most wonderful things in heaven the writers knack is only a slight gift i put on paper what lives in your heart  she raised her head and he kissed her lips for a moment he held her quite quietly her arms encircled him the perfume of her clothes her hair her warm gentle touch seemed like a strong sedative if she said that he was safe he must be it was queer how so often at these times their sexes seemed reversed it was he who felt that womanly desire for shelter and protection which she so amply afforded him she patted his cheek  now for our little walk she said open the windows and let out all these bad fancies of yours and listen she went on as they stepped out of the lift a moment or two later and passed through the hall towards the pavement not a word about our own problem we are going to talk nonsense we are going to be just two lighthearted children in this wonderful city gazing at the sights and taking all she has to offer us i love it you know i love the noise of it it isnt a distant stifled roar like london theres a harsh clarionlike note about it like metal striking upon metal and the smell of new yorkthere isnt any other city like it when we get into fifth avenue i am going to direct your attention to the subject of hats have you ever bought a womans hat philip  never he answered truthfully enough  then you are going to this morning or rather you are going to help me to choose one she declared and in a very few moments too there is a little place almost underground in fifth avenue there and a frenchwomanoh she is so frenchand all her assistants have black hair and wear untidy shapeless clothes and velvet slippers it isnt new york at all but i love it and i let them put their name on the programme they really dont charge me more than twice as much as they ought to for my hats we go down here she added descending some steps and if you make eyes at any of the young women i shall bring you straight out again  they spent half an hour choosing a hat and nearly two hours over lunch it was late in the afternoon before she dropped him at his rooms not a word had they spoken of sylvanus power or their future but philip was a different man only as he turned and said goodby his voice trembled  i cant say thank you he muttered but you know  the lift was too slow for him he opened his door with almost breathless haste he only paused to light a cigarette and change his coat and wheel his table round so as to catch the afternoon light more perfectly then with his brain teeming with fancies he plunged into his work    chapter xii  philip let the pen slip at last from his tired fingers the light had failed he had been writing with straining eyes almost in the darkness but there was something else had it been fancy or  this time there could be no mistake he had not heard the lift stop but some one was knocking softly at the door softly but persistently he turned his head the room seemed filled with shadows he had written for hours and he was conscious that his limbs were stiff the sun had gone down in a cloudy sky and the light had faded he could scarcely distinguish the articles of furniture at the further end of the room for some reason or other he felt tonguetied then without any answer from him to this mysterious summons the handle of the door slowly turned as he sat there he saw it pushed open a woman wrapped in a long coat stepped inside closing it firmly behind her she stood peering around the room there was something familiar and yet unfamiliar in her height her carriage he waited spellbound for her voice  douglas she exclaimed ah there you are  the words seemed to die away unuttered upon his lips he suddenly thought that he was choking he stared at her blankly it was impossible she came a step further into the room her hand was stretched out accusingly  so ive found you have i douglas she cried and there was a note of bitter triumph in her words found you after all these months arent you terrified arent you afraid no wonder you sit there shrinking away do you know what i have come for  he tried to speak but his lips were as powerless to frame words as his limbs were to respond to his desire for movement this was the one thing which he had not foreseen  you broke your promise she went on raising her voice a little in passionate reproach you left me there alone to face dismissal without a penny and slipped off yourself to america you never even came in to wish me goodby why tell me why you went without coming near me you wont eh you darent be a man out with it i am here and i know the truth  for the first time some definite sound came from his lips  beatrice he gasped  ah she mocked you can remember my name then douglas i knew that you were a bad man i knew that when you told me how you meant to cheat your creditors how you meant to escape over here on the pretext of business and bring all the money you could scrape together i knew that and yet i was willing to come with you and i should have come but there was one thing i didnt reckon upon i didnt know that you had the heart or the courage to be a murderer  the little cry that broke from his lips was stifled even before it was uttered  i shall never forgive you she sobbed i never want to touch your bloodstained fingers i have forgotten that i ever loved you youre horribledo you hearhorrible and yet i dont mean to be left to starve thats why ive followed you youre afraid i am going to give you up to justice well i dont know it depends turn on the lights i want to see you do you hear i want to see how you can face me i want to see how the memory of that afternoon has dealt with you do as i tell you dont stand there glowering at me  he crossed the room with stumbling footsteps  youve learnt to stoop anyhow she went on youre thinner too my god  the room was suddenly flooded with light philip rigid and ghastly was looking at her from the other side of the table she held up her hands as though to shut out the sight of him  philip she shrieked philip oh my god  her eyes were lit with horror as she swayed upon her feet for a moment she seemed about to collapse then she groped her way towards the door and stood there clinging to the handle slowly she looked around over her shoulder her face as white as death she moistened her lips with her tongue her eyes glared at him behind her brain seemed to be working her first spasm of inarticulate fear passed  philipalive she muttered alive speak cant you speak to me are you a ghost  of course not he answered with a calm which surprised him you cant have forgotten in less than six months what i look like  a new expression struggled into her face she abandoned her grasp of the handle and came back to her former position  look here she faltered if you are philip romilly wheres hedouglas wheres douglas  there was no answer philip simply looked at her she began to shake once more upon her feet  wheres douglas she demanded fiercely tell me tell me quickly before i go mad if you are philip romilly alive if it wasnt your body they found wheres douglas  you can guess what happened to him philip said slowly i met him on the towingpath by the side of the canal i spoke to himabout you he answered me with a jest i think that all the passion of those grinding years of misery swept up at that moment from my heart i was stronggod how strong i was i took him by the throat beatrice i watched his face change i watched his damned selfsatisfied complacency fade away he lost all his smugness and his eyes began to stare at me and his lips grew whiter as they struggled to utter the cries for mercy which choked back then i flung him inthats all splash god i can hear it now i saw his face just under the water then i went on  you went on she repeated trembling in every limb  i picked up the pocketbook which i had shaken out of his clothes in that first struggle i studied its contents and it gave me an idea i went to liverpool stayed at the hotel where he had engaged rooms dressed myself in his clothes and went on the steamer in his place i travelled to new york as mr douglas romilly of the douglas romilly shoe company occupied my room at the waldorf under that name then i disappeared suddenlythere were too many people waiting to see me i took the pseudonym which he had carefully prepared for himself and hid for a time in a small tenement house then i rewrote the play there you have my story  youmurdered him philip you  it was no crime he continued calmly filled with a queer sense of relief at the idea of being able to talk about it my whole life up till that day had been one epitome of injustice and evil fortune you were my one solace his lifewell you know what it had been everything was made easy for him he had a luxurious boyhood he was sent to college pampered and spoilt and passed on to a dissipated manhood he spent a great fortune ruined a magnificent business he lived month by month hour by hour for just the voluptuous pleasures which his wealth made possible to him that was the man i met on the canal bank that afternoon you know the state i was in you know very well the grievance i had against him  you had no right to interfere she said dully if i chose to accept what he had to give it was my business there never had been overmuch affection between you and me we were just waifs together life wouldnt give us what we wanted i had made up my mind months before to escape whenever the opportunity came douglas brought it to me and i snatched at it i am not accepting any blame  he leaned towards her  neither am i he declared do you remember we used to talk about the doctrine of responsibility i am a pervert i did what i had to do and i am content  she stood quite still for several moments then she took out the pins from her hat banged it upon the table opened her tweed coat came round to the fireside and threw herself into an easychair her action was portentous and significant  tell me how you found me out he asked after a brief pause  i was dismissed from detton magna she told him i had to go and be waitingmaid to aunt esther at croydon i took the place of her maidofallwork i scrubbed for my living there wasnt anything else i hadnt clothes to try for the bolder things not a friend in the world but i was only waiting i meant at the first chance to rob aunt esther to come to london dress myself properly and find a post on the stage if possible i wasnt particular then one day a man came to see mean american hed travelled all the way from new york because he was interested in what he called the mysterious romilly disappearance he knew that i had been douglas friend he asked me to come out and identifyyou he offered me my passage a hundred pounds and to give me a start in life here if i needed it so i came out with him  with dane he muttered  she nodded  yes that was his namemr edward dane i came out to identify douglas  you werent going to give him away philip asked curiously  of course not i should have made my bargain and then after i had scared douglas for leaving me as he did i should have said that it wasnt the man and insteadi found you  he tapped the table with his fingers restlessly a new hope was forming in his brain this indeed might be the end of all his troubles  listen he said earnestly dane has always suspected me sometimes i have wondered whether he hadnt the truth at the back of his head you can make me safe forever  she made no reply her eyes were watching his face she seemed to be waiting to hear what else he had to say  dont you understand he went on impatiently you have only to tell dane that i am neither douglas nor philip but curiously like both and he will chuck the thing up he must then i shall be safe you see that dont you  yes i see that she admitted  well  tell me exactly how much of douglas money you have spent she demanded  only the loose money from the pocketbook not all of that i am earning money now  she leaned across the table  what about the twenty thousand pounds  i havent touched it he assured her not a penny  on your honour  he rose silently and went to his desk unlocked one of the drawers and drew from a hidden place a thin strip of paper he smoothed it out on the table before her  theres the deposit note he saidtwenty thousand pounds to the joint or separate credit of beatrice wenderley and douglas romilly on demand the moneys there still i havent touched it  she gripped the paper in her fingers the sight of the figures seemed to fascinate her then she looked around  how can you afford to live in a place like this then she demanded suspiciously where does your money come from  the play he told her  what all this she exclaimed  it is a great success the theatre is packed every night my royalties come every week to far more than i could spend  she looked once more around her gripped the deposit note in her fingers and leaned back in her chair she laughed curiously her eyes had travelled back to philips anxious face  wonderful she murmured you paid the price but youve won youve had something for it i paid the price and up till now  she stared at the paper in her hand then she looked away into the fire  i cant get it all into my head she went on i pictured him here living in luxury spending the money of which he had promised me a share  and hes dead that was his bodythat unrecognisable thing they found in the canal you killed himdouglas he was so fond of life too  fond of the things which meant life to him philip muttered  i should never have believed that you had the courage she observed ruminatingly after all then he wasnt faithless he wasnt the brute i thought him  she sat thinking for what seemed to him to be an interminable time he broke in at last upon her meditations  well he asked what are you going to say to dane  i shant give you awayat least i dont think so she promised cautiously i shall see presently i will make terms only this time i am not going to be left i am going to have what i want  but hell be waiting to hear from you philip exclaimed he may come here even  she shook her head  hes gone to chicago he cant be back for five days i promised to wire but i shant ill wait until hes back and in the meantime  her fingers closed upon the deposit note he nodded shortly  thats yours he said you can have it all i have helped myself to a fresh start in life at his expense thats all i wanted  she folded up the paper and thrust it carefully into the bosom of her gown then she stood up  well she pronounced i think i am getting used to things its wonderful how callous one can become the banks are closed now i suppose  he nodded  they will be open at nine oclock in the morning  first of all then she decided ill make sure of my twenty thousand pounds and then well see i dont think youll find me hard philip i ought not to be hard on you ought i  she looked at him most kindly and he began to shiver curiously enough her very kindness when he realised the knowledge which lay behind her brain was hateful to him he had pleaded for her forgiveness even her toleration butanything else seemed horrible she strolled across the room and glanced at the clock took one of his cigarettes from a box and lit it  well this is queer she murmured reflectively now i want some dinner and ill see your play philip you shall take me get ready quickly please  he looked at her doubtfully  but beatrice he protested think you know why you came here you know the story you will have to tell we are strangers you and i what if we are seen together  she snapped her fingers at him  pooh who cares i am a stranger in new york and i have taken a fancy to you you are a young man of gallantry and you are going to take me out we often used to talk of a little excursion like this in london well have it in new york instead  he turned slowly towards the door of his bedroom she was busy looking at her own eyes in the mirror and she missed the little gleam of horror in his face  in ten minutes he promised her    chapter xiii  beatrice replaced the programme which she had been studying on the ledge of the box and turned towards philip who was seated in the background there was something a little new in her manner her tone was subdued her eyes curious  you really are a wonderful person philip she declared its the same play just as you used to tell it me word for word and yet it isnt what is it that you have gained i wondera sense of atmosphere breadth something strangely vital  i am glad you like it he said simply  like it its amazing and what an audience i never thought that the people were so fashionable here philip i am sitting right back in the box but ten minutes after i have cashed my draft tomorrow i shall be buying clothes you wont be ashamed to be seen anywhere with me then  he drew his chair up to her side a little haggard and worn with the suspense of the evening she laughed at him mockingly  what an idiot you are she exclaimed you ought to be one of the happiest men in the world and you look like a deathshead  the happiest man in the world he repeated  beatrice sometimes i think that there is only one thing in the world that makes for happiness  and whats that booby she asked with some of her old familiarity  a clear conscience  she laid her hand upon his arm  look here philip she said the one thing i determined when i threw up the sponge was that whether the venture was a success or not id never waste a single moment in regrets things didnt turn out too brilliantly with me as you know but yousee what youve attained why its wonderful your play the one thing you dreamed about produced in one of the greatest cities in the world and a packed house to listen to it people applauding all the time i didnt realise your success when we talked this evening i am just beginning to understand ive been reading some of these extracts from the newspapers youre merton ware the great dramatist the coming man of letters youve won philip cant you see that its puling cowardice to grumble at the price  he for his part was wondering at her callousness of which he was constantly discovering fresh evidences the whole shock of her discovery seemed already in these few hours to have passed away  if you can forgetso soon he muttered i suppose i ought to be able to  she made a little grimace but immediately afterwards he saw the cold tightening of her lips  listen philip she said i started life with the usual quiverful of good qualities but theres one ive lost and i dont want it back again im a selfish woman and i mean to stay a selfish woman i am going to live for myself ive paid a fair price and im going to have what ive paid for see  do you think he asked that it is possible to make that sort of bargain with ones self and fate  she laughed scornfully  theres room for a little stiffening in you even now philip no one but a weakling ever talks about fate youd think better of me i suppose if i stayed in my room and wept well i could do it if i let myself but i wont i should lose several hours of the life that belongs to me you think i didnt care about douglas i am not at all sure that i didnt care for him as much as i ever did for you although of course he wasnt worthy of it but hes gone and all the shudders and morbid regrets in the world wont bring him back again and i am here in new york and tomorrow i shall have twenty thousand pounds and tonight i am with you watching your play thats life enough for me at presentno more no less i hate missing the first act and im coming to see it again tomorrow what time is it over  soon after eleven he told her  she glanced at her watch  you shall take me out and give me some supper she decided somewhere where theres music  he made no remark but she surprised again something in his face which irritated her  look here philip she said firmly i wont have you look at me as though i were something inhuman there are plenty of other women like me in the world even if they are not quite so frank about it i want to live and i will live and i grudge every moment out of which i am not extracting the fullest amount of happiness thats because ive paid its the womans bargaining instinct you know she wants to get value now i want to hear about miss dalstan where did you meet her and how did you get her to accept your play  she was on the elletania he explained we crossed from liverpool together she sat at my table  how much does she know about you beatrice asked bluntly  everything he confessed i dont know what i should have done without her she has been the most wonderful friend any one could have  beatrice looked at him a little critically  youre a queer person philip she exclaimed youre not fit to go about alone really good thing i came over to take care of you i think  you dont understand he replied miss dalstan iswell unlike anybody else she wants to see you i am to take you round after the next act if you would like to go  beatrice smiled at him in a gratified manner  ive always wanted to go behind the scenes she admitted ill come with you with pleasure perhaps if i decide that id like to go on the stage she may be able to help me how much is twenty thousand pounds in dollars philip  a little over a hundred thousand he told her  i dont suppose they think that much out here she went on ruminatingly the hotel where mr dane sent meits nice enough in its way but very stuffy as regards the peopleis twice as expensive as it would be in london however we shall see  the curtain rang up on the third act and beatrice seated well back in the shadows followed the play attentively appreciated its good points and had every appearance of both understanding and enjoying it afterwards she rose promptly to her feet still clapping  im longing to meet miss dalstan philip she declared she is wonderful and to think that you wrote itthat you created the part for her i am really quite proud of you  she laughed at his embarrassment affecting to ignore the fact that it was less the authors modesty than some queer impulse of horror which seemed to come over him when any action of hers reminded him of their past familiarity he hurried on piloting her down the corridor to the door of elizabeths dressing room in response to his knock they were bidden to enter and elizabeth who was lying on a couch whilst a maid was busy preparing her costume for the next act held out her hand with a little welcoming smile  i am so glad to see you miss wenderley she said cordially philip bring miss wenderley over here youll forgive my not getting up wont you i have to rest for just these few minutes before the next act  beatrice was for a moment overpowered the luxury of the wonderful dressing room with its perfect french furniture its white walls hung with a few choice sketches the thick rugs upon the polished wood floor the exquisite toilet table with its wealth of gold and tortoiseshell appurtenanceselizabeth herself so beautiful and graciouseven a hurried contemplation of all these things took her breath away she felt suddenly acutely conscious of the poverty of her travelling clothes of her own insignificance  wont you sit down for a moment elizabeth begged pointing to a chair by her side you and i must be friends you know for philips sake  beatrice recovered herself a little she sank into the blue satin chair with its ample cushions and looked down at elizabeth with something very much like awe  i am sure philip must feel very grateful to you for having taken his play she declared it has given him a fresh chance in life  after all he has gone through elizabeth said gently he certainly deserves it it is a wonderfully clever play you know  dont blush mr author  i heard the story long ago beatrice observed only of course it sounded very differently then and we never dreamed that it would really be produced  philip has told me about those days elizabeth said i am afraid that you too have had your share of unhappiness miss wenderley i only hope that life in the future will make up to you something of what you have lost  the girls face hardened her lips came together in familiar fashion  i mean it to she declared i am going to make a start tomorrow i wish miss dalstan you could get philip to look at things a little more cheerfully he has been like a ghost ever since i arrived  elizabeth turned and smiled at him sympathetically  your coming must have been rather a shock she reminded beatrice you came with the idea did you not thatyou would find mr douglas romilly  the girl nodded and glanced around for the maid who had disappeared however into an inner apartment  they were always alike she confidedthe same figures same shaped head and that sort of thing douglas was a little overfond of life though and philip here hasnt found out yet what it means it was a shock though miss dalstan philip was sitting in the dark when i arrived at his rooms this evening andi thought it was douglas  elizabeth shivered a little  dont let us talk about it she begged you must come and see me wont you miss wenderley philip will tell you where i live are you going back to england at once  i havent made up my mind yet the girl replied with a slight frown it just depends  elizabeth glanced at the little clock upon her table and philip threw away his cigarette and came forward  we must go beatrice he announced miss dalstan has to change her dress for this act  he held out his hand and elizabeth rose lightly to her feet so far no word as to their two selves had passed their lips she smiled at him and all this sense of throbbing almost theatrical excitement subsided he was once more conscious of the beautiful things beyond once more he felt the rest of her presence  you must let me see something of you tomorrow philip she said telephone will you good night miss wenderley  the maid who had just returned held the door open philip glanced back over his shoulder elizabeth blew him a kiss a gesture which curiously enough brought a frown to beatrices face    chapter xiv  the close of the performance left them both curiously tonguetied they waited until the theatre was half empty before they left their seats then they joined the little throng of stragglers at the end  your play she murmured as they faced the soft night air i cant believe it even now weve seen it togetheryour playand this is new york thats a new ending isnt it  absolutely he confessed the ending was always what bothered me you know  she laughed not quite naturally she was unexpectedly impressed  so youre a genius after all she went on sometimes i wonderedbut never mind that now philip do you know i am starving we took exactly ten minutes over dinner  he led her to a huge restaurant a few doors away where they found a corner table up in the balcony an orchestra was playing light music and a little crowd of people were all the time streaming through the doors beatrice settled herself down with an air of content few of the people were in evening dress and the tone of the place was essentially democratic philip who had learnt a little about american dishes gave an order and beatrice sipped her cocktail with an air of growing appreciation  queer idea this but the stuff tastes all right she acknowledged i suppose if you were taking your dear miss dalstan out youd go to a different sort of place eh  we generally go further up town he admitted unthinkingly  she set her glass down quickly  so you do take her out do you she asked coldly youd have been with her tonight perhaps if i hadnt been here  very likely  she was half inclined to rally him behind it all a little annoyed  youre a nice sort of person why its only a few months ago since you pretended to be in love with me  he looked at her and her eyes fell before his  i dont think there was ever much question of our being in love with one another was there we simply seemed to have drifted together because we were both miserable and then as the time passed onwell you came to be my only solace against the wretchedness of that life  she nodded appreciatively for a moment the sights and sounds of the noisy restaurant passed from her consciousness  do you remember how glad i was to see you how we used to spend our holidays out in those dingy fields and hope and pray for better things some day but it was all so hopeless wasnt it you could barely keep yourself from starving and ioh the misery of that awful detton magna and teaching those wretched children there never were such children in the world i couldnt get their mothers to send them clean they seemed to have inherited all the vice the bad language the ugly sordidness with which the place reeked they were old men and women in wickedness before they passed their first standard its a corner of the world i never want to see again id rather find hell have you ordered any wine philip i want to forget  he pointed to the bottle which stood in the pail by their side and summoned a waiter she watched it being opened and their glasses filled  this is like one of our fairy stories of the old days isnt it she said well i drink to you philip heres success to our new lives  she raised her glass and drained it a woman had entered who reminded him of elizabeth and his eyes had wandered away for a moment as beatrice pledged him she called him back a little impatiently  dont sit there as though you were looking at ghosts philip try and remember who i am and what we used to mean to one another let us try and believe she added a little wistfully that one of those dreams of ours which we used to set floating like bubbles has come true we can wipe out all the memories we dont want that ought to be easy  ought it he answered grimly there are times when ive found it difficult enough  she laughed and looked about her he realised suddenly that she was still very attractive with her rather insolent mouth her clear eyes her silky hair with the little fringe people as they passed paid her some attention and she was frankly curious about everybody  well she went on presently thank heavens i have plenty of will power i remember nothing absolutely nothing which happened before this evening i am going to tell myself that an uncle in australia has died and left me money and so we are here in new york to spend it tomorrow i am going to begin i shall buy clothesall sorts of clothesand hats you wont know me tomorrow evening philip  his heart sank tomorrow evening  but beatrice he expostulated you dont think of staying out here do you you dont know a soul you havent a friend in the city  what friends have i in england she retorted not one i may just as well start a new life in a new country it seems bright enough here and gay i like it i shall move to a different sort of hotel tomorrow you must help me choose one and as to friends she whispered looking up at him with a little provocative gleam in her eyes dont you count cant you do what i am going to do philip cant you draw down that curtain  he shivered  i cant he muttered  a waiter brought their first course and she at once evinced interest in her food she returned to the subject however later on after she had drunk another glass of wine  youre a silly old thing you know she declared you found the courage somehow to break away from that loathsome existence you had more courage even than i because you ran a risk i never did but here you are free with the whole world before you and your last danger disappearing with the knowledge that i am ready to be your friend and am sensible about everything that has happened this ought to be an immense relief to you philip you ought to be the happiest man on earth and there you sit looking like a deathshead look at me for a moment like a human being cant you drink some more wine there must be some strength some manhood about you somewhere or you couldnt have done what you have done  he filled his glass mechanically she leaned across the table her eyes were bright her cheeks delicately pink  courage philip she murmured remember that what you did  well in a way it was for my sake wasnt itfor love of me i am here now and we are both free the old days are passed even their shadow cannot trouble us any longer dont be a sentimentalist listen and ill tell you somethingat the bottom of my heart i rather admire you for what you did dont you want your reward  no he answered firmly i dont  she shrugged her shoulders and kept time with her foot to the music across the table although she kept silence for a while she smiled at him whenever she caught his eye she was not angry not even hurt philip had always been so difficult but in the end so easily led she had unlimited confidence in herself  dont be a goose she exclaimed at last of course you want your reward and of course youll have it some day youve always lived with your head partly in the clouds and its always been my task to pull you down to earth i suppose i shall have to do the same again but tonight i havent patience i feel suddenly gay you are so nicelooking philip but youd look ten times nicer still if youd only smile once or twice and look as though you were glad  the whole thing was a nightmare to him the horror of it was in his blood yet he did his best to obey plain speaking just then was impossible he drank glass after glass of wine and called for liqueurs she held his fingers for a moment under the table  oh philip she whispered cant you forget that you have ever been a schoolteacher dear we are only human and did suffer so you know she went on you were made for the things that are coming to us youve improved already ever so much i like your clothes and the way you carry yourself but you lookoh so sad and so far away all the time when i came to your rooms at my first glimpse of you i knew that you were miserable we must alter all that dear tell me how it is that with all your success you havent been happy  memories he answered harshly only a few hours before you came i was in hell  then you had better make up your mind she told him firmly that you are going to climb up out of there and when youre out youre going to stay out you cant alter the past you cant alter even the smallest detail of its setting just as inevitably as our lives come and go so what has happened is finished with unchangeable it is only a weak person who would spoil the present and the future brooding you used not to be weak philip  i dont think that i am really he said i am moody though and thats almost as bad the sight of you brought it all back and that fellow daneive been frightened of him beatrice  well you neednt be any longer she declared what you want is some one with you all the time who understands you some one to drive back those other thoughts when they come to worry you it is really a very good thing for you dear that i came out to new york mr dane is going to be very disappointed when i tell him that i never saw you before in my life dont you love the music listen to that waltz that was written for happy people philip i adore this place i suppose we shall find others that we like better as time goes on but i shall always think of this evening it is the beginning of my task too philip with youfor you what has really happened dear i cant realise anything i feel as though the gates of some great prison had been thrown wideopen and everything there was to long for in life was just there within reach waiting i am glad so much gladder than i should have imagined possible its wonderful to have you again i didnt even feel that i missed you so much but i know now what it was that made life so appalling tell me am i still nice to look at  of course you are he assured her cant you understand that by the way people notice you  she strummed upon the table with her fingers her whole body seemed to be moving to the music she nodded several times  i dont want them to notice me philip she murmured i want you to look just for a moment as though you thought me the only person in the worldas you did once you know  he did his best to be responsive but he was not wholly successful nevertheless she was tolerant with his shortcomings they sat there until nearly three oclock it was she at last who rose reluctantly to her feet  i want to go whilst the memory of it all is wonderful she declared come heres a card with my address on drive me home now please  he paid his bill and they found a cab she linked her arm through his her head sank a little upon his shoulder he made no movement she waited for a moment then she leaned back amongst the cushions  philip she asked quietly has this elizabeth dalstan been letting you make love to her  please dont speak of miss dalstan like that he begged  answer my question she insisted  miss dalstan has been very kind to me he admitted slowly wonderfully kind if you really want to know i do care for her  more than you did for me  very much more he answered bravely and in a different fashion  in the darkness of the cab it seemed to him that her face had grown whiter her arm remained within his but it clasped him no longer her body seemed to have become limp even her voice firm though it was seemed pitched in a different key  listen she said you will have to forget miss dalstan i have made up my mind what i want in life and i am going to have it i shall draw my money tomorrow morning and afterwards i shall come straight to your rooms then we will talk i want more than just that money i am lonely and do you know philip i believe that i must have cared for you all the time and youyou must have cared for me a little or you would never have done that for my sake you must and you shall care philip because our time has come and i want you pleaseshall i have to say it deari want you to marry me  he wrenched himself free from her  that is quite out of the question beatrice he declared  she laughed at him mockingly  oh dont say that philip you might tempt me to be brutal you might tempt me to speak horribly plain words to you  speak them and have done with it he told her roughly i might find a few too  i am past hurting she replied and i am not in the least afraid of anything you could say you robbed me of the man who was bringing me to americawho would have married me some day i suppose well you must pay do you see and in my way i have told you the way i choose  you want me to marry you he demandedsimply marry you you do not care whether i have any love for you or whether i loathe you now  you couldnt loathe me could you she begged the thought of those long days we spent together in our prison house would rise up and forbid it kiss me  i will not  her lips sought his in vain he pushed her away  dont you understand he exclaimed there is another woman whom i have kissedwhom i am longing to kiss now  but we are old friends she pleaded and i am lonely kiss me how you like dont be foolish  he kissed her upon the cheek she pulled down her veil the cab had stopped before the door of her hotel  you are not to worry any more about ugly things philip she whispered holding his hand for a moment as he rang the bell for her you are safe rememberquite safe ive come to take care of you you need it so badly good night dear    chapter xv  late though it was when philip reached his rooms he found on his writing table a message addressed to him from the telephone call office in the building he tore it open  kindly ring up number 551 avenue immediately you return whatever the time  he glanced at the clock hesitated and finally approaching the instrument called up elizabeths number for a few moments he waited the silence in the streets outside seemed somehow to have become communicated to the line the space between them emptied of all the jarring sounds of the day it was across a deep gulf of silence that he heard at last her voice  yes is that you philip  i am here he answered i am sorry it is so late  have you only just come in  this moment  has that girl kept you out till now she asked reprovingly  i couldnt help it he replied it was her first night over here i took her to churchills for supper  is everythingall right with her she doesnt mean to make trouble  the unconscious irony of the question almost forced a smile to his lips  i dont think so he answered she is thoroughly excited at the idea of possessing the money i believe she thought that douglas would have drawn it all she is going straight to the bank early in the morning to get hold of it  what about the man dane  he has gone to chicago he wont be back for several days  there was a moments pause  have you anything to ask me she enquired  nothing  i have had the most extraordinary letter from sylvanus you and he have met  yes he admitted  philip we must make up our minds  you mean that you must make up your mind he answered gently  there was another silence then she spoke a little abruptly  i wonder whether you really love me philip no dont pleasedont try to answer such a foolish question go to bed and sleep well now youve had a trying day good night dear  he had barely time to say good night before he heard the ring off he set down the receiver somehow there was a sensation of relief in having been although indirectly in touch with her the idea of the letter from sylvanus power affected him only hazily the crowded events of the day had somehow or other dulled his power of concentrated thought he felt a curious sense of passivity he undressed without conscious effort closed his eyes and slept until he was awakened by the movements of the valet about the room  philip was still seated over his breakfast reading the paper and finishing his coffee when the door was thrown suddenly open and beatrice entered tumultuously she laughed at his air of blank surprise  you booby she exclaimed i couldnt help coming in to wish you good morning i have just discovered that my hotel is quite close by here lucky isnt it except that i am going to move good morning mr serious face she went on leaning towards him her hands behind her her lips held out invitingly  he set down his paper kissed her on the cheek and looked inside the coffeepot  have you had your breakfast  hours ago i was too excited to sleep when i got to bed and yet i feel so well philip wheres wall street wont you take me there  he shook his head  i am expecting a visitor and i have piles of work to do  she made a grimace  i know i shall be terrified when i march up to the counter of the bank and say ive come for twenty thousand pounds  you must transfer it to a current account he explained in your own name have you any papers with youfor identification i mean  she nodded  ive thought of all that ive a photograph and a passport and some letters it isnt that im really afraid but i hate being alone and you look so nice philip dear i always loved you in blue serge and i adore your eyeglass you really have been clever in the small things you have done to change your appearance perhaps you are right not to come though she went on looking in the mirror these clothes are the best i could get at a minutes notice mr dane was really quite nice but he hadnt the least idea how long it takes a woman to prepare for a journey never mind you wait until i get back here this afternoon i am going round to all the shops and i am going to bring the clothes i buy away with me then i am going to lock myself in my room and change everything i am going to have some of those funny little patent shoes and silk stockingsand oh well all sorts of things you wouldnt understand about and do try and cheer up before i get back please philip twelve months ago you would have thought all this paradise oh i cant stop a moment longer she wound up throwing away the cigarette she had taken from the box and lit im off now and philip dont you dare to go out of these rooms until i come back  she turned towards the doorshe was halfway there in factwhen they were both aware of a ring at the bell she stopped short and looked around enquiringly  whos that she whispered  philip glanced at the clock it was too early for elizabeth  no idea he answered come in  the door opened and closed philip sat as though turned to stone beatrice remained in the middle of the room her fingers clasping the back of a chair mr dane hat in hand had entered  good morning miss wenderley he said good morning mr ware  philip said nothing he had a horrible feeling that this was some trap beatrice at first could only stare at the unexpected visitor his sudden appearance had disconcerted her  i thought you were in chicago mr dane she exclaimed at last  my plans were altered at the last moment he told her no i wont sit down thanks he added waving away the chair towards which philip had pointed as a matter of fact i havent been out of new york i decided to wait and hear your news miss wenderley  well youre going to be disappointed then she said bluntly i havent any  mr dane was politely incredulous he was also a little stern  you mean he protested that you cannot identify this gentlemanthat you dont recognise him as mr douglas romilly  i cannot identify him she repeated he is not mr douglas romilly  i have brought you all this way then to confront you with a stranger  absolutely she insisted it wasnt my fault i didnt want to come  mr danes expression suddenly changed his hard knuckles were pressed upon the table he leaned forward towards her even his tone was altered his blandness had all vanished his grey eyes were as hard as steel  a stranger he exclaimed derisively yet you come here to his rooms early in the evening you stay here you go to the theatre with him the same night you go on to supper at churchills and stay there till three oclock in the morning you are here with him again at nine oclockat breakfast time a stranger miss wenderley think again a story like this might do for scotland yard it wont do for us out here  she knew at once that she had fallen into a trap but she was not wholly dismayed the position was one which they had half anticipated she told herself that he was bluffing that it was simply the outburst of a disappointed man on the whole she behaved extraordinarily well  you brought me out here she said to confront me with this manto identify him if i could as mr douglas romilly well he isnt mr douglas romilly and thats all there is about it as to my going out with him last evening i cant see that thats any concern of any one he was kind to me cheered me up when he saw that i was disappointed i told him my whole story and that i didnt know a soul in new york and we became friends thats all there is about it  that so the detective observed with quiet sarcasm you seem to have a knack of making friends pretty easily miss wenderley  it is not your business if i have she snapped  well well pass that then he conceded i havent quite finished with you yet though there are just one or two more points i am going to put before youand this gentleman who is not mr douglas romilly he added with a little bow to philip the first is this there is one fact which we can all three take for granted because i know iti can prove it a hundred times overand you both know it and that is that the mr merton ware of today travelled from liverpool on the elletania as mr douglas romilly occupied a room at the waldorf astoria hotel as mr douglas romilly and absconded from there leaving his luggage and his identity behind him to blossom out in an attic of the monmouth tenement house as mr merton ware a young writer of plays now i dont think mr dane went on leaning a little further over the table that the mr douglas romilly who has disappeared was ever capable of writing a play i dont think he was a man of talent at all i dont think he could have written for instance the house of shams let us however leave the subject of douglas romilly for a moment let us go a little further backto detton magna let us say curiously enough there was another young man who disappeared from that little derbyshire village about the same time who has never been heard of since his name too was romilly i gathered during the course of my recent enquiries that he was a poor relation a cousin of mr douglas romilly  he was drowned in the canal beatrice faltered his body has been found  a body has been found mr dane corrected but it was in an unrecognisable state it has been presumed to be the body of philip romilly the poor relation a starving young art teacher in london with literary aspirationsbut i hold that that presumption is a mistake i believe the detective went on his eyes fastened upon philip his voice a little raised that it was the body of douglas romilly the shoe manufacturer which was fished out from the canal and that you sir are mr philip romilly late artschool teacher of kensington who murdered douglas romilly on the banks of the canal stole his money and pocketbook assumed his identity in liverpool and on the elletania and became what you are nowmr merton ware  philip threw away the cigarette which he had been smoking and leaning over the box carefully selected another he tapped it against the table and lit it  mr dane he said coolly i shall always be grateful to you for your visit this morning for you have given me what is the most difficult thing in the whole world to stumble up againstan excellent idea for a new play apart from that you seem for so intelligent a man to have wasted a good deal of your time and to have come what we should call in english a cropper i will take you into my confidence so far as to admit that i am not particularly anxious to disclose my private history but if ever the necessity should arise i shall do so without hesitation until that time comes you must forgive me if i choose to preserve a certain reticence as to my antecedents  mr dane in the moments breathless silence which followed acknowledged to himself the perpetration of a rare mistake he had selected philip to bear the brunt of his attack believing him to be possessed of the weaker nerve beatrice who at the end of his last speech had sunk into a chair white and terrified an easy victim had rallied now inspired by philips composure  you deny then that you are mr philip romilly the detective asked  i never heard of the fellow in my life philip replied pleasantly but dont go mr dane you cant imagine how interesting this is to me you have sent me a most charming acquaintance he added bowing to beatrice and you have provided me with what i can assure you is almost pathetically scarce in these daysa new and very dramatic idea take a seat wont you and chat with us a little longer tell us how you came to think of all this i have always held that the workings of a criminologists brain must be one of the most interesting studies in life  mr dane smiled enigmatically  ah he protested you mustnt ask me to disclose all my secrets  you wouldnt care to tell us a little about your future intentions philip enquired  mr dane shook his head  it is very kind of you mr merton ware he confessed to let me down so gently we all make mistakes of course as to my future intentions well i am not quite sure about them you see this isnt really my job at all it isnt up to me to hunt out english criminals so long as they behave themselves in this city if an extradition order or anything of that sort came my way it would of course be different  why not lay this interesting theory of yours before the authorities at scotland yard philip suggested i am sure they would listen with immense interest to any report from you  thats some idea certainly the detective admitted taking up his hat from the table for the present ill wish you both good morningor shall i say an revoir  we may look for the pleasure of another visit from you then philip enquired politely  the detective faced them from the doorway  sir he said to philip i admire your nerve and i admire the nerve of your old sweetheart miss wenderley i am afraid i cannot promise you however that this will be my last visit  the door closed behind him they heard the shrill summons of the bell the arrival of the lift the clanging of the iron gate and its subsequent descent then beatrice turned her head philip was still smoking serenely standing with his back to the mantelpiece his hands in his pockets she rose and threw her arms around him  philip she cried why you are wonderful you are marvellous you make me ashamed it was only for a moment that i lost my nerve and you saved us oh what idiots we were of course he meant to watchthats why he told me he was going to chicago the beast  he seems to have got hold of the idea all right doesnt he philip muttered  pooh she exclaimed encouragingly i know a little about the lawso do you he hasnt any proofhe never can have any proof no one will ever be able to swear that the body which they picked out of the canal was the body of douglas romilly there wasnt a soul who saw you do it i am the only person in the world who could supply the motive and ii shall never be any use to them dont you see philip i shall be your wife a wife cant give evidence against her husband youll be safe dearquite safe  he withdrew a little from her embrace  beatrice he reminded her there is another tragedy beyond the one with which dane threatens us i do not wish to marry you  she suddenly blazed up  because  not because of any reason in the world he interrupted except that i love elizabeth dalstan  does she want to marry you  he was suddenly an altered person some of his confidence seemed to desert him he shook his head doubtfully  i am not sure sometimes i think that she would sometimes i fancy that it is only a great kindness of heart an immense sympathy a kind of protective sympathy which has made her so good to me  she looked at herself steadily for a moment in the mirror then she pulled down her veil  philip she said we find out the truth when we are up against things like this i used to think i could live alone i cant whatever you may think of me i was fond of douglas it wasnt only for the sake of the money and the comfort he was kind and in his way he understood and then you know misery didnt agree with you you were often even in those few hours we spent together very hard and cold anyway she added with a little tightening of the lips i am going to get my money now no one can stop that you stay here and think it over it would be better to marry me philip and be safe than to have the fear of that man dane always before you and waitwait till you see me when i come back she went on her spirits rapidly rising as she moved towards the door youll change your mind then philip you were always so impressionable werent you a little touch of colour the perfume of flowers a single soft word spoken at the right momentanything that took your fancy made such a difference welljust wait till i come back  she closed the door philip heard her descend in the lift he moved to the window and watched for her on the pavement she appeared there in a moment or two and waited whilst the boy whistled for a taxicab her face expectantly upraised one hand resting lightly on her bosom just over the spot where her pocketbook lay    chapter xvi  philip was still gazing into vacancy and smoking cigarettes when elizabeth arrived she seemed conscious at once of the disturbed atmosphere his hands which she held firmly in hers were as cold as ice  is that girl going to be troublesome she demanded anxiously  not in the way we feared he replied all the same the plot has thickened so far as i am concerned that fellow dane has been here  go on she begged  he laid a trap for us and we fell into it like the veriest simpletons he let beatrice think that he had gone to chicago of course he did nothing of the sort he turned her loose to come to me and he had us watched he knew that we spent last evening together as old friends she was here in my rooms this morning when he arrived  oh philip philip she murmured well what does he suspect  the truth he accused me to my face of being philip romilly beatrice did her best but you see the position was a little absurd she denied strenuously that she had ever seen me before that i was anything but a stranger to her in the face of last evening and his finding her here this morning it didnt sound convincing  what is dane going to do  heaven knows it isnt his affair really if there were any charge against mewell you see thered have to be an extradition order i should think he will probably lay the facts before scotland yard and let them do what they choose  she made him sit down and drew a low chair herself to his side she held his hand in hers  philip she said soothingly they cant possibly prove anything  they can prove he pointed out that i was in detton magna that afternoon i dont think any one except beatrice saw me start along the canal path but they can prove that i knew all about douglas romillys disappearance because i travelled to america under his name and with his ticket and deliberately personated him  they can prove all that she agreed but they cant prove the crime itself beatrice is the only person who could do that  she proposes to marry me he announced grimly that would prevent her giving evidence at all  elizabeth suddenly threw her arms around his neck and held her cheek to his  she shant marry you she declared i want you myself  elizabeth  yes i have made up my mind philip it is no use the other things are fascinating and splendid in their way but they dont count they dont last theyre tinsel dear and i dont want tinseli want the gold well face this bravely wherever it leads however far however deep down and then well start again  you know what this means elizabeth he faltered that man power  she brushed the thought away  i know hell close the theatre hell do all he can to harm us that doesnt matter the play is ours thats worth a fortune and the new one comingwhy its wonderful philip we dont want wealth your brain and my art can win us all that we desire in life we shall have something sweeter than anything which sylvanus powers millions could buy we shall have our loveyour love for me dear and mine for you  he felt her tears upon his cheek her lips pressed to his he held her there but although his heart was beating with renewed hope he said nothing for a time when she stepped back to look at his face however the change was already there  you are glad philip she cried you are happyi can see it you didnt ever care really for that girl did you  he almost laughed  not like this he answered confidently i never even for a single moment pretended to care in a great way we were just companions in misfortune the madness that came over me that day had been growing in my brain for years i hated douglas romilly i had every reason to hate him and then after all he had robbed me ofmy one companion  she stopped him  i knowi know she murmured you need never try to explain anything to me i know everything i understand i sympathise  a revulsion of feeling had suddenly chilled him he held her to him none the less tightly but there was a ring of despair in his tone  elizabeth think what it may mean he muttered how can i drag you through it all a trial perhaps the suspense and all the time that guilty knowledge behindyours and mine  pooh she exclaimed lightly i am not a sentimentalist i am a woman in love  but elizabeth i am guilty he groaned thats the horror of it id take the risk if i were an innocent manid risk everything but i am afraid to stand there and know that every word they say against me will be true and every word of the men who speak in my defence will be false cant you realise the black abominable horror of it i couldnt drag you into such a plight elizabeth i was weak to think of it i couldnt  youll drag me nowhere she answered holding him tightly where i go my feet will lead me and my love for you you cant help that well play the gameplay it magnificently philip my faith in you will count for something  but dear he protested dont you see if the case ever comes into court even if i get off every one will know that it is through a technicality the evidence is too strong half the world at least will believe me guilty  it shant come into court she proclaimed confidently i shall talk to dane i have some influence with the police authorities here i shall point out how ridiculous it all is whats the use of formulating a charge that they can never never prove  unless he reminded her hesitatingly beatrice  beatrice youre not afraid of her  i am afraid of no one or anything he declared when you are here but beatrice has been behaving strangely ever since she arrived she has a sudden fancy for remembering that in a sense we were once engaged  beatrice elizabeth announced must be satisfied with her twenty thousand pounds i know what you are trying to sayshe wants you she shant have you philip well find her some one else well be kind to heri dont mind that very soon well find her plenty of friends but as for you philipwell she just shant have you and thats all there is about it  he took her suddenly into his arms in that moment he was the lover she had craved forstrong passionate and reckless  all the love that my heart has ever known he cried is yours elizabeth every thought and every hope is yours you are my life you saved meyou made me what i am the play is yours my brain is yours there isnt a thought or a dream or a wish that isnt for youof youyours  he kissed her as he had never dreamed of kissing any woman it was the one supreme moment of their life and their love time passed uncounted  then interruption came suddenly and tragically without knock or ring the door was flung open and slammed again beatrice stood there still in her shabby clothes her veil pushed back gloveless and breathless her clenched hand flew out towards philip as though she would have struck him  you liar she shrieked youve had my money youve spent it youve stolen it thief murderer  she paused struggling for breath tore her hat from her head and threw it on the table her face was like the face of a virago her eyes blazed her cheeks were as pale as death save for one hectic spot of colour  you are talking nonsense beatrice he expostulated  dont lie to me she shouted you can lie in the dock when you stand there and tell them you never murdered douglas romilly that makes you cringe doesnt it i dont want to make a scene but the woman youre in love with had better hear what i have to say are you going to give me back my money philip  as i stand here he declared solemnly i have not touched that money or been near the bank where it was deposited i swear it every penny i have spent since i moved into this apartment i have spent from my earnings my own royalties come to over a hundred pounds a weekmore than sufficient to keep me in luxury i never meant to touch that money i have not touched it  his words carried conviction with them she stood there for several seconds absolutely rigid her eyes growing larger and rounder her lips a little parted bewilderment was now struggling with her passion  who in gods name then she asked hoarsely could have known about the money and forged his signature i tell you that ive seen it with my own eyes a few minutes ago in the bank they showed me into a little cupboard a place without any roof and laid it there before me on the deskhis cheque and signature for the whole amount  philip looked at her earnestly oppressed by a sense of coming trouble  beatrice he said i wouldnt deceive you i should be a fool to try shouldnt i i can only repeat what i have said i have never been near the bank i have never touched that money  she shivered a little where she stood it was obvious that she was convinced but her sense of personal injustice remained unabated  then there is some one else she declared who knows everythingsome one else my man she added leaning across the table and shaking her head with a sudden fierceness who can step into the witness box and tell the truth about you you must find out who it is you must find out who has stolen that money and get it back i tell you i wont have everything snatched away from me like this she cried her voice breaking hysterically i wont be robbed of life and happiness and everything that counts i want my money are you going to get it back for me  beatrice dont be absurd he protested you know very well that i cant do that i am not in a position to go about making enquiries i shall be watched from now day and night if nothing worse happens a single step on my part in that direction would mean disaster  then take me straight to the town hall or the registry office or wherever you go here and marry me she demanded a hundred pounds a week royalty eh well thats good enough ill marry you philipdo you hearat once thatll save your skin if it wont get me back my twenty thousand pounds you neednt flatter yourself overmuch either id rather have had douglas hes more of a man than you after all you are too selfconscious you think about yourself too much youre too intellectual too i dont want those things i want to live any way youve got to marry metoday now give me some money do you hear  he took out his pocketbook and threw it towards her she smoothed out the wad of notes which it contained and counted them with glistening eyes  well theres enough here for a start she decided slipping them into her bosom no one shall rob me of these before i get to the shops better come with me philip im not going to leave you alone with her  elizabeth would have intervened but philip laid his hand upon her arm  beatrice he said sternly you are a little beside yourself listen i dont understand what has happened i must think about it apparently that twenty thousand pounds has gone but so far as regards money i recognise your claim you shall have half my earnings ill write more ill make it up somehow but for the rest this morning has cleared away many misunderstandings let this be the last word miss dalstan has promised to be my wife she is the only woman i could ever love  then youll have to marry me without loving me beatrice declared thickly i wont be left alone in this beastly city i want some one to take care of me i am getting frightened its uncannyhorrible ioh i am so miserableso miserable  she sank into a chair and fell forward across the table sobbing hysterically  i hate every one she moaned philip why cant you be kind to me why doesnt some one care    chapter xvii  and after all nothing happened danes barely veiled threats seemed to vanish like the man himself into thin air beatrice after the breakdown of her one passionate outburst had become wonderfully meek and tractable sylvanus power who had received from elizabeth the message for which he had waited showed no sign either of disappointment or anger after the storm which had seemed to be breaking in upon him from every quarter the days which followed possessed for philip almost the calm of an indian summer he had found something in life at last stronger than his turbulent fears his whole nature was engrossed by one great atmosphere of deep and wonderful affection he spent a part of every day with elizabeth and the remainder of his time was completely engrossed by the work over which she too the presiding genius pored eagerly together they humoured many of beatrices whims treating her very much as an unexpected protegée a position with which she seemed entirely content she made friends with the utmost facility she wore new clothes with frank and obvious joy she preened herself before the lookingglass of life developed a capacity for living and enjoying herself which under the circumstances was nothing less than remarkable  and then came the climax of philips newfound happiness his earnest protests had long since been overruled and certainly no one could have accused him of posing for a single moment as the reluctant bridegroom the happiness which shone from their two faces seemed to brighten the strangely unecclesiastical looking apartment in which a cheerful and exceedingly pleasant looking american divine completed the formalities of their marriage it was a queer little company who hurried back to elizabeths room for teaelizabeth and philip themselves and martha grimes and beatrice sharing the attentions of noel bridges for an event of such stupendous importance it was amazing how perfectly matteroffact the two persons chiefly concerned were there was only one moment just before they started for the theatre when elizabeth betrayed the slightest signs of uneasiness  i sent a telegram philip she said to sylvanus power i thought i had better this is his answer  philip read the few typewritten words on the little slip of paper  you will hear from me within twentyfour hours  philip frowned a little as he handed it back it was dated from washington  i think elizabeth faltered he might have sent his good wishes at any rate  philip laughed confidently  we have nothing to fear he declared confidently from sylvanus power  nor from any one else in the world elizabeth murmured fervently  then followed the wonderful evening philip found beatrice alone in the stage box when he returned from taking elizabeth to her dressingroom  wheres martha he asked  faithless beatrice replied she is in the stalls down there with a young man from the box office she said youd understand  a serious affair philip ventured  beatrice nodded  they are engaged i had tea with them yesterday  we shall have to do something for you beatrice soon he remarked cheerfully  a very rare gravity settled for a moment upon her face  i wonder philip she said simply i thought a little time ago it would be easy enough to care for the right sort of person perhaps i am not really quite so rotten as i thought i was here comes elizabeth lets watch her  they both leaned a little forward in the box philip in a state of beatific wonder which turned soon to amazement when at elizabeths first appearance the house suddenly rose and a torrent of applause broke out from the floor to the ceiling elizabeth for a moment seemed dumbfounded the fact that the news of what had happened that afternoon could so soon have become public property had not occurred to either her or philip then a sudden smile of comprehension broke across her face with understanding however came a momentary embarrassment she looked a little pathetically at the great audience then laughed and glanced at philip seated now well back in the box many of them followed her gaze and the applause broke out again then there was silence she paused before she spoke the first words of her part  thank you so much she said quietly  it was a queer little episode beatrice gripped philips hand as she drew her chair back to his there were tears in her eyes  how they love her these people and fancy their knowing about it philip already you ought to have shown yourself as the happy bridegroom they were all looking up here i wonder why men are so shy im glad i have my new frock on fancy being married only a few hours ago tell me how you are feeling cant you philip you sit there looking like a sphinx you are happy arent you  happier i think than any man has a right to be he answered his eyes watching elizabeths every movement  as the play proceeded his silence only deepened he went behind at the end of each act and spent a few stolen moments with elizabeth life was a marvellous thing indeed every pulse and nerve in his body was tingling with happiness and yet as he lingered for a moment in the vestibule of the theatre before going back to his box at the commencement of the last act he felt once more that terrible wave of depression the ghostly uprising of his old terrors even in this supreme moment he looked down from the panorama of flaring skysigns into the faces of the passersby along the crowded pavement he had a sudden fancy that dane was there watching his heart beat fiercely as he stood almost transfixed scanning eagerly every strange face then the bell rang behind him he set his teeth and turned away in less than half an hour the play would be over they would be on their way home  he found the box door open and the box itself to his surprise empty there was no sign anywhere of beatrice he waited for a little time then he rang the bell for the attendant but could hear no news of her his uneasiness increased as the curtain at last fell and she had not returned he hurried round to the back but elizabeth when he told her only smiled  why theres nothing to worry about dear she said beatrice can take care of herself perhaps she thought it more tactful to hurry on home tonight she is really just as kindhearted as she can be you know philip underneath all that pentup passionate desire for just a small share of the good things of life she has wasted so much of herself in longings poor child i sometimes wonder that she is as levelheaded as she seems to be now i am ready  they passed down the corridor amidst a little chorus of good nights and stepped into the automobile which was waiting as it glided off she suddenly came closer to him  philip she whispered its true isnt it put your arms around me you are driving me homesay its true  elizabeth sat up presently a little dazed her fingers were still gripping philips almost fiercely the automobile had stopped  i havent the least idea where we are she murmured  and i forgot to tell you he laughed as he helped her out i took the suite below mine by the week there are two or three rooms and an extra one for beatrice of course its small but then with this london idea before us  such extravagance she interrupted your own rooms would have done quite nicely only it is a luxury to have a place for phoebe i hope beatrice wont have gone to bed  i am sure she wont he replied she has done all the arranging for meshe and phoebe together  they crossed the pavement and entered the lift the attendant grinned broadly as he stopped at the eighth floor and held out his hand for the tip for which philip had been fumbling the door of the suite was opened before they could reach the bell elizabeths maid phoebe came forward to take her mistress cloak and the floor valet was there to relieve philip of his overcoat a waiter was hovering in the background  supper is served in the dining room sir he announced shall i open the wine  philip nodded and showed elizabeth over the little flat finally ushering her into the small round dining room  its perfectly delightful she declared but we dont need nearly so much room philip what a dear little dining table and what a delicious supper everything i like best in the world from pâté de foie gras to cold asparagus you are a dear  the waiter disappeared with a little bow they were alone at last she held his hands tightly she was trembling the forced composure of the last few minutes seemed to have left her  i am silly she faltered but the servants and everythingthey wont come back will they  he laughed as he patted her hand  we shant see another soul dear he assured her  she laid her cheek against his  how hot your face feels she exclaimed throw open the window do i shant feel it  he obeyed her at once the roar of the city all its harshness muffled came to them in a sombre almost melodious undernote she rested her hands upon his shoulder  what children we are she murmured now its you who are trembling sit down please youve been so brave these last few days  it was just for a moment he told her it seems too wonderful i had a sudden impulse of terror lest it should all be snatched away  she laughed easily  i dont think theres any fear of that dear she said perhaps  there was a little knock at the door philip who had been holding elizabeths chair stood as though transfixed elizabeth gripped at the side of the table it was some few seconds before either of them spoke  its perhapsbeatrice elizabeth faltered  the knock was repeated philip drew a little breath  come in he invited  the door opened slowly towards them and closed again it was mr dane who had entered from outside they caught a momentary glimpse of another man waiting mr dane took off his hat for a man with so expressionless a countenance he was looking considerably perturbed  miss dalstan he said i am very sorry believe me to intrude i only heard of your marriage an hour ago i wish i could have prevented it  prevented it elizabeth repeated what do you mean  i think that mr philip romilly could explain dane continued turning towards philip i am sorry but i have received an imperative cable from scotland yard and it is my duty to arrest you philip romilly and to hold you pending the arrival of a special police mission from england i am bound to take note of anything you may say so i beg of you not to ask me any particulars as to the charge  the colour slowly faded from elizabeths cheeks she had risen to her feet and was gripping the mantelpiece for support philip however was perfectly calm he poured out a glass of water and held it to her lips  drink this dear he begged and dont be alarmed it sounds very terrible but believe me there is nothing to be feared  he swung suddenly round to dane his voice shook with passion  youve kept me under observation he cried all this time i havent attempted to escape i havent moved from new york i havent the slightest intention of doing so until this thing is cleared up cant you take my parole cant you leave me alone until they come from england  mr dane shook his head slowly he was a hard man but there was an unaccustomed look of distress in his face  sorry mr romilly he said regretfully i did suggest something of the sort but they wouldnt hear of it at headquarters if we let you slip through our fingers we should never hear the last of it from london  then there came another and a still more unexpected interruption from outside they heard beatrices voice raised in excitement mr dane stood on one side as the door was thrown open beatrice suddenly flung herself into the room dragging after her a man who was almost breathless  i say beatrice steady the latter began goodnaturedly  there followed the most wonderful silence in the world a silence which was filled with throbbing indescribable emotions a silence which meant something different for every one of them beatrice gripping her captive by the wrist was looking around striving to understand elizabeth was filled with blank wonder mr dane was puzzled but philip who a moment before had seemed perfectly composed was the one who seemed torn by indescribable by horrible emotions he was livid almost to the lips his hands were stretched out as though to keep from him some awful and ghastly vision his eyes filled with the anguished light of supreme terror were fastened upon the newcomer his lips shook as he tried to speak  take him away he shrieked oh my god  beatrice more coherent than any of them scoffed at him  dont be a fool she cried take him away indeed hes the most wonderful thing that ever happened hes the one man in life you want to see so youve come for him eh she went on turning almost like a wildcat on dane you beast you chose tonight did you now get on with it then and ill give you the surprise of your life what are you here for  i am here to arrest that man philip romilly for the murder of his cousin douglas romilly miss wenderley dane announced gravely i am sorry  beatrice threw her head back and laughed hysterically  youll never write a play like it philip she exclaimed there never was anything like it before now mr dane what is it you say in america when you want to introduce anybodyshake hands with mr douglas romillythats it shake hands with the dead man here and then get on with your arresting he must be dead if you say so but he doesnt look it does he  philips face had become a more natural colour his eyes had never left the other mans he swayed a little on his feet and his voice seemed to him to come from a long way off  douglas it isnt you douglas  it isnt you really  i wish youd all leave off staring at me as though i were a ghost the other man answered almost pettishly im douglas romilly right enough you neednt look in such a blue funk philip he went on his fingers mechanically rearranging his collar and tie which beatrice had disarranged i served you a beastly trick and you went for me i should have done the same if id been in your place on the other hand i rather turned the tables on you by keeping quiet perhaps its up to me to explain  elizabeth feeling her way by the mantelpiece came to philips side his arm supported her holding her as though in a vise  is that your cousin she whispered hoarsely is that douglas romilly is he alive after all  philip had no words but his face spoke for him then they both turned to listen the newcomer had dragged a chair towards him and was leaning over the back of it he addressed philip  we met as you know on the canal path that beastly afternoon he began i was jolly well ashamed of myself for having made love to beatrice and all the rest of it and you were mad with rage we had a sort of tussle and you threw me into the canal it was a nasty dark spot just underneath the bridge i expect i was stunned for a moment but it was only for a moment i came to long before i choked and when i remembered your grip upon my throat i decided i was safer where i was i could swim like a duck you know and though it was filthy water i took a long dive when i came up againgad what disgusting water it wasyou were tearing off like a creature possessed thats the true history of our little fracas  but afterwards philip asked wonderingly what happened afterwards  you just tell them all about it beatrice ordered him sternly go on douglas  well you see douglas romilly continued i was just going to scramble out on to the bank when my brain began to work and i swam slowly along instead you see just then i was in a devil of a mess id spent a lot of money and though id kept the credit of the firm good i knew that the business was bust and the one thing i was anxious about was to get off to america without being stopped ive explained this all to beatrice and why i didnt send for her before anyway i swam along until i met with an old barge i climbed in and got two of the choicest blackguards you ever saw to let me spend an hour or two in their filthy cabin and to keep their mouths closed about it fortunately i had another pocketbook with sufficient to satisfy them and keep me going then i borrowed some clothes and came out to america steerage i had no difficulty in getting my money as i had a couple of pals in lynn whom i had fixed things up with before i started they came and identified me as merton ware and we all three started in business together as the ford boot and shoe manufacturing company at lynn in massachusetts incidentally weve done all right heaps more of course but thats the pith of it as for the body that was fished out of the canal if you make enquiries youll find there was a tramp missing a month or so before  elizabeth had begun to sob quietly philip who was holding her tenderly in his arms whispered unheard things into her ears it was beatrice who remained in charge of the situation  so now mr dane she jeered what about your little errand i hope this will be a lesson to you not to come meddling in other peoples affairs  dane turned to the man who had brought this bombshell into their midst  do you swear that you are douglas romilly he asked  i not only swear it but i can prove it if youll come along with me to murrays he answered my partners there waiting supper and another man who has known me all his life  the detective glanced interrogatively towards philip  that is my cousin douglas romilly the latter pronounced  dane took up his hat  mr merton ware he said or mr philip romilly whichever you may in future elect to call yourself you may not believe it but the end of this affairs is an immense relief to me i offer you my heartiest congratulations you need fear no more annoyance good night  he passed out they heard the sound of his footsteps and his companions as they crossed the corridor and rang for the lift speech was a little difficult it was still beatrice who imposed conviction upon them  i was seated in the box she explained when philip went round to see you elizabeth i had looking down into the stalls to find martha and all of a sudden i saw douglas there he too was staring at me of course i thought it was some extraordinary likeness but whilst i was clutching at the curtain he stood up and waved his hand you should have seen me tear from the box you know ever since they showed me that signature at the bank i have had a queer idea at the back of my head luckily for him she went patting his arm he sent home for me a fortnight ago and sent a draft for my expenses out you wont mind will you if i take him off now she concluded turning to elizabeth they are waiting supper for us but i wasnt going to let philip  did you know that dane was going to be here elizabeth asked  not an idea beatrice declared i simply dragged douglas along here as soon as wed talked things out because i knew that it would be the one thing wanting to complete philips happiness well leave you now douglas will bring me back and we are going to be married in a few days  philip held out his hand a little diffidently  you wouldnt  my dear fellow douglas interrupted grasping it wouldnt i im thundering sorry for all youve been through i suppose i ought to have let you know that i was still in the land of the living but i was waiting until things blew over in england thats all right now though he went on ive turned over a new leaf and i am making moneymaking it after a style they dont understand in england i am going to pay my creditors twenty shillings in the pound before a couple of years have gone and do pretty well for beatrice and myself as well you wouldnt care i suppose he added as they stood there with locked hands to offer us just a glass of wine before we start out beatrice has been riddling me with questions and dragging me through the streets till i scarcely know whether i am on my head or my heels  philip emptied the contents of the champagne bottle into the glasses never was wine poured out more gladly  douglas he explained this is miss elizabeth dalstan whom you saw act this evening we were married this afternoon you can understand cant you just what your coming has meant for us  douglas shook elizabeth by the hand then he held up his glass  heres the best of luck to you both he said heartily very soon beatrice and i will ask you to wish us the same philip old chap he added as he set his glass down and without the slightest protest watched it replenished thats a thundering good play of yours ive seen this evening but youll never write one to beat this  soon beatrice and douglas also took their departure elizabeth held out her arms almost as the door closed the tearstains were still on her cheeks her lips quivered a little but her voice was clear and sweet and passionate  philip she cried its all overits all finished withthe dread the awful days i am not going to be hysterical any more and youyou are just going to remember that we have everything we want in the world sit down opposite to me if you please and fill my glass i have only one emotion left i am hungrydesperately hungry move your chair nearer so that i can reach your hand there now you and i will drink our little toast  it was an hour before they thought of leaving the table a very perplexed waiter brought them coffee and watched them light cigarettes then the telephone bell rang they both stared at the instrument philip would have taken off the receiver but elizabeth held out her hand  i have an idea she said i believe it is from sylvanus power let me answer it  she held the receiver to her ear and listened  yes she murmured yes at what time  her face grew more puzzled she listened for a moment longer  but sylvanus she expostulated what do you mean sylvanus mr power  the telephone had become a dumb thing she replaced the receiver  i dont understand she told philip all that he said wasyou will receive my present at five oclock this morning  does he think we are going to sit up for it philip asked  he is the strangest man she sighed                                       after all some queer fancy awoke philip at a little before five that morning and drew him to the window he sat looking out over the still sleeping city all sound now was hushed it was the brief breathing space before the dawn in the clear morning spring light the buildings of the city seemed to stand out with a new and marvellous distinctness now and then from the harbour came the shriek of a siren a few pale lights were still burning along the river way from one of the city clocks the hour was slowly tolled philip counted the strokesone two three four five then almost as he was preparing to leave his post there came a terrific roar the window against which he leaned shook some of the buildings in the distance trembled one with its familiar white cupola seemed for a moment to be lifted from the ground and then split through by some unseen hand the roar of the explosion was followed by the crashing of falling masonry long fingers of fire suddenly leapt up into the quiet cool air fragments of masonry a portion even of that wonderful cupola came crashing down into the street he heard elizabeths voice behind him felt her fingers upon his shoulder  what is it philip what is it  he pointed with steady finger the truth seemed to come to him by inspiration  it is sylvanus powers message to you he replied the theatre  there were flames now leaping up to the sky together they watched them and listened to the shrieking of sirens and whistles as the fire engines galloped by from every section of the city there was a strange look in elizabeths face as she watched the curling flames  philip she whispered thank god there it goes all his great offering to me its like the man and his mottoa man may do what he will with his own only last night i felt as though i would give anything in the world never to stand upon the stage of that theatre again he doesnt know it philip but his is a precious gift  he passed his arm around her and drew her from the window  a man may do what he will with his own he repeated well it isnt such a bad motto sylvanus power may destroy a milliondollar theatre for a whim but so far as you and i are concerned  she sighed with content  we do both need a holiday she murmured somewhere in europe i think   the end
