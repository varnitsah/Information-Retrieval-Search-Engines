68133593	the armourers prentices     preface    i have attempted here to sketch citizen life in the early tudor days aided therein by stowes survey of london supplemented by mr lofties excellent history and dr burtons english merchants  stowe gives a full account of the relations of apprentices to their masters though i confess that i do not know whether edmund burgess could have become a citizen of york after serving an apprenticeship in london  evil may day is closely described in halls chronicle the ballad said to be by churchill a contemporary does not agree with it in all respects but the storyteller may surely have license to follow whatever is most suitable to the purpose  the sermon is exactly as given by hall who is also responsible for the description of the kings sports and of the field of the cloth of gold and of ardres  knights admirable pictorial history of england tells of barlow the archer dubbed by henry viii the king of shoreditch  historic winchester describes both st elizabeth college and the archer monks of hyde abbey  the tales mentioned as told by ambrose to dennet are really new forest legends  the morescos arabic gospel and breviary are mentioned in lady calcotts history of spain but she does not give her authority nor can i go further than knights pictorial history for the kings adventure in the marsh  he does not say where it happened but as in stowes map dead mans hole appears in what is now regents park the marsh was probably deep enough in places for the adventure there  brands popular antiquities are the authority for the nutting in st johns wood on holy cross day  indeed in some country parishes i have heard that boys still think they have a license to crack nuts at church on the ensuing sunday  seebohms oxford reformers and the life of sir thomas more written by william roper are my other authorities though i touched somewhat unwillingly on ground already lighted up by miss manning in her household of sir thomas more  galts life of cardinal wolsey afforded the description of his household taken from his faithful cavendish and likewise the story of patch the fool  in fact a large portion of the whole book was built on that anecdote  i mention all this because i have so often been asked my authorities in historical tales that i think people prefer to have what the french appropriately call pieces justificatives  c m yonge  august 1st 1884    chapter i  the verdurers lodge    give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament with that i will go buy me fortunes get you with him you old dog  as you like it   the officials of the new forest have ever since the days of the conqueror enjoyed some of the pleasantest dwellings that southern england can boast  the home of the birkenholt family was not one of the least delightful  it stood at the foot of a rising ground on which grew a grove of magnificent beeches their large silvery boles rising majestically like columns into a lofty vaulting of branches covered above with tender green foliage  here and there the shade beneath was broken by the gilding of a ray of sunshine on a lower twig or on a white trunk but the floor of the vast arcades was almost entirely of the russet brown of the fallen leaves save where a fern or holly bush made a spot of green  at the foot of the slope lay a stretch of pasture ground some parts covered by ladysmocks all silver white with the course of the little stream through the midst indicated by a perfect golden river of shining kingcups interspersed with ferns  beyond lay tracts of brown heath and brilliant gorse and broom which stretched for miles and miles along the flats while the dry ground was covered with holly brake and here and there woods of oak and beech made a sea of verdure purpling in the distance  cultivation was not attempted but hardy little ponies cows goats sheep and pigs were feeding and picking their way about in the marshy mead below and a small garden of potherbs inclosed by a strong fence of timber lay on the sunny side of a spacious rambling forest lodge only one story high built of solid timber and roofed with shingle  it was not without strong pretensions to beauty as well as to picturesqueness for the posts of the door the architecture of the deep porch the frames of the latticed windows and the verge boards were all richly carved in grotesque devices over the door was the royal shield between a pair of magnificent antlers the spoils of a deer reported to have been slain by king edward iv as was denoted by the glorious sun of york carved beneath the shield  in the background among the trees were ranges of stables and kennels and on the grassplat in front of the windows was a row of beehives  a tame doe lay on the little green sward not far from a large rough deerhound both close friends who could be trusted at large  there was a mournful dispirited look about the hound evidently an aged animal for the once black muzzle was touched with grey and there was a film over one of the keen beautiful eyes which opened eagerly as he pricked his ears and lifted his head at the rattle of the door latch  then as two boys came out he rose and with a slowly waving tail and a wistful appealing air came and laid his head against one of the pair who had appeared in the porch they were lads of fourteen and fifteen clad in suits of new mourning with the short belted doublet puffed hose small ruffs and little round caps of early tudor times  they had dark eyes and hair and honest open faces the younger ruddy and sunburnt the elder thinner and more intellectualand they were so much the same size that the advantage of age was always supposed to be on the side of stephen though he was really the junior by nearly a year  both were sad and grave and the eyes and cheeks of stephen showed traces of recent floods of tears though there was more settled dejection on the countenance of his brother  ay spring said the lad tis winter with thee now  a poor old rogue  did the new housewife talk of a halter because he showed his teeth when her illnurtured brat wanted to ride on him  nay old spring thou shalt share thy masters fortunes changed though they be  oh father father didst thou guess how it would be with thy boys  and throwing himself on the grass he hid his face against the dog and sobbed  come stephen stephen tis time to play the man  what are we to do out in the world if you weep and wail  she might have let us stay for the months mind was heard from stephen  ay and though we might be more glad to go we might carry bitterer thoughts along with us  better be done with it at once say i  there would still be the forest  and i saw the moorhen sitting yester eve  and the wild ducklings are out on the pool and the woods are full of song  oh  ambrose  i never knew how hard it is to part  nay now steve where be all your plots for bravery  you always meant to seek your fortunenot bide here like an acorn for ever  i never thought to be thrust forth the very day of our poor fathers burial by a shrewish townbred vixen and a base narrow souled  hist hist said the more prudent ambrose  let him hear who will  he cannot do worse for us than he has done all the forest will cry shame on him for a meanhearted skinflint to turn his brothers from their home ere their father and his be cold in his grave cried stephen clenching the grass with his hands in his passionate sense of wrong  thats womanish said ambrose  wholl be the woman when the time comes for drawing cold steel cried stephen sitting up  at that moment there came through the porch a man a few years over thirty likewise in mourning with a paler sharper countenance than the brothers and an uncomfortable pleading expression of self justification  how now lads he said what means this passion  you have taken the matter too hastily  there was no thought that ye should part till you had some purpose in view  nay we should be fain for ambrose to bide on here so he would leave his portion for me to deal with and teach little will his primer and accidence  you are a quiet lad ambrose and can rule your tongue better than stephen  thanks brother john said ambrose somewhat sarcastically but where stephen goes i go  i wouldi would have found stephen a place among the prickers or rangers if hesitated john  in sooth i would yet do it if he would make it up with the housewife  my father looked higher for his son than a prickers office returned ambrose  that do i wot said john and therefore tis for his own good that i would send him forth  his godfather our uncle birkenholt he will assuredly provide for him and set him forth  the door of the house was opened and a shrewish voice cried mr birkenholthere husband  you are wanted  heres little kate crying to have yonder smooth pouch to stroke and i cannot reach it for her  father set store by that otterskin pouch for poor prince arthur slew the otter cried stephen  surely john youll not let the babes make a toy of that  john made a helpless gesture and at a renewed call went indoors  you are right ambrose said stephen this is no place for us why should we tarry any longer to see everything moiled and set at nought  i have couched in the forest before and tis summer time  nay said ambrose we must make up our fardels and have our money in our pouches before we can depart  we must tarry the night and call john to his reckoning and so might we set forth early enough in the morning to lie at winchester that night and take counsel with our uncle birkenholt  i would not stop short at winchester said stephen  london for me where uncle randall will find us preferment  and what wilt do for spring  take him with me of course exclaimed stephen  what would i leave him to be kicked and pinched by will and hanged belike by mistress maud  i doubt me whether the poor old hound will brook the journey  then ill carry him  ambrose looked at the big dog as if he thought it would be a serious undertaking but he had known and loved spring as his brothers property ever since his memory began and he scarcely felt that they could be separable for weal or woe  the verdurers of the new forest were of gentle blood and their office was wellnigh hereditary  the birkenholts had held it for many generations and the reversion passed as a matter of course to the eldest son of the late holder who had newly been laid in the burial ground of beaulieu abbey  john birkenholt whose mother had been of knightly lineage had resented his fathers second marriage with the daughter of a yeoman on the verge of the forest suspected of a strain of gipsy blood and had lived little at home becoming a sort of agent at southampton for business connected with the timber which was yearly cut in the forest to supply material for the shipping  he had wedded the daughter of a person engaged in law business at southampton and had only been an occasional visitor at home ever after the death of his stepmother  she had left these two boys unwelcome appendages in his sight  they had obtained a certain amount of education at beaulieu abbey where a school was kept and where ambrose daily studied though for the last few months stephen had assisted his father in his forest duties  death had come suddenly to break up the household in the early spring of 1515 and john birkenholt had returned as if to a patrimony bringing his wife and children with him  the funeral ceremonies had been conducted at beaulieu abbey on the extensive scale of the sixteenth century the requiem the feast and the dole all taking place there leaving the forest lodge in its ordinary quiet  it had always been understood that on their fathers death the two younger sons must make their own way in the world but he had hoped to live until they were a little older when he might himself have started them in life or expressed his wishes respecting them to their elder brother  as it was however there was no commendation of them nothing but a strip of parchment drawn up by one of the monks of beaulieu leaving each of them twenty crowns with a few small jewels and properties left by their own mother while everything else went to their brother  there might have been some jealousy excited by the estimation in which stephens efficiencyboy as he waswas evidently held by the plainspoken underlings of the verdurer and this added to mistress birkenholts dislike to the presence of her husbands halfbrothers whom she regarded as interlopers without a right to exist  matters were brought to a climax by old springs resentment at being roughly teased by her spoilt children  he had done nothing worse than growl and show his teeth but the townbred dame had taken alarm and half in terror half in spite had insisted on his instant execution since he was too old to be valuable  stephen who loved the dog only less than he loved his brother ambrose had come to high words with her and the end of the altercation had been that she had declared that she would suffer no great lubbers of the halfblood to devour her childrens inheritance and teach them ill manners and that go they must and that instantly  john had muttered a little about not so fast dame and for very shame but she had turned on him and rated him with a violence that demonstrated who was ruler in the house and took away all disposition to tarry long under the new dynasty  the boys possessed two uncles one on each side of the house  their fathers elder brother had been a manatarms having preferred a stirring life to the forest and had fought in the last surges of the wars of the roses  having become disabled and infirm he had taken advantage of a corrody or right of maintenance as being of kin to a benefactor of hyde abbey at winchester to which birkenholt some generations back had presented a few roods of land in right of which one descendant at a time might be maintained in the abbey intelligence of his brothers death had been sent to richard birkenholt but answer had been returned that he was too evil disposed with the gout to attend the burial  the other uncle harry randall had disappeared from the country under a cloud connected with the kings deer leaving behind him the reputation of a careless thriftless jovial fellow the best company in all the forest and capable of doing every ones work save his own  the two brothers who were about seven and six years old at the time of his flight had a lively recollection of his charms as a playmate and of their mothers grief for him and refusal to believe any ill of her hal  rumours had come of his attainment to vague and unknown greatness at court under the patronage of the lord archbishop of york which the verdurer laughed to scorn though his wife gave credit to them  gifts had come from time to time passed through a succession of servants and officials of the king such as a coral and silver rosary a jewelled bodkin an agate carved with st catherine an ivory pouncet box with a pierced gold coin as the lid but no letter with them as indeed hal randall had never been induced to learn to read or write  master birkenholt looked doubtfully at the tokens and hoped hal had come honestly by them but his wife had thoroughly imbued her sons with the belief that uncle hal was shining in his proper sphere where he was better appreciated than at home  thus their one plan was to go to london to find uncle hal who was sure to put stephen on the road to fortune and enable ambrose to become a great scholar his favourite ambition  his gifts would as ambrose observed serve them as tokens and with the purpose of claiming them they reentered the hall a long low room with a handsome open roof and walls tapestried with dressed skins interspersed with antlers hung with weapons of the chase at one end of the hall was a small polished barrel always replenished with beer at the other a hearth with a wood fire constantly burning and there was a table running the whole length of the room at one end of this was laid a cloth with a few trenchers on it and horn cups surrounding a barley loaf and a cheese this meagre irregular supper being considered as a sufficient supplement to the funeral baked meats which had abounded at beaulieu  john birkenholt sat at the table with a trencher and horn before him uneasily using his knife to crumble rather than cut his bread  his wife a thin pale shrewishlooking woman was warming her childs feet at the fire before putting him to bed and an old woman sat spinning and nodding on a settle at a little distance  brother said stephen we have thought on what you said  we will put our stuff together and if you will count us out our portions we will be afoot by sunrise tomorrow  nay nay lad i said not there was such haste did i mistress housewifeshe snorted only that thou art a wellgrown lusty fellow and tis time thou wentest forth  for thee ambrose thou wottest i made thee a fair offer of bed and board  that is called out the wife if thou wilt make a fair scholar of little will  tis a mighty good offer  there are not many who would let their child be taught by a mere stripling like thee  nay said ambrose who could not bring himself to thank her i go with stephen mistress i would mend my scholarship ere i teach  as you please said mistress maud shrugging her shoulders only never say that a fair offer was not made to you  and said stephen so please you brother john hand us over our portions and the jewels as bequeathed to us and we will be gone  portions quotha returned john  boy they be not due to you till you be come to years of discretion  the brothers looked at one another and stephen said nay now brother i know not how that may be but i do know that you cannot drive us from our fathers house without maintenance and detain what belongs to us  and ambrose muttered something about my lord of beaulieu  look you now said john did i ever speak of driving you from home without maintenance  hath not ambrose had his choice of staying here and stephen of waiting till some office be found for him  as for putting forty crowns into the hands of striplings like you it were mere throwing it to the robbers  that being so said ambrose turning to stephen we will to beaulieu and see what counsel my lord will give us  yea do like the vipers ye are and embroil us with my lord of beaulieu cried maud from the fire  see said john in his more caressing fashion it is not well to carry family tales to strangers andand  he was disconcerted by a laugh from the old nurse ho  john birkenholt thou wast ever a lad of smooth tongue but an thou or madam here think that thy brothers can be put forth from thy fathers door without their due before the good man be cold in his grave and the forest not ring with it thou art mightily out in thy reckoning  peace thou old hag what matter ist of thine began mistress maud but again came the harsh laugh  matter of mine  why whose matter should it be but mine that have nursed all three of the lads ay and their father before them besides four more that lie in the graveyard at beaulieu  rest their sweet souls  and i tell thee master john an thou do not righteously by these thy brothers thou mayst back to thy parchments at southampton for not a man or beast in the forest will give thee good day  they all felt the old womans authority  she was able and spirited in her homely way and more mistress of the house than mrs birkenholt herself and such were the terms of domestic service that there was no peril of losing her place  even maud knew that to turn her out was an impossibility and that she must be accepted like the loneliness damp and other evils of forest life  john had been under her dominion and proceeded to persuade her  good now nurse joan what have i denied these rash striplings that my father would have granted them  wouldst thou have them carry all their portion in their hands to be cozened of it at the first alehouse or robbed on the next heath  i would have thee do a brothers honest part john birkenholt  a loving part i say not  thou wert always like a very popple for hardness and smoothness ay and slipperiness  heigh ho  but what is right by the lads thou shalt do  john cowered under her eye as he had done at six years old and faltered i only seek to do them right nurse  nurse joan uttered an emphatic grunt but mistress maud broke in they are not to hang about here in idleness eating my poor childs substance and teaching him ill manners  we would not stay here if you paid us for it returned stephen  and whither would you go asked john  to winchester first to seek counsel with our uncle birkenholt then to london where uncle randall will help us to our fortunes  gipsy hal  he is more like to help you to a halter sneered john sotto voce and joan herself observed their uncle at winchester will show them better than to run after that there gobychance  however as no one wished to keep the youths and they were equally determined to go an accommodation was come to at last  john was induced to give them three crowns apiece and to yield them up the five small trinkets specified though not without some murmurs from his wife  it was no doubt safer to leave the rest of the money in his hands than to carry it with them and he undertook that it should be forthcoming if needed for any fit purpose such as the purchase of an office an apprentices fee or an outfit as a squire  it was a vague promise that cost him nothing just then and thus could be readily made and johns great desire was to get them away so that he could aver that they had gone by their own free will without any hardship for he had seen enough at his fathers obsequies to show him that the love and sympathy of all the scanty dwellers in the forest was with them  nurse joan had fought their battles but with the sore heart of one who was parting with her darlings never to see them again  she bade them doff their suits of mourning that she might make up their fardels as they would travel in their lincolngreen suits  to take these she repaired to the little rough shedlike chamber where the two brothers lay for the last time on their pallet bed awake and watching for her with spring at their feet  the poor old woman stood over them as over the motherless nurslings whom she had tended and she should probably never see more but she was a woman of shrewd sense and perceived that with the new madam in the hall it was better that they should be gone before worse ensued  she advised leaving their valuables sealed up in the hands of my lord abbot but they were averse to thisfor they said their uncle randall who had not seen them since they were little children would not know them without some pledge  she shook her head  the less you deal with hal randall the better she said  come now lads be advised and go no farther than winchester where master ambrose may get all the booklearning he is ever craving for and you master steevie may prentice yourself to some good trade  prentice cried stephen scornfully  ay ay  as good blood as thine has been prenticed returned joan better so than be a cutthroat swordandbuckler fellow ever slaying some one else or getting thyself slaina terror to all peaceful folk  but thine uncle will see to thata steadyminded lad always was hewas master dick  consoling herself with this hope the old woman rolled up their new suits with some linen into two neat knapsacks sighing over the thought that unaccustomed fingers would deal with the shirts she had spun bleached and sewn  but she had confidence in master dick and concluded that to send his nephews to him at winchester gave a far better chance of their being cared for than letting them be flouted into illdoing by their grudging brother and his wife    chapter ii  the grange of silkstede          all itchens valley lay st catherines breezy side and the woodlands far away the huge cathedral sleeping in venerable gloom the modest college tower and the bedesmens norman home  lord selborne   very early in the morning even according to the habits of the time were stephen and ambrose birkenholt astir  they were full of ardour to enter on the new and unknown world beyond the forest and much as they loved it any change that kept them still to their altered life would have been distasteful  nurse joan asking no questions folded up their fardels on their backs and packed the wallets for their days journey with ample provision  she charged them to be good lads to say their pater credo and ave daily and never omit mass on a sunday  they kissed her like their mother and promised heartilyand stephen took his crossbow  they had had some hope of setting forth so early as to avoid all other human farewells except that ambrose wished to begin by going to beaulieu to take leave of the father who had been his kind master and get his blessing and counsel  but beaulieu was three miles out of their way and stephen had not the same desire being less attached to his schoolmaster and more afraid of hindrances being thrown in their way  moreover contrary to their expectation their elder brother came forth and declared his intention of setting them forth on their way bestowing a great amount of good advice to the same purport as that of nurse joan namely that they should let their uncle richard birkenholt find them some employment at winchester where they or at least ambrose might even obtain admission into the famous college of st mary  in fact this excellent elder brother persuaded himself that it would be doing them an absolute wrong to keep such promising youths hidden in the forest  the purpose of his going thus far with them made itself evident  it was to see them past the turning to beaulieu  no doubt he wished to tell the story in his own way and that they should not present themselves there as orphans expelled from their fathers house  it would sound much better that he had sent them to ask counsel of their uncle at winchester the fit person to take charge of them and as he represented that to go to beaulieu would lengthen their days journey so much that they might hardly reach winchester that night while all stephens wishes were to go forward ambrose could only send his greetings  there was another debate over spring who had followed his master as usual  john uttered an exclamation of vexation at perceiving it and bade stephen drive the dog back  or give me the leash to drag him  he will never follow me  he goes with us said stephen  he  thoult never have the folly  the old hound is half blind and past use  no man will take thee in with him after thee  then they shall not take me in said stephen  ill not leave him to be hanged by thee  who spoke of hanging him  thy wife will soon if she hath not already  thou wilt be for hanging him thyself ere thou have made a days journey with him on the kings highway which is not like these forest paths i would have thee to know  why he limps already  then ill carry him said stephen doggedly  what hast thou to say to that device ambrose asked john appealing to the elder and wiser  but ambrose only answered ill help and as john had no particular desire to retain the superannuated hound and preferred on the whole to be spared sentencing him no more was said on the subject as they went along until all johns stock of good counsel had been lavished on his brothers impatient ears  he bade them farewell and turned back to the lodge and they struck away along the woodland pathway which they had been told led to winchester though they had never been thither nor seen any town save southampton and romsey at long intervals  on they went sometimes through beech and oak woods of noble almost primeval trees but more often across tracts of holly underwood illuminated here and there with the snowy garlands of the wild cherry and beneath with wide spaces covered with young green bracken whose soft irregular masses on the undulating ground had somewhat the effect of the waves of the sea  these alternated with stretches of yellow gorse and brown heather sheets of cottongrass and pools of white crowfoot and all the vegetation of a mountain side only that the mountain was not there  the brothers looked with eyes untaught to care for beauty but with a certain love of the home scenes tempered by youths impatience for something new  the nightingales sang the thrushes flew out before them the wild duck and moorhen glanced on the pools  here and there they came on the furrows left by the snout of the wild swine and in the open tracts rose the graceful heads of the deer but of inhabitants or travellers they scarce saw any save when they halted at the little hamlet of minestead where a small alehouse was kept by one will purkiss who claimed descent from the charcoal burner who had carried william rufuss corpse to burial at winchesterthe one fact in history known to all new foresters though perhaps ambrose and john were the only persons beyond the walls of beaulieu who did not suppose the affair to have taken place in the last generation  a draught of ale and a short rest were welcome as the heat of the day came on making the old dog plod wearily on with his tongue out so that stephen began to consider whether he should indeed have to be his bearera serious matter for the creature at full length measured nearly as much as he did  they met hardly any one and they and spring were alike too well known and trained for difficulties to arise as to leading a dog through the forest should they ever come to the term of the forest  it was not easy to tell when they were really beyond it for the ground was much of the same kind  only the smooth treeless hills where they had always been told winchester lay seemed more defined and they saw no more deer but here and there were inclosures where wheat and barley were growing and black timbered farmhouses began to show themselves at intervals  herd boys as rough and unkempt as their charges could be seen looking after little tawny cows blackfaced sheep or spotted pigs with curs which barked fiercely at poor weary spring even as their masters were more disposed to throw stones than to answer questions  by and by on the further side of a green valley could be seen buildings with an encircling wall of flint and mortar faced with ruddy brick the dark redtiled roofs rising among walnuttrees and an orchard in full bloom spreading into a long green field  winchester must be nigh  the sun is getting low said stephen  we will ask  the good folk will at least give us an answer said ambrose wearily  as they reached the gate a team of plough horses was passing in led by a peasant lad while a lay brother with his gown tucked up rode sideways on one whistling  an augustinian monk ruddy burly and sunburnt stood in the farmyard to receive an account of the days work and doffing his cap ambrose asked whether winchester were near  three mile or thereaway my good lad said the monk thoult see the towers an ye mount the hill  whence art thou he added looking at the two young strangers  scholars  the college elects not yet a while  we be from the forest so please your reverence and are bound for hyde abbey where our uncle master richard birkenholt dwells  and oh sir added stephen may we crave a drop of water for our dog  the monk smiled as he looked at spring who had flung himself down to take advantage of the halt hanging out his tongue and panting spasmodically  a noble beast he said of the windsor breed ist not  then laying his hand on the graceful head poor old hound thou art oer travelled  he is aged for such a journey if you came from the forest since morn  twelve years at the least i should say by his muzzle  your reverence is right said stephen he is twelve years old he is two years younger than i am and my father gave him to me when he was a little whelp  so thou must needs take him to seek thy fortune with thee said the goodnatured augustinian not knowing how truly he spoke  come in my lads heres a drink for him  what said you was your uncles name and as ambrose repeated it birkenholt  living on a corrody at hyde  ay ay  my lads i have a call to winchester tomorrow youd best tarry the night here at silkstede grange and fare forward with me  the tired boys were heartily glad to accept the invitation more especially as spring happy as he was with the trough of water before him seemed almost too tired to stand over it and after the first tried to lap lying down  silkstede was not a regular convent only a grange or farmhouse presided over by one of the monks with three or four lay brethren under him and a little colony of hinds in the surrounding cottages to cultivate the farm and tend a few cattle and numerous sheep the special care of the augustinians  father shoveller as the goodnatured monk who had received the travellers was called took them into the spacious but homely chamber which served as refectory kitchen and hall  he called to the lay brother who was busy over the open hearth to fry a few more rashers of bacon and after they had washed away the dust of their journey at the trough where spring had slaked his thirst they sat down with him to a hearty supper which smacked more of the grange than of the monastery spread on a large solid oak table and washed down with good ale  the repast was shared by the lay brethren and farm servants and also by two or three big sheep dogs who had to be taught their manners towards spring  there was none of the formality that ambrose was accustomed to at beaulieu in the great refectory where no one spoke but one of the brethren read aloud some theological book from a stone pulpit in the wall  here brother shoveller conversed without stint chiefly with the brother who seemed to be a kind of bailiff with whom he discussed the sheep that were to be taken into market the next day and the prices to be given for them by either the college the castle or the butchers of boucher row  he however found time to talk to the two guests and being sprung from a family in the immediate neighbourhood he knew the verdurers name and ere he was a monk had joined in the chase in the forest  there was a little oratory attached to the hall where he and the lay brethren kept the hours to a certain degree putting two or three services into one on a liberal interpretation of laborare est orare  ambroses responses made their host observe as they went out thou hast thy latin pat my son theres the making of a scholar in thee  then they took their first nights rest away from home in a small guestchamber with a good bed though bare in all other respects brother shoveller likewise had a cell to himself but the lay brethren slept promiscuously among their sheepdogs on the floor of the refectory  all were afoot in the early morning and stephen and ambrose were awakened by the tumultuous bleatings of the flock of sheep that were being driven from their fold to meet their fate at winchester market  they heard brother shoveller shouting his orders to the shepherds in tones a great deal more like those of a farmer than of a monk and they made haste to dress themselves and join him as he was muttering a morning abbreviation of his obligatory devotions in the oratory observing that they might be in time to hear mass at one of the city churches but the sheep might delay them and they had best break their fast ere starting  it was wednesday a day usually kept as a moderate fast so the breakfast was of oatmeal porridge flavoured with honey and washed down with mead after which brother shoveller mounted his mule a sleek creature whose long ears had an air of great contentment and rode off accommodating his pace to that of his young companions up a stony carttrack which soon led them to the top of a chalk down whence as in a map they could see winchester surrounded by its walls lying in a hollow between the smooth green hills  at one end rose the castle its fortifications covering its own hill beneath in the valley the long low massive cathedral the college buildings and tower with its pinnacles and nearer at hand among the trees the almshouse of noble poverty at st cross beneath the round hill of st catherine  churches and monastic buildings stood thickly in the town and indeed brother shoveller said shaking his head that there were wellnigh as many churches as folk to go to them the place was decayed since the time he remembered when prince arthur was born there  hyde abbey he could not show them from where they stood as it lay further off by the river side having been removed from the neighbourhood of the minster because the brethren of st grimbald could not agree with those of st swithuns belonging to the minster as indeed their buildings were so close together that it was hardly possible to pass between them and their bells jangled in each others ears  brother shoveller did not seem to entertain a very high opinion of the monks of st grimbald and he asked the boys whether they were expected there  no they said tidings of their fathers death had been sent by one of the woodmen and the only answer that had been returned was that master richard birkenholt was ill at ease but would have masses said for his brothers soul  hem said the augustinian ominously but at that moment they came up with the sheep and his attention was wholly absorbed by them as he joined the lay brothers in directing the shepherds who were driving them across the downs steering them over the high ground towards the arched west gate close to the royal castle  the street sloped rapidly down and brother shoveller conducted his young companions between the overhanging houses with stalls between serving as shops till they reached the open space round the market cross on the steps of which women sat with baskets of eggs butter and poultry raised above the motley throng of cattle and sheep with their dogs and drivers the various cries of man and beast forming an incongruous accompaniment to the bells of the churches that surrounded the marketplace  citizens wives in hood and wimple were there shrilly bargaining for provision for their households squires and grooms in quest of hay for their masters stables purveyors seeking food for the garrison lay brethren and sisters for their convents and withal the usual margin of begging friars wandering gleemen jugglers and pedlars though in no great numbers as this was only a wednesday marketday not a fair  ambrose recognised one or two who made part of the crowd at beaulieu only two days previously when he had seen through tears the juggler leap and the jingling tune one of them was playing on a rebeck brought back associations of almost unbearable pain  happily father shoveller having seen his sheep safely bestowed in a pen bethought him of bidding the lay brother in attendance show the young gentlemen the way to hyde abbey and turning up a street at right angles to the principal one they were soon out of the throng  it was a lonely place with a decayed uninhabited appearance and brother peter told them it had been the jewry whence good king edward had banished all the unbelieving dogs of jews and where no one chose to dwell after them  soon they came in sight of a large extent of monastic buildings partly of stone but the more domestic offices of flint and brick or mortar  large meadows stretched away to the banks of the itchen with cattle grazing in them but in one was a set of figures to whom the lay brother pointed with a laugh of exulting censure  long bows exclaimed stephen  who be they  brethren of st grimbald sir  such rule doth my lord of hyde keep mitred abbot though he be  they say the good bishop hath called him to order but what recks he of bishops  goodday brother bulpett here be two young kinsmen of master birkenholt to visit him and so benedicite fair sirs  st austins grace be with you  through a gate between two little red octagonal towers brother bulpett led the two visitors and called to another of the monks benedicite father segrim here be two striplings wanting speech of old birkenholt  looking after dead mens shoes i trow muttered father segrim with a sour look at the lads as he led them through the outer court where some fine horses were being groomed and then across a second court surrounded with a beautiful cloister with flower beds in front of it  here on a stone bench in the sun clad in a gown furred with rabbit skin sat a decrepit old man both his hands clasped over his staff  into his deaf ears their guide shouted these boys say they are your kindred master birkenholt  anan said the old man trembling with palsy  the lads knew him to be older than their father but they were taken by surprise at such feebleness and the monk did not aid them only saying roughly there he is  tell your errand  how fares it with you uncle ventured ambrose  who be ye  i know none of you muttered the old man shaking his head still more  we are ambrose and stephen from the forest shouted ambrose  ah  steve poor stevie  the accursed boar has rent his goodly face so as i would never have known him  poor steve  best his soul  the old man began to weep while his nephews recollected that they had heard that another uncle had been slain by the tusk of a wild boar in early manhood  then to their surprise his eyes fell on spring and calling the hound by name he caressed the creatures headspring poor spring  stevies faithful old dog  hast lost thy master  wilt follow me now  he was thinking of a spring as well as of a stevie of sixty years ago and he babbled on of how many fawns were in the queens bower this summer and who had best shot at the butts at lyndhurst as if he were excited by the breath of his native forest but there was no making him understand that he was speaking with his nephews  the name of his brother john only set him repeating that john loved the greenwood and would be content to take poor stevies place and dwell in the verdurers lodge but that he himself ought to be abroad he had seen brave lord talbots ships ready at southampton john might stay at home but he would win fame and honour in gascony  and while he thus wandered and the boys stood by perplexed and distressed brother segrim came back and said so young sirs have you seen enough of your doting kinsman  the subprior bids me say that we harbour no strange idling lubber lads nor strange dogs here  tis enough for us to be saddled with dissolute old menat arms without all their idle kin making an excuse to come and pay their devoirs  these corrodies are a heavy charge and a weighty abuse and if there be the visitation the kings majesty speaks of they will be one of the first matters to be amended  wherewith stephen and ambrose found themselves walked out of the cloister of st grimbald and the gates shut behind them    chapter iii  kinsmen and strangers    the reul of st maure and of st beneit because that it was old and some deale streit this ilke monk let old things pace he held ever of the new world the trace  chaucer   the churls exclaimed stephen  poor old man said ambrose i hope they are good to him  to think that thus ends all that once was gallant talk of fighting under talbots banner sighed stephen thoughtful for a moment however theres a good deal to come first  yea and what next said the elder brother  on to uncle hal  i ever looked most to him  he will purvey me to a pages place in some noble household and get thee a clerks or scholars place in my lord of yorks house  mayhap there will be room for us both there for my lord of york hath a goodly following of armed men  which way lies the road to london  we must back into the town and ask as well as fill our stomachs and our wallets said ambrose  talk of their rule  the entertaining of strangers is better understood at silkstede than at hyde  tush  a grudged crust sticks in the gullet returned stephen come on ambrose i marked the sign of the white hart by the marketplace  there will be a welcome there for foresters  they returned on their steps past the dilapidated buildings of the old jewry and presently saw the market in full activity but the sounds and sights of busy life where they were utter strangers gave ambrose a sense of loneliness and desertion and his heart sank as the bolder stephen threaded the way in the direction of a broad entry over which stood a slenderbodied hart with gold hoofs horns collar and chain  how now my sons said a full cheery voice and to their joy they found themselves pushed up against father shoveller  returned already  did you get scant welcome at hyde  here come where we can get a free breath and tell me  they passed through the open gateway of the white hart into the court but before listening to them the monk exchanged greetings with the hostess who stood at the door in a broad hat and velvet bodice and demanded what cheer there was for noonmeat  a jack reverend sir eels and a grampus fresh sent up from hampton also freshkilled mutton for such lay folk as are not curious of the wednesday fast  they are laying the board even now  lay platters for me and these two young gentlemen said the augustinian  ye be my guests ye wot he added since ye tarried not for meat at hyde  nor did they ask us exclaimed stephen lubbers and idlers were the best words they had for us  ho ho  thats the way with the brethren of st grimbald  and your uncle  alas sir he doteth with age said ambrose  he took stephen for his own brother dead under king harry of windsor  so  i had heard somewhat of his age and sickness  who was it who thrust you out  a lean brother with a thin red beard and a shrewd puckered visage  ha  by that token twas segrim the bursar  he wots how to drive a bargain  st austin but he deemed you came to look after your kinsmans corrody  he said the king spake of a visitation to abolish corrodies from religious houses said ambrose  hell abolish the long bow from them first said father shoveller ay and miniver from my lord abbots hood  id admonish you my good brethren of s  grimbald to be in no hurry for a visitation which might scarce stop where you would fain have it  well my sons are ye bound for the forest again  an ye be well wend back together and ye can lie at silkstede tonight  alack kind father theres no more home for us in the forest said ambrose  methought ye had a brother  yea but our brother hath a wife  ho ho  and the wife will none of you  she would have kept ambrose to teach her boy his primer said stephen but she would none of spring nor of me  we hoped to receive counsel from our uncle at hyde added ambrose  have ye no purpose now inquired the father his jolly good humoured face showing much concern  yea manfully returned stephen  twas what i ever hoped to do to fare on and seek our fortune in london  ha  to pick up gold and silver like dick whittington  poor old spring here will scarce do you the part of his cat and the monks hearty laugh angered stephen into muttering we are no fools but father shoveller only laughed the more saying fair and softly my son yell never pick up the gold if ye cannot brook a kindly quip have you friends or kindred in london  yea that have we sir cried stephen our mothers own brother master randall hath come to preferment there in my lord archbishop of yorks household and hath sent us tokens from time to time which we will show you  not while we be feasting said father shoveller hastily checking ambrose who was feeling in his bosom  see the knaves be bringing their grampus across the court  here well clean our hands and be ready for the meal and he showed them under a projecting gallery in the inn yard a stone trough through which flowed a stream of water in which he proceeded to wash his hands and face and to wipe them in a coarse towel suspended nigh at hand  certainly after handling sheep freely there was need though such ablutions were a refinement not indulged in by all the company who assembled round the wellspread board of the white hart for the meal after the market  they were a motley company  by the hosts side sat a knight on his way home from pilgrimage to compostella or perhaps a mission to spain with a couple of squires and other attendants and converse of political import seemed to be passing between him and a shrewdlooking man in a lawyers hood and gown the recorder of winchester who preferred being a daily guest at the white hart to keeping a table of his own  country franklins and yeomen merchants and menatarms palmers and craftsmen friars and monks black white and grey and with almost all father shoveller had greeting or converse to exchange  he knew everybody and had friendly talk with all on canons or crops on war or wool on the prices of pigs or prisoners on the news of the country side or on the perilous innovations in learning at oxford which might it was feared even affect st marys college at winchester  he did not affect outlandish fishes himself and dined upon pike but observing the curiosity of his guests he took good care to have them well supplied with grampus also in due time with varieties of the pudding and cake kind which had never dawned on their forest bred imagination and with a due proportion of good alethe same over which the knight might be heard rejoicing and lauding far above the spanish or french wines on which he said he had been half starved  father shoveller mused a good deal over his pike and its savoury stuffing  he was not by any means an ideal monk but he was equally far from being a scandal  he was the shrewd man of business and manager of his fraternity conducting the farming operations and making all the bargains following his rule respectably according to the ordinary standard of his time but not rising to any spirituality and while duly observing the fast day as to the quality of his food eating with the appetite of a man who lived in the open fields  but when their hunger was appeased with many a fragment given to spring the young birkenholts wearied of the endless talk that was exchanged over the tankard began to grow restless and after exchanging signs across father shovellers solid person they simultaneously rose and began to thank him and say they must pursue their journey  how now not so fast my sons said the father tarry a bit i have more to say to thee  prayers and provender thou knowstill come anon  so sir didst say yonder beggarly flemings haggle at thy price for thy southdown fleeces  weight of dirt forsooth  do not we wash the sheep in the poolhole stream the purest water in the shire  manners withheld ambrose from responding to stephens hot impatience while the merchant in the sleek pucecoloured coat discussed the flemish wool market with the monk for a good halfhour longer  by this time the knights horses were brought into the yard and the merchants men had made ready his palfrey his packhorse being already on the way the hosts son came round with the reckoning and there was a general move  stephen expected to escape and hardly could brook the goodnatured authority with which father shoveller put ambrose aside when he would have discharged their share of the reckoning and took it upon himself  said i not ye were my guests quoth he  we missed our morning mass it will do us no harm to hear nones in the minster  sir we thank you but we should be on our way said ambrose incited by stephens impatient gestures  tut tut  fair and softly my son or more haste may be worse speed  methought ye had somewhat to show me  stephens youthful independence might chafe but the habit of submission to authorities made him obediently follow the monk out at the back entrance of the inn behind which lay the minster yard the grand western front rising in front of them and the buildings of st swithuns abbey extending far to their right  the hour was nearly noon and the space was deserted except for an old woman sitting at the great western doorway with a basket of rosaries made of nuts and of snail shells and a workman or two employed on the bishops new reredos  now for thy tokens said father shoveller  see my young foresters ye be new to the world  take an old mans counsel and never show nor speak of such gear in an hostel  mine host of the white hart is an old gossip of mine and indifferent honest but who shall say who might be within earshot  stephen had a mind to say that he did not see why the meddling monk should wish to see them at all and ambrose looked a little reluctant but father shoveller said in his goodhumoured way as you please young sirs  tis but an old mans wish to see whether he can do aught to help you that you be not as lambs among wolves mayhap ye deem ye can walk into london town and that the first man you meet can point you to your unclerandall call ye himas readily as i could show you my brother thomas shoveller of granbury  but you are just as like to meet with some knave who might cozen you of all you have or mayhap a beadle might take you up for vagabonds and thrust you in the stocks or ever you get to london town so i would fain give you some commendation an i knew to whom to make it and ye be not too proud to take it  you are but too good to us sir said ambrose quite conquered though stephen only half believed in the difficulties  the father took them within the west door of the minster and looking up and down the long arcade of the southern aisle to see that no one was watching he inspected the tokens and crossexamined them on their knowledge of their uncle  his latest gift the rosary had come by the hand of friar hurst a begging minorite of southampton who had it from another of his order at winchester who had received it from one of the kings archers at the castle with a message to mistress birkenholt that it came from her brother master randall who had good preferment in london in the house of my lord archbishop of york without whose counsel king henry never stirred  as to the coming of the agate and the pouncet box the minds of the boys were very hazy  they knew that the pouncet box had been conveyed through the attendants of the abbot of beaulieu but they were only sure that from that time the belief had prevailed with their mother that her brother was prospering in the house of the allpowerful wolsey  the good augustinian examining the tokens thought they gave colour to that opinion  the rosary and agate might have been picked up in an ecclesiastical household and the lid of the pouncet box was made of a spanish coin likely to have come through some of the attendants of queen katharine  it hath an appearance he said  i marvel whether there be still at the castle this archer who hath had speech with master randall for if ye know no more than ye do at present tis seeking a needle in a bottle of hay  but see here come the brethren that be to sing nonessinner that i am to have said no hours since the morn being letted with lawful business  again the unwilling stephen had to submit  there was no feeling for the incongruous in those days and reverence took very different directions from those in which it now shows itself so that nobody had any objection to springs pacing gravely with the others towards the lady chapel where the hours were sung since the choir was in the hands of workmen and the sound of chipping stone could be heard from it where bishop foxs elaborate lacework reredos was in course of erection  passing the shrine of st swithun and the grand tomb of cardinal beaufort where his lifecoloured effigy filled the boys with wonder they followed their leaders example and knelt within the lady chapel while the brief latin service for the ninth hour was sung through by the canon clerks and boys  it really was the sixth but cumulative easygoing treatment of the breviary had made this the usual time for it as the name of noon still testifies  the boys attention it must be confessed was chiefly expended on the wonderful miracles of the blessed virgin in fresco on the walls of the chapel all tending to prove that here was hope for those who said their ave in any extremity of fire or flood  nones ended father shoveller with many a halt for greeting or for gossip took the lads up the hill towards the wide fortified space where the old castle and royal hall of henry of winchester looked down on the city and after some friendly passages with the warder at the gate father shoveller explained that he was in quest of some one recently come from court of whom the striplings in his company could make inquiry concerning a kinsman in the household of my lord archbishop of york  the warder scratched his head and bethinking himself that eastcheap jockey was the reverend  fathers man summoned a horseboy to call that worthy  where was he  sitting over his pottle in the hall was the reply and the monk with a laugh savouring little of asceticism said he would seek him there and accordingly crossed the court to the noble hall with its lofty dark marble columns and the round table of king arthur suspended at the upper end  the governor of the castle had risen from his meal long ago but the garrison in the piping times of peace would make their ration of ale last as far into the afternoon as their commanders would suffer  and half a dozen men still sat there one or two snoring two playing at dice on a clear corner of the board and another a smart welldressed fellow in a bright scarlet jerkin laying down the law to a country bumpkin who looked somewhat dazed  the first of these was as it appeared eastcheap jockey and there was something both of the readiness and the impudence of the londoner in his manner when he turned to answer the question  he knew many in my lord of yorks houseas many as a man was like to know where there was a matter of two hundred folk between clerks and soldiers he had often crushed a pottle with them  no he had never heard of one called randall neither in hat nor cowl but he knew more of them by face than by name and more by byname than surname or christened name  he was certainly not the archer who had brought a token for mistress birkenholt and his comrades all avouched equal ignorance on the subject  nothing could be gained there and while father shoveller rubbed his bald head in consideration stephen rose to take leave  look you here my fair son said the monk  starting at this hour though the days be long you will not reach any safe halting place with daylight whereas by lying a night in this good city you might reach alton tomorrow and there is a home where the name of brother shoveller will win you free lodging and entertainment  and tonight good father inquired ambrose  that will i see to if ye will follow me  stephen was devoured with impatience during the farewells in the castle but ambrose represented that the good man was giving them much of his time and that it would be unseemly and ungrateful to break from him  what matter is it of his  and why should he make us lose a whole day grumbled stephen  what special gain would a day be to us sighed ambrose  i am thankful that any should take heed for us  ay you love leadingstrings returned stephen  where is he going now  all out of our way  father shoveller however as he went down the castle hill explained that the warden of st elizabeths hospital was his friend and knowing him to have acquaintance among the clergy of st pauls it would be well to obtain a letter of commendation from him which might serve them in good stead in case they were disappointed of finding their uncle at once  it would be better for spring to have a little more rest thought stephen thus mitigating his own longing to escape from the monks and friars of whom winchester seemed to be full  they had a kindly welcome in the pretty little college of st elizabeth of hungary lying in the meadows between william of wykehams college and the round hill of st catharine  the warden was a more scholarly and ecclesiasticallooking person than his friend the goodnatured augustinian  after commending them to his care and partaking of a drink of mead the monk of silkstede took leave of the youths with a hearty blessing and advice to husband their few crowns not to tell every one of their tokens and to follow the counsel of the warden of st elizabeths assuring them that if they turned back to the forest they should have a welcome at silkstede  moreover he patted spring pitifully and wished him and his master well through the journey  st elizabeths college was a hundred years older than its neighbour st marys as was evident to practised eyes by its arches and windows but it had been so entirely eclipsed by wykehams foundation that the number of priests students and choirboys it was intended to maintain had dwindled away so that it now contained merely the warden a superannuated priest and a couple of big lads who acted as servants  there was an air of great quietude and coolness about the pointed arches of its tiny cloister on that summers day with the old monk dozing in his chair over the manuscript he thought he was reading not far from the little table where the warden was eagerly studying erasmuss praise of folly but the birkenholts were of the age at which quiet means dulness at least stephen was and the warden had pity both on them and on himself and hearing joyous shouts outside he opened a little door in the cloister wall and revealed a multitude of lads with their black gowns tucked up a playing at the ballthese being the scholars of st marys  beckoning to a pair of elder ones who were walking up and down more quietly he consigned the strangers to their care sweetening the introduction by an invitation to supper for which he would gain permission from their warden  one of the young wykehamists was shy and churlish and sheered off from the brothers but the other catechised them on their views of becoming scholars in the college  he pointed out the cloister where the studies took place in all weathers showed them the hall the chapel and the chambers and expatiated on the chances of attaining to new college  being moreover a scholarly fellow he and ambrose fell into a discussion over the passage of virgil copied out on a bit of paper which he was learning by heart  some other scholars having finished their game and become aware of the presence of a strange dog and two strange boys proceeded to mob stephen and spring whereupon the shy boy stood forth and declared that the warden of st elizabeths had brought them in for an hours sport  of course in such close quarters the rival warden was esteemed a natural enemy and went by the name of old bess so that his recommendation went for worse than nothing and a dash at spring was made by the inhospitable young savages  stephen stood to the defence in act to box and the shy lad stood by him calling for fair play and one at a time  of course a fight ensued stephen and his champion on the one side and two assailants on the other till after a fall on either side ambroses friend interfered with a voice as thundering as the manly crack would permit peace was restored stephen found himself free of the meads and spring was caressed instead of being tormented  stephen was examined on his past present and future envied for his forest home and beguiled into magnificent accounts not only of the deer that had fallen to his bow and the boars that had fallen to his fathers spear but of the honours to which his uncle in the archbishops household would prefer himfor he viewed it as an absolute certainty that his kinsman was captain among the menat arms whom he endowed on the spot with scarlet coats faced with black velvet and silver medals and chains  whereat one of the other boys was not behind in telling how his father was pursuivant to my lord duke of norfolk and never went abroad save with silver lions broidered on back and breast and trumpets going before and another dwelt on the splendours of the mayor and aldermen of southampton with their chains and cups of gold  stephen felt bound to surpass this with the last report that my lord of yorks men rode flemish steeds in crimson velvet housings passmented with gold and gems and of course his uncle had the leading of them  who be thine uncle demanded a thin squeaky voice  i have brothers likewise in my lord of yorks meime  mine uncle is captain harry randall of shirley quoth stephen magnificently scornfully surveying the small proportions of the speaker what is thy brother  head turnspit said a rude voice provoking a general shout of laughter but the boy stood his ground and said hotly  he is page to the comptroller of my lords household and waits at the second table and i know every one of the captains  hell say next he knows every one of the seven worthies cried another boy for stephen was becoming a popular character  and all the paladins to boot  come on little rowley was the cry  i tell you my brother is page to the comptroller of the household and my mother dwells beside the gate house and i know every man of them insisted rowley waxing hot  as for that forest savage fellows uncle being captain of the guard tis more like that he is my lords fool quipsome hal  whereat there was a cry in which were blended exultation at the hit and vituperation of the hitter  stephen flew forward to avenge the insult but a big bell was beginning to ring a whole wave of black gowns rushed to obey it sweeping little rowley away with them and stephen found himself left alone with his brother and the two lads who had been invited to st elizabeths and who now repaired thither with them  the supper party in the refectory was a small one and the rule of the foundation limited the meal to one dish and a pittance but the dish was of savoury eels and the wardens good nature had added to it some cates and comfits in consideration of his youthful guests  after some conversation with the elder wykehamist the warden called ambrose and put him through an examination on his attainments which proved so satisfactory that it ended in an invitation to the brothers to fill two of the empty scholarships of the college of the dear st elizabeth  it was a good offer and one that ambrose would fain have accepted but stephen had no mind for the cloister or for learning  the warden had no doubt that he could be apprenticed in the city of winchester since the brother at home had in keeping a sum sufficient for the fee  though the trade of capping had fallen off there were still good substantial burgesses who would be willing to receive an active lad of good parentage some being themselves of gentle blood  stephen however would not brook the idea  out upon you ambrose said he to desire to bind your own brother to base mechanical arts  tis what nurse joan held to be best for us both said ambrose  joan  yea like a woman who deems a man safest when he is a tailor or a perfumer  an you be minded to stay here with a black gown and a shaven crown i shall on with spring and come to preferment  maybe thoult next hear of me when i have got some fat canonry for thee  nay i quit thee not said ambrose  if thou fare forward so do i  but i would thou couldst have brought thy mind to rest there  what wouldst thou be content with this wornout place with more churches than houses and more empty houses than full ones  no let us on where there is something doing  thou wilt see that my lord of york will have room for the scholar as well as the manatarms  so the kind offer was declined but ambrose was grieved to see that the warden thought him foolish and perhaps ungrateful  nevertheless the good man gave them a letter to the reverend master alworthy singing clerk at st pauls cathedral telling ambrose it might serve them in case they failed to find their uncle or if my lord of yorks household should not be in town  he likewise gave them a recommendation which would procure them a nights lodging at the grange and after the mornings mass and meat sped them on their way with his blessing muttering to himself that elder one might have been the staff of mine age  pity on him to be lost in the great and evil city  yet tis a good lad to follow that fiery spark his brother  tanquam agnus inter lupos  alack    chapter iv  a heros fall    these four came all afront and mainly made at me  i made no more ado but took their seven points on my targetthus  shakespeare   the journey to alton was eventless  it was slow for the day was a broiling one and the young foresters missed their oaks and beeches as they toiled over the chalk downs that rose and sank in endless succession though they would hardly have slackened their pace if it had not been for poor old spring who was sorely distressed by the heat and the want of water on the downs  every now and then he lay down panting distressfully with his tongue hanging out and his young masters always waited for him often themselves not sorry to rest in the fragment of shade from a solitary thorn or juniper  the track was plain enough and there were hamlets at long intervals  flocks of sheep fed on the short grass but there was no approaching the shepherds as they and their dogs regarded spring as an enemy to be received with clamour stones and teeth in spite of the dejected looks which might have acquitted him of evil intentions  the travellers reached alton in the cool of the evening and were kindly received by a monk who had charge of a grange just outside the little town near one of the springs of the river wey  the next days journey was a pleasanter one for there was more of wood and heather and they had to skirt round the marshy borders of various bogs  spring was happier being able to stop and lap whenever he would and the whole scene was less unfriendly to them but they scarcely made speed enough for they were still among tall whins and stiff scrub of heather when the sun began to get low gorgeously lighting the tall plumes of golden broom and they had their doubts whether they might not be off the track but in such weather there was nothing alarming in spending a night out of doors if only they had something for supper  stephen took a bolt from the purse at his girdle and bent his crossbow so as to be ready in case a rabbit sprang out or a duck flew up from the marshes  a small thicket of trees was in sight and they were making for it when sounds of angry voices were heard and spring bristling up the mane on his neck and giving a few premonitory fierce growls like thunder bounded forward as though he had been seven years younger stephen darted after him ambrose rushed after stephen and breaking through the trees they beheld the dog at the throat of one of three men  as they came on the scene the dog was torn down and hurled aside giving a howl of agony which infuriated his master  letting fly his crossbow bolt full at the fellows face he dashed on reckless of odds waving his knotted stick and shouting with rage ambrose though more aware of the madness of such an assault still hurried to his support and was amazed as well as relieved to find the charge effectual  without waiting to return a blow the miscreants took to their heels and stephen seeing nothing but his dog dropped on his knees beside the quivering creature from whose neck blood was fast pouring  one glance of the faithful wistful eyes one feeble movement of the expressive tail and spring had made his last farewell  that was all stephen was conscious of but ambrose could hear the cry good sirs good lads set me free and was aware of a portly form bound to a tree  as he cut the rope with his knife the rescued traveller hurried out thanks and demands where are the rest of you and on the reply that there were no more proceeded then we must on on at once or the villains will return  they must have thought you had a band of hunters behind you  two furlongs hence and we shall be safe in the hostel at dogmersfield  come on my boy to stephen the brave hound is quite dead mores the pity  thou canst do no more for him and we shall soon be in his case if we dally here  i cannot cannot leave him thus sobbed stephen who had the loving old head on his knees  ambrose stay we must bring him there his tail wagged  if the blood were staunched  stephen  indeed he is stone dead  were he our brother we could not do otherwise reasoned ambrose forcibly dragging his brother to his feet  go on we must  wouldst have us all slaughtered for his sake  come  the rogues will be upon us anon  spring saved this good mans life  undo not his work  see  is yonder your horse sir  this way stevie  the instinct of catching the horse roused stephen and it was soon accomplished for the steed was a plump docile citybred palfrey with dapplegrey flanks like wellstuffed satin pincushions by no means resembling the shaggy forest ponies of the boys experience but quite astray in the heath and ready to come at the masters whistle and call of soh  sohnow poppet  stephen caught the bridle and ambrose helped the burgess into the saddle  now good boys he said each of you lay a hand on my pommel  we can make good speed ere the rascals find out our scant numbers  you would make better speed without us sir said stephen hankering to remain beside poor spring  dye think giles headley the man to leave two children that have maybe saved my life as well as my purse to bear the malice of the robbers demanded the burgess angrily  that were like those fellows of mine who have shown their heels and left their master strapped to a tree  thou thou whats thy name that hast the most wit bring thy brother unless thou wouldst have him laid by the side of his dog  stephen was forced to comply and run by poppets side though his eyes were so full of tears that he could not see his way even when the pace slackened and in the twilight they found themselves among houses and gardens and thus in safety the lights of an inn shining not far off  a figure came out in the road to meet them crying master master is it you and without scathe  oh the saints be praised  ay tibble tis i and no other thanks to the saints and to these brave lads  what man i blame thee not i know thou canst not strike but where be the rest  in the inn sir  i strove to call up the hue and cry to come to the rescue but the cowardly hinds were afraid of the thieves and not one would come forth  i wish they may not be in league with them said master headley see i was delivereday and in time to save my purse by these twain and their good dog  are ye from these parts my fair lads  we be journeying from the new forest to london said ambrose the poor dog heard the tumult and leapt to your aid sir and we made after him  twas the saints sent him was the fervent answer  and with a lifting of the cap i hereby vow to st julian a hound of solid bronze a foot in length with a collar of silver to his shrine in st faiths in token of my deliverance in body and goods  to london are ye bound  then will we journey on together  they were by this time near the porch of a large country hostel from the doors and large bay window of which light streamed out and as the casement was open those without could both see and hear all that was passing within  the table was laid for supper and in the place of honour sat a youth of some seventeen or eighteen years gaily dressed with a little feather curling over his crimson cap and thus discoursing   yea my good host two of the rogues bear my tokens besides him whom i felled to the earth  he came on at me with his sword but i had my point ready for him and down he went before me like an ox then came on another but him i dealt with by the back stroke as used in the tiltyard at clarendon  i trow we shall know him again sir  holy saints to think such rascals should haunt so nigh us the hostess was exclaiming  pity for the poor goodman master headley  a portly burgher was he friendly of tongue and free of purse  i well remember him when he went forth on his way to salisbury little thinking poor soul what was before him  and is he truly sped  i tell thee good woman i saw him go down before three of their pikes  what more could i do but drive my horse over the nearest rogue who was rifling him  if he were still alivewhich our lady grantthe knaves will hold him to ransom quoth the host as he placed a tankard on the table  i am afraid he is past ransom said the youth shaking his head but an if he be still in the rogues hands and living i will get me on to his house in cheapside and arrange with his mother to find the needful sum as befits me i being his heir and about to wed his daughter  however i shall do all that in me lies to get the poor old seignior out of the hands of the rogues  saints defend me  the poor old seignior is much beholden to thee said master headley advancing amid a clamour of exclamations from three or four servingmen or grooms one protesting that he thought his master was with him another that his horse ran away with him one showing an arm which was actually being bound up and the youth declaring that he rode off to bring help  well wast thou bringing it master headley answered  i might be still standing bound like an eagle displayed against yonder tree for aught you fellows recked  nay sir the odds began the youth  odds such odds as were put to routby what deem you  these two striplings and one poor hound  had but one of you had the heart of a sparrow ye had not furnished a tale to be the laugh of the barbican and cheapside  look well at them  how old be you my brave lads  i shall be sixteen come lammas day and stephen fifteen at martinmas day sir said ambrose but verily we did nought  we could have done nought had not the thieves thought more were behind us  there are odds between going forward and backward said master headley dryly  ha  art hurt  thou bleedst he exclaimed laying his hand on stephens shoulder and drawing him to the light  tis no blood of mine said stephen as ambrose likewise came to join in the examination  it is my poor springs  he took the cowards blow  his was all the honour and we have left him there on the heath  and he covered his face with his hands  come come my good child said master headley we will back to the place by times tomorrow when rogues hide and honest men walk abroad  thou shalt bury thine hound as befits a good warrior on the battlefield  i would fain mark his points for the effigy we will frame honest tibble for st julian  and mark ye fellows thou godson giles above all who tis that boast of their valour and who tis that be modest of speech  yea thanks mine host  let us to a chamber and give us water to wash away soil of travel and of fray and then to supper  young masters ye are my guests shame were it that giles headley let go farther them that have under heaven and st julian saved him in life limb and purse  the inn was large being the resort of many travellers from the south often of nobles and knights riding to parliament and thus the brothers found themselves accommodated with a chamber where they could prepare for the meal while ambrose tried to console his brother by representing that after all poor spring had died gallantly and with far less pain than if he had suffered a wasting old age besides being honoured for ever by his effigy in st faiths wherever that might be the idea which chiefly contributed to console his master  the two boys appeared in the room of the inn looking so unlike the dusty bloodstained pair who had entered that master headley took a second glance to convince himself that they were the same before beckoning them to seats on either side of him saying that he must know more of them and bidding the host load their trenchers well from the grand fabric of beefpasty which had been set at the end of the board  the runaways four or five in number herded together lower down with a few travellers of lower degree all except the youth who had been boasting before their arrival and who retained his seat at the board thumping it with the handle of his knife to show his impatience for the commencement of supper and not far off sat tibble the same who had hailed their arrival a thin slight onesided looking person with a terrible red withered scar on one cheek drawing the corner of his mouth awry  he like master headley himself and the rest of his party were clad in red guarded with white and wore the cross of st george on the white border of their flat crimson caps being no doubt in the livery of their company  the citizen himself having in the meantime drawn his conclusions from the air and gestures of the brothers and their mode of dealing with their food asked the usual question in an affirmative tone ye be of gentle blood young sirs  to which they replied by giving their names and explaining that they were journeying from the new forest to find their uncle in the train of the archbishop of york  birkenholt said tibble meditatively  he beareth vert a bucks head proper on a chief argent two arrows in saltire  crest a buck courant pierced in the gorge by an arrow all proper  to which the brothers returned by displaying the handles of their knives both of which bore the pierced and courant buck  ay ay said the man  twill be found in our books sir  we painted the shield and newcrested the morion the first year of my prenticeship when the earl of richmond the late king harry of blessed memory had newly landed at milford haven  verily said ambrose our uncle richard birkenholt fought at bosworth under sir richard poles banner  a tall and stalwart esquire methinks said master headley  is he the kinsman you seek  not so sir  we visited him at winchester and found him sorely old and with failing wits  we be on our way to our mothers brother master harry randall  is he clerk or layman  my lord of york entertaineth enow of both said master headley  lay assuredly sir returned stephen i trust to him to find me some preferment as page or the like  knowst thou the man tibble inquired the master  not among the menatarms sir was the answer but there be a many of them whose right names we never hear  however he will be easily found if my lord of york be returned from windsor with his train  then will we go forward together my young masters birkenholt  i am not going to part with my doughty championspatting stephens shoulder  yed not think that these lightheeled knaves belonged to the brave craft of armourers  certainly not thought the lads whose notion of armourers was derived from the brawny blacksmith of lyndhurst who sharpened their boar spears and shod their horses  they made some kind of assent and master headley went on  these be the times  this is what peace hath brought us to  i am called down to salisbury to take charge of the goods chattels and estate of my kinsman robert headleysaints rest his souland to bring home yonder spark my godson whose indentures have been made over to me  and i may not ride a mile after sunset without being set upon by a sort of robbers who must have guessed overwell what a pack of cowards they had to deal with  sir cried the younger giles i swear to you that i struck right and left  i did all that man could do but these rogues of serving men they fled and dragged me along with them and i deemed you were of our company till we dismounted  did you so  methought anon you saw me go down with three pikes in my breast  come come godson giles speech will not mend it  thou art but a green townbred lad a mothers darling and mayst be a brave man yet only dont dread to tell the honest truth that you were afeard as many a better man might be  the host chimed in with tales of the thieves and outlaws who then and indeed for many later generations infested bagshot heath and the wild moorland tracks around  he seemed to think that the travellers had had a hairsbreadth escape and that a few seconds more delay might have revealed the weakness of the rescuers and have been fatal to them  however there was no danger so near the village in the morning and somewhat to stephens annoyance the whole place turned out to inspect the spot and behold the burial of poor spring who was found stretched on the heather just as he had been left the night before  he was interred under the stunted oak where master headley had been tied  while the grave was dug with a spade borrowed at the inn ambrose undertook to cut out the dogs name on the bark but he had hardly made the first incision when tibble the singed foreman offered to do it for him and made a much more sightly inscription than he could have done  master headleys sword was found honourably broken under the tree and was reserved to form a base for his intended ex voto  he uttered the vow in due form like a funeral oration when stephen with a swelling heart had laid the companion of his life in the little grave which was speedily covered in    chapter v  the dragon court             a citizen    of credit and renown a trainband captain eke was he    of famous london town  cowper   in spite of his satisfaction at the honourable obsequies of his dog stephen birkenholt would fain have been independent and thought it provoking and strange that every one should want to direct his movements and assume the charge of one so well able to take care of himself but he could not escape as he had done before from the warden of st elizabeth for ambrose had readily accepted the proposal that they should travel in master headleys company only objecting that they were on foot on which the good citizen hired a couple of hackneys for them  besides the two giles headleys the party consisted of tibble the scarred and withered foreman two grooms and two servingmen all armed with the swords and bucklers of which they had made so little use  it appeared in process of time that the two namesakes besides being godfather and godson were cousins and that robert the father of the younger one had after his apprenticeship in the paternal establishment at salisbury served for a couple of years in the london workshop of his kinsman to learn the latest improvements in weapons  this had laid the foundation of a friendship which had lasted through life though the london cousin had been as prosperous as the country one had been the reverse  the provincial trade in arms declined with the close of the york and lancaster wars  men were not permitted to turn from one handicraft to another and robert headley had neither aptitude nor resources  his wife was vain and thriftless and he finally broke down under his difficulties appointing by will his cousin to act as his executor and to take charge of his only son who had served out half his time as apprentice to himself  there had been delay until the peace with france had given the armourer some leisure for an expedition to salisbury a serious undertaking for a london burgess who had little about him of the ancient northern weaponsmith and had wanted to avail himself of the protection of the suite of the bishop of salisbury returning from parliament  he had spent some weeks in disposing of his cousins stock in trade which was far too antiquated for the london market also of the premises which were bought by an adjoining convent to extend its garden and he had divided the proceeds between the widow and children  he had presided at the wedding of the last daughter with whom the mother was to reside and was on his way back to london with his godson who had now become his apprentice  giles headley the younger was a fine tall youth but clumsy and untrained in the use of his limbs and he rode a large powerful brown horse which brooked no companionship lashing out with its shaggy hoofs at any of its kind that approached it more especially at poor plump mottled poppet  the men said he had insisted on retaining that and no other for his journey to london contrary to all advice and he was obliged to ride foremost alone in the middle of the road while master headley seemed to have an immense quantity of consultation to carry on with his foreman tibble whose quiet looking brown animal was evidently on the best of terms with poppet by daylight tibble looked even more sallow lean and sickly and stephen could not help saying to the servingman nearest to him can such a weakling verily be an armourer  yea sir  wrymouthed tibble as they call him was a sturdy fellow till he got a fell against the mouth of a furnace and lay ten months in st bartholomews spital scarce moving hand or foot he cannot wield a hammer but he has a cunning hand for gilding and coloured devices and is as good as garterkingatarms himself for all bearings of knights and nobles  as we heard last night said stephen  moreover in the spital he learnt to write and cast accompts like a very scrivener and the master trusts him more than any except maybe kit smallbones the head smith  what will smallbones think of the new prentice said one of the other men  prentice  tis plain enough what sort of prentice the youth is like to be who beareth the name of a master with one only daughter  an emphatic grunt was the only answer while ambrose pondered on the good luck of some people who had their futures cut out for them with no trouble on their own part  this days ride was through more inhabited parts and was esteemed less perilous  they came in sight of the thames at lambeth but master headley remembering how ill his beloved poppet had brooked the ferry decided to keep to the south of the river by a causeway across lambeth marsh which was just passable in high and dry summers and which conducted them to a raised road called bankside where they looked across to the towers of westminster and the abbey in its beauty dawned on the imagination of stephen and ambrose  the royal standard floated over the palace whence master headley perceived that the king was there and augured that my lord of yorks meine would not be far to seek  then came broad green fields with young corn growing or hay waving for the scythe the tents and booths of may fair and the beautiful market cross in the midst of the village of charing while the strand immediately opposite began to be fringed with great monasteries within their ample gardens with here and there a noblemans castellated house and terraced garden with broad stone stairs leading to the thames  barges and wherries plied up and down the former often gaily canopied and propelled by liveried oarsmen all plying their arms in unison so that the vessel looked like some brilliant manylimbed creature treading the water  presently appeared the heavy walls inclosing the city itself dominated by the tall openwork timber spire of st pauls with the foursquare fourturreted tower acting as it has been well said as a padlock to a chain and the rivers breadth spanned by london bridge a very street of houses built on the abutments  now bankside had houses on each side of the road and wrymouthed tibble showed evident satisfaction when they turned to cross the bridge where they had to ride in single file not without some refractoriness on the part of young headleys steed  on they went now along streets where each story of the tall houses projected over the last so that the gables seemed ready to meet now beside walls of convent gardens now past churches while the country lads felt bewildered with the numbers passing to and fro and the air was full of bells  cap after cap was lifted in greeting to master headley by burgess artisan or apprentice and many times did he draw poppets rein to exchange greetings and receive congratulations on his return  on reaching st pauls minster he halted and bade the servants take home the horses and tell the mistress with his dutiful greetings that he should be at home anon and with guests  we must een return thanks for our safe journey and great deliverance he said to his young companions and thrusting his arm into that of a russetvested citizen who met him at the door he walked into the cathedral recounting his adventure  the youths followed with some difficulty through the stream of loiterers in the nave giles the younger elbowing and pushing so that several of the crowd turned to look at him and it was well that his kinsman soon astonished him by descending a stair into a crypt with solid short clustered columns and highpitched vaulting fitted up as a separate church namely that of the parish of st faith  the great cathedral having absorbed the site of the original church had given this crypt to the parishioners  here all was quiet and solemn in marked contrast to the hubbub in pauls walk above in the nave  against the eastern pillar of one of the bays was a little altar and the decorations included st julian the patron of travellers with his saltire doubly crossed and his stag beside him  little ships trees and wonderful enamelled representations of perils by robbers field and flood hung thickly on st julians pillar and on the wall and splay of the window beside it and here after crossing himself master headley rapidly repeated a paternoster and ratified his vow of presenting a bronze image of the hound to whom he owed his rescue  one of the clergy came up to register the vow and the good armourer proceeded to bespeak a mass of thanksgiving on the next morning also ten for the soul of master john birkenholt late verdurer of the new forest in hampshirea mode of showing his gratitude which the two sons highly appreciated  then climbing up the steps again and emerging from the cathedral by the west door the boys beheld a scene for which their experiences of romsey and even of winchester had by no means prepared them  it was five oclock on a summer evening so that the place was full of stir  old women sat with baskets of rosaries and little crosses or images of saints on the steps of the cathedral while in the open space beyond more than one horse was displaying his paces for the benefit of some undecided purchaser who had been chaffering for hours in pauls walk  merchants in the costume of their countries lombard spanish dutch or french were walking away in pairs attended by servants from their exchange likewise in the nave  women some alone some protected by servingmen or apprentices were returning from their orisons or it might be from their gossipings  priests and friars as usual pervaded everything and round the open space were galleried buildings with stalls beneath them whence the holders were removing their wares for the night  the great octagonal structure of pauls cross stood in the centre and just beneath the stone pulpit where the sermons were wont to be preached stood a man with a throng round him declaiming a ballad at the top of his singsong voice and causing much loud laughter by some ribaldry about monks and friars  master headley turned aside as quickly as he could through paternoster row which was full of stalls where little black books and larger sheets printed in blackletter seemed the staple commodities and thence the burgess keeping a heedful eye on his young companions among all his greetings entered the broader space of cheapside where numerous prentice lads seemed to be playing at different sports after the labours of the day  passing under an archway surmounted by a dragon with shining scales master headley entered a paved courtyard where the lads started at the figures of two knights in full armour their lances in rest and their horses with housings down to their hoofs apparently about to charge any intruder  but at that moment there was a shriek of joy and out from the scarlet and azure petticoats of the nearest steed there darted a little girl crying father father and in an instant she was lifted in master headleys arms and was clinging round his neck while he kissed and blessed her and as he set her on her feet he said here dennet greet thy cousin giles headley and these two brave young gentlemen  greet them like a courteous maiden or they will think thee a little town mouse  in truth the child had a pointed little visage and bright brown eyes somewhat like a mouse but it was a very sweet face that she lifted obediently to be kissed not only by the kinsman but by the two guests  her father meantime was answering with nods to the respectful welcomes of the workmen who thronged out below and their wives looking down from the galleries above while poppet and the other horses were being rubbed down after their journey  the groundfloor of the buildings surrounding the oblong court seemed to be entirely occupied by forges workshops warehouses and stables  above were open railed galleries with outside stairs at intervals giving access to the habitations of the workpeople on three sides  the fourth opposite to the entrance had a much handsomer broad stone stair adorned on one side with a stone figure of the princess fleeing from the dragon and on the other of st george piercing the monsters open mouth with his lance the scaly convolutions of the two dragons forming the supports of the handrail on either side  here stood cap in hand showing his thick curly hair and with open front displaying a huge hairy chest a giant figure whom his master greeted as kit smallbones inquiring whether all had gone well during his absence  tis time you were back sir for theres a great tilting match on hand for the lady marys wedding  here have been half the gentlemen in the court after you and my lord of buckingham sent twice for you since sunday and once for tibble steelman and his squire swore that if you were not at his bidding before noon tomorrow he would have his new suit of master hillyer of the eagle  he shall see me when it suiteth me said mr headley coolly  he wotteth well that hillyer hath none who can burnish plate armour like tibble here  moreover the last iron we had from that knave mepham is nought  it works short under the hammer  that shall be seen to kit  the rest of the budget tomorrow  i must on to my mother  for at the doorway at the head of the stairs there stood the still trim and active figure of an old woman with something of the mouse likeness seen in her granddaughter in the close cap high hat and cloth dress that sumptuary opinion if not law prescribed for the burgher matron a white apron silver chain and bunch of keys at her girdle  due and loving greetings passed between mother and son after the longest and most perilous absence of master headleys life and he then presented giles to whom the kindly dame offered hand and cheek saying welcome my young kinsman your good father was well known and liked here  may you tread in his steps  thanks good mistress returned giles  i am thought to have a pretty taste in the fancy part of the trade  my lord of montagu  before he could get any farther mistress headley was inquiring what was the rumour she had heard of robbers and dangers that had beset her son and he was presenting the two young birkenholts to her brave boys good boys she said holding out her hands and kissing each according to the custom of welcome you have saved my son for me and this little ones father for her  kiss them dennet and thank them  it was the poor dog said the child in a clear little voice drawing back with a certain quaint coquetting shyness i would rather kiss him  would that thou couldst little mistress said stephen  my poor brave spring  was he thine own  tell me all about him said dennet somewhat imperiously  she stood between the two strangers looking eagerly up with sorrowfully interested eyes while stephen out of his full heart told of his faithful comradeship with his hound from the infancy of both  her father meanwhile was exchanging serious converse with her grandmother and giles finding himself left in the background began  come hither pretty coz and i will tell thee of my lady of salisburys dainty little hounds  i care not for dainty little hounds returned dennet i want to hear of the poor faithful dog that flew at the wicked robber  a mighty stir about a mere chance muttered giles  i know what you did said dennet turning her bright brown eyes full upon him  you took to your heels  her look and little nod were so irresistibly comical that the two brothers could not help laughing whereupon giles headley turned upon them in a passion  what mean ye by this insolence you beggars brats picked up on the heath  better born than thou braggart and coward that thou art broke forth stephen while master headley exclaimed how now lads  no brawling here  three voices spoke at once  they were insolent  he reviled our birth  father they did but laugh when i told cousin giles that he took to his heels and he must needs call them beggars brats picked up on the heath  ha ha wench thou art woman enough already to set them together by the ears said her father laughing  see here giles headley none who bears my name shall insult a stranger on my hearth  stephen however had stepped forth holding out his small stock of coin and saying sir receive for our charges and let us go to the tavern we passed anon  how now boy  said i not ye were my guests  yea sir and thanks but we can give no cause for being called beggars nor beggars brats  what beggary is there in being guests my young gentlemen said the master of the house  if any one were picked up on the heath it was i  we owned you for gentlemen of blood and coat armour and thy brother there can tell thee that ye have no right to put an affront on me your host because a rude prentice from a country town hath not learnt to rule his tongue  giles scowled but the armourer spoke with an authority that imposed on all and stephen submitted while ambrose spoke a few words of thanks after which the two brothers were conducted by an external stair and gallery to a guestchamber in which to prepare for supper  the room was small but luxuriously filled beyond all ideas of the young foresters for it was hung with tapestry representing the history of joseph the bed was curtained there was a carved chest for clothes a table and a ewer and basin of bright brass with the armourers mark upon it a twist in which the letter h and the dragons tongue and tail were ingeniously blended  the city was far in advance of the country in all the arts of life and only the more magnificent castles and abbeys which the boys had never seen possessed the amount of comforts to be found in the dwellings of the superior class of londoners  stephen was inclined to look with contempt upon the effeminacy of a churl merchant  no churl returned ambrose if manners makyth man as we saw at winchester  then what do they make of that cowardly clown his cousin  ambrose laughed but said prove we our gentle blood at least by not brawling with the fellow  master headley will soon teach him to know his place  that will matter nought to us  tomorrow shall we be with our uncle hal  i only wish his lord was not of the ghostly sort but perhaps he may prefer me to some great knights service  but oh ambrose come and look  see  the fellow they call smallbones is come out to the fountain in the middle of the court with a bucket in each hand  look  didst ever see such a giant  he is as big and brawny as ascapart at the bargate at southampton  see he lifts that big pail full and brimming as though it were an egg shell  see his arm  twere good to see him wield a hammer  i must look into his smithy before going forth tomorrow  stephen clenched his fist and examined his muscles ere donning his best mourning jerkin and could scarce be persuaded to complete his toilet so much was he entertained with the comings and goings in the court a little world in itself like a college quadrangle  the days work was over the forges out and the smiths were lounging about at ease one or two sitting on a bench under a large elmtree beside the central well enjoying each his tankard of ale  a few more were watching poppet being combed down and conversing with the newlyarrived grooms  one was carrying a little child in his arms and a young man and maid sitting on the low wall round the well seemed to be carrying on a courtship over the pitcher that stood waiting to be filled  two lads were playing at skittles children were running up and down the stairs and along the wooden galleries and men and women went and came by the entrance gateway between the two effigies of knights in armour  some were servants bringing helm or gauntlet for repair or taking the like away  some might be known by their flat caps to be apprentices and two substantial burgesses walked in together as if to greet master headley on his return  immediately after a mancook appeared with white cap and apron bearing aloft a covered dish surrounded by a steamy cloud followed by other servants bearing other meats a big bell began to sound the younger men and apprentices gathered together and the brothers descended the stairs and entered by the big door into the same large hall where they had been received  the spacious hearth was full of green boughs with a beaupot of wild rose honeysuckle clove pinks and gilliflowers the lower parts of the walls were hung with tapestry representing the adventures of st george the mullioned windows had their upper squares filled with glass bearing the shield of the city of london that of the armourers company the rose and portcullis of the king the pomegranate of queen catharine and other like devices  others belonging to the lancastrian kings adorned the pendants from the handsome open roof and the front of a gallery for musicians which crossed one end of the hall in the taste of the times of henry v and whittington  far more interesting to the hungry travellers was it that the long table running the whole breadth of the apartment was decked with snowy linen trenchers stood ready with horns or tankards beside them and loaves of bread at intervals while the dishes were being placed on the table  the master and his entire establishment took their meals together except the married men who lived in the quadrangle with their families  there was no division by the salt cellar as at the tables of the nobles and gentry but the master his family and guests occupied the centre with the hearth behind them where the choicest of the viands were placed next after them were the places of the journeymen according to seniority then those of the apprentices household servants and stablemen but the apprentices had to assist the servingmen in waiting on the master and his party before sitting down themselves  there was a dignity and regularity about the whole which could not fail to impress stephen and ambrose with the weight and importance of a london burgher warden of the armourers company and alderman of the ward of cheap  there were carved chairs for himself his mother and the guests also a small persian carpet extending from the hearth beyond their seats  this article filled the two foresters with amazement to put ones feet on what ought to be a coverlet  they would not have stepped on it had they not been kindly summoned by old mistress headley to take their places among the company which consisted besides the family of the two citizens who had entered and of a priest who had likewise dropped in to welcome master headleys return and had been invited to stay to supper  young giles as a matter of course placed himself amongst them at which there were black looks and whispers among the apprentices and even mistress headley wore an air of amazement  mother said the head of the family speaking loud enough for all to hear you will permit our young kinsman to be placed as our guest this evening  tomorrow he will act as an apprentice as we all have done in our time  i never did so at home cried giles in his loud hasty voice  i trow not dryly observed one of the guests  giles however went on muttering while the priest was pronouncing a latin grace and thereupon the same burgess observed never did i see it better proved that folk in the country give their sons no good breeding  have patience with him good master pepper returned mr headley he hath been an only son greatly cockered by father mother and sisters but ere long he will learn what is befiting  giles glared round but he met nothing encouraging  little dennet sat with open mouth of astonishment her grandmother looked shocked the household which had been aggrieved by his presumption laughed at his rebuke for there was not much delicacy in those days but something generous in the gentle blood of ambrose moved him to some amount of pity for the lad who thus suddenly became conscious that the tie he had thought nominal at salisbury a mere preliminary to municipal rank was here absolute subjection and a bondage whence there was no escape  his was the only face that giles met which had any friendliness in it but no one spoke for manners imposed silence upon youth at table except when spoken to and there was general hunger enough prevailing to make mistress headleys fat capon the most interesting contemplation for the present  the elders conversed for there was much for master headley to hear of civic affairs that had passed in his absence of two months also of all the comings and goings and it was ascertained that my lord archbishop of york was at his suburban abode york house now whitehall  it was a very late supper for the times not beginning till seven oclock on account of the travellers and as soon as it was finished and the priest and burghers had taken their leave master headley dismissed the household to their beds although daylight was scarcely departed    chapter vi  a sunday in the city    the rod of heaven has touched them all    the word from heaven is spoken rise shine and sing thou captive thrall    are not thy fetters broken  keble   on sunday morning when the young birkenholts awoke the whole air seemed full of bells from hundreds of church and minster steeples the dragon court wore a holiday air and there was no ring of hammers at the forges but the men who stood about were in holiday attire  and the brothers assumed their best clothes  breakfast was not a meal much accounted of  it was reckoned effeminate to require more than two meals a day though just as in the verdurers lodge at home there was a barrel of ale on tap with drinking horns beside it in the hall and on a small round table in the window a loaf of bread to which city luxury added a cheese and a jug containing sack with some silver cups beside it and a pitcher of fair water  master headley with his mother and daughter was taking a morsel of these refections standing and in outdoor garments when the brothers appeared at about seven oclock in the morning  ha thats well quoth he greeting them  no slugabeds i see will ye come with us to hear mass at st faiths  they agreed and master headley then told them that if they would tarry till the next day in searching out their uncle they could have the company of tibble steelman who had to see one of the captains of the guard about an alteration of his corslet and thus would have every opportunity of facilitating their inquiries for their uncle  the mass was an ornate one though not more so than they were accustomed to at beaulieu  ambrose had his book of devotions supplied by the good monks who had brought him up and old mrs headley carried something of the same kind but these did not necessarily follow the ritual and neither quiet nor attention was regarded as requisite in hearing mass  dennet unchecked was exchanging flowers from her sunday posy with another little girl and with hooded fingers carrying on in all innocence the satirical pantomime of father francis and sister catharine and even master headley himself exchanged remarks with his friends and returned greetings from burgesses and their wives while the celebrant priests voice droned on and the choir respondedthe peals of the organ in the minster above coming in at inappropriate moments for there they were in a different part of high mass using the liturgy peculiar to st pauls  thinking of last week at beaulieu ambrose knelt meantime with his head buried in his hands in an absorption of feeling that was not perhaps wholly devout but which at any rate looked more like devotion than the demeanour of any one around  when the ite missa est was pronounced and all rose up stephen touched him and he rose looking about bewildered  so please you young sir i can show you another sort of thing by and by said in his ear tibble steelman who had come in late and marked his attitude  they went up from st faiths in a flood of talk with all manner of people welcoming master headley after his journey and thence came back to dinner which was set out in the hall very soon after their return from church  quite guests enough were there on this occasion to fill all the chairs and master headley intimated to giles that he must begin his duties at table as an apprentice under the tuition of the senior a tall young fellow of nineteen by name edmund burgess  he looked greatly injured and discomfited above all when he saw his two travelling companions seated at the table though far lower than the night before nor would he stir from where he was standing against the wall to do the slightest service although edmund admonished him sharply that unless he bestirred himself it would be the worse for him  when the meal was over and grace had been said the boards were removed from their trestles and the elders drew round the small table in the window with a flagon of sack and a plate of wastel bread in their midst to continue their discussion of weighty town council matters  every one was free to make holiday and edmund burgess goodnaturedly invited the strangers to come to mile end where there was to be shooting at the butts and a match at singlestick was to come off between kit smallbones and another giant who was regarded as the champion of the brewers craft  stephen was nothing loth especially if he might take his own crossbow but ambrose never had much turn for these pastimes and was in no mood for them  the familiar associations of the mass had brought the grief of orphanhood homelessness and uncertainty upon him with the more force  his spirit yearned after his father and his heart was sick for his forest home  moreover there was the duty incumbent on a good son of saying his prayers for the repose of his fathers soul  he hinted as much to stephen who boylike answered oh well see to that when we get into my lord of yorks house  masses must be plenty there  and i must see smallbones floor the brewer  ambrose could trust his brother under the care of edmund burgess and resolved on a double amount of repetitions of the appointed intercessions for the departed  he was watching the party of youths set off all except giles headley who sulkily refused the invitations betook himself to a window and sat drumming on the glass while ambrose stood leaning on the dragon balustrade with his eyes dreamily following the merry lads out at the gateway  you are not for such gear sir said a voice at his ear and he saw the scathed face of tibble steelman beside him  never greatly so tibble answered ambrose  and my heart is too heavy for it now  ay ay sir  so i thought when i saw you in st faiths  i have known what it was to lose a good father in my time  ambrose held out his hand  it was the first really sympathetic word he had heard since he had left nurse joan  tis the weeks mind of his burial he said half choked with tears  where shall i find a quiet church where i may say his de profundis in peace  mayhap returned tibble the chapel in the pardon churchyard would serve your turn  tis not greatly resorted to when mass time is over when theres no funeral in hand and i oft go there to read my book in quiet on a sunday afternoon  and then if tis your will i will take you to what to my mind is the best healing for a sore heart  nurse joan was wont to say the best for that was a sight of the true cross as she once beheld it at holy rood church at southampton said ambrose  and so it is lad so it is said tibble with a strange light on his distorted features  so they went forth together while giles again hugged himself in his doleful conceit marvelling how a youth of birth and nurture could walk the streets on a sunday with a scarecrow such as that  the hour was still early there was a whole summer afternoon before them and tibble seeing how much his young companion was struck with the grand vista of church towers and spires gave him their names as they stood though coupling them with short dry comments on the way in which their priests too often perverted them  the cheap was then still in great part an open space where boys were playing and a tumbler was attracting many spectators while the balladsinger of yesterday had again a large audience who laughed loudly at every coarse jest broken upon masspriests and friars  ambrose was horrified at the stave that met his ears and asked how such profanity could be allowed  tibble shrugged his shoulders and cited the old saying the nearer the churchadding truth hath a voice and will out  but surely this is not the truth  tis mighty like it sir though it might be spoken in a more seemly fashion  whats this demanded ambrose  tis a noble house  thats the bishops palace sira man that hath much to answer for  liveth he so ill a life then  not so  he is no scandalous liver but he would fain stifle all the voices that call for better things  ay you look back at yon balladmonger  great folk despise the like of him never guessing at the power there may be in such ribald stuff while they would fain silence that which might turn men from their evil ways while yet there is time  tibble muttered this to himself unheeded by ambrose and then presently crossing the churchyard where a grave was being filled up with numerous idle children around it he conducted the youth into a curious little chapel empty now but with the host enthroned above the altar and the trestles on which the bier had rested still standing in the narrow nave  it was intensely still and cool a fit place indeed for ambroses filial devotions while tibble settled himself on the step took out a little black book and became absorbed  ambroses latin scholarship enabled him to comprehend the language of the round of devotions he was rehearsing for the benefit of his fathers soul but there was much repetition in them and he had been so trained as to believe their correct recital was much more important than attention to their spirit and thus while his hands held his rosary his eyes were fixed upon the walls where was depicted the dance of death  in terrible repetition the artist had aimed at depicting every rank or class in life as alike the prey of the grisly phantom  triplecrowned pope scarlethatted cardinal mitred prelate priests monks and friars of every degree emperors kings princes nobles knights squires yeomen every sort of trade soldiers of all kinds beggars even thieves and murderers and in like manner ladies of every degree from the queen and the abbess down to the starving beggar were each represented as grappled with and carried off by the crowned skeleton  there was no truckling to greatness  the bishop and abbot writhed and struggled in the grasp of death while the miser clutched at his gold and if there were some nuns and some poor ploughmen who willingly clasped his bony fingers and obeyed his summons joyfully there were countesses and prioresses who tried to beat him off or implored him to wait  the infant smiled in his arms but the middleaged fought against his scythe  the contemplation had a most depressing effect on the boy whose heart was still sore for his father  after the sudden shock of such a loss the monotonous repetition of the snatching away of all alike in the midst of their characteristic worldly employments and the anguish and hopeless resistance of most of them struck him to the heart  he moved between each bead to a fresh group staring at it with fixed gaze while his lips moved in the unconscious hope of something consoling till at last hearing some uncontrollable sobs tibble steelman rose and found him crouching rather than kneeling before the figure of an emaciated hermit who was greeting the summons of the king of terrors with crucifix pressed to his breast rapt countenance and outstretched arms seeing only the angel who hovered above  after some minutes of bitter weeping which choked his utterance ambrose feeling a friendly hand on his shoulder exclaimed in a voice broken by sobs oh tell me where may i go to become an anchorite  theres no other safety  ill give all my portion and spend all my time in prayer for my father and the other poor souls in purgatory  two centuries earlier nay even one ambrose would have been encouraged to follow out his purpose  as it was tibble gave a little dry cough and said come along with me sir and ill show you another sort of way  i want no entertainment said ambrose i should feel only as if he pointing to the phantom were at hand clutching me with his deadly claw and he looked over his shoulder with a shudder  there was a box by the door to receive alms for masses on behalf of the souls in purgatory and here he halted and felt for the pouch at his girdle to pour in all the contents but steelman said hold sir are you free to dispose of your brothers share you who are pursebearer for both  i would fain hold my brother to the only path of safety  again tibble gave his dry cough but added he is not in the path of safety who bestows that which is not his own but is held in trust  i were foully to blame if i let this grim portrayal so work on you as to lead you to beggar not only yourself but your brother with no consent of his  for tibble was no impulsive italian but a soberminded englishman of sturdy good sense and ambrose was reasonable enough to listen and only drop in a few groats which he knew to be his own  at the same moment a church bell was heard the tone of which steelman evidently distinguished from all the others and he led the way out of the pardon churchyard over the space in front of st pauls  many persons were taking the same route citizens in gowns and gold or silver chains their wives in tall pointed hats craftsmen blackgowned scholarly men with fur caps but there was a much more scanty proportion of priests monks or friars than was usual in any popular assemblage  many of the better class of women carried folding stools or had them carried by their servants as if they expected to sit and wait  is there a procession toward or a relic to be displayed asked ambrose trying to recollect whose feastday it might be  tibble screwed up his mouth in an extraordinary smile as he said relic quotha yea the soothest relic there be of the lord and master of us all  methought the true cross was always displayed on the high altar said ambrose as all turned to a side aisle of the noble nave  rather say hidden muttered tibble  thou shalt have it displayed young sir but neither in wood nor gilded shrine  see here he comes who setteth it forth  from the choir came attended by half a dozen clergy a small pale man in the ordinary dress of a priest with a square cap on his head  he looked spare sickly and wrinkled but the furrows traced lines of sweetness his mouth was wonderfully gentle and there was a keen brightness about his clear grey eye  every one rose and made obeisance as he passed along to the stone stair leading to a pulpit projecting from one of the columns  ambrose saw what was coming though he had only twice before heard preaching  the children of the antereformation were not called upon to hear sermons and the few exhortations given in lent to the monks of beaulieu were so exclusively for the religious that seculars were not invited to them  so that ambrose had only once heard a weary and heavy discourse there plentifully garnished with latin and once he had stood among the throng at a wake at millbrook and heard a begging friar recommend the purchase of briefs of indulgence and the daily repetition of the ave maria by a series of extraordinary miracles for the rescue of desperate sinners related so jocosely as to keep the crowd in a roar of laughter  he had laughed with the rest but he could not imagine his guide with the stern grave eyebrows writhen features and earnest ironical tone coveringas even he could detectthe deepest feeling enjoying such broad sallies as tickled the slow merriment of village clowns and forest deerstealers  all stood for a moment while the paternoster was repeated  then the owners of stools sat down on them some leant on adjacent pillars others curled themselves on the floor but most remained on their feet as unwilling to miss a word and of these were tibble steelman and his companion  omnis qui facit peccatum servus est peccati followed by the rendering in english whosoever doeth sin is sins bond thrall the words answered well to the ghastly delineations that seemed stamped on ambroses brain and which followed him about into the nave so that he felt himself in the grasp of the cruel fiend and almost expected to feel the skeleton claw of death about to hand him over to torment  he expected the consolation of hearing that a daily hail mary persevered in through the foulest life would obtain that beams should be arrested in their fall ships fail to sink cords to hang till such confession had been made as should insure ultimate salvation after such a proportion of the flames of purgatory as masses and prayers might not mitigate  but his attention was soon caught  sinfulness stood before him not as the liability to penalty for transgressing an arbitrary rule but as a taint to the entire being mastering the will perverting the senses forging fetters out of habit so as to be a loathsome horror paralysing and enchaining the whole being and making it into the likeness of him who brought sin and death into the world  the horror seemed to grow on ambrose as his boyish faults and errors rushed on his mind and he felt pervaded by the contagion of the pestilence abhorrent even to himself  but behold what was he hearing now  the bond thrall abideth not in the house for ever but the son abideth ever  si ergo filius liberavit vere liberi eritis  if the son should make you free then are ye free indeed  and for the first time was the true liberty of the redeemed soul comprehensibly proclaimed to the young spirit that had begun to yearn for something beyond the outside  light began to shine through the outward ordinances the church the world life and death were revealed as something absolutely new a redeeming cleansing sanctifying power was made known and seemed to inspire him with a new life joy and hope  he was no longer feeling himself necessarily crushed by the fetters of death or only delivered from absolute peril by a mechanism that had lost its heart but he could enter into the glorious liberty of the sons of god in process of being saved not in sin but from sin  it was an era in his life and tibble heard him sobbing but with very different sobs from those in the pardon chapel  when it was over and the blessing given ambrose looked up from the hands which had covered his face with a new radiance in his eyes and drew a long breath  tibble saw that he was like one in another world and gently led him away  who is he  what is he  is he an angel from heaven demanded the boy a little wildly as they neared the southern door  if an angel be a messenger of god i trow he is one said tibble but men call him dr colet  he is dean of st pauls minster and dwelleth in the house you see below there  and are such words as these to be heard every sunday  on most sundays doth he preach here in the nave to all sorts of folk  i musti must hear it again exclaimed ambrose  ay ay said tibble regarding him with a wellpleased face  you are one with whom it works  every sunday repeated ambrose  why do not allyour master and all these pointing to the holiday crowds going to and frowhy do they not all come to listen  master doth come by times said tibble in the tone of irony that was hard to understand  he owneth the dean as a rare preacher  ambrose did not try to understand  he exclaimed again panting as if his thoughts were too strong for his wordslo you that preacherdean call ye himputteth a soul into what hath hitherto been to me but a dead and empty framework  tibble held out his hand almost unconsciously and ambrose pressed it  man and boy alike they had felt the electric current of that truth which suppressed and ignored among mans inventions was coming as a new revelation to many and was already beginning to convulse the church and the world  ambroses mind was made up on one point  whatever he did and wherever he went he felt the doctrine he had just heard as needful to him as vital air and he must be within reach of it  this and not the hermits cell was what his instinct craved  he had always been a studious scholarly boy supposed to be marked out for a clerical life because a book was more to him than a bow and he had been easily trained in good habits and practices of devotion but all in a childish manner without going beyond simple receptiveness until the experiences of the last week had made a man of him or more truly the pardon chapel and dean colets sermon had made him a new being with the realities of the inner life opened before him  his present feeling was relief from the hideous load he had felt while dwelling on the dance of death and therewith general goodwill to all men which found its first issue in compassion for giles headley whom he found on his return seated on the stepsmoody and miserable  would that you had been with us said ambrose sitting down beside him on the step  never have i heard such words as today  i would not be seen in the street with that scarecrow murmured giles  if my mother could have guessed that he was to be set over me i had never come here  surely you knew that he was foreman  yea but not that i should be under himi whom old giles vowed should be as his own soni that am to wed yon little brown moppet and be master here  so forsooth he said now he treats me like any common lowbred prentice  nay said ambrose an if you were his son he would still make you serve  its the way with all craftsmenyea and with gentlemens sons also  they must be pages and squires ere they can be knights  it never was the way at home  i was only bound prentice to my father for the name of the thing that i might have the freedom of the city and become head of our house  but how could you be a wise master without learning the craft  what are journeymen for demanded the lad  had i known how giles headley meant to serve me he might have gone whistle for a husband for his wench  i would have ridden in my lady of salisburys train  you might have had rougher usage there than here said ambrose master headley lays nothing on you but what he has himself proved i would i could see you make the best of so happy a home  ay thats all very well for you who are certain of a great mans house  would that i were certified that my brother would be as well off as you if you did but know it said ambrose  ha here come the dishes  tis supper time come on us unawares and stephen not returned from mile end  punctuality was not however exacted on these summer sunday evenings when practice with the bow and other athletic sports were enjoined by government and moreover the youths were with so trustworthy a member of the household as kit smallbones  sundry city magnates had come to supper with master headley and whether it were the effect of ambroses counsel or of the example of a handsome lad who had come with his father one of the worshipful guild of merchant taylors giles did vouchsafe to bestir himself in waiting and in consideration of the effort it must have cost him old mrs headley and her son did not take notice of his blunders but only dennet fell into a violent fit of laughter when he presented the stately alderman with a nutmeg under the impression that it was an overgrown peppercorn  she suppressed her mirth as well as she could poor little thing for it was a great offence in good manners but she was detected and only child as she was the consequence was the being banished from the table and sent to bed  but when after supper was over ambrose went out to see if there were any signs of the return of stephen and the rest he found the little maiden curled up in the gallery with her kitten in her arms  nay she said in a spoiltchild tone im not going to bed before my time for laughing at that great oaf  nurse alice says he is to wed me but i wont have him  i like the pretty boy who had the good dog and saved father and i like you master ambrose  sit down by me and tell me the story over again and we shall see kit smallbones come home  i know hell have beaten the brewers fellow  before ambrose had decided whether thus far to abet rebellion she jumped up and cried  oh i see kit  hes got my ribbon  he has won the match  and down she rushed quite oblivious of her disgrace and ambrose presently saw her uplifted in kit smallbones brawny arms to utter her congratulations  stephen was equally excited  his head was full of kit smallbones exploits and of the marvels of the sports he had witnessed and joined in with fair success  he had thought londoners poor effeminate creatures but he found that these youths preparing for the trained bands understood all sorts of martial exercises far better than any of his forest acquaintance save perhaps the hitting of a mark  he was half wild with a boys enthusiasm for kit smallbones and edmund burgess and when after eating the supper that had been reserved for the late comers he and his brother repaired to their own chamber his tongue ran on in description of the feats he had witnessed and his hopes of emulating them since he understood that archbishop as was my lord of york there was a tilt yard at york house  ambrose equally full of his new feelings essayed to make his brother a sharer in them but stephen entirely failed to understand more than that his bookworm brother had heard something that delighted him in his own line of scholarship from which stephen had happily escaped a year ago    chapter vii  york house    then hath he servants five or six score some behind and some before a marvellous great company of which are lords and gentlemen with many grooms and yeomen and also knaves among them  contemporary poem on wolsey   early were hammers ringing on anvils in the dragon court and all was activity  master headley was giving his orders to kit smallbones before setting forth to take the duke of buckinghams commands giles headley very much disgusted was being invested with a leathern apron and entrusted to edmund burgess to learn those primary arts of furbishing which but for his mothers vanity and his fathers weakness he would have practised four years sooner  tibble steelman was superintending the arrangement of half a dozen corslets which were to be carried by three stout porters under his guidance to what is now whitehall then the residence of the archbishop of york the kings prime adviser thomas wolsey  look you tib said the kindhearted armourer if those lads find not their kinsman or find him not what they look for bring them back hither i cannot have them cast adrift  they are good and brave youths and i owe a life to them  tibble nodded entire assent but when the boys appeared in their mourning suits with their bundles on their backs they were sent back again to put on their forest green master headley explaining that it was reckoned illomened if not insulting to appear before any great personage in black unless to enhance some petition directly addressed to himself  he also bade them leave their fardels behind as if they tarried at york house these could be easily sent after them  they obeyedeven stephen doing so with more alacrity than he had hitherto shown to master headleys behests for now that the time for departure had come he was really sorry to leave the armourers household  edmund burgess had been very goodnatured to the raw country lad and kit smallbones was in his eyes an ascapart in strength and a bevis in prowess and kindliness  mistress headley too had been kind to the orphan lads and these two days had given a feeling of being at home at the dragon  when giles wished them a moody farewell and wished he were going with them stephen returned ah you dont know when you are well off  little dennet came running down after them with two pinks in her hands  heres a sopinwine for a token for each of you young gentlemen she cried for you came to help father and i would you were going to stay and wed me instead of giles  what both of us little maid said ambrose laughing as he stooped to receive the kiss her rosy lips tendered to him  not but what she would have royal example muttered tibble aside  dennet put her head on one side as considering  nay not both but you are gentle and courteous and he is brave and gallantand giles there is moody and glum and can do nought  ah you will see what a gallant fellow giles can be when thou hast cured him of his homesickness by being good to him said ambrose sorry for the youth in the universal laughter at the childs plain speaking  and thus the lads left the dragon amid friendly farewells  ambrose looked up at the tall spire of st pauls with a strong determination that he would never put himself out of reach of such words as he had there drunk in and which were indeed spirit and life to him  tibble took them down to the st pauls stairs on the river where at his whistle a wherry was instantly brought to transport them to york stairs only one of the smiths going any further in charge of the corslets  very lovely was their voyage in the brilliant summer morning as the glittering water reflected in broken ripples church spire convent garden and stately house  here rows of elmtrees made a cool walk by the river side there strawberry beds sloped down the strand and now and then the hooded figures of nuns might be seen gathering the fruit  there rose the round church of the temple and the beautiful gardens surrounding the buildings half monastic half military and already inhabited by lawyers  from a barge at the temple stairs a legal personage descended with a square beard and open benevolent shrewd face before whom tibble removed his cap with eagerness saying to ambrose yonder is master more a close friend of the deans a good and wise man and forward in every good work  thus did they arrive at york house  workmen were busy on some portions of it but it was inhabited by the great archbishop the kings chief adviser  the approach of the boat seemed to be instantly notified as it drew near the stone steps giving entrance to the gardens with an avenue of trees leading up to the principal entrance  four or five yeomen ran down the steps calling out to tibble that their corslets had tarried a long time and that sir thomas drury had been storming for him to get his tilting armour into order  tibble followed the man who had undertaken to conduct him through a path that led to the offices of the great house bidding the boys keep with him and asking for their uncle master harry randall  the yeoman shook his head  he knew no such person in the household and did not think there ever had been such  sir thomas drury was found in the stable court trying the paces of the horse he intended to use in the approaching joust  ha old wrymouth he cried welcome at last  i must have my new device damasked on my shield come hither and ill show it thee  private rooms were seldom enjoyed even by knights and gentlemen in such a household and sir thomas could only conduct tibble to the armoury where numerous suits of armour hung on blocks presenting the semblance of armed men  the knight a goodlooking personage expatiated much on the device he wished to dedicate to his lady love a pierced heart with a forgetmenot in the midst and it was not until the directions were finished that tibble ventured to mention the inquiry for randall  i wot of no such fellow returned sir thomas you had best go to the comptroller who keeps all the names  tibble had to go to this functionary at any rate to obtain an order for payment for the corslets he had brought home  ambrose and stephen followed him across an enormous hall where three long tables were being laid for dinner  the comptroller of the household an esquire of good birth with a stiff little ruff round his neck sat in a sort of office inclosed by panels at the end of the hall  he made an entry of tibbles account in a big book and sent a message to the cofferer to bring the amount  then tibble again put his question on behalf of the two young foresters and the comptroller shook his head  he did not know the name  was the gentleman he chose that word as he looked at the boys layman or clerk  layman certainly said ambrose somewhat dismayed to find how little on interrogation he really knew  was he a yeoman of the guard or in attendance on one of my lords nobles in waiting  we thought he had been a yeoman said ambrose  see said the comptroller stimulated by a fee administered by tibble tis just dinner time and i must go to attend on my lord archbishop but do you tibble sit down with these striplings to dinner and then i will cast my eye over the books and see if i can find any such name  what hast not time  none ever quits my lords without breaking his fast  tibble had no doubt that his master would be willing that he should give up his time for this purpose so he accepted the invitation the tables were by this time nearly covered but all stood waiting for there flowed in from the great doorway of the hall a gorgeous trainfirst a man bearing the double archiepiscopal cross of york fashioned in silver and thick with gemsthen with lofty mitre enriched with pearls and jewels and with flowing violet lace covered robes came the sturdy squarefaced ruddy prelate who was then the chief influence in england and after him two glittering ranks of priests in square caps and richly embroidered copes all in accordant colours  they were returning as a yeoman told tibble from some great ecclesiastical ceremony and dinner would be served instantly  that for which ralf bowyer lives said a voice close by he would fain that the dials hands were marie bones the face blancmange wherein the figures should be grapes of corinth  stephen looked round and saw a man close beside him in what he knew at once to be the garb of a jester  a tall scarlet velvet cap with three peaks bound with gold braid and each surmounted with a little gilded bell crowned his head a small crimson ridge to indicate the cocks comb running along the front  his jerkin and hose were of motley the left arm and right leg being blue their opposites orange tawny while the nether stocks and shoes were in like manner black and scarlet counterchanged  and yet somehow whether from the way of wearing it or from the effect of the gold embroidery meandering over all the effect was not distressing but more like that of a gorgeous bird  the figure was tall lithe and active the brown ruddy face had none of the blank stare of vacant idiocy but was full of twinkling merriment the black eyes laughed gaily and perhaps only so clearsighted and shrewd an observer as tibble would have detected a weakness of purpose about the mouth  there was a roar of laughter at the gibe as indeed there was at whatever was uttered by the man whose profession was to make mirth  thou likest thy food well enough thyself quipsome one muttered ralf  hast found one who doth not ralf  then should he have a free gift of my bauble responded the jester shaking on high that badge surmounted with the golden head of an ass and jingling with bells how now friend wrymouth  tis long since thou wert here  this house hath wellnigh been forced to its ghostly weapons for lack of thy substantial ones  where hast thou been  at salisbury good merryman  have the wilts men raked the moon yet out of the pond  did they lend thee their rake tib that thou hast raked up a couple of green forest palmer worms or be they the sons of the man in the moon raked out and all astray  mayhap for we met them with dog and bush said tibble and they dropped as from the moon to save my poor master from the robbers on bagshot heath  come now mine honest fellow aid me to rake as thou sayest this same household  they are come up from the forest to seek out their uncle one randall who they have heard to be in this meine  knowest thou such a fellow  to seek a spider in a stubblefield  truly he needs my bauble who sent them on such an errand said the jester rather slowly as if to take time for consideration  whats your name my forest flies  birkenholt sir answered ambrose but our uncle is harry randall  heres fools enow to take away mine office was the reply heres a couple of lads would leave the greenwood and the free oaks and beeches for this stinking plaguesmitten london  wed not have quitted it could we have tarried at home began ambrose but at that moment there was a sudden commotion a trampling of horses was heard outside a loud imperious voice demanded is my lord archbishop within a whisper ran round the king and there entered the hall with hasty steps a figure never to be forgotten clad in a hunting dress of green velvet embroidered with gold with a golden hunting horn slung round his neck  henry viii was then in the splendid prime of his youth in his twentyseventh year and in the eyes not only of his own subjects but of all others the very type of a true king of men  tall and as yet of perfect form for strength agility and grace his features were of the beautiful straight plantagenet type and his complexion of purely fair rosiness his large wellopened blue eyes full at once of frankness and keenness and the short golden beard that fringed his square chin giving the manly air that otherwise might have seemed wanting to the feminine tinting of his regular lineaments  all caps were instantly doffed save the little bonnet with one drooping feather that covered his short curled yellow hair and the earl of derby who was at the head of wolseys retainers made haste bowing to the ground to assure him that my lord archbishop was but doffing his robes and would be with his grace instantly  would his grace vouchsafe to come on to the privy chamber where the dinner was spread  at the same moment quipsome hal sprang forward exclaiming how now brother and namesake  wherefore this coil  hath cloth of gold wearied yet of cloth of frieze  is she willing to own her right to this as he held out his bauble  holla old blister art thou there said the king good humouredly  what knowest not that we are to have such a wedding as will be a sight for sore eyes  sore thats well said friend hal  thou art making progress in mine art  sore be the eyes wherein thou wouldst throw dust  again the king laughed for every one knew that his sister mary had secretly been married to the duke of suffolk for the last two months and that this public marriage and the tournament that was to follow were only for the sake of appearances  he laid his hand goodnaturedly on the jesters shoulder as he walked up the hall towards the archbishops private apartments but the voices of both were loud pitched and bits of the further conversation could be picked up  weddings are rife in your family said the jester none of you get weary of fitting on the noose  what thou thyself hal  ay thou hast not caught the contagion yet  now ye gods forefend  if thou hast the chance thoult have it strong  therewith the archbishop in his purple robes appeared in the archway at the other end of the hall the king joined him and still followed by the jester they both vanished  it was presently made known that the king was about to dine there and that all were to sit down to eat  the king dined alone with the archbishop as his host the two noblemen who had formed his suite joined the first table in the higher hall the knights that of the steward of the household who was of knightly degree and with whom the superior clergy of the household ate and the grooms found their places among the vast array of yeomen and servingmen of all kinds with whom tibble and his two young companions had to eat  a week ago stephen would have contemned the idea of being classed with servingmen and grooms but by this time he was quite bewildered and anxious enough to be thankful to keep near a familiar face on any terms and to feel as if tibble were an old friend though he had only known him for five days  why the king had come had not transpired but there was a whisper that despatches from scotland were concerned in it  the meal was a lengthy one but at last the kings horses were ordered and presently henry came forth with his arm familiarly linked in that of the archbishop whose horse had likewise been made ready that he might accompany the king back to westminster  the jester was close at hand and as a parting shaft he observed while the king mounted his horse friend hal give my brotherly commendations to our madge and tell her that one who weds anguish cannot choose but cry out  wherewith affecting to expect a stroke from the kings whip he doubled himself up performed the contortion now called turning a coachwheel then recovering himself put his hands on his hips and danced wildly on the steps while henry shaking his whip at him laughed at the only too obvious pun for anguish was the english version of angus the title of queen margarets second husband and it was her complaints that had brought him to his counsellor  the jester then much to the annoyance of the two boys thought proper to follow them to the office of the comptroller and as that dignitary read out from his books the name of every henry and of all the varieties of ralf and randolf among the hundred and eighty persons composing the household he kept on making comments  harry hempseed clerk to the kitchen ay hempseed will serve his turn one of these days  walter randall groom of the chamber ah ha my lads if you want a generous uncle who will look after you well there is your man  hell give you the shakings of the napery for largesse and when he is in an openhanded mood will let you lie on the rushes that have served the hall  harry of lambeth yeoman of the stable  he will make you free of all the taverns in eastchepe  and so on accompanying each remark with a pantomime mimicry of the air and gesture of the individual  he showed in a second the contortions of harry weston in drawing the bow and in another the grimaces of henry hope the choir man in producing bass notes or the swelling majesty of randall porcher the crossbearer till it really seemed as if he had shown off the humours of at least a third of the enormous household  stephen had laughed at first but as failure after failure occurred the antics began to weary even him and seem unkind and ridiculous as hope ebbed away and the appalling idea began to grow on him of being cast loose on london without a friend or protector  ambrose felt almost despairing as he heard in vain the last name  he would almost have been willing to own hal the scullion and his hopes rose when he heard of hodge randolph the falconer but alas that same hodge came from yorkshire  and mine uncle was from the new forest in hampshire he said  maybe he went by the name of shirley added stephen tis where his home was  but the comptroller unwilling to begin a fresh search replied at once that the only shirley in the household was a noble esquire of the warwickshire family  you must een come back with me young masters said tibble and see what my master can do for you  stay a bit said the fool  harry of shirley  harry of shirley methinks i could help you to the man if so be as you will deem him worth the finding he added suddenly turning upside down and looking at them standing on the palms of his hands with an indescribable leer of drollery which in a moment dashed all the hopes with which they had turned to him  should you know this minks of yours he added  i think i should said ambrose  i remember best how he used to carry me on his shoulder to cull mistletoe for christmas  ah ha  a proper fellow of his inches now with yellow hair  nay said ambrose i mind that his hair was black and his eyes as black as sloesor as thine own master jester  the jester tumbled over into a more extraordinary attitude than before while stephen said   john was wont to twit us with being akin to gipsy hal  i mean a man sad and grave as the monks of beaulieu said the jester  he they both cried  no indeed  he was foremost in all sports  ah cried stephen mind you not ambrose his teaching us leapfrog and aye leaping over one of us himself with the other in his arms  ah sadly changed sadly changed said the jester standing upright with a most mournful countenance  maybe youd not thank me if i showed him to you young sirs that is if he be the man  nay is he in need or distress cried the brothers  poor hal returned the fool shaking his head with mournfulness in his voice  oh take us to him goodgood jester cried ambrose  we are young and strong  we will work for him  what a couple of lads like you that have come to london seeking for him to befriend youdeserving well my cap for that matter will ye be guided to him broken and souredno more gamesome but a sickly old runagate  of course cried ambrose  he is our mothers brother  we must care for him  master headley will give us work mayhap said stephen turning to tibble  i could clean the furnaces  ah ha  i see fools caps must hang thick as beech masts in the forest cried the fool but his voice was husky and he turned suddenly round with his back to them then cut three or four extraordinary capers after which he observedwell young gentlemen i will see the man i mean and if he be the same and be willing to own you for his nephews he will meet you in the temple gardens at six of the clock this evening close to the rosebush with the flowers in my liverymotley red and white  but how shall we know him  dye think a pair of green caterpillars like you cant be marked unless indeed the gardener crushes you for blighting his roses wherewith the jester quitted the scene walking on his hands with his legs in the air  is he to be trusted asked tibble of the comptroller  assuredly was the answer none hath better wit than quipsome hal when he chooseth to be in earnest  in very deed as i have heard sir thomas more say it needeth a wise man to be fool to my lord of york    chapter viii  quipsome hal    the sweet and bitter fool    will presently appear the one in motley here    the other found out there  shakespeare   there lay the quiet temple gardens on the thames bank cut out in formal walks with flowers growing in the beds of the homely kinds beloved by the english  musk roses honeysuckle and virgins bower climbed on the old grey walls sopsinwine bluebottles bachelors buttons stars of bethlehem and the like filled the borders may thorns were in full sweet blossom and near one another were the two rose bushes one damask and one white provence whence somerset and warwick were said to have plucked their fatal badges while on the opposite side of a broad grassplot was another bush looked on as a great curiosity of the best omen where the roses were streaked with alternate red and white in honour as it were of the union of york and lancaster  by this rosetree stood the two young birkenholts  edmund burgess having by his masters desire shown them the way and passed them in by a word and sign from his master then retired unseen to a distance to mark what became of them they having promised also to return and report of themselves to master headley  they stood together earnestly watching for the coming of the uncle feeling quite uncertain whether to expect a frail old broken man or to find themselves absolutely deluded and made game of by the jester  the gardens were nearly empty for most people were sitting over their suppertables after the business of the day was over and only one or two figures in black gowns paced up and down in conversation  come away ambrose said stephen at last  he only meant to make fools of us  come before he comes to gibe us for having heeded a moment  come i sayheres this man coming to ask us what we are doing here  for a tall wellmade welldressed personage in the black or sad colour of a legal official looking like a prosperous householder or superior artisan was approaching them some attendant as the boys concluded belonging to the temple  they expected to be turned out and ambrose in an apologetic tone began sir we were bidden to meet aa kinsman here  and even so am i was the answer in a grave quiet tone or rather to meet twain  ambrose looked up into a pair of dark eyes and exclaimed stevie stevie tis he  tis uncle hal  ay tis all youre like to have for him answered harry randall enfolding each in his embrace  lad how like thou art to my poor sister  and is she indeed goneand your honest father tooand none left at home but that hunks little john  how and when died she  two years agone come lammastide answered stephen  there was a deadly creeping fever and ague through the forest  we two sickened and ambrose was so like to die that diggory went to the abbey for the priest to housel and anneal him but by the time father simon came he was sound asleep and soon was whole again  but before we were on our legs our blessed mother took the disease and she passed away ere many days were over  then though poor father took not that sickness he never was the same man again and only twelve days after last paschtide he was taken with a fit and never spake again  stephen was weeping by this time and his uncle had a hand on his shoulder and with tears in his eyes threw in ejaculations of pity and affection  ambrose finished the narrative with a broken voice indeed but as one who had more selfcommand than his brother perhaps than his uncle whose exclamations became bitter and angry as he heard of the treatment the boys had experienced from their halfbrother who as he said he had always known as a currish meanspirited churl but scarce such as this  nor do i think he would have been save for his wife maud pratt of hampton said ambrose  nay truly also he deemed that we were only within a days journey of council from our uncle richard at hyde  richard birkenholt was a sturdy old comrade  methinks he would give master jack a piece of his mind  alack good uncle we found him in his dotage and the bursar of hyde made quick work with us for fear good father shoveller said that we were come to look after his corrody  shovellerwhat a shoveller of cranbury  how fell ye in with him  ambrose told the adventures of their journey and randall exclaimed by my baui mean by my faithif ye have illluck in uncles ye have had good luck in friends  no illluck in thee good kind uncle said stephen catching at his hand with the sense of comfort that kindred blood gives  how wottest thou that child  did not ii mean did not merryman tell you that mayhap ye would not be willing to own your uncle  we deemed he was but jesting said stephen  ah  for a sudden twinkle in the black eyes an involuntary twist of the muscles of the face were a sudden revelation to him  he clutched hold of ambrose with a sudden grasp ambrose too looked and recoiled for a moment while the colour spread over his face  yes lads  can you brook the thoughtharry randall is the poor fool  stephen whose composure had already broken down burst into tears again perhaps mostly at the downfall of all his own expectations and glorifications of the kinsman about whom he had boasted ambrose only exclaimed o uncle you must have been hard pressed for indeed the grave almost melancholy man who stood before them regarding them wistfully had little in common with the lithe tumbler full of absurdities whom they had left at york house  even so my good lad  thou art right in that said he gravely harder than i trust will ever be the lot of you two my sweet molls sons  she never guessed that i was come to this  o no said stephen  she always thought thouthou hadst some high preferment in  and so i have said randall with something of his ordinary humour theres no man dares to speak such plain truth to my lordor for that matter to king harry himself save his own jackaleeand he being a fool of natures own making cannot use his chances poor rogue  and so the poor lads came up to london hoping to find a gallant captain who could bring them to high preferment and found nought buttom fool  i could find it in my heart to weep for them and so thou mindest clutching the mistletoe on nunk hals shoulder i warrant it groweth still on the crooked may bush  and is old bobbin alive  they answered his questions but still as if under a great shock and presently he said as they paced up and down the garden walks ay i have been sore bestead and ill tell you how it came about boys and mayhap ye will pardon the poor fool who would not own you sooner lest ye should come in for mockery ye have not learnt to brook  there was a sadness and pleading in his tone that touched ambrose and he drew nearer to his uncle who laid a hand on his shoulder and presently the other on that of stephen who shrank a little at first but submitted  lads i need not tell you why i left fair shirley and the good greenwood  i was a worse fool then than ever i have been since i wore the cap and bells and if all had been brought home to me it might have brought your father and mother into troublemy sweet moll who had done her best for me  i deemed as you do now that the way to fortune was open but i found no path before me and i had tightened my belt many a time and was not much more than a bag of bones when by chance i fell in with a company of tumblers and gleemen  i sang them the old huntingsong and they said i did it tunably and whereas they saw i could already dance a hornpipe and turn a somersault passably well the leader of the troop old nat fireeater took me on and methinks he did not repentnor i neithersave when i sprained my foot and had time to lie by and think  we had plenty to fill our bellies and put on our backs we had welcome wherever we went and the groats and pennies rained into our caps  i was clown and jack pudding and whatever served their turn and the very name of quipsome hal drew crowds  yea twas a merry life  ay i feel thee wince and shrink my lad and so should i have shuddered when i was of thine age and hoped to come to better things  methinks twere better than this present said stephen rather gruffly  i had my reasons boy said randall speaking as if he were pleading his cause with their father and mother rather than with two such young lads  there was in our company an old manatarms who played the lute and the rebeck and sang ballads so long as hand and voice served him and with him went his grandchild a fair and honest little maiden whom he kept so jealously apart that twas long ere i knew of her following the company  he had been a franklin on my lord of warwicks lands and had once been burnt out by queen margarets men and just as things looked up again with him king edwards folk ruined all again and slew his two sons when great folk play the fool small folk pay the scot as i din into his graces ears whenever i may  a minion of the duke of clarence got the steading and poor old martin fulford was turned out to shift as best he might  one son he had left and with him he went to the low countries where they would have done well had they not been bitten by faith in the fellow perkin warbeck  youve heard of him  yea said ambrose the same who was taken out of sanctuary at beaulieu and borne off to london  father said he was marvellous like in the face to all the kings he had ever seen hunting in the forest  i know not but to the day of his death old martin swore that he was a son of king edwards and they came home again with the men the duchess of burgundy gave perkincame bag and baggage for young fulford had wedded a fair flemish wife poor soul  he left her with his father nigh to taunton ere the battle and he was never heard of more but as he was one of the few men who knew how to fight belike he was slain  thus old martin was left with the flemish wife and her little one on his hands for whose sake he did what went against him sorely joined himself to this troop of jugglers and players so as to live by the minstrelsy he had learnt in better days while his daughterinlaw mended and made for the company and kept them in smart and shining trim  by the time i fell in with them his voice was wellnigh gone and his hand sorely shaking but fireeating nat the master of our troop was not an illnatured fellow and the gleewomens feet were well used to his rebeck  moreover the fire eater had an eye to little perronel though her mother had never let him train herscarce let him set an eye on her and when mistress fulford died poor soul of ague caught when we showed off before the merry prior of worcester her last words were that perronel should never be a gleemaiden  well to make an end of my tale we had one day a mighty show at windsor when the king and court were at the castle and it was whispered to me at the end that my lord archbishops household needed a jester and that quipsome hal had been thought to make excellent fooling  i gave thanks at first but said i would rather be a free man not bound to be a greater fool than dame nature made me all the hours of the day  but when i got back to the garter what should i find but that poor old martin had been stricken with the dead palsy while he was playing his rebeck and would never twang a note more and there was pretty perronel weeping over him and nat fireeater pledging his word to give the old man bed board and all that he could need if so be that perronel should be trained to be one of his gleemaidens to dance and tumble and sing  and there was the poor old franklin shaking his head more than the palsy made it shake already and trying to frame his lips to say rather they both should die  oh uncle i wot now what thou didst cried stephen  yea lad there was nought else to be done  i asked master fulford to give me perronel plighting my word that never should she sing or dance for any ones pleasure save her own and mine and letting him know that i came of a worthy family  we were wedded out of hand by the priest that had been sent for to housel him and in our true names  the fireeater was fiery enough and swore that wedded or not i was bound to him that he would have both of us and would not drag about a helpless old man unless he might have the wench to do his bidding  i verily believe that but for my being on the watch and speaking a word to two or three stout yeomen of the kings guard that chanced to be crushing a pot of sack at the garter he would have played some villainous trick on us  they gave a hint to my lord of yorks steward and he came down and declared that the archbishop required quipsome hal and wouldof his gracesend a purse of nobles to the fireeater wherewith he was to be off on the spot without more ado or he might find it the worse for him and they together with mine hosts good wife took care that the rogue did not carry away perronel with him as he was like to have done to end my story here am i getting showers of gold coins one day and nought but kicks and gibes the next while my good woman keeps house nigh here on the banks of the thames with gaffer martin  her flemish thrift has set her to the washing and clearstarching of the lawyers ruffs whereby she makes enough to supply the defects of my scanty days or when i have to follow my lords grace out of her reach sweet soul  theres my tale nevoys  and now have ye a hand for quipsome hal  o uncle  father would have honoured thee cried stephen  why didst thou not bring her down to the forest said ambrose  i conned over the thought said randall but there was no way of living  i wist not whether the ranger might not stir up old tales and moreover old martin is ill to move  we brought him down by boat from windsor and he has never quitted the house since nor his bed for the last two years  youll come and see the housewife  she hath a supper laying out for you and on the way well speak of what ye are to do my poor lads  id forgotten that said stephen  so had not i returned his uncle i fear me i cannot aid you to preferment as you expected  none know quipsome hal by any name but that of harry merryman and it were not well that ye should come in there as akin to the poor fool  no said stephen emphatically  your father left you twenty crowns apiece  ay but john hath all save four of them  for that theres remedy  what saidst thou of the cheapside armourer  his fellow the wrymouth seemed to have a care of you ye made in to the rescue with poor old spring  even so replied ambrose and if stevie would brook the thought i trow that master headley would be quite willing to have him bound as his apprentice  well said my good lad cried hal  what sayest thou stevie  i had liefer be a manatarms  that thou couldst only be after being sorely knocked about as horseboy and as groom  i tried that once but found it meant kicks and oaths and vile companysuch as i would not have for thy mothers son steve  headley is a wellreported godfearing man and will do well by thee  and thou wilt learn the use of arms as well as handle them  i like master headley and kit smallbones well enough said stephen rather gloomily and if a gentleman must be a prentice weapons are not so bad a craft for him  whittington was a gentleman said ambrose  i am sick of whittington muttered stephen  nor is he the only one said randall theres middleton and pole ay and many another who have risen from the flat cap to the open helm if not to the coronet  nay these london companies have rules against taking any prentice not of gentle blood  come in to supper with my good woman and then ill go with thee and hold converse with good master headley and if master john doth not send the fee freely why then i know of them who shall make him disgorge it  but mark he added as he led the way out of the gardens not a breath of quipsome hal  down here they know me as a clerk of my lords chamber sad and sober and high in his trust and therein they are not far out  in truth though harry randall had been a wild and frolicsome youth in his hampshire home the effect of being a professional buffoon had actually made it a relaxation of effort to him to be grave quiet and slow in movement and this was perhaps a more effectual disguise than the dark garments and the false brown hair beard and moustache with which he concealed the shorn and shaven condition required of the domestic jester  having been a player he was well able to adapt himself to his part and yet ambrose had considerable doubts whether tibble had not suspected his identity from the first more especially as both the lads had inherited the same dark eyes from their mother and ambrose for the first time perceived a considerable resemblance between him and stephen not only in feature but in unconscious gesture  ambrose was considering whether he had better give his uncle a hint lest concealment should excite suspicion when niched as it were against an abutment of the wall of the temple courts close to some steps going down to the thames they came upon a tiny house at whose open door stood a young woman in the snowiest of caps and aprons over a short black gown beneath which were a trim pair of blue hosen and stout shoes a suspicion of yellow hair was allowed to appear framing the honest fresh flemish face which beamed a goodhumoured welcome  here they be here be the poor lads pernel mine  she held out her hand and offered a round comfortable cheek to each saying welcome to london young gentlemen  good mistress perronel did not look exactly the stuff to make a gleemaiden of nor even the beauty for whom to sacrifice everything even liberty and respect  she was substantial in form and broad in face and mouth without much nose and with large almost colourless eyes  but there was a wonderful look of heartiness and friendliness about her person and her house the boys had never in their lives seen anything so amazingly and spotlessly clean and shining  in a corner stood an erection like a dark oaken cupboard or wardrobe but in the middle was an opening about a yard square through which could be seen the nightcapped face of a white headed whitebearded old man propped against snowy pillows  to him randall went at once saying so gaffer how goes it  you see i have brought company my poor sisters sonsrest her soul  gaffer martin mumbled something to them incomprehensible but which the jester comprehended for he called them up and named them to him and martin put out a bony hand and gave them a greeting though his speech and limbs had failed him his intelligence was evidently still intact and there was a tenderlycaredfor look about him rendering his condition far less pitiable than that of richard birkenholt who was so palpably treated as an incumbrance  the table was already covered with a cloth and perronel quickly placed on it a yellow bowl of excellent beef broth savoury with vegetables and potherbs and with meat and dumplings floating in it  a lesser bowl was provided for each of the company with horn spoons and a loaf of good wheaten bread and a tankard of excellent ale  randall declared that his perronel made far daintier dishes than my lord archbishops cook who went every day in silk and velvet  he explained to her his views on the armourer to which she agreed with all her might the old gentleman in bed adding something which the boys began to understand that there was no worthier nor more honourable condition than that of an english burgess specially in the good town of london where the kings knew better than to be ever at enmity with their good towns  will the armourer take both of you asked mistress randall  nay it was only for stephen we devised it said ambrose  and what wilt thou do  i wish to be a scholar said ambrose  a lean trade quoth the jester a monk now or a friar may be a right jolly fellow but i never yet saw a man who throve upon books  i had rather study than thrive said ambrose rather dreamily  he wotteth not what he saith cried stephen  oh ho so thou art of that sort rejoined his uncle  i know them  a crabbed black and white page is meat and drink to them theres that dutch fellow with a long latin name thin and weazen as never was dutchman before they say he has read all the books in the world and can talk in all the tongues and yet when he and sir thomas more and the dean of st pauls get together at my lords table one would think they were bidding for my bauble  such excellent fooling do they make that my lord sits holding his sides  the dean of st pauls said ambrose experiencing a shock  ay  hes another of your lean scholars and yet he was born a wealthy man son to a lord mayor who they say reared him alone out of a round score of children  alack poor souls sighed mistress randall under her breath for as ambrose afterwards learnt her two babes had scarce seen the light  her husband while giving her a look of affection went on not that he can keep his wealth  he has bestowed the most of it on stepney church and on the school he hath founded for poor children nigh to st pauls  could i get admittance to that school exclaimed ambrose  thou art a big fellow for a school said his uncle looking him over  however faint heart never won fair lady  i have a letter from the warden of st elizabeths to one of the clerks of st pauls added ambrose  alworthy is his name  thats well  well prove that same said his uncle  meantime if ye have eaten your fill we must be on our way to thine armourer nevoy stephen or i shall be called for  and after a private colloquy between the husband and wife ambrose was by both of them desired to make the little house his home until he could find admittance into st pauls school or some other  he demurred somewhat from a mixture of feelings in which there was a certain amount of stephens longing for freedom of action and likewise a doubt whether he should not thus be a great inconvenience in the tiny householda burden he was resolved not to be  but his uncle now took a more serious tone  look thou ambrose thou art my sisters son and fool though i be thou art bound in duty to me and i to have charge of thee nor will ifor the sake of thy father and motherhave thee lying i know not where among gulls and cutpurses and beguilers of youth here in this city of london  so till better befals thee and i wot of it thou must be here no later than curfew or i will know the reason why  and i hope the young gentleman will find it no sore grievance said perronel so goodhumouredly that ambrose could only protest that he had feared to be troublesome to her and promise to bring his bundle the next day    chapter ix  arms spiritual and temporal    for him was leifer to have at his beddes hedde twenty books clothed in blacke or redde of aristotle and his philosophie than robes riche or fiddle or psalterie  chaucer   master headley was found spending the summer evening in the bay window of the hall  tibble sat on a threelegged stool by him writing in a crabbed hand in a big ledger and kit smallbones towered above both holding in his hand a bundle of tallysticks by the help of these and of that accuracy of memory which writing has destroyed he was unfolding down to the very last farthing the entire account of payments and receipts during his masters absence the debtor and creditor account being preserved as perfectly as if he had always had a pen in his huge fingers and studied book keeping by double or single entry  on the return of the two boys with such an apparently respectable member of society as the handsome welldressed personage who accompanied them little dennet who had been set to sew her sampler on a stool by her grandmother under penalty of being sent off to bed if she disturbed her father sprang up with a little cry of gladness and running up to ambrose entreated for the tales of his good greenwood forest and the pucks and pixies and the girl who daily shared her breakfast with a snake and said eat your own side speckleback  somehow on sunday night she had gathered that ambrose had a store of such tales and she dragged him off to the gallery there to revel in them while his brother remained with her father  though master stephen had begun by being high and mighty about mechanical crafts and thought it a great condescension to consent to be bound apprentice yet when once again in the dragon court it looked so friendly and felt so much like a home that he found himself very anxious that master headley should not say that he could take no more apprentices at present and that he should be satisfied with the terms uncle hal would propose  and oh suppose tibble should recognise quipsome hal  however tibble was at this moment entirely engrossed by the accounts and his master left him and his big companion to unravel them while he himself held speech with his guest at some distance sending for a cup of sack wherewith to enliven the conversation  he showed himself quite satisfied with what randall chose to tell of himself as a well known housekeeper close to the temple his wife a lavender there while he himself was attached to the suite of the archbishop of york  here alone was there any approach to shuffling for master headley was left to suppose that randall attended wolsey in his capacity of kings counsellor and therefore having a house of his own had not been found in the roll of the domestic retainers and servants  he did not think of inquiring further the more so as randall was perfectly candid as to his own inferiority of birth to the birkenholt family and the circumstances under which he had left the forest  master headley professed to be quite willing to accept stephen as an apprentice with or without a fee but he agreed with randall that it would be much better not to expose him to having it cast in his teeth that he was accepted out of charity and randall undertook to get a letter so written and conveyed to john birkenholt that he should not dare to withhold the needful sum in earnest of which master headley would accept the two crowns that stephen had in hand as soon as the indentures could be drawn out by one of the many scriveners who lived about st pauls  this settled randall could stay no longer but he called both nephews into the court with him  ye can write a letter he said  ay sure both of us but ambrose is the best scribe said stephen  one of you had best write then  let that cur john know that i have my lord of yorks ear and there will be no fear but he will give it  ill find a safe hand among the clerks when the judges ride to hold the assize  mayhap ambrose might also write to the father at beaulieu  the thing had best be bruited  i wished to do so said ambrose  it irked me to have taken no leave of the good fathers  randall then took his leave having little more than time to return to york house where the archbishop might perchance come home wearied and chafed from the king and the jester might be missed if not there to put him in good humour  the curfew sounded and though attention to its notes was not compulsory by law it was regarded as the breakup of the evening and the note of recall in all wellordered establishments  the apprentices and journeymen came into the court among them giles headley who had been taken out by one of the men to be provided with a working dress much to his disgust the grandmother summoned little dennet and carried her off to bed  stephen and ambrose bade goodnight but master headley and his two confidential men remained somewhat longer to wind up their accounts  doors were not as a rule locked within the court for though it contained from forty to fifty persons they were all regarded as a single family and it was enough to fasten the heavily bolted ironstudded folding doors of the great gateway leading into cheapside the key being brought to the master like that of a castle seven minutes measured by the glass after the last note of the curfew in the belfry outside st pauls  the summer twilight however lasted long after this time of grace and when tibble had completed his accountants work and smallbones deep voiced goodnight comrade had resounded over the court he beheld a figure rise up from the steps of the gallery and ambroses voice said  may i speak to thee tibble  i need thy counsel  come hither sir said the foreman muttering to himself methought twas working in him  the leaven the leaven  tibble led the way up one of the side stairs into the open gallery where he presently opened a door admitting to a small though high chamber the walls of bare brick and containing a low bed a small table a threelegged stool a big chest and two cupboards also a cross over the head of the bed  a private room was a luxury neither possessed nor desired by most persons of any degree and only enjoyed by tibble in consideration of his great value to his master his peculiar tastes and the injuries he had received  in point of fact his fall had been owing to a hasty blow given in a passion by the master himself when a young man  dismay and repentance had made giles headley a cooler and more selfcontrolled man ever since and even if tibble had not been a superior workman he might still have been free to do almost anything he chose  tibble gave his visitor the stool and himself sat down on the chest saying  so you have found your uncle sir  ay said ambrose pausing in some expectation that tibble would mention some suspicion of his identity but if the foreman had his ideas on the subject he did not disclose them and waited for more communications  tibble said ambrose with a long gasp i must find means to hear more of him thou tookedst me to on sunday  none ever truly tasted of that well without longing to come back to it quoth tibble  but hath not thy kinsman done aught for thee  nay said ambrose save to offer me a lodging with his wife a good and kindly lavender at the temple  tibble nodded  so far am i free said ambrose and i am glad of it  i have a letter here to one of the canons one master alworthy but ere i seek him i would know somewhat from thee tibble  what like is he  i cannot tell sir said tibble  the canons are rich and many and a poor smith like me wots little of their fashions  is it true again asked ambrose that the deanhe who spake those words yesterdayhath a school here for young boys  ay  and a good and mild school it be bringing them up in the name and nurture of the holy child jesus to whom it is dedicated  then they are taught this same doctrine  i trow they be  they say the dean loves them like the children of his old age and declares that they shall be made in love with holy lore by gentleness rather than severity  is it likely that this same alworthy could obtain me entrance there  alack sir i fear me thou art too old  i see none but little lads among them  didst thou come to london with that intent  nay for i only wist today that there was such a school  i came with i scarce know what purpose save to see stephen safely bestowed and then to find some way of learning myself  moreover a change seems to have come on me as though i had hitherto been walking in a dream  tibble nodded and ambrose sitting there in the dark was moved to pour forth all his heart the experience of many an ardent soul in those spirit searching days  growing up happily under the care of the simple monks of beaulieu he had never looked beyond their somewhat mechanical routine accepted everything implicitly and gone on acquiring knowledge with the receptive spirit but dormant thought of studious boyhood as yet unawakened thinking that the studious clerical life to which every one destined him would only be a continuation of the same as indeed it had been to his master father simon  not that ambrose expressed this beyond saying they are good and holy men and i thought all were like them and fear that was all  then came death for the first time nearly touching and affecting the youth and making his soul yearn after further depths which he might yet have found in the peace of the good old men and the holy rites and doctrine that they preserved but before there was time for these things to find their way into the wounds of his spirit his expulsion from home had sent him forth to see another side of monkish and clerkly life  father shoveller kindly as he was was a mere yeoman with nothing spiritual about him the monks of hyde were the younger gay comrades only trying how loosely they could sit to their vows the elder churlish and avaricious even the warden of elizabeth college was little more than a student  and in london fresh phases had revealed themselves the pomp state splendour and luxury of archbishop wolseys house had been a shock to the lads ideal of a bishop drawn from the saintly biographies he had studied at beaulieu and he had but to keep his ears open to hear endless scandals about the mass priests as they were called since they were at this time very unpopular in london and in many cases deservedly so  everything that the boy had hitherto thought the way of holiness and salvation seemed invaded by evil and danger and under the bondage of death whose terrible dance continued to haunt him  i saw it i saw it he said all over those halls at york house i seemed to behold the grisly shape standing behind one and another as they ate and laughed and when the archbishop and his priests and the king came in it seemed only to make the pageant complete  only now and then could i recall those blessed words ye are free indeed  did he say from the bondage of death  yea said tibble into the glorious freedom of gods children  thou knowst it  thou knowst it tibble  it seems to me that life is no life but living death without that freedom  and i must hear of it and know whether it is mine yea and stephens and all whom i love  o tibble i would beg my bread rather than not have that freedom ever before mine eyes  hold it fast hold it fast dear sir said tibble holding out his hands with tears in his eyes and his face working in a manner that happily ambrose could not see  but howhow  the barefoot friar said that for an ave a day our blessed lady will drag us back from purgatory  i saw her on the wall of her chapel at winchester saving a robber knight from the sea yea and a thief from the gallows but that is not being free  fond inventions of pardonmongers muttered tibble  and is one not free when the priest hath assoilsied him added ambrose  if and if said tibble  but bone shall make me trow that shrift in words without heartsorrow for sin and the latin heard with no thought of him that bore the guilt can set the sinner free tis none other that the dean sets forth ay and the book that i have here  i thank my god he stood up and took off his cap reverently that he hath opened the eyes of another  his tone was such that ambrose could have believed him some devout almost inspired hermit rather than the acute skilful artisan he appeared at other times and in fact tibble steelman like many another craftsman of those days led a double life the outer one that of the ordinary workman the inner one devoted to those lights that were shining unveiled and new to many and especially here in the heart of the city partly from the influence of dean colets sermons and catechisings at st pauls but also from remnants of lollardism which had never been entirely quenched  the ordinary clergy looked at it with horror but the intelligent and thoughtful of the burgher and craftsman classes studied it with a passionate fervour which might have sooner broken out and in more perilous forms save for the guidance it received in the truly catholic and openspirited public teachings of colet in which he persisted in spite of the opposition of his brother clergy  not that as yet the inquirers had in the slightest degree broken with the system of the church or with her old traditions  they were only beginning to see the light that had been veiled from them and to endeavour to clear the fountain from the mire that had fouled it and there was as yet no reason to believe that the aspersions continually made against the mass priests and the friars were more than the chronic grumblings of englishmen who had found the same faults in them for the last two hundred years  and what wouldst thou do young sir presently inquired tibble  that i came to ask thee good tibble  i would work to the best of my power in any craft so i may hear those words and gain the key to all i have hitherto learnt unheeding as one in a dream  my purpose had been to be a scholar and a clerk but i must see mine own way and know whither i am being carried ere i can go farther  tibble writhed and wriggled himself about in consideration  i would i wist how to take thee to the dean himself he said but i am but a poor man and his doctrine is new wine in old bottles to the master though he be a right good man after his lights  see now master ambrose meseemeth that thou hadst best take thy letter first to this same priest  it may be that he can prefer thee to some post about the minster  canst sing  i could once but my voice is nought at this present  if i could but be a servitor at st pauls school  it might be that the will which hath led thee so far hath that post in store for thee so bear the letter to master alworthy  and if he fail thee wouldst thou think scorn of aiding a friend of mine who worketh a printingpress in warwick inner yard  thou wilt find him at his place in paternoster row hard by st pauls  he needeth one who is clerk enough to read the latin and the craft being a new one tis fenced by none of those prentice laws that would bar the way to thee elsewhere at thy years  i should dwell among books  yea and holy books that bear on the one matter dear to the true heart  thou might serve lucas hansen at the sign of the winged staff till thou hast settled thine heart and then it may be the way would be opened to study at oxford or at cambridge so that thou couldst expound the faith to others  good tibble kind tibble i knew thou couldst aid me  wilt thou speak to this master hansen for me  tibble however held that it was more seemly that ambrose should first try his fate with master alworthy but in case of this not succeeding he promised to write a billet that would secure attention from lucas hansen  i warn thee however that he is low dutch he added though he speaketh english well  he would gladly have gone with the youth and at any other time might have been sent by his master but the whole energies of the dragon would be taken up for the next week by preparations for the tiltingmatch at court and tibble could not be spared for another working hour  ambrose as he rose to bid his friend goodnight could not help saying that he marvelled that one such as he could turn his mind to such vanities as the tiltyard required  nay said tibble twas the craft i was bred toyea and i have a good master and the apostle paul himselfas ive heard a preacher saybade men continue in the state wherein they were and not be curious to chop and change  who knoweth whether in gods sight all our wars and policies be no more than the games of the tiltyard  moreover paul himself made these very weapons read as good a sermon as the dean himself  didst never hear of the shield of faith and helmet of salvation and breastplate of righteousness so if thou comest to master hansen and provest worthy of his trust thou wilt hear more ay and maybe read too thyself and send forth the good seed to others he murmured to himself as he guided his visitor across the moonlit court up the stairs to the chamber where stephen lay fast asleep    chapter x  two vocations    the smith a mighty man is he    with large and sinewy hands and the muscles of his brawny arms    are strong as iron bands  longfellow   stephens first thought in the morning was whether the ex voto effigy of poor spring was put in hand while ambrose thought of tibbles promised commendation to the printer  they both however found their affairs must needs wait  orders for weapons for the tiltingmatch had come in so thickly the day before that every hand must be employed on executing them and the dragon court was ringing again with the clang of hammers and screech of grindstones  stephen though not yet formally bound was to enter on his apprentice life at once and ambrose was assured by master headley that it was of no use to repair to any of the dignified clergy of st pauls before midday and that he had better employ the time in writing to his elder brother respecting the fee  materials were supplied to him and he used them so as to do credit to the monks of beaulieu in spite of little dennet spending every spare moment in watching his pen as if he were performing some cabalistic operation  he was a long time about it  there were two letters to write and the wording of thorn needed to be very careful besides that the old court hand took more time to frame than the italian current hand and even thus when dinnertime came at ten oclock the household was astonished to find that he had finished all that regarded stephen though he had left the letters open until his own venture should have been made  stephen flung himself down beside his brother hot and panting shaking his shoulderblades and declaring that his arms felt ready to drop out  he had been turning a grindstone ever since six oclock  the two new apprentices had been set on to sharpening the weapon points as all that they were capable of and had been bidden by smallbones to turn and hold alternately but that oaf giles headley said stephen never ground but one lance and made me go on turning threatening to lay the butt about mine ears if i slacked  the lazy lubber cried ambrose  but did none see thee or couldst not call out for redress  thou art half a wench thyself ambrose to think id complain besides he stood on his rights as a master and he is a big fellow  thats true said ambrose and he might make it the worse for thee  i would i were as big as he sighed stephen i would soon show him which was the better man  perhaps the grinding match had not been as unobserved as stephen fancied for on returning to work smallbones who presided over all the rougher parts of the business claimed them both  he set stephen to stand by him sort out and hand him all the rivets needed for a suit of proof armour that hung on a frame while he required giles to straighten bars of iron heated to a white heat  ere long giles called out for stephen to change places to which smallbones coolly replied turnabout is the rule here master  even so replied giles and i have been at work like this long enough ay and too long  thy turn was a matter of three hours this morning replied kit not coolly for nobody was cool in his den but with a brevity which provoked a laugh  i shall see what my cousin the master saith cried giles in great wrath  ay that thou wilt returned kit if thou dost loiter over thy business and hast not those bars ready when called for  he never meant me to be put on work like this with a hammer that breaks mine arm  what crying out for that said edmund burgess who had just come in to ask for a pair of tongs  what wouldst say to the big hammer that none can wield save kit himself  giles felt there was no redress and panted on feeling as if he were melting away and with a dumb wild rage in his heart that could get no outlet for smallbones was at least as much bigger than he as he was than stephen  tibble was meanwhile busy over the gilding and enamelling of buckinghams magnificent plate armour in italian fashion but he had found time to thrust into ambroses hand an exceedingly small and curiously folded billet for lucas hansen the printer in case of need  he would be found at the sign of the winged staff in paternoster row said tibble or if not there himself there would be his servant who would direct ambrose to the place where the dutch printer lived and worked  no one was at leisure to show the lad the way and he set out with a strange feeling of solitude as his path began decisively to be away from that of his brother  he did not find much difficulty in discovering the quadrangle on the south side of the minster where the minor canons lived near the deanery and the porter a stout lay brother pointed out to him the doorway belonging to master alworthy  he knocked and a young man with a tonsured head but a bloated face opened it  ambrose explained that he had brought a letter from the warden of st elizabeths college at winchester  give it here said the young man  i would give it to his reverence himself said ambrose  his reverence is taking his afterdinner nap and may not be disturbed said the man  then i will wait said ambrose  the door was shut in his face but it was the shady side of the court and he sat down on a bench and waited  after full an hour the door was opened and the canon a goodnatured looking man in a square cap and gown and cassock of the finest cloth came slowly out  he had evidently heard nothing of the message and was taken by surprise when ambrose doffing his cap and bowing low gave him the greeting of the warden of st elizabeths and the letter  hum  ha  my good friendfielderi remember him  he was always a scholar  so he hath sent thee here with his commendations  what should i do with all the idle country lads that come up to choke london and feed the plague  yet staythat lurdane bolt is getting intolerably lazy and insolent and methinks he robs me  what canst do thou stripling  i can read latin sir and know the greek alphabeta  tush  i want no scholar more than enough to serve my mass  canst sing  not now but i hope to do so again  when i rid me of bolt thereand theres an office under the sacristan that he might fill as well as another knavethe fellow might do for me well enow as a body servant said mr alworthy speaking to himself  he would brush my gowns and make my bed and i might perchance trust him with my marketings and by and by there might be some office for him when he grew saucy and idle  ill prove him on mine old comrades word  sir said ambrose respectfully what i seek for is occasion for study  i had hoped you could speak to the dean dr john colet for some post at his school  boy said alworthy i thought thee no such fool  why crack thy brains with study when i can show thee a surer path to ease and preferment  but i see thou art too proud to do an old man a service  thou writst thyself gentleman forsooth and high blood will not stoop  not so sir returned ambrose i would work in any way so i could study the humanities and hear the dean preach  cannot you commend me to his school  ha exclaimed the canon this is your sort is it  ill have nought to do with it  preaching preaching  every idle childs head is agog on preaching nowadays  a plague on it  why cant master dean leave it to the black friars whose vocation tis and not cumber us with his sermons for ever and set every lazy lad thinking he must needs run after them  no no my good boy take my advice  thou shalt have two good bellyfuls a day all my cast gowns and a pair of shoes by the year with a groat a month if thou wilt keep mine house bring in my meals and the like and by and by so thou art a good lad and runst not after these newfangled preachments which lead but to heresy and set folk racking their brains about sin and such trash well get thee shorn and into minor orders and who knows what good preferment thou mayst not win in due time  sir i am beholden to you but my mind is set on study  what kin art thou to a fool cried the minor canon so startling ambrose that he had almost answered and turning to another ecclesiastic whose siesta seemed to have ended about the same time look at this varlet brother cloudesley  would you believe it  he comes to me with a letter from mine old friend in consideration of which i offer him that saucy lubber bolts place a gown of mine own a year meat and preferment and lo you he tells me all he wants is to study greek forsooth and hear the deans sermons  the other canon shook his head in dismay at such arrant folly young stripling be warned he said  know what is good for thee greek is the tongue of heresy  how may that be reverend sir said ambrose when the holy apostles and the fathers spake and wrote in the greek  waste not thy time on him brother said mr alworthy  he will find out his error when his pride and his greek forsooth have brought him to fire and faggot  ay ay added cloudesley  the dean with his dutch friend and his sermons and his new grammar and accidence is sowing heretics as thick as groundsel  wherewith the two canons of the old school waddled away arm in arm and bolt put out his head leered at ambrose and bade him shog off and not come sneaking after other folks shoes  sooth to say ambrose was relieved by his rejection  if he were not to obtain admission in any capacity to st pauls school he felt more drawn to tibbles friend the printer for the selfseeking luxurious habits into which so many of the beneficed clergy had fallen were repulsive to him and his whole soul thirsted after that new revelation as it were which colets sermon had made to him yet the word heresy was terrible and confusing and a doubt came over him whether he might not be forsaking the right path and be lured aside by false lights  he would think it out before he committed himself  where should he do so in peace  he thought of the great minster but the nave was full of a surging multitude and there was a loud hum of voices proceeding from it which took from him all inclination to find his way to the quieter and inner portions of the sanctuary  then he recollected the little pardon church where he had seen the dance of death on the walls and crossing the burialground he entered and as he expected found it empty since the hours for masses for the dead were now past  he knelt down on a step repeated the sext office in warning for which the bells were chiming all round covering his face with his hands and thinking himself back to beaulieu then seating himself on a step leaning against the wall he tried to think out whether to give himself up to the leadings of the new light that had broken on him or whether to wrench himself from it  was this which seemed to him truth and deliverance verily the heresy respecting which rumours had come to horrify the country convents  if he had only heard of it from tibble wrymouth he would have doubted in spite of its power over him but he had heard it from a man wise good and high in place like dean colet  yet to his further perplexity his uncle had spoken of colet as jesting at wolseys table  what course should he take  could he bear to turn away from that which drew his soul so powerfully and return to the bounds which seem to him to be grown so narrow but which he was told were safe  now that stephen was settled it was open to him to return to st elizabeths college but the young soul within him revolted against the repetition of what had become to him unsatisfying unless illumined by the brightness he seemed to have glimpsed at  but ambrose had gone through much unwonted fatigue of late and while thus musing he fell asleep with his head against the wall he was half wakened by the sound of voices and presently became aware that two persons were examining the walls and comparing the paintings with some others which one of them had evidently seen if he had known it it was with the dance of death on the bridge of lucerne  i question said a voice that ambrose had heard before whether these terrors be wholesome for mens souls  for priests pouches they be said the other with something of a foreign accent  alack when shall we see the day when the hope of paradise and dread of purgatory shall be no longer made the tools of priestly gain and hatred of sin taught to these poor folk instead of servile dread of punishment  have a care my colet answered the yellow bearded foreigner thou art already in ill odour with those same men in authority and though a deans stall be fenced from the episcopal crook yet there is a rod at rome which can reach even thither  i tell thee dear erasmus thou art too timid i were well content to leave house and goods yea to go to prison or to death could i but bring home to one soul for which christ died the truth and hope in every one of those prayers and creeds that our poor folk are taught to patter as a senseless charm  these are strange times returned erasmus  methinks yonder phantom be he skeleton or angel will have snatched both of us away ere we behold the full issue either of thy preachings or my greek testament or of our mores utopian images  dost thou not feel as though we were like children who have set some mighty engine in motion like the great waterwheels in my native home which whirled by the flowing streams of time and opinion may break up the whole foundations and destroy the oneness of the edifice  it may be so returned colet  what read we  the net brake even in the masters sight while still afloat on the sea  it was only on the shore that the hundred and fiftythree all good and sound were drawn to his feet  and returned erasmus i see wherefore thou hast made thy children at st pauls one hundred and fifty and three  the two friends were passing out  their latter speeches had scarce been understood by ambrose even if he heard them so full was he of conflicting feelings now ready to cast himself before their feet and entreat the dean to help him to guidance now withheld by bashfulness unwillingness to interrupt and ingenuous shame at appearing like an eavesdropper towards such dignified and venerable personages  had he obeyed his first impulse mayhap his career had been made safer and easier for him but it was while shyness chained his limbs and tongue that the dean and erasmus quitted the chapel and the opportunity of accosting them had slipped away  their half comprehended words had however decided him in the part he should take making him sure that colet was not controverting the formularies of the church but drawing out those meanings which in repetition by rote were wellnigh forgotten  it was as if his course were made clear to him  he was determined to take the means which most readily presented themselves of hearing colet and leaving the chapel he bent his steps to the row which his bookloving eye had already marked flanking the great cathedral on the north was the row of small open stalls devoted to the sale of books or objects of devotion all so arranged that the open portion might be cleared and the stock intrade locked up if not carried away  each stall had its own sign most of them sacred such as the lamb and flag the scallop shell or some patron saint but classical emblems were oddly intermixed such as minervas aegis pegasus and the lyre of apollo  the sellers some middleaged men some lads stretched out their arms with their wares to attract the passengers in the street and did not fail to beset ambrose  the more lively looked at his lincoln green and shouted verses of ballads at him fluttering broad sheets with verses on the lamentable fate of jane shore or fair rosamond the same woodcut doing duty for both ladies without mercy to their beauty  the scholastic judged by his face and step that he was a student and they flourished at him blackbound copies of virgilius maro and of tullys offices while others hoping that he was an incipient clerk offered breviaries missals or portuaries with the use of st pauls or of sarum or mayhap st austins confessions  he made his way along with his eye diligently heedful of the signs and at last recognised the winged staff or caduceus of hermes over a stall where a couple of boys in blue caps and gowns and yellow stockings were making a purchase of a small grave looking elderly but bright cheeked man whose yellow hair and beard were getting intermingled with grey  they were evidently those st pauls school boys whom ambrose envied so much and as they finished their bargaining and ran away together ambrose advanced with a salutation asked if he did not see master lucas hansen and gave him the note with the commendations of tibble steelman the armourer  he was answered with a ready nod and yea yea as the old man opened the billet and cast his eyes over it then scanning ambrose from head to foot said with some amazement but you are of gentle blood young sir  i am said ambrose but gentle blood needs at times to work for bread and tibble let me hope that i might find both livelihood for the body and for the soul with you sir  is it so asked the printer his face lighting up  art thou willing to labour and toil and give up hope of fee and honour if so thou mayst win the truth  ambrose folded his hands with a gesture of earnestness and lucas hansen said bless thee my son  methinks i can aid thee in thy quest so thou canst lay aside and here his voice grew sharper and more peremptory all thy gentlemans airs and follies and serve ay serve and obey  i trust so returned ambrose my brother is even now becoming prentice to master giles headley and we hope to live as honest men by the work of our hands and brains  i forgot that you english herren are not so puffed up with pride and scorn like our dutch nobles returned the printer  canst live sparingly and lie hard and see that thou keepst the house clean not like these english swine  i hope so said ambrose smiling but i have an uncle and aunt and they would have me lie every night at their house beside the temple gardens  what is thine uncle  he hath a post in the meine of my lord archbishop of york said ambrose blushing and hesitating a little  he cometh to and fro to his wife who dwells with her old father doing fine lavenders work for the lawyer folk therein  it was somewhat galling that this should be the most respectable occupation that could be put forward but lucas hansen was evidently reassured by it  he next asked whether ambrose could read latin putting a book into his hand as he did so ambrose read and construed readily explaining that he had been trained at beaulieu  that is well said the printer and hast thou any greek  only the alphabeta said ambrose i made that out from a book at beaulieu but father simon knew no more and there was nought to study from  even so replied hansen but little as thou knowst tis as much as i can hope for from any who will aid me in my craft  tis i that as thou hast seen furnish for the use of the children at the deans school of st pauls  the best and foremost scholars of them are grounded in their greek that being the tongue wherein the holy gospels were first writ  hitherto i have had to get me books for their use from holland whither they are brought from basle but i have had sent me from hamburg a fount of type of the greek character whereby i hope to print at home the accidence and mayhap the dialogues of plato and it might even be the sacred gospel itself which the great doctor master erasmus is even now collating from the best authorities in the universities  ambroses eyes kindled with unmistakable delight  you have the accidence he exclaimed  then could i study the tongue even while working for you  sir i would do my best  it is the very opportunity i seek  fair and softly said the printer with something of a smile thou art new to cheapening and bargaining my fair lad  thou hast spoken not one word of the wage  i recked not of that said ambrose  tis true i may not burthen mine uncle and aunt but verily sir i would live on the humblest fare that will keep body and soul together so that i may have such an opportunity  how knowst thou what the opportunity may be returned lucas drily  thou art but a babe  some one should have a care of thee if i set thee to stand here all day and cry what dye lack or to carry bales of books twixt this and warwick inner yard thou wouldst have no ground to complain  nay sir returned ambrose i wot that tibble steelman would never send me to one who would not truly give me what i need  tibble steelman is verily one of the few who are both called and chosen replied lucas and i think thou art the same so far as green youth may be judged since thou art one who will follow the word into the desert and never ask for the loaves and fishes nevertheless i will take none advantage of thy youth and zeal but thou shalt first behold what thou shalt have to do for me and then if it still likes thee i will see thy kindred  hast no father  ambrose explained and at that moment master hansens boy made his appearance returning from an errand the stall was left in his charge while the master took ambrose with him into the precincts of what had once been the splendid and hospitable mansion of the great kingmaker warwick but was now broken up into endless little tenements with their courts and streets though the baronial ornaments and the arrangement still showed what the place had been  entering beneath a wide archway still bearing the sign of the bear and ragged staff lucas led the way into what must have been one of the courts of offices for it was surrounded with buildings and sheds of different heights and sizes and had on one side a deep trough of stone fed by a series of watertaps intended for the use of the stables  the doors of one of these buildings was unlocked by master hansen and ambrose found himself in what had once perhaps been part of a stable but had been partitioned off from the rest there were two stalls one serving the dutchman for his living room the other for his workshop  in one corner stood a white earthenware stoveso new a spectacle to the young forester that he supposed it to be the printing press  a table shiny with rubbing a wooden chair a couple of stools a few vessels mirrors for brightness some chests and corner cupboards a bed shutting up like a box and likewise highly polished completed the furniture all arranged with the marvellous orderliness and neatness of the nation  a curtain shut off the opening to the other stall where stood a machine with a huge screw turned by leverage  boxes of type and piles of paper surrounded it and ambrose stood and looked at it with a sort of awestruck wonder and respect as the great fount of wisdom  hansen showed him what his work would be in setting up type and by and by correcting after the first proof  the machine could only print four pages at a time and for this operation the whole strength of the establishment was required  moreover master hansen bound as well as printed his books  ambrose was by no means daunted  as long as he might read as well as print and while he had sundays at st pauls to look to he asked no moreexcept indeed that his gentle blood stirred at the notion of acting salesman in the bookstall and master hansen assured him with a smile that will wherry the other boy would do that better than either of them and that he would be entirely employed here  the methodical master insisted however on making terms with the boys relations and with some misgivings on ambroses part the twosince business hours were almost overwalked together to the temple and to the little house where perronel was ironing under her window  ambrose need not have doubted  the dutch blood on either side was stirred and the good housewife commanded the little printers respect as he looked round on a kitchen as tidy as if it were in his own country  and the bargain was struck that ambrose birkenholt should serve master hansen for his meals and two pence a week while he was to sleep at the little house of mistress randall who would keep his clothes and linen in order  and thus it was that both ambrose and stephen birkenholt had found their vocations for the present and both were fervent in them master headley pshawed a little when he heard that ambrose had engaged himself to a printer and a foreigner and when he was told it was to a friend of tibbles only shook his head saying that tibs only fault was dabbling in matters of divinity as if a plain man could not be saved without them  however he respected the lad for having known his own mind and not hung about in idleness and he had no opinion of clerks whether monks or priests  indeed the low esteem in which the clergy as a class were held in london was one of the very evil signs of the times  ambrose was invited to dine and sup at the dragon court every sunday and holiday and he was glad to accept since the hospitality was so free and he thus was able to see his brother and tibble besides that it prevented him from burthening mistress randall whom he really liked though he could not see her husband either in his motley or his plain garments without a shudder of repulsion  ambrose found that setting up type had not much more to do with the study of new books than stephens turning the grindstone had with fighting in the lists and the mistakes he made in spelling from right to left and in confounding the letters made him despair and prepare for any amount of just indignation from his master but he found on the contrary that master hansen had never had a pupil who made so few blunders on the first trial and augured well of him from such a beginning  paper was too costly and pressure too difficult for many proofs to be struck off but hansen could read and correct his type as it stood and assured ambrose that practice would soon give him the same power and the correction was thus completed when will wherry a big stout fellow came in to dinner the stall being left during that time as nobody came for books during the dinnerhour and hansen having an understanding with his next neighbour by which they took turns to keep guard against thieves  the master and the two lads dined together on the contents of a cauldron where pease and pork had been simmering together on the stove all the morning  their strength was then united to work the press and strike off a sheet which the master scanned finding only one error in it  it was a portion of lillys grammar and ambrose regarded it with mingled pride and delight though he longed to go further into those deeper revelations for the sake of which he had come here  master hansen then left the youths to strike off a couple of hundred sheets after which they were to wash the types and rearrange the letters in the compartments in order whilst he returned to the stall  the customers requiring his personal attention were generally late ones  when all this was accomplished and the pot put on again in preparation for supper the lads might use the short time that remained as they would and hansen himself showed ambrose a shelf of books concealed by a blue curtain whence he might read  will wherry showed unconcealed amazement that this should be the taste of his companion  he himself hated the whole business and would never have adopted it but that he had too many brothers for all to take to the water on the thames and their mother was too poor to apprentice them and needed the small weekly pay the dutchman gave him  he seemed a goodnatured dull fellow whom no doubt hansen had hired for the sake of the strong arms developed by generations of oarsmen upon the river  what he specially disliked was that his master was a foreigner  the whole court swarmed with foreigners he said with the utmost disgust as if they were noxious insects  they made provisions dear and undersold honest men and he wondered the lord mayor did not see to it and drive them out  he did not so much object to the dutch but the spaniardsno words could express his horror of them  by and by ambrose going out to fetch some water from the conduit found standing by it a figure entirely new to him  it was a young girl of some twelve or fourteen years old in the round white cap worn by all of her age and sex but from beneath it hung down two thick plaits of the darkest hair he had ever seen and though the dress was of the ordinary dark serge with a coloured apron it was put on with an air that made it look like some strange and beautiful costume on the slender lithe little form  the vermilion apron was further trimmed with a narrow border of white edged again with deep blue and it chimed in with the bright coral earrings and necklace as ambrose came forward the creature tried to throw a crimson handkerchief over her head and ran into the shelter of another door but not before ambrose had seen a pair of large dark eyes so like those of a terrified fawn that they seemed to carry him back to the forest  going back amazed he asked his companion who the girl he had seen could have been  will stared  i trow you mean the old blackamoor swordcutlers wench  he is one of those pestilent strangers  an ebrew jew who worships mahound and is too bad for the spanish folk themselves  this rather startled ambrose though he knew enough to see that the accusations could not both be true but he forgot it in the delight when will pronounced the work done of drawing back the curtain and feasting his eyes upon the black backs of the books and the black letter brochures that lay by them  there were scarcely thirty yet he gloated on them as on an inexhaustible store while will whistling wonder at his taste opined that since some one was there to look after the stove and the iron pot on it he might go out and have a turn at ball with hob and martin  ambrose was glad to be left to go over his coming feast  there was latin english and alas baffling dutch  high or low it was all the same to him  what excited his curiosity most was the enchiridion militis christiani of erasmusin latin of course and that he could easily readbut almost equally exciting was a greek and latin vocabulary or again a very thin book in which he recognised the new testament in the vulgate  he had heard chapters of it read from the graceful stone pulpit overhanging the refectory at beaulieu and of course the gospels and epistles at mass but they had been read with little expression and no attention and that sundays discourse had filled him with eagerness to look farther but the mere reading the titles of the books was pleasure enough for the day and his master was at home before he had fixed his mind on anything  perhaps this was as well for lucas advised him what to begin with and how to divide his studies so as to gain a knowledge of the greek his great ambition and also to read the scripture  the master was almost as much delighted as the scholar and it was not till the curfew was beginning to sound that ambrose could tear himself away  it was still daylight and the door of the next dwelling was open  there sitting on the ground crosslegged in an attitude such as ambrose had never seen was a magnificent old man with a huge long white beard wearing indeed the usual dress of a londoner of the lower class but the gown flowed round him in a grand and patriarchal manner corresponding with his noble somewhat aquiline features and behind him ambrose thought he caught a glimpse of the shy fawn he had seen in the morning    chapter xi  ay di me grenada    in sooth it was a thing to weep    if then as now the level plain beneath was spreading like the deep    the broad unruffled main if like a watchtower of the sun    above the alpuxarras rose streaked when the dying day was done    with evenings roseate snows  archbishop trench   when mary tudor released by death from her first dreary marriage contracted for her brothers pleasure had appeased his wrath at her second marriage made to please herself henry viii was only too glad to mark his assent by all manner of festivities and english chroniclers instead of recording battles and politics had only to write of pageantries and tournaments during the merry may of the year 1515a may be it remembered which thanks to the old style was at least ten days nearer to midsummer than our present month  how the two queens and all their court had gone amaying on shooters hill ladies and horses poetically disguised and labelled with sweet summer titles was only a nine days wonder when the birkenholts had come to london but the approaching tournament at westminster on the whitsun holiday was the great excitement to the whole population for with all its faults the court of bluff king hal was thoroughly genial and every one gentle and simple might participate in his pleasures  seats were reserved at the lists for the city dignitaries and their families and though old mistress headley professed that she ought to have done with such vanities she could not forbear from going to see that her son was not too much encumbered with the care of little dennet and that the child herself ran into no mischief  master headley himself grumbled and sighed but he put himself into his scarlet gown holding that his presence was a befitting attention to the king glad to gratify his little daughter and not without a desire to see how his workmanshipgood english wareheld out against mail and plate of milan steel the fine armour brought home from france by the new duke of suffolk  giles donned his best in the expectation of sitting in the places of honour as one of the family and was greatly disgusted when kit smallbones observed whats all that bravery for  the tilting match quotha  ha ha my young springald if thou see it at all thou must be content to gaze as thou canst from the armourers tent if tibble there chooses to be cumbered with a useless lubber like thee  i always sat with my mother when there were matches at clarendon muttered giles who had learnt at least that it was of no use to complain of smallbones plain speaking  if folks cocker malapert lads at sarum we know better here was the answer  i shall ask the master my kinsman returned the youth  but he got little by his move  master headley told him not unkindly for he had some pity for the spoilt lad that not the lord mayor himself would take his own son with him while yet an apprentice  tibble steelman would indeed go to one of the attendants tents at the further end of the lists where repairs to armour and weapons might be needed and would take an assistant or two but who they might be must depend on his own choice and if giles had any desire to go he had better don his working dress  in fact tibble meant to take edmund burgess and one workman for use and one of the new apprentices for pleasure letting them change in the middle of the day  the swagger of giles actually forfeited for him the first turn whichthough he was no favourite with the menwould have been granted to his elder years and his relationship to the master but on his overbearing demand to enter the boat which was to carry down a little anvil and charcoal furnace with a few tools rivets nails and horseshoes tibble coolly returned that he needed no such gay birds but if giles chose to be ready in his leathern coat when stephen birkenholt came home at midday mayhap he might change with him  stephen went joyously in the plainest of attire though tibble in fur cap grimy jerkin and leathern apron was no elegant steersman and edmund who was at the age of youthful foppery shrugged his shoulders a little and disguised the garments of the smithy with his best flat cap and newest mantle  they kept in the wake of the handsome barge which master headley shared with his friend and brother alderman master hope the draper whose young wife in a beautiful black velvet hood and shining blue satin kirtle was evidently petting dennet to her hearts content though the little damsel never lost an opportunity of nodding to her friends in the plainer barge in the rear  the tudor tilting matches cost no lives and seldom broke bones they were chiefly opportunities for the display of brilliant enamelled and gilt armour at the very acme of cumbrous magnificence and of equally gorgeous embroidery spread out over the vast expanse provided by elephantine flemish horses  even if the weapons had not been purposely blunted and if the champions had really desired to slay one another they would have found the task very difficult as in effect they did in the actual game of war but the spectacle was a splendid one and all the apparatus was ready in the armourers tent marked by st george and the dragon tibble ensconced himself in the innermost corner with a tractate borrowed from his friend lucas and sent the apprentices to gaze their fill at the rapidly filling circles of seats  they saw king harry resplendent in gilded armourfrom their own anvil true english steel said edmund proudlyhand to her seat his sister the bride one of the most beautiful women then in existence with a lovely and delicate bloom on her fair face and exquisite plantagenet features  no more royally handsome creatures could the world have offered than that brother and sister and the english world appreciated them and made the lists ring with applause at the fair lady who had disdained foreign princes to wed her true love an honest englishman  hethe cloth of friezein blue milanese armour made to look as classical as possible and with clasps and medals engraven from antique gemshanded in queen katharine whose dark but glowing spanish complexion made a striking contrast to the dazzling fairness of her young sisterinlaw  near them sat a stout burly figure in episcopal purple and at his feet there was a form which nearly took away all stephens pleasure for the time  for it was in motley and he could hear the bells jingle while the hot blood rose in his cheeks in the dread lest burgess should detect the connection or recognise in the jester the grave personage who had come to negotiate with mr headley for his indentures or worse still that the fool should see and claim him  however quipsome hal seemed to be exchanging drolleries with the young dowager of france who sooth to say giggled in a very unqueenly manner at jokes which made the grave spanishborn queen draw up her stately head and converse with a lady on her other handan equally stately lady somewhat older with the straight plantagenet features and by her side a handsome boy who though only eight or nine years was tonsured and had a little scholars gown  that said edmund is my lady countess of salisbury of whom giles headley prates so much  a tournament which was merely a game between gorgeously equipped princes and nobles afforded little scope for adventure worthy of record though it gave great diversion to the spectators  stephen gazed like one fascinated at the gay panoply of horse and man with the huge plumes on the heads of both as they rushed against one another and he shared with edmund the triumph when the lance from their armoury held good the vexation if it were shivered  all would have been perfect but for the sight of his uncle playing off his drolleries in a manner that gave him a sense of personal degradation  to escape from the sight almost consoled him when in the pause after the first courses had been run tibble told him and burgess to return and send headley and another workman with a fresh bundle of lances for the afternoons tilting  stephen further hoped to find his brother at the dragon court as it was one of those holidays that set every one free and separation began to make the brothers value their meetings  but ambrose was not at the dragon court and when stephen went in quest of him to the temple perronel had not seen him since the early morning but she said he seemed so much bitten with the little old mans scholarship that she had small doubt that he would be found poring over a book in warwick inner yard  thither therefore did stephen repair  the place was nearly deserted for the inhabitants were mostly either artisans or that far too numerous race who lived on the doles of convents on the alms of churchgoers and the largesses scattered among the people on public occasions and these were for the most part pursuing their vocation both of gazing and looking out for gain among the spectators outside the lists  the door that stephen had been shown as that of ambroses master was however partly open and close beside it sat in the sun a figure that amazed him  on a small mat or rug with a black and yellow handkerchief over her head and little scarlet legs crossed under a blue dress all lighted up by the gay may sun there slept the little dark glowing maiden with her head best as it leant against the wall her rosy lips half open her long black plaits on her shoulders  stepping up to the halfopen door whence he heard a voice reading his astonishment was increased  at the table were his brother and his master ambrose with a black book in hand lucas hansen with some papers and on the ground was seated a venerable whitebearded old man something between stephens notions of an apostle and of a magician though the latter idea predominated at sight of a long parchment scroll covered with characters such as belonged to no alphabet that he had ever dreamt of  what were they doing to his brother  he was absolutely in an enchanters den  was it a pixy at the door guarding it  ambrose he cried aloud  everybody started  ambrose sprang to his feet exclaiming stephen  the pixy gave a little scream and jumped up flying to the old man who quietly rolled up his scroll  lucas rose up as ambrose spoke  thy brother said he  yeacome in search of me said ambrose  thou hadst best go forth with him said lucas  it is not well that youth should study over long said the old man  thou hast aided us well but do thou now unbend the bow peace be with thee my son  ambrose complied but scarcely willingly and the instant they had made a few steps from the door stephen exclaimed in dismay who what was it  have they bewitched thee ambrose  ambrose laughed merrily  not so  it is holy lore that those good men are reading  nay now ambrose  stand stillif thou canst poor fellow he muttered and then made the sign of the cross three times over his brother who stood smiling and said art satisfied stevie  or wilt have me rehearse my credo  which he did stephen listening critically and drawing a long breath as he recognised each word pronounced without a shudder at the critical points  thou art safe so far said stephen  but sure he is a wizard  i even beheld his familiar spiritin a fair shape doubtlesslike a pixy  be not deceived brother  sorcery reads backwardsand i saw him so read from that scroll of his  laughest thou  nay what shall i do to free thee  enter here  stephen dragged his brother still laughing into the porch of the nearest church and deluged him with holy water with such good will that ambrose putting up his hands to shield his eyes exclaimed come now have done with this folly stephenthough it makes me laugh to think of thy scared looks and poor little aldonza being taken for a familiar spirit  and ambrose laughed as he had not laughed for weeks  but what is it then  the old man is of thy calling or something like it stephen being that he maketh and tempereth swordblades after the prime damascene or toledo fashion and the familiar spirit is his little daughter  stephen did not however look mollified  swordblades  none have a right to make them save our craft  this is one of the rascaille spaniards who have poured into the city under favour of the queen to spoil and ruin the lawful trade  though could you but have seen ambrose how our tough english ashwood in king harrys handfrom our own armoury toomade all go down before it you would never uphold strangers and their false wares that can only get the better by sorcery  how thou dost harp upon sorcery exclaimed ambrose  i must tell thee the good old mans story as twas told to me and then wilt thou own that he is as good a christian as ourselvesay or better and hath little cause to love the spaniards  come on then said stephen  methought if we went towards westminster we might yet get where we could see the lists  such a rare show ambrose to see the king in english armour ay and master headleys every inch of it glittering in the sun so that one could scarce brook the dazzling on his horse like a rock shattering all that came against him  i warrant you the lances cracked and shivered like faggots under old purkiss billhook  and that you should liefer pore over crabbed monkish stuff with yonder old men  my life on it there must be some spell  no more than of old when i was ever for book and thou for bow said ambrose but ill make thee rueful for old michael yet  hast heard tell of the moors in spain  moorsblackamoors who worship mahound and termagant  i saw a blackamoor last week behind his master a merchant of genoa in pauls walk  he looked like the devils in the miracle play at christ church with blubber lips and wool for hair  i marvelled that he did not writhe and flee when he came within the minster but ned burgess said he was a christened man  moors be not all black neither be they all worshippers of mahound replied ambrose  however as ambroses information though a few degrees more correct and intelligent than his brothers was not complete it will be better not to give the history of lucass strange visitors in his words  they belonged to the race of saracen arabs who had brought the arts of life to such perfection in southern spain but who had received the general appellation of moors from those africans who were continually reinforcing them and bringing a certain puritan strictness of mohammedanism with them had done much towards destroying the highest cultivation among them before the spanish kingdoms became united and finally triumphed over them  during the long interval of two centuries while castille was occupied by internal wars and aragon by italian conquests there had been little aggression on the moorish borderland and a good deal of friendly intercourse both in the way of traffic and of courtesy nor had the bitter persecution and distrust of new converts then set in which followed the entire conquest of granada  thus when ronda was one of the first moorish cities to surrender a great merchant of the unrivalled swordblades whose secret had been brought from damascus had with all his family been accepted gladly when he declared himself ready to submit and receive baptism  miguel abenali was one of the sons and though his conversion had at first been mere compliance with his fathers will and the family interests he had become sufficiently convinced of christian truth not to take part with his own people in the final struggle  still however the inbred abhorrence of idolatry had influenced his manner of worship and when after half a lifetime granada had fallen and the inquisition had begun to take cognisance of new christians from among the moors as well as the jews there were not lacking spies to report the absence of all sacred images or symbols from the house of the wealthy merchant and that neither he nor any of his family had been seen kneeling before the shrine of nuestra senora the sons of abenali did indeed feel strongly the power of the national reaction and revolted from the religion which they saw cruelly enforced on their conquered countrymen  the moor had been viewed as a gallant enemy the morisco was only a being to be distrusted and persecuted and the efforts of the good bishop of granada who had caused the psalms gospels and large portions of the breviary to be translated into arabic were frustrated by the zeal of those who imagined that heresy lurked in the vernacular and perhaps that objections to popular practices might be strengthened  by order of cardinal ximenes these arabic versions were taken away and burnt but miguel abenali had secured his own copy and it was what he there learnt that withheld him from flying to his countrymen and resuming their faith when he found that the christianity he had professed for forty years was no longer a protection to him  having known the true christ in the gospel he could not turn back to mohammed even though christians persecuted in the name they so little understood  the crisis came in 1507 when ximenes apparently impelled by the dread that simulated conformity should corrupt the church quickened the persecution of the doubtful nuevos cristianos and the abenali family who had made themselves loved and respected received warning that they had been denounced and that their only hope lay in flight  the two sons highspirited young men on whom religion had far less hold than national feeling fled to the alpuxarra mountains and renouncing the faith of the persecutors joined their countrymen in their gallant and desperate warfare  their mother who had long been dead had never been more than an outward christian but the second wife of abenali shared his belief and devotion with the intelligence and force of character sometimes found among the moorish ladies of spain  she and her little ones fled with him in disguise to cadiz with the precious arabic scriptures rolled round their waists and took shelter with an english merchant who had had dealings in swordblades with senor miguel and had been entertained by him in his beautiful saracenic house at ronda with eastern hospitality  this he requited by giving them the opportunity of sailing for england in a vessel laden with xeres sack but the misery of the voyage across the bay of biscay in a ship fit for nothing but wine was excessive and creatures reared in the lovely climate and refined luxury of the land of the palm and orange exhausted too already by the toils of the mountain journey were incapable of enduring it and abenalis brave wife and one of her children were left beneath the waves of the atlantic  with the one little girl left to him he arrived in london and the recommendation of his cadiz friend obtained for him work from a dealer in foreign weapons who was not unwilling to procure them nearer home  happily for him moorish masters however rich were always required to be proficients in their own trade and thus miguel or michael as he was known in england was able to maintain himself and his child by the fabrication of blades that no one could distinguish from those of damascus  their perfection was a work of infinite skill labour and industry but they were so costly that their price and an occasional job of inlaying gold in other metal sufficed to maintain the old man and his little daughter  the armourers themselves were sometimes forced to have recourse to him though unwillingly for he was looked on with distrust and dislike as an interloper of foreign birth belonging to no guild  a biscayan or castillian of the oldest christian blood incurred exactly the same obloquy from the mass of london craftsmen and apprentices and lucas himself had small measure of favour though dutchmen were less alien to the english mind than spaniards and his trade did not lead to so much rivalry and competition  as much of this as ambrose knew or understood he told to stephen who listened in a good deal of bewilderment understanding very little but with a strong instinct that his brothers love of learning was leading him into dangerous company  and what were they doing on this fine may holiday when every one ought to be out enjoying themselves  well if thou wilt know said ambrose pushed hard there is one master william tindal who hath been doing part of the blessed evangel into english and for better certainty of its correctness master michael was comparing it with his arabic version while i overlooked the latin  o ambrose thou wilt surely run into trouble  know you not how nurse joan used to tell us of the burning of the lollard books  nay nay stevie this is no heresy  tis such work as the great scholar master erasmus is busied onay and he is loved and honoured by both the archbishops and the kings grace  ask tibble steelman what he thinks thereof  tibble steelman would think nought of a beggarly stranger calling himself a sword cutler and practising the craft without prenticeship or license said stephen swelling with indignation come on ambrose and sweep the cobwebs from thy brain  if we cannot get into our own tent again we can mingle with the outskirts and learn how the day is going and how our lances and breastplates have stood where the knaves at the eagle have gone like reeds and eggshellsjust as i threw george bates the prentice at the eagle yesterday in a wrestling match at the butts with the trick old diggory taught me    chapter xii  a king in a quagmire       for my pastance hunt sing and dance my heart is set all godly sport to my comfort who shall me let  the kings balade attributed to henry viii   life was a rough hearty thing in the early sixteenth century strangely divided between thought and folly hardship and splendour misery and merriment toil and sport  the youths in the armourers household had experienced little of this as yet in their country life but in london they could not but soon begin to taste both sides of the matter  master headley himself was a good deal taken up with city affairs and left the details of his business to tibble steelman and kit smallbones though he might always appear on the scene and he had a wonderful knowledge of what was going on  the breakingin and training of the two new country lads was entirely left to them and to edmund burgess  giles soon found that complaints were of no avail and only made matters harder for him and that tibble steelman and kit smallbones had no notion of favouring their masters cousin  poor fellow he was very miserable in those first weeks  the actual toil to which he was an absolute novice though nominally three years an apprentice made his hands raw and his joints full of aches while his groans met with nothing but laughter and he recognised with great displeasure that more was laid on him than on stephen birkenholt  this was partly in consideration of stephens youth partly of his ready zeal and cheerfulness  his hands might be sore too but he was rather proud of it than otherwise and his hero worship of kit smallbones made him run on errands tug at the bellows staff or fetch whatever was called for with a bright alacrity that won the foremens hearts and it was noted that he who was really a gentleman had none of the airs that giles headley showed  giles began by some amount of bullying by way of slaking his wrath at the preference shown for one whom he continued to style a beggarly brat picked up on the heath but stephen was goodhumoured and accustomed to give and take and they both found their level as well in the dragon court as among the world outside where the london prentices were a strong and redoubtable body with rude not to say cruel rites of initiation among themselves plenty of rivalries and enmities between house and house guild and guild but a united not to say ferocious esprit de corps against every one else  fisticuffs and wrestlings were the amenities that passed between them though always with a love of fair play so long as no cowardice or what was looked on as such was shown for there was no mercy for the weak or weakly  such had better betake themselves at once to the cloister or life was made intolerable by constant jeers blows baiting and huntings often it must be owned absolutely brutal  stephen and giles had however passed through this ordeal  the letter to john birkenholt had been despatched by a trusty clerk riding with the judges of assize whom mistress perronel knew might be safely trusted and who actually brought back a letter which might have emanated from the most affectionate of brothers giving his authority for the binding stephen apprentice to the worshipful master giles headley and sending the remainder of the boys portion  stephen was thereupon regularly bound apprentice to master headley it was a solemn affair which took place in the armourers hall in coleman street before sundry witnesses  harry randall in his soberest garb and demeanour acted as guardian to his nephew and presented him clad in the regulation prentice garbflat round cap closecut hair narrow falling bands coarse side coat close hose cloth stockings coat with the badge of the armourers company and master headleys own dragons tail on the sleeve to which was added a blue cloak marked in like manner  the instructions to apprentices were rehearsed beginning ye shall constantly and devoutly on your knees every day serve god morning and eveningpledging him to avoid evil company to make speedy return when sent on his masters business to be fair gentle and lowly in speech and carriage with all men and the like  mutual promises were interchanged between him and his master stephen on his knees the indentures were signed for quipsome hal could with much ado produce an autograph signature though his penmanship went no further and the occasion was celebrated by a great dinner of the whole craft at the armourers hall to which the principal craftsmen who had been apprentices such as tibble steelman and kit smallbones were invited sitting at a lower table while the masters had the higher one on the dais and a third was reserved for the apprentices after they should have waited on their mastersin fact it was an imitation of the orders of chivalry knights squires and pages and the gradation of rank was as strictly observed as by the nobility  giles considering the feast to be entirely in his honour though the transfer of his indentures had been made at salisbury endeavoured to come out in some of his bravery but was admonished that such presumption might be punished the first time at his masters discretion the second time by a whipping at the hall of his company and the third time by six months being added to the term of his apprenticeship  master randall was entertained in the place of honour where he comported himself with great gravity though he could not resist alarming stephen with an occasional wink or gesture as the boy approached in the course of the duties of waiting at the upper boarda splendid sight with cups and flagons of gold and silver with venison and capons and all that a city banquet could command before the invention of the turtle  there was drinking of toasts and among the foremost was that of wolsey who had freshly received his nomination of cardinal and whose hat was on its way from romeand here the jester could not help betraying his knowledge of the domestic policy of the household and telling the company how it had become known that the scarlet hat was actually on the way but in a varlets budgeta mere italian common knave no better than myself quoth quipsome hal whereat his nephew trembled standing behind his chair forgetting that the decorous solid man in the sadcoloured gown and wellcrimped ruff neatest of perronels performances was no such base comparison for any varlet  hal went on to describe however how my lord of york had instantly sent to stay the messenger on his handing at dover and equip him with all manner of costly silks by way of apparel and with attendants such as might do justice to his freight that so he said men may not rate it but as a scarlet cocks comb since all men be but fools and the sole question is who among them hath wit enough to live by his folly  therewith he gave a wink that so disconcerted stephen as nearly to cause an upset of the bowl of perfumed water that he was bringing for the washing of hands  master headley however suspected nothing and invited the grave master randall to attend the domestic festival on the presentation of poor springs effigy at the shrine of st julian  this was to take place early in the morning of the 14th of september holy cross day the last holiday in the year that had any of the glory of summer about it and on which the apprentices claimed a prescriptive right to go out nutting in st johns wood and to carry home their spoil to the lasses of their acquaintance  tibble steelman had completed the figure in bronze with a silver collar and chain not quite without protest that the sum had better have been bestowed in alms  but from his masters point of view this would have been giving to a pack of lying beggars and thieves what was due to the holy saint no one save tibble who could do and say what he chose could have ventured on a word of remonstrance on such a subject and as the full tide of iconoclasm consequent on the discovery of the original wording of the second commandment had not yet set in tibble had no more conscientious scruple against making the figure than in moulding a little straighttailed lion for lord harry percys helmet  so the party in early morning heard their mass and then repairing to st julians pillar while the rising sun came peeping through the low eastern window of the vaulted church of st faith master headley on his knees gave thanks for his preservation and then put forward his little daughter holding on her joined hands the figure of poor spring couchant and beautifully modelled in bronze with all tibbles best skill  hal randall and ambrose had both come up from the little home where perronel presided for the hour was too early for the jesters absence to be remarked in the luxurious household of the cardinal elect and he even came to break his fast afterwards at the dragon court and held such interesting discourse with old dame headley on the farthingales and coifs of queen katharine and her ladies that she pronounced him a man wondrous wise and understanding and declared stephen happy in the possession of such a kinsman  and whither away now youngsters he said as he rose from table  to st johns wood  the good greenwood uncle said ambrose  thou too ambrose said stephen joyfully  for once away from thine ink and thy books  ay said ambrose mine heart warms to the woodlands once more uncle would that thou couldst come  would that i could boy  we three would show these lads of cockayne what three foresters know of wood craft  but it may not be  were i once there the old blood might stir again and i might bring you into trouble and ye have not two faces under one hood as i have  so fare ye well i wish you many a bagful of nuts  the four months of city life albeit the city was little bigger than our moderate sized country towns and far from being an unbroken mass of houses had yet made the two young foresters delighted to enjoy a day of thorough country in one anothers society  little dennet longed to go with them but the prentice world was far too rude for little maidens to be trusted in it and her father held out hopes of going one of these days to high park as he called it while edmund and stephen promised her all their nuts and as many blackberries as could be held in their flat caps  giles has promised me none said dennet with a pouting lip nor ambrose  why sure little mistress thoult have enough to crack thy teeth on said edmund burgess  they ought to bring theirs to me returned the little heiress of the dragon court with an air of offended dignity that might have suited the heiress of the kingdom  giles who looked on dennet as a kind of needful appendage to the dragon a piece of property of his own about whom he need take no trouble merely laughed and said want must be thy master then but ambrose treated her petulance in another fashion  look here pretty mistress said he there dwells by me a poor little maid nigh about thine age who never goeth further out than to st pauls minster nor plucketh flower nor hath sweet cake nor manchet bread nor sugarstick nay and scarce ever saw english hazelnut nor blackberry  tis for her that i want to gather them  is she thy masters daughter demanded dennet who could admit the claims of another princess  nay my master hath no children but she dwelleth near him  i will send her some and likewise of mine own comfits and cakes said mistress dennet  only thou must bring all to me first  ambrose laughed and said its a bargain then little mistress  i keep my word returned dennet marching away while ambrose obeyed a summons from goodnatured mistress headley to have his wallet filled with bread and cheese like those of her own prentices  off went the lads under the guidance of edmund burgess meeting parties of their own kind at every turn soon leaving behind them the city bounds as they passed under new gate and by and by skirting the fields of the great carthusian monastery or charter house with the burialground given by sir walter manny at the time of the black death  beyond came marshy ground through which they had to pick their way carefully over steppingstonesthis being no other than what is now the regents park not yet in any degree drained by the new river but all quaking ground overgrown with rough grass and marshplants through which stephen and ambrose bounded by the help of stout poles with feet and eyes well used to bogs and knowing where to look for a safe footing while many a flatcapped london lad floundered about and sank over his yellow ankles or left his shoes behind him while lapwings shrieked pee wheet and almost flapped him with their broad wings and moorhens dived in the dark pools and wild ducks rose in long families  stephen was able to turn the laugh against his chief adversary and rival george bates of the eagle who proposed seeking for the lapwings nest in hopes of a dainty dish of plovers eggs being too great a cockney to remember that in september the contents of the eggs were probably flying over the heather as well able to shift for themselves as their parents  above all things the london prentices were pugnacious but as every one joined in the laugh against george and he was besides stuck fast on a quaking tussock of grass afraid to proceed or advance he could not have his revenge  and when the slough was passed and the slight rise leading to the copse of st johns wood was attained behold it was found to be in possession of the lower sort of lads the black guard as they were called  they were of course quite as ready to fight with the prentices as the prentices were with them and a battle royal took place all along the front of the hazel bushesin which stephen of the dragon and george of the eagle fought side by side  sticks and fists were the weapons and there were no very severe casualties before the prentices being the larger number as well as the stouter and better fed had routed their adversaries and driven them off towards harrow  there was crackling of boughs and filling of bags and cracking of nuts and wild cries in pursuit of startled hare or rabbit and though ambrose and stephen indignantly repelled the idea of st johns wood being named in the same day with their native forest it is doubtful whether they had ever enjoyed themselves more until just as they were about to turn homeward whether moved by his hostility to stephen or by envy at the capful of juicy blackberries carefully covered with green leaves george bates rushing up from behind shouted out heres a skulker  heres one of the black guard  off to thy fellows varlet at the same time dealing a dexterous blow under the cap which sent the blackberries up into ambroses face  ha ha shouted the illconditioned fellow  so much for a knave that serves rascally strangers  here hand over that bag of nuts  ambrose was no fighter but in defence of the bag that was to purchase a treat for little aldonza he clenched his fists and bade george bates come and take them if he would  the quiet scholarly boy was however no match for the young armourer and made but poor reply to the buffets of his adversary who had hold of the bag and was nearly choking him with the string round his neck  however stephen had already missed his brother and turning round shouted out that the villain bates was mauling him and rushed back falling on ambroses assailant with a sudden welldirected pounding that made him hastily turn about with cries of two against one  not at all said stephen  stand by ambrose ill give the coward his deserts  in fact though the boys were nearly of a size george somewhat the biggest stephens country activity and perhaps the higher spirit of his gentle blood generally gave him the advantage and on this occasion he soon reduced bates to roar for mercy  thou must purchase it said stephen  thy bag of nuts in return for the berries thou hast wasted  peaceable ambrose would have remonstrated but stephen was implacable  he cut the string and captured the bag then with a parting kick bade bates go after his comrades for his eagle was nought but a thieving kite  bates made off pretty quickly but the two brothers tarried a little to see how much damage the blackberries had suffered and to repair the losses as they descended into the bog by gathering some choice dewberries  i marvel these fine fellows scaped our company said stephen presently  are we in the right track thinkst thou  here is a pool i marked not before said ambrose anxiously  nay we cant be far astray while we see st pauls spire and the tower full before us said stephen  plainer marks than we had at home  that may be  only where is the safe footing said ambrose  i wish we had not lost sight of the others  pish what good are a pack of city lubbers returned stephen dont we know a quagmire when we see one better than they do  hark they are shouting for us  not they  thats a falconers call  theres another whistle see theres the hawk  shes going down the wind as im alive and stephen began to bound wildly along making all the sounds and calls by which falcons were recalled and holding up as a lure a lapwing which he had knocked down  ambrose by no means so confident in bogtrotting as his brother stood still to await him hearing the calls and shouts of the falconer coming nearer and presently seeing a figure flying by the help of a pole over the pools and dykes that here made some attempt at draining the waste suddenly in mid career over one of these broad ditches there was a collapse and a lusty shout for help as the form disappeared ambrose instantly perceived what had happened the leaping pole had broken to the downfall of its owner  forgetting all his doubts as to bogholes and morasses he grasped his own pole and sprang from tussock to tussock till he had reached the bank of the ditch or watercourse in which the unfortunate sportsman was floundering  he was a large powerful man but this was of no avail for the slough afforded no foothold  the further side was a steep built up of sods the nearer sloped down gradually and though it was not apparently very deep the efforts of the victim to struggle out had done nothing but churn up a mass of black muddy water in which he sank deeper every moment and it was already nearly to his shoulders when with a cry of joy half choked however by the mud he cried ha my good lad  are there any more of ye  not nigh i fear said ambrose beholding with some dismay the breadth of the shoulders which were all that appeared above the turbid water  soh  lie down boy behind that bunch of osier  hold out thy pole  let me see thine hands  thou art but a straw but our lady be my speed  now hangs england on a pair of wrists  there was a great struggle an absolute effort for life and but for the osier stump ambrose would certainly have been dragged into the water when the man had worked along the pole and grasping his hands pulled himself upwards  happily the sides of the dyke became harder higher up and did not instantly yield to the pressure of his knees and by the time ambroses hands and shoulders felt nearly wrenched from their sockets the stem of the osier had been attained and in another minute the rescued man bareheaded plastered with mud and streaming with water sat by him on the bank panting gasping and trying to gather breath and clear his throat from the mud he had swallowed  thanks good lad well done he articulated  those fellows where are they  and feeling in his bosom he brought out a gold whistle suspended by a chain  blow it he said taking off the chain my mouth is too full of slime  ambrose blew a loud shrill call but it seemed to reach no one but stephen whom he presently saw dashing towards them  here is my brother coming sir he said as he gave his endeavours to help the stranger to free himself from the mud that clung to him and which was in some places thick enough to be scraped off with a knife  he kept up a continual interchange of exclamations at his plight whistles and shouts for his people and imprecations on their tardiness until stephen was near enough to show that the hawk had been recovered and then he joyfully called out ha hast thou got her  why flatcaps as ye are ye put all my fellows to shame how now thou errant bird dost know thy master or take him for a mud wall  kite that thou art to have led me such a dance  and whats your name my brave lads  ye must have been bred to wood craft  ambrose explained both their parentage and their present occupation but was apparently heeded but little  wot ye how to get out of this quagmire was the question  i never was here before sir said stephen but yonder lies the tower and if we keep along by this dyke it must lead us out somewhere  well said boy i must be moving or the mud will dry on me and i shall stand here as though i were turned to stone by the gorgons head  so have with thee  go on first master hawktamer  what will bear thee will bear me  there was an imperative tone about him that surprised the brothers and ambrose looking at him from head to foot felt sure that it was some great man at the least whom it had been his hap to rescue indeed he began to have further suspicions when they came to a pool of clearer water beyond which was firmer ground and the stranger with an exclamation of joy borrowed stephens cap and scooping up the water with it washed his face and head disclosing the golden hair and beard fair complexion and handsome square face he had seen more than once before  he whispered to stephen tis the king  ha ha laughed henry hast found him out lads  well it may not be the worse for ye  pity thou shouldst not be in the forest still my young falconer but we know our good city of london to well to break thy indentures  and thou  he was turning to ambrose when further shouts were heard  the king hallooed and bade the boys do so and in a few moments more they were surrounded by the rest of the hawking party full of dismay at the kings condition and deprecating his anger for having lost him  yea said henry an it had not been for this good lad ye would never have heard more of the majesty of england  swallowed in a quagmire had made a new end for a king and ye would have to brook the little scot  the gentlemen who had come up were profuse in lamentations  a horse was brought up for the kings use and he prepared to mount being in haste to get into dry clothes  he turned round however to the boys and said ill not forget you my lads  keep that he added as ambrose on his knee would have given him back the whistle tis a token that maybe will serve thee for i shall know it again  and thou my blackeyed ladmy purse howard  he handed the purse to stephena velvet hag richly wrought with gold and containing ten gold angels besides smaller moneybidding them divide like good brothers as he saw they were and then galloped off with his train  twilight was coming on but following in the direction of the riders the boys were soon on the islington road  the new gate was shut by the time they reached it and their explanation that they were belated after a nutting expedition would not have served them had not stephen produced the sum of twopence which softened the surliness of the guard  it was already dark and though curfew had not yet sounded preparations were making for lighting the watchfires in the open spaces and throwing chains across the streets but the little door in the dragon court was open and ambrose went in with his brother to deliver up his nuts to dennet and claim her promise of sending a share to aldonza  they found their uncle in his sober array sitting by master headley who was rating edmund and giles for having lost sight of them the latter excusing himself by grumbling out that he could not be marking all stephens brawls with george bates  when the two wanderers appeared relief took the form of anger and there were sharp demands why they had loitered  their story was listened to with many exclamations  dennet jumped for joy her grandmother advised that the angels should be consigned to her own safe keeping and when master headley heard of henrys scruples about the indentures he declared that it was a rare wise king who knew that an honest craft was better than court favour  yet mayhap he might do something for thee friend ambrose added the armourer  commend thee to some post in his chapel royal or put thee into some college since such is thy turn  how sayst thou master randall shall he send in this same token and make his petition  if a fooif a plain man may be heard where the wise hath spoken said randall he had best abstain  kings love not to be minded of mishaps and our hals humour is not to be reckoned on  lay up the toy in case of need but an thou claim overmuch he may mind thee in a fashion not to thy taste  sure our king is of a more generous mould exclaimed mrs headley  he is like other men good mistress just as you know how to have him and he is scarce like to be willing to be minded of the taste of mire or of floundering like a hog in a salt marsh  ha ha and quipsome hal went off into such a laugh as might have betrayed his identity to any one more accustomed to the grimaces of his professional character but which only infected the others with the same contagious merriment  come thou home now he said to ambrose my good woman hath been in a mortal fright about thee and would have me come out to seek after thee  such are the women folk master headley  let them have but a lad to look after and theyll bleat after him like an old ewe that has lost her lamb  ambrose only stayed for dennet to divide the spoil and though the blackberries had all been lost or crushed the little maiden kept her promise generously and filled the bag not only with nuts but with three redchecked apples and a handful of comfits for the poor little maid who never tasted fruit or sweets    chapter xiii  a london holiday    up then spoke the apprentices tall living in london one and all  old ballad   another of the many holidays of the londoners was enjoyed on the occasion of the installation of thomas wolsey as cardinal of st cecilia and papal legate  a whole assembly of prelates and lusty gallant gentlemen rode out to blackheath to meet the roman envoy who robed in full splendour with st peters keys embroidered on back and breast and on the housings of his mule appeared at the head of a gallant train in the papal liveries two of whom carried the gilded pillars the insignia of office and two more a scarlet and goldcovered box or casket containing the cardinals hat  probably no such reception of the dignity was ever prepared elsewhere and all was calculated to give magnificent ideas of the office of cardinal and of the power of the pope to those who had not been let into the secret that the messenger had been met at dover and thus magnificently fitted out to satisfy the requirements of the butchers son of ipswich and of one of the most ostentatious of courts  old gaffer martin fulford had muttered in his bed that such pomp had not been the way in the time of the true old royal blood and that display had come in with the upstart slips of the red roseas he still chose to style the tudors and he maundered away about the beauty and affability of edward iv till nobody could understand him and perronel only threw in her ay grandad or yea gaffer when she thought it was expected of her  ambrose had an unfailing appetite for the sermons of dean colet who was to preach on this occasion in westminster abbey and his uncle had given him counsel how to obtain standing ground there entering before the procession  he was alone his friends tibble and lucas both had that part of the lollard temper which loathed the pride and wealth of the great political clergy and in spite of their admiration for the dean they could not quite forgive his taking part in the pomp of such a rare show  but ambroses devotion to the dean to say nothing of youthful curiosity outweighed all those scruples and as he listened he was carried along by the curious sermon in which the preacher likened the orders of the hierarchy below to that of the nine orders of the angels making the rank of cardinal correspond to that of the seraphim aglow with love  of that holy flame the scarlet robes were the type to the spiritualised mind of colet while others saw in them only the relic of the imperial purple of old rome and some beheld them as the token that wolsey was one step nearer the supreme height that he coveted so earnestly  but the great and successful man found himself personally addressed bidden not to be puffed up with his own greatness and stringently reminded of the highest example of humility shown that he that exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself be exalted  the preacher concluded with a strong personal exhortation to do righteousness and justice alike to rich and poor joined with truth and mercy setting god always before him  the sermon ended wolsey knelt at the altar and archbishop wareham who like his immediate predecessors held legatine authority performed the act of investiture placing the scarlet hat with its many hoops and tassels on his brother primates head after which a magnificent te deum rang through the beautiful church and the procession of prelates peers and ecclesiastics of all ranks in their richest array formed to escort the new cardinal to banquet at his palace with the king and queen  ambrose stationed by a column let the throng rush tumble and jostle one another to behold the show till the abbey was nearly empty while he tried to work out the perplexing question whether all this pomp and splendour were truly for the glory of god or whether it were a delusion for the temptation of mens souls  it was a debate on which his old and his new guides seemed to him at issue and he was drawn in both directionsnow by the beauty order and deep symbolism of the catholic ritual now by the spirituality and earnestness of the men among whom he lived  at one moment the worldly pomp the mechanical and irreverent worship and the gross and vicious habits of many of the clergy repelled him at another the reverence and conservatism of his nature held him fast  presently he felt a hand on his shoulder and started lost in a stud as we say at home boy said the jester resplendent in a bran new motley suit  wilt come in to the banquet  tis open house and i can find thee a seat without disclosing the kinship that sits so sore on thy brother  where is he  i have not seen him this day  that did i returned randall as i rode by on mine ass  he was ruffling it so lustily that i could not but give him a wink the which my gentleman could by no means stomach  poor lad  yet there be times ambrose when i feel in sooth that mine office is the only honourable one since who besides can speak truth  i love my lord he is a kind openhanded master and theres none i would so willingly serve whether by jest or earnest but what is he but that which i oft call him in jokethe greater fool than i selling peace and ease truth and hope this life and the next for yonder scarlet hat which is after all of no more worth than this jingling head gear of mine  deafening the spiritual ears far more it may be said ambrose since humiles exallaverint  it was no small shock that there in the midst of the nave the answer was a bound like a ball almost as high as the capital of the column by which they stood  theres exaltation said randall in a low voice and ambrose perceived that some strangers were in sight  come seek thy brother out boy and bring him to the banquet  ill speak a word to peter porter and hell let you in therell be plenty of fooling all the afternoon before my namesake king hal who can afford to be an honester man in his fooling than any about him and whose laugh at a hearty jest is goodly to hear  ambrose thanked him and undertook the quest  they parted at the great west door of the abbey where by way of vindicating his own character for buffoonery randall exclaimed where be mine ass and not seeing the animal immediately declared there he is and at the same time sprang upon the back and shoulders of a gaping and astonished clown who was gazing at the rear of the procession  the crowd applauded with shouts of coarse laughter but a man who seemed to belong to the victim broke in with an angry oath and how now sir  i cry you mercy quoth the jester twas mine own ass i sought and if i have fallen on thine i will but ride him to york house and then restore him  so ho good jackass crossing his ankles on the poor fellows chest so that he could not be shaken off  the comrade lifted a cudgel but there was a general cry of my lord cardinals jester lay not a finger on him  but harry randall was not one to brook immunity on the score of his masters greatness  in another second he was on his feet had wrested the staff from the hands of his astounded beast of burden flourished it round his head after the most approved manner of shirley champions at lyndhurst fair and called to his adversary to come on  it did not take many rounds before hals dexterity had floored his adversary and the shouts of well struck merry fool  well played quipsome hal were rising high when the abbot of westminsters yeomen were seen making way through the throng which fell back in terror on either side as they came to seize on the brawlers in their sacred precincts  but here again my lord cardinals fool was a privileged person and no one laid a hand on him though his blood being up he would spite of his gay attire have enjoyed a fight on equal terms  his quadruped donkey was brought up to him amid general applause but when he looked round for ambrose the boy had disappeared  the better and finer the nature that displayed itself in randall the more painful was the sight of his buffooneries to his nephew and at the first leap ambrose had hurried away in confusion  he sought his brother here there everywhere and at last came to the conclusion that stephen must have gone home to dinner  he walked quickly across the fields separating westminster from the city of london hoping to reach cheapside before the lads of the dragon should have gone out again but just as he was near st pauls coming round amen corner he heard the sounds of a fray  have at the country lubbers  away with the moonrakers  flatcaps come on  hey lads of the eagle  down with the dragons  adders snakesss sss  there was a kicking struggling mass of blue backs and yellow legs before him from out of which came yah  down with the eagles cowards  kites  cockneys  there were plenty of boys men women with children in their arms hallooing on well done eagle  go it dragon  the word dragon filled the quiet ambrose with hot impulse to defend his brother  all his gentle scholarly habits gave way before that cry and a shout that he took to be stephens voice in the midst of the melee  he was fairly carried out of himself and doubling his fists fell on the back of the nearest boys intending to break through to his brother and he found an unexpected ally  will wherrys voice called out have with you comradeand a pair of hands and arms considerably stouter and more used to fighting than his own began to pommel right and left with such good will that they soon broke through to the aid of their friends and not before it was time for stephen giles and edmund with their backs against the wall were defending themselves with all their might against tremendous odds and just as the new allies reached them a sharp stone struck giles in the eye and levelled him with the ground his head striking against the wall  whether it were from alarm at his fall or at the unexpected attack in the rear or probably from both causes the assailants dispersed in all directions without waiting to perceive how slender the succouring force really was  edmund and stephen were raising up the unlucky giles who lay quite insensible with blood pouring from his eye  ambrose tried to wipe it away and there were anxious doubts whether the eye itself were safe  they were some way from home and giles was the biggest and heaviest of them all  would that kit smallbones were here said stephen preparing to take the feet while edmund took the shoulders  look here said will wherry pulling ambroses sleeve our yard is much nearer and the old moor master michael is safe to know what to do for him  that sort of cattle always are leeches  he wiled the pain from my thumb when twas crushed in our printing press  mayhap if he put some salve to him he might get home on his own feet  edmund listened  theres reason in that he said  dost know this leech ambrose  i know him well  he is a good old man and wondrous wise  nay no black arts but he saith his folk had great skill in herbs and the like and though he be no physician by trade he hath much of their lore  have with thee then returned edmund the rather that giles is no small weight and the guard might come on us ere we reached the dragon  or those cowardly rogues of the eagle might set on us again added stephen and as they went on their way to warwick inner yard he explained that the cause of the encounter had been that giles had thought fit to prank himself in his fathers silver chain and thus george bates always owing the dragon a grudge and rendered specially malicious since the encounter on holy rood day had raised the cry against him and caused all the flatcaps around to make a rush at the gaud as lawful prey  tis clean against prentice statutes to wear one is it not asked ambrose  ay returned stephen yet none of us but would stand up for our own comrade against those meddling fellows of the eagle  but added edmund we must beware the guard for if they looked into the cause of the fray our master might be called on to give giles a whipping in the companys hall this being a second offence of going abroad in these vanities  ambrose went on before to prepare miguel abenali and entreat his good offices explaining that the youths master who was also his kinsman would be sure to give handsome payment for any good offices to him  he scarcely got out half the words the grand old arab waved his hand and said when the wounded is laid before the tent of ben ali where is the question of recompense  peace be with thee my son  bring him hither  aldonza lay the carpet yonder and the cushions beneath the window where i may have light to look to his hurt  therewith he murmured a few words in an unknown tongue which as ambrose understood were an invocation to the god of abraham to bless his endeavours to heal the stranger youth but which happily were spoken before the arrival of the others who would certainly have believed them an incantation  the carpet though worn threadbare was a beautiful old moorish rug once glowing with brilliancy and still rich in colouring and the cushion was of thick damask faded to a strange pale green  all in that doublestalled partition once belonging to the great earls warhorses was scrupulously clean for the christian moor had retained some of the peculiar virtues born of mohammedanism and of high civilisation  the apprentice lads tramped in much as if they had been entering a wizards cave though stephen had taken care to assure edmund of his application of the test of holy water  following the old mans directions edmund and stephen deposited their burden on the rug  aldonza brought some warm water and abenali washed and examined the wound aldonza standing by and handing him whatever he needed now and then assisting with her slender brown hands in a manner astonishing to the youths who stood by anxious and helpless white their companion began to show signs of returning life  abenali pronounced that the stone had missed the eyeball but the cut and bruise were such as to require constant bathing and the blow on the head was the more serious matter for when the patient tried to raise himself he instantly became sick and giddy so that it would be wise to leave him where he was  this was much against the will of edmund burgess who shared all the prejudices of the english prentice against the foreignerperhaps a wizard and rival in trade but there was no help for it and he could only insist that stephen should mount guard over the bed until he had reported to his master and returned with his orders  therewith he departed with such elaborate thanks and courtesies to the host as betrayed a little alarm in the tall apprentice who feared not quarterstaff nor wrestler and had even dauntlessly confronted the masters of his guild  stephen sooth to say was not very much at ease everything around had such a strange unenglish aspect and he imploringly muttered bide with me am to which his brother willingly assented being quite as comfortable in master michaels abode as by his aunts own hearth  giles meanwhile lay quiet and then as his senses became less confused and he could open one eye he looked dreamily about him and presently began to demand where he was and what had befallen him grasping at the hand of ambrose as if to hold fast by something familiar but he still seemed too much dazed to enter into the explanation and presently murmured something about thirst  aldonza came softly up with a cup of something cool  he looked very hard at her and when ambrose would have taken it from her hand to give it to him he said nay  she  and she with a sweet smile in her soft dark shady eyes and on her full lips held the cup to his lips far more daintily and dexterously than either of his boy companions could have done then when he moaned and said his head and eye pained him the white bearded elder came and bathed his brow with the soft sponge  it seemed all to pass before him like a dream and it was not much otherwise with his unhurt companions especially stephen who followed with wonder the movements made by the slippered feet of father and daughter upon the mats which covered the stone flooring of the old stable  the mats were only of english rushes and flags and had been woven by abenali and the child but loose rushes strewing the floor were accounted a luxury in the forest and even at the dragon court the upper end of the hall alone had any covering  then the water was heated and all such other operations carried on over a curious round vessel placed over charcoal the window and the door had dark heavy curtains and a matted partition cut off the further stall no doubt to serve as aldonzas chamber stephen looked about for something to assure him that the place belonged to no wizard enchanter and was glad to detect a large white cross on the wall with a holywater stoup beneath it but of images there were none  it seemed to him a long time before master headleys ruddy face full of anxiety appeared at the door  blows were of course no uncommon matter perhaps so long as no permanent injury was inflicted the masterarmourer had no objection to anything that might knock the folly out of his troublesome young inmate but edmund had made him uneasy for the youths eye and still more so about the quarters he was in and he had brought a mattress and a couple of men to carry the patient home as well as steelman his prime minister to advise him  he had left all these outside however and advanced civilly and condescendingly thanking the swordcutler in perfect ignorance that the man who stood before him had been born to a home that was an absolute palace compared with the dragon court  the two men were a curious contrast  there stood the englishman with his sturdy form inclining with age to corpulence his broad honest face telling of many a civic banquet and his short stubbly brown grizzled heard his whole air giving a sense of worshipful authority and weight and opposite to him the sparely made dark thin aquilinefaced white bearded moor a far smaller man in stature yet with a patriarchal dignity refinement and grace in port and countenance belonging as it were to another sphere  speaking english perfectly though with a foreign accent abenali informed master headley that his young kinsman would by heavens blessing soon recover without injury to the eye though perhaps a scar might remain  mr headley thanked him heartily for his care and said that he had brought men to carry the youth home if he could not walk and then he went up to the couch with a hearty how now giles  so thou hast had hard measure to knock the foolery out of thee my poor lad  but come well have thee home and my mother will see to thee  i cannot walk said giles heavily hardly raising his eyes and when he was told that two of the men waited to bear him home he only entreated to be let alone  somewhat sharply mr headley ordered him to sit up and make ready but when he tried to do so he sank back with a return of sickness and dizziness  abenali thereupon intreated that he might be left for that night and stepping out into the court so as to be unheard by the patient explained that the brain had had a shock and that perfect quiet for some hours to come was the only way to avert a serious illness possibly dangerous  master headley did not like the alternative at all and was a good deal perplexed  he beckoned to tibble steelman who had all this time been talking to lucas hansen and now came up prepared with his testimony that this michael was a good man and true a godly one to boot who had been wealthy in his own land and was a rare artificer in his own craft  though he hath no license to practise it here threw in master headley sotto voce but he accepted the assurance that michael was a good christian and with his daughter regularly went to mass and since better might not be he reluctantly consented to leave giles under his treatment on lucas reiterating the assurance that he need have no fears of magic or foul play of any sort  he then took the purse that hung at his girdle and declared that master michael the title of courtesy was wrung from him by the stately appearance of the old man must be at no charges for his cousin  but abenali with a grace that removed all air of offence from his manner returned thanks for the intention but declared that it never was the custom of the sons of ali to receive reward for the hospitality they exercised to the stranger within their gates  and so it was that master headley a good deal puzzled had to leave his apprentice under the roof of the old swordcutler for the night at least  tis passing strange said he as he walked back i know not what my mother will say but i wish all may be right  i feeli feel as if i had left the lad giles with abraham under the oak tree as we saw him in the miracle play  this description did not satisfy mrs headley indeed she feared that her son was likewise bewitched and when the next morning stephen who had been sent to inquire for the patient reported him better but still unable to be moved since he could not lift his head without sickness she became very anxious  giles was transformed in her estimate from a crossgrained slip to poor robin headleys boy the only son of a widow and nothing would content her but to make her son conduct her to warwick inner yard to inspect matters and carry thither a precious relic warranted proof against all sorcery  it was with great trepidation that the good old dame ventured but the result was that she was fairly subdued by abenalis patriarchal dignity  she had never seen any manners to equal his not even when king edward the fourth had come to her fathers house at the barbican chucked her under the chin and called her a dainty duck  it was aldonza however who specially touched her feelings  such a sweet little wench with the air of being bred in a kingly or knightly court to be living there close to the very dregs of the city was a scandal and a dangerspeaking so prettily too and knowing how to treat her elders  she would be a good example for dennet who sooth to say was getting too old for spoiltchild sauciness to be always pleasing while as to giles he could not be in better quarters  mrs headley well used to the dressing of the burns and bruises incurred in the weapon smiths business could not but confess that his eye had been dealt with as skilfully as she could have done it herself    chapter xiv  the knight of the badger    i am a gentleman of a company  shakespeare   giles headleys accident must have amounted to concussion of the brain for though he was able to return to the dragon in a couple of days and the cut over his eye was healing fast he was weak and shaken and did not for several weeks recover his usual health  the noise and heat of the smithy were distressing to him and there was no choice but to let him lie on settles sun himself on the steps and attempt no work  it had tamed him a good deal  smallbones said the letting out of malapert blood was wholesome and others thought him still under a spell but he seemed to have parted with much of his arrogance either because he had not spirits for selfassertion or because something of the grand eastern courtesy of abenali had impressed him  for intercourse with the morisco had by no means ceased giles went as long as the injury required it to have the hurt dressed and loitered in the inner yard a long time every day often securing some small dainty for aldonzaan apple a honey cake a bit of marchpane a dried plum or a comfit  one day he took her a couple of oranges  to his surprise as he entered abenali looked up with a strange light in his eyes and exclaimed my son thy scent is to my nostrils as the court of my fathers house then as he beheld the orange he clasped his hands took it in them and held it to his breast pouring out a chant in an unknown tongue while the tears flowed down his cheeks  father father aldonza cried terrified while giles marvelled whether the orange worked on him like a spell  but he perceived their amazement and spoke again in english i thank thee my son thou hast borne me back for a moment to the fountain in my fathers house where ye grow ye trees of the unfading leaf the spotless blossom and golden fruit  ah ronda  ronda  land of the sunshine the deep blue sky and snowtopped hills  land where are the graves of my father and mother  how pines and sickens the heart of the exile for thee  o happy they who died beneath the sword or flame for they knew not the lonely homelonging of the exile  ah ye golden fruits  one fragrant breath of thee is as a waft of the joys of my youth  are ye foretastes of the fruits of paradise the true home to which i may yet come though i may never never see the towers and hills of ronda more  giles knew not what to make of this outburst  he kept it to himself as too strange to be told  the heads of the family were willing that he should carry these trifles to the young child of the man who would accept no reward for his hospitality  indeed master headley spent much consideration on how to recompense the care bestowed on his kinsman  giles suggested that master michael had just finished the most beautiful sword blade he had ever seen and had not yet got a purchaser for it it was far superior to the sword tibble had just completed for my lord of surrey  thereat the whole court broke into an outcry that any workman should be supposed to turn out any kind of work surpassing steelmans was rank heresy and master headley bluntly told giles that he knew not what he was talking of  he might perhaps purchase the blade by way of courtesy and return of kindness butgood english workmanship for him  however giles was allowed to go and ask the price of the blade and bring it to be looked at  when he returned to the court he found in front of the building where finished suits were kept for display a tall thin wiry elderly man deeply bronzed and with a scar on his brow  master headley and tibble were both in attendance tib measuring the stranger and stephen who was standing at a respectful distance gave giles the information that this was the famous captain of freelances sir john fulford who had fought in all the wars in italy and was going to fight in them again but wanted a suit of our harness  the information was hardly needed for sir john in a voice loud enough to lead his men to the battlefield and with all manner of strong asseverations in all sorts of languages was explaining the dints and blows that had befallen the mail he had had from master headley eighteen years ago when he was but a squire how his helmet had endured tough blows and saved his head at novara but had been crushed like an egg shell by a stone from the walls at barletta which had nearly been his own destruction  and how that which he at present wore beautifully chased and in a classical form was taken from a dead italian count on the field of ravenna but always sat amiss on him and how he had broken his good sword upon one of the rascally swiss only a couple of months ago at marignano  having likewise disabled his right arm and being well off through the payment of some ransoms he had come home partly to look after his family and partly to provide himself with a full suit of english harness his present suit being a patchwork of relics of numerous battlefields  only one thing he desired a true spanish sword not only toledo or bilboa in name but nature  he had seen execution done by the weapons of the soldiers of the great captain and been witness to the endurance of their metal and this made him demand whether master headley could provide him with the like  giles took the moment for stepping forward and putting abenalis work into the masters hand  the condottiere was in raptures  he pronounced it as perfect a weapon as gonzalo de cordova himself could possess showed off its temper and his own dexterity by piercing and cutting up an old cuirass and invited the bystanders to let him put it to further proof by letting him slice through an apple placed on the open palm of the hand  giless friendship could not carry him so far as to make the venture kit smallbones observed that he had a wife and children and could not afford to risk his good right hand on a wandering soldiers bravado edmund was heard saying nay nay steve dont be such a fool but stephen was declaring he would not have the fellow say that english lads hung back from what rogues of france and italy would dare  no danger for him who winceth not said the knight  master headley a very peaceful citizen in his composition in spite of his trade was much inclined to forbid stephen from the experiment but he refrained ashamed and unwilling to daunt a high spirit and half the household eager for the excitement rushed to the kitchen in quest of apples and brought out all the women to behold and add a clamour of remonstrance  sir john however insisted that they should all be ordered back again  not that the noise and clamour of women folk makes any odds to me said the grim old warrior ive seen too many towns taken for that but it might make the lad queasy and cost him a thumb or so  of course this renewed the dismay and excitement and both tibble and his master entreated stephen to give up the undertaking if he felt the least misgiving as to his own steadiness arguing that they should not think him any more a craven than they did kit smallbones or edmund burgess  but stephens mind was made up his spirit was high and he was resolved to go through with it  he held out his open hand a rosychecked apple was carefully laid on it  the sword flashed through the airdivided in half the apple which remained on stephens palm  there was a sharp shriek from a window drowned in the acclamations of the whole court while the captain patted stephen on the shoulder exclaiming well done my lad  theres the making of a tall fellow in thee  if ever thou art weary of making weapons and wouldst use them instead seek out john fulford of the badger troop and thou shalt have a welcome  our name is the badger because theres no troop like us for digging out mines beneath the walls  a few months ago such an invitation would have been bliss to stephen  now he was bound in all honour and duty to his master and could only thank the knight of the badger and cast a regretful eye at him as he drank a cup of wine and flung a bag of gold and silver supplemented by a heavy chain to master headley who prudently declined working for free companions unless he were paid beforehand and at the knights request took charge of a sufficient amount to pay his fare back again to the continent  then mounting a tall lean bony horse the knight said he should call for his armour on returning from somerset and rode off while stephen found himself exalted as a hero in the eyes of his companions for an act common enough at feats of arms among modern cavalry but quite new to the london flatcaps  the only sufferer was little dennet who had burst into an agony of crying at the sight needed that stephen should spread out both hands before her and show her the divided apple before she would believe that his thumb was in its right place and at night screamed out in her sleep that the illfavoured man was cutting off stephens hands  the sword was left behind by sir john in order that it might be fitted with a scabbard and belt worthy of it and on examination master headley and tibble both confessed that they could produce nothing equal to it in workmanship though kit looked with contempt at the slight weapon of deep blue steel with lines meandering on it like a watered silk and the upper part inlaid with gold wire in exquisite arabesque patterns  he called it a mere toy and muttered something about sorcery and men who had been in foreign parts not thinking honest weight of english steel good enough for them  master headley would not trust one of the boys with the good silver coins that had been paid as the price of the swordfrench crowns and milanese ducats with a few venetian gold bezantsbut he bade them go as guards to tibble for it was always a perilous thing to carry a sum of money through the london streets  tibble was not an unwilling messenger  he knew master michael to be somewhat of his own way of thinking and he was a naturally largeminded man who could appreciate skill higher than his own without jealousy indeed he and his master held a private consultation on the mode of establishing a connection with michael and profiting by his ability  to have lodged him at the dragon court and made him part of the establishment might have seemed the most obvious way but the dogged english hatred and contempt of foreigners would have rendered this impossible even if abenali himself would have consented to give up his comparative seclusion and live in a crowd and turmoil  but he was thankful to receive and execute orders from master headley since so certain a connection would secure aldonza from privation such as the child had sometimes had to endure in the winter when though the abstemious eastern nature needed little food there was great suffering from cold and lack of fuel  and tibble moreover asked questions and begged for instructions in some of the secrets of the art  it was an effort to such a prime artificer as steelman to ask instruction from any man especially a foreigner but tibble had a nature of no common order and set perfection far above class prejudice and moreover he felt abenali to be one of those men who had their inner eyes devotedly fixed on the truth though little knowing where the quest would lead them  on his side abenali underwent a struggle  woe is me he said wottest thou my son that the secrets of the sword of light and swiftness are the heritage that abdallah ben ali brought from damascus in the hundred and fiftythird year of the flight of him whom once i termed the prophet nor have they departed from our house but have been handed on from father to son  and shall they be used in the wars of the stranger and the christian  i feared it might be thus said tibble  and yet went on the old man as if not hearing him wherefore should i guard the secret any longer  my sons  where are they they brooked not the scorn and hatred of the castillian which poisoned to them the new faith  they cast in their lot with their own people and that their bones may lie bleaching on the mountains is the best lot that can have befallen the children of my youth and hope  the house of miguel abenali is desolate and childless save for the little maiden who sits by my hearth in the land of my exile why should i guard it longer for him who may wed her and whom i may never behold  the will of heaven be done  young man if i bestow this knowledge on thee wilt thou swear to be as a father to my daughter and to care for her as thine own  it was a good while since tibble had been called a young man and as he listened to the flowing eastern periods in their foreign enunciation he was for a moment afraid that the price of the secret was that he should become the old moors soninlaw  his seared and scarred youth had precluded marriage and he entertained the low opinion of women frequent in men of superior intellect among the uneducated  besides the possibilities of giving umbrage to church authorities were dawning on him and he was not willing to form any domestic ties so that in every way such a proposition would have been unwelcome to him  but he had no objection to pledge himself to fatherly guardianship of the pretty child in case of a need that might never arise  so he gave the promise and became a pupil of abenali visiting warwick inner yard with his masters consent whenever he could be spared while the workmanship at the dragon began to profit thereby  the jealousy of the eagle was proportionately increased  alderman itillyeo the head of the eagle was friendly enough to mr headley but it was undeniable that they were the rival armourers of london dividing the favours of the court equally between them and the bitterness of the emulation increased the lower it went in the establishment  the prentices especially could hardly meet without gibes and sneers if nothing worse and stephens exploit had a peculiar flavour because it was averred that no one at the eagle would have done the like  but it was not till the sunday that ambrose chanced to hear of the feat at which he turned quite pale but he was prouder of it than any one else and although he rejoiced that he had not seen it performed he did not fail to boast of it at home though perronel began by declaring that she did not care for the mad pranks of roistering prentices but presently she paused as she stirred her grandfathers evening posset and said what saidst thou was the strange soldiers name  fulfordsir john fulford said ambrose  what  i thought not of it is not that gaffers name  fulford yea  mayhap and perronel sat down and gave an odd sort of laugh of agitationmayhap tis mine own father  shouldst thou know him good aunt cried ambrose much excited  scarce she said  i was not seven years old when he went to the warsif so be he lived through the battleand he reeked little of me being but a maid  i feared him greatly and so did my mother twas happier with only gaffer  where saidst thou he was gone  ambrose could not tell but he undertook to bring stephen to answer all queries on the subject  his replies that the captain was gone in quest of his family to somersetshire settled the matter since there had been old martin fulfords abode and there john fulford had parted with his wife and father  they did not however tell the old man of the possibility of his sons being at home he had little memory and was easily thrown into a state of agitation besides it was a doubtful matter how the condottiere would feel as to the present fortunes of the family  stephen was to look out for his return in quest of his suit of armour inform him of his fathers being alive and show him the way to the little house by the temple gardens but perronel gave the strictest injunctions that her husbands profession should not be explained  it would be quite enough to say that he was of the lord cardinals household  stephen watched but the armour was finished and christmas passed by before anything was seen of the captain  at last however he did descend on the dragon court looking so dilapidated that mr headley rejoiced in the having received payment beforehand  he was louder voiced and fuller of strange oaths than ever and in the utmost haste for he had heard tidings that there was to be a lusty game between the emperor and the italians and he must have his share  stephen made his way up to speak to him and was received with ha my gallant lad  art weary of hammer and anvil  wouldst be a brave badger slip thine indentures and hear helm and lance ring in good earnest  not so sir said stephen but i have been bidden to ask if thou hast found thy father  whats that to thee stripling  when thou hast cut thy wisdom teeth thoult know old fathers be not so easy found  twas a wild goose chase and i wot not what moved me to run after it  i met jolly comrades enough bumpkins that could drink with an honest soldier when they saw him but not one that ever heard the name of fulford  sir said stephen i know an old man named fulford  his granddaughter is my uncles wife and they dwell by the temple  the intelligence seemed more startling and less gratifying than stephen had expected  sir john demanded whether they were poor and declared that he had better have heard of them when his purse was fuller  he had supposed that his wife had given him up and found a fresh mate and when he heard of her death he made an exclamation which might be pity but had in it something of relief  he showed more interest about his old father but as to his daughter if she had been a lad now a might have been a stout comrade by this time ready to do the badger credit  yea his poor kate was a good lass but she was only a flemish woman and hadnt the sense to rear aught but a whining little wench who was of no good except to turn fools heads and she was wedded and past all that by this time  stephen explained that she was wedded to one of the lord cardinals meine  ho said the condottiere pausing be that the butchers boy that is pouring out his gold to buy scarlet hats if not the three crowns  tis no bad household wherein to have a footing  saidst thou i should find my wench and the old gaffer there  stephen had to explain somewhat to the disappointment of the captain who had as it appeared in the company of three or four more adventurous spirits like himself taken a passage in a vessel lying off gravesend and had only turned aside to take up his new armour and his deposit of passagemoney  he demurred a little he had little time to spare and though of course he could take boat at the temple stairs and drop down the river he observed that it would have been a very different thing to go home to the old man when he first came back with a pouch full of ransoms and plunder whereas now he had barely enough to carry him to the place of meeting with his badgers  and there was the wench toohe had fairly forgotten her name  women were like she wolves for greed when they had a brood of whelps  stephen satisfied him that there was no danger on that score and heard him muttering that it was no harm to secure a safe harbour in case a man hadnt the luck to be knocked on the head ere he grew too old to trail a pike  and he would fain see the old man  so permission was asked for stephen to show the way to master randalls and granted somewhat reluctantly master headley saying ill have thee back within an hour stephen birkenholt and look thou dost not let thy brain be set afire with this fellows windy talk of battles and sieges and deeds only fit for pagans and wolves  ay said tibble perhaps with a memory of the old fable better be the trusty mastiff than the wolf  and like the wolf twitting the mastiff with his chain the soldier was no sooner outside the door of the dragon court before he began to express his wonder how a lad of mettle could put up with a flat cap a blue gown and the being at the beck and call of a greasy burgher when a bold handsome young knave like him might have the world before him and his stout pike  stephen was flattered but scarcely tempted  the hard selfishness and want of affection of the condottiere shocked him while he looked about hoping some of his acquaintance would see him in company with this tall figure clanking in shining armour and with a knightly helmet and gilt spurs  the armour new and brilliant concealed the worn and shabby leathern dress beneath and gave the tall spare figure a greater breadth diminishing the look of a hungry wolf which sir john fulfords aspect suggested  however as he passed some of the wealthier stalls where the apprentices seeing the martial figure shouted what dye lack sir knight and offered silk and velvet robes and mantles gay sword knots or even rich chains under all the clamour stephen heard him swearing by st george what a place this would be for a sack if his badgers were behind him  if that poor craven of a warbeck had had a spark of valour in him quoth he as he passed a stall gay with bright tankards and flagons we would have rattled some of that shining gear about the lazy citizens ears  he jolly king edwards son  ill never give faith to it  to turn his back when there was such a booty to be had for the plundering  he might not have found it so easy  our trainbands are sturdy enough said stephen whose esprit de corps was this time on the londoners side but the knight of the badger snapped his fingers and said so much for your burgher trainbands  all they be good for with their show of fight is to give honest landsknechts a good reason to fall on to the plunder if so be one is hampered by a squeamish prince  but grammercy to st george there be not many of that sort after they he once fleshed  perhaps a year ago when fresh from the forest stephen might have been more captivated by the notion of adventure and conquest  now that he had his place in the community and looked on a civic position with wholesome ambition fulfords longings for havoc in these peaceful streets made his blood run cold  he was glad when they reached their destination and he saw perronel with bare arms taking in some linen cuffs and bands from a line across to the opposite wall  he could only call out good naunt here he be  perronel turned round the colour rising in her cheeks with an obeisance but trembling a good deal  how now wench  thou art grown a buxom dame  thou makst an old man of me said the soldier with a laugh  wheres my father  i have not the turning of a cup to stay for im come home poor as a cat in a plundered town and am off to the wars again but hearing that the old man was nigh at hand i came this way to see him and let thee know thou art a knights daughter  thou art indifferent comely girl whats thy name but not the peer of thy mother when i wooed her as one of the bonny lasses of bruges  he gave a kind of embrace while she gave a kind of gasp of welcome sir and glanced somewhat reproachfully at stephen for not having given her more warning  the cause of her dismay was plain as the captain giving her no time to precede him strode into the little chamber where hal randall without his false beard or hair and in his particoloured hose was seated by the cupboard like bed assisting old martin fulford to take his midday meal  be this thine husband girl  ha ha  hes more like a jolly friar come in to make thee merry when the good man is out exclaimed the visitor laughing loudly at his own rude jest but heeding little either hals appearance or his reply as he caught the old mans bewildered eyes and heard his efforts to utter his name  for eighteen years had altered john fulford less than either his father or his daughter and old martin recognised him instantly and held out the only arm he could use while the knight softened touched and really feeling more natural affection than stephen had given him credit for dropped on his knee breaking into indistinct mutterings with rough but hearty greetings regretting that he had not found his father sooner when his pouch was full lamenting the change in him declaring that he must hurry away now but promising to come back with sacks of italian ducats to provide for the old man  those who could interpret the imperfect utterance now further choked by tears and agitation knew that there was a medley of broken rejoicings blessings and weepings in the midst of which the soldier glad perhaps to end a scene where he became increasingly awkward and embarrassed started up hastily kissed the old man on each of his withered cheeks gave another kiss to his daughter threw her two venetian ducats bidding her spend them for the old man and he would bring a pouchful more next time and striding to the door bade stephen call a boat to take him down to gravesend  randall who had in the meantime donned his sober black gown in the inner chamber together with a dark hood accompanied his newly found fatherinlaw down the river and stephen would fain have gone too but for the injunction to return within the hour  perronel had hurried back to her grandfathers side to endeavour to compose him after the shock of gladness  but it had been too much for his enfeebled powers  another stroke came on before the day was over and in two or three days more old martin fulford was laid to rest and his sons ducats were expended on masses for his souls welfare    chapter xv  heave half a brick at him    for strangers then did so increase    by reason of king henrys queen and privileged in many a place    to dwell as was in london seen poor tradesmen had small dealing then    and who but strangers bore the bell which was a grief to englishmen    to see them here in london dwell  ill may day by churchill a contemporary poet   time passed on and edmund burgess who had been sent from york to learn the perfection of his craft completed his term and returned to his home much regretted in the dragon court where his good humour and good sense had generally kept the peace both within and without  giles headley was now the eldest prentice  he was in every way greatly improved thoroughly accepting his position and showing himself quite ready both to learn and to work but he had not the will or the power of avoiding disputes with outsiders or turning them aside with a merry jest and rivalries and quarrels with the armoury at the eagle began to increase  the dragon no doubt turned out finer workmanship and this the eagle alleged was wholly owing to nefarious traffic with the old spanish or moorish sorcerer in warwick inner yard a thing unworthy of honest englishmen  this made giles furious and the cry never failed to end in a fight in which stephen supported the cause of the one house and george bates and his comrades of the other  it was the same with even the archery at mile end where the butts were erected and the youth contended with the long bow which was still considered as the safeguard of england  king henry often looked in on these matches and did honour to the winners  one match there was in especial on mothering sunday when the champions of each guild shot against one another at such a range that it needed a keen eye to see the popinjaya stuffed bird at which they shot  stephen was one of these his forest lore having always given him an advantage over many of the others  he even was one of the last three who were to finish the sport by shooting against one another one was a butcher named barlow  the other was a walloon the best shot among six hundred foreigners of various nations all of whom though with little encouragement joined in the national sport on these pleasant spring afternoons  the first contest threw out the walloon at which there were cries of ecstasy now the trial was between barlow and stephen and in this final effort the distance of the pole to which the popinjay was fastened was so much increased that strength of arm told as much as accuracy of aim and stephens seventeen years old muscles could not after so long a strain cope with those of ralph barlow a butcher of full thirty years old  his wrist and arm began to shake with weariness and only one of his three last arrows went straight to the mark while barlow was as steady as ever and never once failed  stephen was bitterly disappointed his eyes filled with tears and he flung himself down on the turf feeling as if the shouts of a barlow a barlow which were led by the jovial voice of king harry himself were all exulting over him  barlow was led up to the king who hailed him king of shoreditch a title borne by the champion archer ever after so long as bowmanship in earnest lasted  a tankard which the king filled with silver pieces was his prize but henry did not forget no 2 wheres the other fellow he said  he was but a stripling and to my mind his feat was a greater marvel than that of a stalwart fellow like barlow  half a dozen of the spectators among them the cardinals jester hurried in search of stephen who was roused from his fit of weariness and disappointment by a shake of the shoulder as his uncle jingled his bells in his ears and exclaimed how now here i own a cousin  stephen sat up and stared with angry astonished eyes but only met a laugh  ay ay tis but striplings and fools that have tears to spend for such as this  up boy  dye hear  the other hal is asking for thee  and stephen hastily brushing away his tears and holding his flat cap in his hand was marshalled across the mead hot shy and indignant as the jester mopped and mowed and cut all sorts of antics before him turning round to observe in an encouraging voice pluck up a heart man  one would think hal was going to cut oft thine head  and then on arriving where the king sat on his horse here he is hal such as he is come humbly to crave thy gracious pardon for hitting the mark no better  hell mend his ways good my lord if your grace will pardon him this time  ay marry and that will i said the king  the springald bids fair to be king of shoreditch by the time the other fellow abdicates  how old art thou my lad  seventeen an it please your grace said stephen in the gruff voice of his age  and thy name  stephen birkenholt my liege and he wondered whether he would be recognised but henry only said   methinks ive seen those sloeblack eyes before  or is it only that the lad is thy very marrow quipsome one  the which returned the jester gravely while stephen tingled all over with dismay may account for the tears the lad was wasting at not having the thews of the fellow double his age  but i envy him not  not i  hell never have wit for mine office but will come in second there likewise  i dare be sworn he will said the king  here take this my good lad and prank thee in it when thou art out of thy time and goest ahunting in epping  it was a handsome belt with a broad silver clasp engraven with the tudor rose and portcullis and stephen bowed low and made his acknowledgments as best he might  he was hailed with rapturous acclamations by his own contemporaries who held that he had saved the credit of the english prentice world and insisted on carrying him enthroned on their shoulders back to cheapside in emulation of the journeymen and all the butcher kind who were thus bearing home the king of shoreditch  shouts halloos whistles every jubilant noise that youth and boyhood could invent were the triumphant music of stephen on his surging and uneasy throne as he was shifted from one bearer to another when each in turn grew tired of his weight  just however as they were nearing their own neighbourhood a counter cry broke out witchcraft  his arrows are bewitched by the old spanish sorcerer  down with dragons and wizards  and a handful of mud came full in the face of the enthroned lad aimed no doubt by george bates  there was a yell and rush of rage but the enemy was in numbers too small to attempt resistance and dashed off before their pursuers only pausing at safe corners to shout parthian darts of wizards  magic  sorcerers  heretics  there was nothing to be done but to collect again and escort stephen who had wiped the mud off his face to the dragon court where dennet danced on the steps for joy and master headley not a little gratified promised stephen a supper for a dozen of his particular friends at armourers hall on the ensuing easter sunday  of course stephen went in search of his brother all the more eagerly because he was conscious that they had of late drifted apart a good deal  ambrose was more and more absorbed by the studies to which lucas hansen led him and took less and less interest in his brothers pursuits  he did indeed come to the sundays dinner according to the regular custom but the moment it was permissible to leave the board he was away with tibble steelman to meet friends of lucas and pursue studies as if stephen thought he had not enough of books as it was  when dean colet preached or catechised in st pauls in the afternoon they both attended and listened but that good man was in failing health and his wise discourses were less frequent  where they were at other times stephen did not know and hardly cared except that he had a general dislike to and jealousy of anything that took his brothers sympathy away from him  moreover ambroses face was thinner and paler he had a strange absorbed look and often even when they were together seemed hardly to attend to what his brother was saying  i will make him come said stephen to himself as he went with swinging gait towards warwick inner yard where sure enough he found ambrose sitting at the door frowning over some black letter which looked most uninviting in the eyes of the apprentice and he fell upon his brother with half angry half merry reproofs for wasting the fine spring afternoon over such studies  ambrose looked up with a dreamy smile and greeted his brother but all the time stephen was narrating the history of the match and he did tell the fate of each individual arrow of his own or barlows his eyes were wandering back to the crabbed page in his hand and when stephen impatiently wound up his history with the invitation to supper on easter sunday the reply was nay brother thanks but that i cannot do  cannot exclaimed stephen  nay there are other matters in hand that go deeper  yea i know whatever concerns musty books goes deeper with thee than thy brother replied stephen turning away much mortified  ambroses warm nature was awakened  he held his brother by the arm and declared himself anything but indifferent to him but he owned that he did not love noise and revelry above all on sunday  thou art addling thy brains with preachings said stephen  pray heaven they make not a heretic of thee  but thou mightest for once have come to mine own feast  ambrose much perplexed and grieved at thus vexing his brother declared that he would have done so with all his heart but that this very easter sunday there was coming a friend of master hansens from holland who was to tell them much of the teaching in germany which was so enlightening mens eyes  yea truly making heretics of them mistress headley saith returned stephen  o ambrose if thou wilt run after these books and parchments canst not do it in right fashion among holy monks as of old  holy monks repeated ambrose  holy monks  where be they  stephen stared at him  hear uncle hal talk of monks whom he sees at my lord cardinals table  what holiness is there among them  men that have vowed to renounce all worldly and carnal things flaunt like peacocks and revel like swinemy lord cardinal with his silver pillars foremost of them  he poor and mortified  tis verily as our uncle saith he plays the least false and shameful part there  ambrose ambrose thou wilt be distraught poring over these matters that were never meant for lads like us  do but come and drive them out for once with mirth and good fellowship  i tell thee stephen what thou callest mirth and good fellowship do but drive the pain in deeper  sin and guilt be everywhere  i seem to see the devils putting foul words on the tongue and ill deeds in the hands of myself and all around me that they may accuse us before god  no stephen i cannot cannot come i must go where i can hear of a better way  nay said stephen what better way can there be than to be shrivenclean shrivenand then houselled as i was ere lent and trust to be again on next low sunday morn  thats enough for a plain lad  he crossed himself reverently mine own lord pardoneth and cometh to me  but the two minds one simple and practical the other sensitive and speculative did not move in the same atmosphere and could not understand one another  ambrose was in the condition of excitement and bewilderment produced by the first stirrings of the reformation upon enthusiastic minds  he had studied the vulgate made out something of the greek testament read all fragments of the fathers that came in his way and also all the controversial tractates latin or dutch that he could meet with and attended many a secret conference between lucas and his friends when men coming from holland or germany communicated accounts of the lectures and sermons of dr martin luther which already were becoming widely known  he was wretched under the continual tossings of his mind  was the entire existing system a vast delusion blinding the eyes and destroying the souls of those who trusted to it and was the only safety in the one point of faith that luther pressed on all and ought all that he had hitherto revered to crumble down to let that alone be upheld  whatever he had once loved and honoured at times seemed to him a lie while at others real affection and veneration and dread of sacrilege made him shudder at himself and his own doubts  it was his one thought and he passionately sought after all those secret conferences which did but feed the flame that consumed him  the elder men who were with him were not thus agitated  lucass convictions had not long been fixed  he did not court observation nor do anything unnecessarily to bring persecution on himself but he quietly and secretly acted as an agent in dispersing the lollard books and those of erasmus and lived in the conviction that there would one day be a great crash believing himself to be doing his part by undermining the structure and working on undoubtingly abenali was not aggressive  in fact though he was reckoned among lucass party because of his abstinence from all cult of saints or images and the persecution he had suffered he did not join in their general opinions and held aloof from their meetings  and tibble steelman as has been before said lived two lives and that as foreman at the dragon court being habitual to him and requiring much thought and exertion the speculations of the reformers were to him more like an intellectual relaxation than the business of life he took them as a modern artisan would in this day read his newspaper and attend his club meeting  ambrose however had the enthusiastic practicalness of youth  on that which he fully believed he must act and what did he fully believe  boy as he wasscarcely yet eighteenthe toils and sports that delighted his brother seemed to him like toys amusing infants on the verge of an abyss and he spent his leisure either in searching in the vulgate for something to give him absolute direction or in going in search of preachers for with the stirring of mens minds sermons were becoming more frequent  there was much talk just now of the preaching of one doctor beale to whom all the tradesmen journeymen and apprentices were resorting even those who were of no special religious tendencies ambrose went on easter tuesday to hear him preach at st marys spitall  the place was crowded with artificers and beale began by telling them that he had a pitiful bill meaning a letter brought to him declaring how aliens and strangers were coming in to inhabit the city and suburbs to eat the bread from poor fatherless children and take the living from all artificers and the intercourse from merchants whereby poverty was so much increased that each bewaileth the misery of others  presently coming to his text coelum coeli domini terram autem dedit filiis hominis the heaven of heavens is the lords the earth hath he given to the children of men the doctor inculcated that england was given to englishmen and that as birds would defend their nests so ought englishmen to defend themselves and to hurt and grieve aliens for the common weal  the corollary a good deal resembled that of hate thine enemy which was foisted by them of the old time upon thou shalt love thy neighbour  and the doctor went on upon the text pugna pro patria to demonstrate that fighting for ones country meant rising upon and expelling all the strangers who dwelt and traded within it  many of these foreigners were from the hanse towns which had special commercial privileges there were also numerous venetians and genoese french and spaniards the last of whom were above all the objects of dislike  their imports of silks cloth of gold stamped leather wine and oil and their superior skill in many handicrafts had put english wares out of fashion and their exports of wool tin and lead excited equal jealousy which dr beale instigated as was well known by a broker named john lincoln was thus stirring up into fierce passion  his sermon was talked of all over london blacker looks than ever were directed at the aliens stones and dirt were thrown at them and even ambrose as he walked along the street was reviled as the dutchkins knave  the insults became each day more daring and outrageous  george bates and a skinners apprentice named studley were caught in the act of tripping up a portly old flanderkin and forthwith sent to newgate and there were other arrests which did but inflame the smouldering rage of the mob  some of the wealthier foreigners taking warning by the signs of danger left the city for there could be no doubt that the whole of london and the suburbs were in a combustible condition of discontent needing only a spark to set it alight  it was just about this time that a disreputable clerka lewd priest as hall calls hima hangeron of the house of howard was guilty of an insult to a citizens wife as she was quietly walking home through the cheap  her husband and brother who were nearer at hand than he guessed avenged the outrage with such good wills that this disgrace to the priesthood was left dead on the ground  when such things happened and discourses like beales were heard it was not surprising that ambroses faith in the clergy as guides received severe shocks    chapter xvi  may eve    the rich the poor the old the young beyond the seas though born and bred by prentices they suffered wrong when armed thus they gatherd head  ill may day  may eve had come and little dennet headley was full of plans for going out early with her young playfellows to the meadow to gather may dew in the early morning but her grandmother who was in bed under a heavy attack of rheumatism did not like the reports brought to her and deferred her consent to the expedition  in the afternoon there were tidings that the lord mayor sir thomas rest had been sent for to my lord cardinal who just at this time during the building at york house was lodging in his house close to temple bar  some hours later a message came to master alderman headley to meet the lord mayor and the rest of the council at the guildhall  he shook himself into his scarlet gown and went off puffing and blowing and bidding giles and stephen take heed that they kept close and ran into no mischief  but they agreed and kit smallbones with them that there could be no harm in going into the open space of cheapside and playing out a match with bucklers between giles and wat ball a drapers prentice who had challenged him  the bucklers were huge shields and the weapons were wooden swords  it was an exciting sport and brought out all the youths of cheapside in the summer evening bawling out encouragement and laying wagers on either side  the curfew rang but there were special privileges on may eve and the game went on louder than ever  there was far too much noise for any one to hear the town crier who went along jingling his bell and shouting o yes  o yes  o yes by order of the lord mayor and council no householder shall allow any one of his household to be abroad beyond his gate between the hours of nine oclock at night and seven in the morning or if any of the outermost heard it as did ambrose who was on his way home to his night quarters they were too much excited not to turn a deaf ear to it  suddenly however just as giles was preparing for a masterstroke he was seized roughly by the shoulder and bidden to give over  he looked round  it was an alderman not his master but sir john mundy an unpopular harsh man  wherefore demanded giles  thou shalt know said the alderman seizing his arm to drag him to the counter prison but giles resisted  wat ball struck at sir johns arm with his wooden sword and as the alderman shouted for the watch and cityguard the lads on their side raised their cry prentices and clubs  flatcaps and clubs  master headley struggling along met his colleague with his gown torn into shreds from his back among a host of wildly yelling lads and panting help help brother headley  with great difficulty the two aldermen reached the door of the dragon whence smallbones sallied out to rescue them and dragged them in  the boysthe boys was master headleys first cry but he might as well have tried to detach two particular waves from a surging ocean as his own especial boys from the multitude on that wild evening  there was no moon and the twilight still prevailed but it was dark enough to make the confusion greater as the cries swelled and numbers flowed into the open space of cheapside  in the words of hall the chronicler out came servingmen and watermen and courtiers and by xi of the chock there were vi or vii hundreds in cheap  and out of pawles churchyard came iii hundred which wist not of the others  for the most part all was invoked in the semi darkness of the summer night but here and there light came from an upper window on some boyish face perhaps full of mischief perhaps somewhat bewildered and appalled  here and there were torches which cast a red glare round them but whose smoke blurred everything and seemed to render the darkness deeper  perhaps if the tumult had only been of the apprentices provoked by alderman mundys interference they would soon have dispersed but the throng was pervaded by men with much deeper design and a cry aroseno one knew from whencethat they would break into newgate and set free studley and bates  by this time the torrent of young manhood was quite irresistible by any force that had yet been opposed to it  the mayor and sheriffs stood at the guildhall and read the royal proclamation by the light of a wax candle held in the trembling hand of one of the clerks but no one heard or heeded them and the uproar was increased as the doors of newgate fell and all the felons rushed out to join the rioters  at the same time another shout rose down with the aliens and there was a general rush towards st martins gate in which direction many lived  there was however a pause here for sir thomas more recorder of london stood in the way before st martins gate and with his full sweet voice began calling out and entreating the lads to go home before any heads were broken more than could be mended again  he was always a favourite and his good humour seemed to be making some impression when either from the determination of the more evil disposed or because the inhabitants of st martins lane were beginning to pour down hot water stones and brickbats on the dense mass of heads below them a fresh access of fury seized upon the mob  yells of down with the strangers echoed through the narrow streets drowning sir thomass voice  a lawyer who stood with him was knocked down and much hurt the doors were battered down and the household stuff thrown from the windows here ambrose who had hitherto been pushed helplessly about and knocked hither and thither was driven up against giles and to avoid falling and being trampled down clutched hold of him breathless and panting  thou here exclaimed giles  who would have thought of sober ambrose in the midst of the fray  see here stevie  poor old ambrose cried stephen keep close to us  well see no harm comes to thee  tis hot work eh  oh stephen could i but get out of the throng to warn my master and master michael  those words seemed to strike giles headley  he might have cared little for the fate of the old printer but as he heard the screams of the women in the houses around he exclaimed ay theres the old man and the little maid  we will have her to the dragon  or to mine aunts said ambrose  have with thee then said giles  take his other arm steve and locking their arms together the three fought and forced their way from among the plunderers in st martins with no worse mishap than a shower of hot water which did not hurt them much through their stout woollen coats  they came at last to a place where they could breathe and stood still a moment to recover from the struggle and vituperate the hot water  then they heard fresh howls and yells in front as well as behind  they are at it everywhere exclaimed stephen  i hear them somewhere out by cornhill  ay where the frenchmen live that calender worsted returned giles  come on who knows how it is with the old man and little maid  theres a sort in our court that are ready for aught said ambrose  on they hurried in the darkness which was now at the very deepest of the night now and then a torch was borne across the street and most of the houses had lights in the upper windows for few londoners slept on that strange night  the stained glass of the windows of the churches beamed in bright colours from the altar lights seen through them but the lads made slower progress than they wished for the streets were never easy to walk in the dark and twice they came on mobs assailing houses from the windows of one of which french shoes and boots were being hailed down  things were moderately quiet around st pauls but as they came into warwick lane they heard fresh shouts and wild cries and at the archway heading to the inner yard they could see that there was a huge bonfire in the midst of the courtof what composed they could not see for the howling figures that exulted round it  george bates the villain cried stephen as his enemy in exulting ferocious delight was revealed for a moment throwing a book on the fire and shouting hurrah theres for the old sorcerer theres for the heretics  that instant giles was flying on bates and stephen with equal if not greater fury at one of his comrades but ambrose dashed through the outskirts of the wildly screaming and shouting fellows many of whom were the miscreant population of the mews to the black yawning doorway of his master  he saw only a fellow staggering out with the screw of the press to feed the flame and hurried on in the din to call master art thou there  there was no answer and he moved on to the next door calling again softly while all the spoilers seemed absorbed in the fire and the combat  master michael  tis i ambrose  here my son cautiously answered a voice he knew for lucas hansens  oh master master was his low heartstricken cry as by the leaping light of a flame he saw the pale face of the old printer who drew him in  yea tis ruin my son said lucas  and would that that were the worst  the light flashed and flickered through the broken window so that ambrose saw that the hangings had been torn down and everything wrecked and a low sound as of stifled weeping directed his eyes to a corner where aldonza sat with her fathers head on her lap lives he  is he greatly hurt asked ambrose awestricken  the life is yet in him but i fear me greatly it is passing fast said lucas in a low voice  one of those lads smote him on the back with a club and struck him down at the poor maids feet nor hath he moved since  it was that one young headley is fighting with he added  bates ah  would that we had come sooner  what more of this work  for just then a tremendous outcry broke forth and there was a rush and panic among those who had been leaping round the fire just before  the guardthe kings men was the sound they presently distinguished  they could hear rough abusive voices shrieks and trampling of feet  a few seconds more and all was still only the fire remained and in the stillness the suppressed sobs and moans of aldonza were heard  a light  fetch a light from the fire said lucas  ambrose ran out  the flame was lessening but he could see the dark bindings and the blackened pages of the books he loved so well  a corner of a page of st augustines confessions was turned towards him and lay on a singed fragment of aldonzas embroidered curtain while a little red flame was licking the spiral folds of the screw trying as it were to gather energy to do more than blacken it ambrose could have wept over it at any other moment but now he could only catch up a brandit was the leg of his masters carved chairand run back with it  lucas ventured to light a lamp and they could then see the old mans face pale but calm and still with his long white beard flowing over his breast  there was no blood no look of pain only a set look about the eyes and aldonza cried oh father thou art better  speak to me  let master lucas lift thee up  nay my child  i cannot move hand or foot  let me be thus till the angel of death come for me  he is very near  he spoke in short sentences  waternayno pain he added then and ambrose ran for some water in the first battered fragment of a tin pot he could find  they bathed his face and he gathered strength after a time to say a priestoh for a priest to shrive and housel me  i will find one said ambrose speeding out into the court over fragments of the beautiful work for which abenali was hated and over the torn halfburnt leaves of the beloved store of lucas  the fire had died down but morning twilight was beginning to dawn and all was perfectly still after the recent tumult though for a moment or two ambrose heard some distant cries  where should he go  priests indeed were plentiful but both his friends were in bad odour with the ordinary ones  lucas had avoided both the lenten shrift and easter communion and what miguel might have done ambrose was uncertain  some young priests had actually been among the foremost in sacking the dwellings of the unfortunate foreigners and ambrose was quite uncertain whether he might not fall on one of that stampor on one who might vex the old mans soulperhaps deny him the sacraments altogether  as he saw the pale lighted windows of st pauls it struck him to see whether any one were within  the light might be only from some of the tapers burning perpetually but the pale light in the northeast the morning chill and the clock striking three reminded him that it must be the hour of prime and he said to himself sure if a priest be worshipping at this hour he will be a good and merciful man  i can but try  the door of the transept yielded to his hand  he came forward lighted through the darkness by the gleam of the candles which cast a huge and awful shadow from the crucifix of the roodscreen upon the pavement  before it knelt a black figure in prayer  ambrose advanced in some awe and doubt how to break in on these devotions but the priest had heard his step rose and said what is it my son  dost thou seek sanctuary after these sad doings  nay reverend sir said ambrose   tis a priest for a dying man i seek and in reply to the instant question where it was he explained in haste who the sufferer was and how he had received a fatal blow and was begging for the sacraments  and oh sir he added he is a holy and godfearing man if ever one lived and hath been cruelly and foully entreated by jealous and wicked folk who hated him for his skill and industry  alack for the unhappy lads and alack for those who egged them on said the priest  truly they knew not what they did  i will come with thee my good youth  thou hast not been one of them  no truly sir save that i was carried along and could not break from the throng  i work for lucas hansen the dutch printer whom they have likewise plundered in their savage rage  tis well  thou canst then bear this said the priest taking a thick wax candle  then reverently advancing to the altar whence he took the pyx or gold case in which the host was reserved he lighted the candle which he gave together with his stole to the youth to bear before him  then when the light fell full on his features ambrose with a strange thrill of joy and trust perceived that it was no other than dean colet who had here been praying against the fury of the people  he was very thankful feeling intuitively that there was no fear but that abenali would be understood and for his own part the very contact with the man whom he revered seemed to calm and soothe him though on that solemn errand no word could be spoken  ambrose went on slowly before his dark head uncovered the priestly stole hanging over his arm his hands holding aloft the tall candle of virgin wax while the dean followed closely with feeble steps looking frail and worn but with a grave sweet solemnity on his face  it was a perfectly still morning and as they slowly paced along the flame burnt steadily with little flickering while the pure delicatelycoloured sky overhead was becoming every moment lighter and only the larger stars were visible  the houses were absolutely still and the only person they met a lad creeping homewards after the fray fell on his knees bareheaded as he perceived their errand  once or twice again sounds came up from the city beneath like shrieks or wailing breaking strangely on that fair peaceful may morn but still that pair went on till ambrose had guided the dean to the yard where except that the daylight was revealing more and more of the wreck around all was as he had left it  aldonza poor child with her black hair hanging loose like a veil for she had been startled from her bed still sat on the ground making her lap a pillow for the whitebearded head nobler and more venerable than ever  on it lay in the absolute immobility produced by the paralysing blow the fine features already in the solemn grandeur of death and only the movement of the lips under the white flowing beard and of the dark eyes showing life  dean colet said afterwards that he felt as if he had been called to the deathbed of israel or of barzillai the gileadite especially when the old man in the oriental phraseology he had never entirely lost said i thank thee my god and the god of my fathers that thou hast granted me that which i had prayed for  the dutch printer was already slightly known to the dean having sold him many books  a few words were exchanged with him but it was plain that the dying man could not be moved and that his confession must he made on the lap of the young girl  colet knelt over him so as to be able to hear while lucas and ambrose withdraw but were soon called back for the remainder of the service for the dying  the old mans face showed perfect peace  all worldly thought and care seemed to have been crushed out of him by the blow and he did not even appear to think of the unprotected state of his daughter although he blessed her with solemn fervour immediately after receiving the viaticumthen lay murmuring to himself sentences which ambrose who had learnt much from him knew to be from his arabic breviary about palmbranches and the twelve manner of fruits of the tree of life  it was a strange scenethe grand calm patriarchal old man so peaceful on his darkhaired daughters lap in the midst of the shattered home in the old feudal stable  all were silent a while in awe but the dean was the first to move and speak calling lucas forward to ask sundry questions of him  is there no good woman he asked who could be with this poor child and take her home when her father shall have passed away  mine uncles wife sir said ambrose a little doubtfully  i trow she would comesince i can certify her that your reverence holds him for a holy man  i had thy word for it said the dean  ah reply not my son i see well how it may be with you here  but tell those who will take the word of john colet that never did i mark the passing away of one who had borne more for the true holy catholic faith nor held it more to his souls comfort  for the dean a man of vivid intelligence knew enough of the moresco persecutions to be able to gather from the words of lucas and ambrose and the confession of the old man himself a far more correct estimate of abenalis sufferings and constancy to the truth than any of the more homebred wits could have divined  he knew too that his own orthodoxy was so called in question by the narrower and more unspiritual section of the clergy that only the appreciative friendship of the king and the cardinal kept him securely in his position  ambrose sped away knowing that perronel would be quite satisfied he was sure of her ready compassion and goodwill but she had so often bewailed his running after learning and possibly heretical doctrine that he had doubted whether she would readily respond to a summons on his own authority alone to one looked on with so much suspicion as master michael  colet intimated his intention of remaining a little longer to pray with the dying man and further wrote a few words on his tablets telling ambrose to leave them with one of the porters at his house as he went past st pauls  it was broad daylight now a lovely may morning such as generally called forth the maidens small and great to the meadows to rub their fresh cheeks with the silvery dew and to bring home kingcups cuckoo flowers blue bottles and cowslips for the maypoles that were to be decked  but all was silent now not a house was open the rising sun made the eastern windows of the churches a blaze of light and from the west door of st pauls the city beneath seemed sleeping only a wreath or two of smoke rising  ambrose found the porter looking out for his master in much perturbation  he groaned as he looked at the tablets and heard where the dean was and said that came of being a saint on earth  it would be the death of him ere long  what would old mistress colet his mother say  he would have detained the youth with his inquiries but ambrose said he had to speed down to the temple on an errand from the dean and hurried away  all ludgate hill was now quiet every house closed but here and there lay torn shreds of garments or household vessels  as he reached fleet street however there was a sound of horses feet and a body of menatarms with helmets glancing in the sun were seen  there was a cry theres one  thats one of the lewd younglings  at him  and ambrose to his horror and surprise saw two horsemen begin to gallop towards him as if to ride him down  happily he was close to a narrow archway leading to an alley down which no warhorse could possibly make its way and dashing into it and round a corner he eluded his pursuers and reached the bank of the river whence being by this time experienced in the byways of london he could easily reach perronels house  she was standing at her door looking out anxiously and as she saw him she threw up her hands in thanksgiving to our lady that here he was at last and then turned to scold him  o lad lad what a night thou hast given me  i trusted at least that thou hadst wit to keep out of a fray and to let the poor aliens alone thou that art always running after yonder old spaniard  hey what now  did they fall on him  fie  shame on thema harmless old man like that  yea good aunt and what is more they have slain him i fear me outright  amidst many a good lack and exclamation of pity and indignation from perronel ambrose told his tale of that strange night and entreated her to come with him to do what was possible for abenali and his daughter  she hesitated a little her kind heart was touched but she hardly liked to leave her house in case her husband should come in as he generally contrived to do in the early morning now that the cardinals household was lodged so near her sheltered as she was by the buildings of the temple she had heard little or nothing of the noise of the riot though she had been alarmed at her nephews absence and an officious neighbour had run in to tell her first that the prentice lads were up and sacking the houses of the strangers and next that the tower was firing on them and the lord mayors guard and the gentlemen of the inns of court were up in arms to put them down  she said several times poor soul and yea it were a shame to leave her to the old dutchkin but with true flemish deliberation she continued her household arrangements and insisted that the bowl of broth which she set on the table should be partaken of by herself and ambrose before she would stir a step  not eat  now out on thee lad what good dost thou think thou or i can do if we come in faint and famished where theres neither bite nor sup to be had  as for me not a foot will i budge till i have seen thee empty that bowl  so to it my lad thou hast been afoot all night and lookst so grimed and ill favoured a varlet that no man would think thou camest from an honest wifes house  wash thee at the pail  get thee into thy chamber and put on clean garments or ill not walk the street with thee  tis not safethou wilt be put in ward for one of the rioters  everybody who entered that little house obeyed mistress randall and ambrose submitted knowing it vain to resist and remembering the pursuit he had recently escaped yet the very refreshment of food and cleanliness revealed to him how stiff and weary were his limbs though he was in no mood for rest  his uncle appeared at the door just as he had hoped perronel was ready  ah theres one of you whole and safe he exclaimed  where is the other  stephen exclaimed ambrose  i saw him last in warwick inner yard  and in a few words he explained  hal randall shook his head  may all be well he exclaimed and then he told how sir thomas parr had come at midnight and roused the cardinals household with tidings that all the rabble of london were up plundering and murdering all who came in their way and that he had then ridden on to richmond to the king with the news  the cardinal had put his house into a state of defence not knowing against whom the riot might be directedand the jester had not been awakened till too late to get out to send after his wife besides which by that time intelligence had come in that the attack was directed entirely on the french and spanish merchants and artificers in distant parts of the city and suburbs and was only conducted by lads with no better weapons than sticks so that the temple and its precincts were in no danger at all  the mob had dispersed of its own accord by about three or four oclock but by that hour the mayor had got together a force the gentlemen of the inns of court and the yeomen of the tower were up in arms and the earl of shrewsbury had come in with a troop of horse  they had met the rioters and had driven them in herds like sheep to the different prisons after which lord shrewsbury had come to report to the cardinal that all was quiet and the jester having gathered as much intelligence as he could had contrived to slip into the garments that concealed his motley and to reach home  he gave ready consent to perronels going to the aid of the sufferers in warwick inner yard especially at the summons of the dean of st pauls and even to her bringing home the little wench  indeed he would escort her thither himself for he was very anxious about stephen and ambrose was so dismayed by the account he gave as to reproach himself extremely for having parted company with his brother and never having so much as thought of him as in peril while absorbed in care for abenali  so the three set out together when no doubt the sober solid appearance which randalls double suit of apparel and black gown gave him together with his wifes matronly and respectable look were no small protection to ambrose for menatarms were prowling about the streets looking hungry to pick up straggling victims and one actually stopped randall to interrogate him as to who the youth was and what was his errand  before st pauls they parted the husband and wife going towards warwick inner yard whither ambrose fleeter of foot would follow so soon as he had ascertained at the dragon court whether stephen was at home  alas at the gate he was hailed with the inquiry whether he had seen his brother or giles  the whole yard was disorganised no work going on  the lads had not been seen all night and the master himself had in the midst of his displeasure and anxiety been summoned to the guildhall  the last that was known was giless rescue and the assault on alderman mundy  smallbones and steelman had both gone in different directions to search for the two apprentices and dennet who had flown down unheeded and unchecked at the first hope of news pulled ambrose by the sleeve and exclaimed oh ambrose ambrose they can never hurt them  they can never do any harm to our lads can they  ambrose hoped for the same security but in his dismay could only hurry after his uncle and aunt  he found the former at the door of the old stablewhence issued wild screams and cries  several priests and attendants were there now and the kind dean with lucas was trying to induce aldonza to relax the grasp with which she embraced the body whence a few moments before the brave and constant spirit had departed  her black hair hanging over like a veil she held the inanimate head to her bosom sobbing and shrieking with the violence of her eastern nature  the priest who had been sent for to take care of the corpse and bear it to the mortuary of the minster wanted to move her by force but the dean insisted on one more gentle experiment and beckoned to the kindly woman whom he saw advancing with eyes full of tears  perronel knelt down by her persevered when the poor girl stretched out her hand to beat her off crying off go leave me my father  o father father joy of my life my one only hope and stay leave me not  wake wake speak to thy child o my father  though the child had never seen or heard of eastern wailings over the dead yet hereditary nature prompted her to the lamentations that scandalised the priests and even lucas who broke in with fie maid thou mournest as one who hath no hope  but dr colet still signed to them to have patience and perronel somehow contrived to draw the girls head on her breast and give her a motherly kiss such as the poor child had never felt since she when almost a babe had been lifted from her dying mothers side in the dark stifling hold of the vessel in the bay of biscay  and in sheer surprise and sense of being soothed she ceased her cries listened to the tender whispers and persuasions about holy men who would care for her father and his wishes that she should be a good maidtill at last she yielded let her hands be loosed allowed perronel to lift the venerable head from her knee and close the eyesthen to gather her in her arms and lead her to the door taking her under ambroses guidance into lucass abode which was as utterly and mournfully dismantled as their own but where perronel accustomed in her wandering days to all sorts of contrivances managed to bind up the streaming hair and by the help of her own cloak to bring the poor girl into a state in which she could be led through the streets  the dean meantime had bidden lucas to take shelter at his own house and the old dutchman had given a sort of doubtful acceptance  ambrose meanwhile half distracted about his brother craved counsel of the jester where to seek him    chapter xvii  ill may day    with two and two together tied    through temple bar and strand they go to westminster there to be tried    with ropes about their necks also  ill may day  and where was stephen  crouching wretched with hunger cold weariness blows and what was far worse sense of humiliation and disgrace and terror for the future in a corner of the yard of newgatewhither the whole set of lads surprised in warwick inner court by the law students of the inns of court had been driven like so many cattle at the swords point with no attention or perception that he and giles had been struggling against the spoilers  yet this fact made them all the more forlorn  the others some forty in number their companions in misfortune included most of the barbican prentices who were of the eagle faction special enemies alike to abenali and to the dragon and these held aloof from headley and birkenholt nay reviled them for the attack which they declared had caused the general capture  the two lads of the dragon had in no measured terms denounced the cruelty to the poor old inoffensive man and were denounced in their turn as friends of the sorcerer  but all were too much exhausted by the nights work to have spirit for more than a snarling encounter of words and the only effect was that giles and stephen were left isolated in their misery outside the shelter of the handsome arched gateway under which the others congregated  newgate had been rebuilt by whittington out of pity to poor prisoners and captives  it must have been unspeakably dreadful before for the foulness of the narrow paved court shut in by strong walls was something terrible  tired spent and aching all over and with boyish callousness to dirt still giles and stephen hesitated to sit down and when at last they could stand no longer they rested leaning against one another  stephen tried to keep up hope by declaring that his master would soon get them released and giles alternated between despair and declarations that he would have justice on those who so treated his fathers son  they dropped asleepfirst one and then the otherfrom sheer exhaustion waking from time to time to realise that it was no dream and to feel all the colder and more camped  by and by there were voices at the gate  friends were there asking after their own will or john or thomas as the case might be  the jailer opened a little wicketwindow in the heavy door and no doubt for a consideration passed in food to certain lads whom he called out but it did not always reach its destination  it was often torn away as by hungry wolves  for though the felons had been let out when the doors were opened the new prisoners were not by any means all apprentices  there were watermen husbandmen beggars thieves among them attracted by the scent of plunder and even some of the elder lads had no scruple in snatching the morsel from the younger ones  poor little jasper hope a mischievous little curlyheaded idle fellow only thirteen just apprenticed to his brother the draper and rushing about with the other youths in the pride of his flat cap was one of the sufferers  a servant had been at the door promising that his brother would speedily have him released and handing in bread and meat of which he was instantly robbed by george bates and three or four more big fellows and sent away reeling and sobbing under a heavy blow with all the mischief and play knocked out of him  stephen and giles called shame but were unheeded and they could only draw the little fellow up to them and assure him that his brother would soon come for him  the next call at the gate was headley and birkenholtmaster headleys prenticesbe they here  and at their answer not only the window but the door in the gate was opened and stooping low to enter kit smallbones came in and not emptyhanded  ay ay youngsters said he i knew how it would be by what i saw elsewhere so i came with a fee to open locks  how came ye to get into such plight as this  and poor little hope too  a fine pass when they put babes in jail  im prenticed said jasper though in a very weak little voice  have you had bite or sup asked kit  and on their reply telling how those who had had supplies from home had been treated smallbones observed let them try it and stood at all his breadth guarding the two youths and little jasper as they ate stephen at first with difficulty in the faintness and foulness of the place but then ravenously  smallbones lectured them on their folly all the time and made them give an account of the night  he said their master was at the guildhall taking counsel with the lord mayor and there were reports that it would go hard with the rioters for murder and plunder had been done in many places and he especially looked at giles with pity and asked how he came to embroil himself with master mundy  still his good natured face cheered them and he promised further supplies  he also relieved stephens mind about his brother telling of his inquiry at the dragon in the morning  all that day the condition of such of the prisoners as had welltodo friends was improving fathers brothers masters and servants came in quest of them bringing food and bedding and by exorbitant fees to the jailers obtained for them shelter in the gloomy cells  mothers could not come for a proclamation had gone out that none were to babble and men were to keep their wives at home  and though there were more material comforts prospects were very gloomy  ambrose came when kit smallbones returned with what mrs headley had sent the captives  he looked sad and dazed and clung to his brother but said very little except that they ought to be locked up together and he really would have been left in newgate if kit had not laid a great hand on his shoulder and almost forced him away  master headley himself arrived with master hope in the afternoon jasper sprang to his brother crying simon  simon you are come to take me out of this dismal evil place  but master hopea tall handsome grave young man who had often been much disturbed by his little brothers prankscould only shake his head with tears in his eyes and sitting down on the roll of bedding take him on his knee and try to console him with the hope of liberty in a few days  he had tried to obtain the boys release on the plea of his extreme youth but the authorities were hotly exasperated and would hear of no mercy  the whole of the rioters were to be tried three days hence and there was no doubt that some would be made an example of the only question was how many  master headley closely interrogated his own two lads and was evidently sorely anxious about his namesake who he feared might be recognised by alderman mundy and brought forward as a ringleader of the disturbance nor did he feel at all secure that the plea that he had no enmity to the foreigners but had actually tried to defend lucas and abenali would be attended to for a moment though lucas hansen had promised to bear witness of it  giles looked perfectly stunned at the time unable to take in the idea but at night stephen was wakened on the pallet that they shared with little jasper by hearing him weeping and sobbing for his mother at salisbury  time lagged on till the 4th of may  some of the poor boys whiled away their time with dreary games in the yard sometimes wrestling but more often gambling with the dice that one or two happened to possess for the dinners that were provided for the wealthier sometimes even betting on what the sentences would be and who would be hanged or who escape  poor lads they did not for the most part realise their real danger but stephen was more and more beset with homesick longing for the glades and thickets of his native forest and would keep little jasper and even giles for an hour together telling of the woodland adventures of those happy times shutting his eyes to the grim stone walls and trying to think himself among the beeches hollies cherries and hawthorns shining in the may sun  giles and he were chose friends now and with little jasper said their paters and aves together that they might be delivered from their trouble at last on the 4th the whole of the prisoners were summoned roughly into the court where harshhooking menatarms proceeded to bind them together in pairs to be marched through the streets to the guildhall  giles and stephen would naturally have been put together but poor little jasper cried out so lamentably when he was about to be bound to a stranger that stephen stepped forward in his stead begging that the boy might go with giles  the soldier made a contemptuous sound but consented and stephen found that his companion in misfortune whose left elbow was tied to his right was george bates  the two lads looked at each other in a strange rueful manner and stephen said shake hands comrade  if we are to die let us bear no illwill  george gave a cold limp trembling hand  he looked wretched subdued tearful and nearly starved for he had no kinsfolk at hand and his master was too angry with him and too much afraid of compromising himself to have sent him any supplies  stephen tried to unbutton his own pouch but not succeeding with his left hand bade george try with his right  theres a cake of bread there he said  eat that and thoult be able better to stand up like a man come what will  george devoured it eagerly  ah he said in a stronger voice stephen birkenholt thou art an honest fellow  i did thee wrong if ever we get out of this plight  here they were ordered to march and in a long and doleful procession they set forth  the streets were lined with menatarms for all the affections and sympathies of the people were with the unfortunate boys and a rescue was apprehended  in point of fact the lord mayor and aldermen were afraid of the kings supposing them to have organised the assault on their rivals and each was therefore desirous to show severity to any ones apprentices save his own while the nobility were afraid of contumacy on the part of the citizens and were resolved to crush down every rioter among them so that they had filled the city with their armed retainers  fathers and mothers masters and dames sisters and fellow prentices found their doors closely guarded and could only look with tearful anxious eyes at the processions of poor youths many of them mere children who were driven from each of the jails to the guildhall  there when all collected the entire number amounted to two hundred and seventyeight though a certain proportion of these were grown men priests wherrymen and beggars who had joined the rabble in search of plunder  it did not look well for them that the duke of norfolk and his son the earl of surrey were joined in the commission with the lord mayor  the upper end of the great hall was filled with aldermen in their robes and chains with the sheriffs of london and the whole imposing array and the lord mayor with the duke sat enthroned above them in truly awful dignity  the duke was a hard and pitiless man and bore the city a bitter grudge for the death of his retainer the priest killed in cheapside and in spite of all his poetical fame it may be feared that the earl of surrey was not of much more merciful mood while their menatarms spoke savagely of hanging slaughtering or setting the city on fire  the arraignment was very long as there were so large a number of names to be read and to the horror of all it was not for a mere riot but for high treason  the king it was declared being in amity with all christian princes it was high treason to break the truce and league by attacking their subjects resident in england the terrible punishment of the traitor would thus be the doom of all concerned and in the temper of the howards and their retainers there was little hope of mercy nor in times like those was there even much prospect that out of such large numbers some might escape  a few were more especially cited fourteen in number among them george bates walter ball and giles headley who had certainly given cause for the beginning of the affray  there was no attempt to defend george bates who seemed to be stunned and bewildered beyond the power of speaking or even of understanding but as giles cast his eyes round in wild terrified appeal master headley rose up in his aldermans gown and prayed leave to be heard in his defence as he had witnesses to bring in his favour  is he thy son good armourer headley demanded the duke of norfolk who held the work of the dragon court in high esteem  nay my lord duke but he is in the place of one my near kinsman and godson and so soon as his time be up bound to wed my only child  i pray you to hear his cause ere cutting off the heir of an old and honourable house  norfolk and his sons murmured something about the headley skill in armour and the lord mayor was willing enough for mercy but sir john mundy here rose  my lord duke this is the very young man who was first to lay hands on me  yea my lords and sirs ye have already heard how their rude sport contrary to proclamation was the cause of the tumult  when i would have bidden them go home the one brawler asks me insolently wherefore the other smote me with his sword whereupon the whole rascaille set on me and as master alderman headley can testify i scarce reached his house alive  i ask should favour overcome justice and a ringleader who hath assaulted the person of an alderman find favour above others  i ask not for favour returned headley only that witnesses be heard on his behalf ere he be condemned  headley as a favourite with the duke prevailed to have permission to call his witnesses christopher smallbones who had actually rescued alderman mundy from the mob and helped him into the dragon court could testify that the proclamation had been entirely unheard in the din of the youths looking on at the game  and this was followed up by lucas hansen declaring that so far from having attacked or plundered him and the others in warwick inner yard the two giles headley and stephen birkenholt had come to their defence and fallen on those who were burning their goods  on this a discussion followed between the authorities seated at the upper end of the hall  the poor anxious watchers below could only guess by the gestures what was being agitated as to their fate and stephen was feeling it sorely hard that giles should be pleaded for as the masters kinsman and he left to so cruel a fate no one saying a word for him but unheeded lucas  finally without giving of judgment the whole of the miserable prisoners who had been standing without food for hours were marched back still tied to their several prisons while their guards pointed out the gibbets where they were to suffer the next day  master headley was not quite so regardless of his younger apprentice as stephen imagined  there was a sort of little council held in his hall when he returnedsad dispirited almost hopelessto find hal randall anxiously awaiting him  the alderman said he durst not plead for stephen lest he should lose both by asking too much and his young kinsman had the first right besides being in the most peril as having been singled out by name whereas stephen might escape with the multitude if there were any mercy  he added that the duke of norfolk was certainly inclined to save one who knew the secret of spanish swordblades but that he was fiercely resolved to be revenged for the murder of his lewd priest in cheapside and that sir john mundy was equally determined that giles should not escape  what am i to say to his mother  have i brought him from her for this mourned master headley  ay and master randall i grieve as much for thy nephew who to my mind hath done nought amiss  a brave lad  a good lad who hath saved mine own life  would that i could do aught for him  it is a shame  father said dennet who had crept to the back of his chair the king would save him  mind you the golden whistle that the grandame keepeth  the maid hath hit it exclaimed randall  master alderman  let me but have the little wench and the whistle tomorrow morn and it is done  how sayest thou pretty mistress  wilt thou go with me and ask thy cousins life and poor stephens of the king  with all my heart sir said dennet coming to him with outstretched hands  oh sir canst thou save them  i have been vowing all i could think of to our lady and the saints and now they are going to grant it  tarry a little said the alderman  i must know more of this where wouldst thou take my child  how obtain access to the kings grace  worshipful sir trust me said randall  thou knowst i am sworn servant to my lord cardinal and that his folk are as free of the court as the kings own servants  if thine own folk will take us up the river to richmond and there wait for us while i lead the maid to the king i can wellnigh swear to thee that she will prevail  the alderman looked greatly distressed  ambrose threw himself on his knees before him and in an agony entreated him to consent assuring him that master randall could do what he promised  the alderman was much perplexed  he knew that his mother who was confined to her bed by rheumatism would be shocked at the idea  he longed to accompany his daughter himself but for him to be absent from the sitting of the court might be fatal to giles and he could not bear to lose any chance for the poor youths  meantime an interrogative glance and a nod had passed between tibble and randall and when the alderman looked towards the former always his prime minister the answer was sir meseemeth that it were well to do as master randall counselleth  i will go with mistress dennet if such be your will  the lives of two such youths as our prentices may not lightly be thrown away while by gods providence there is any means of striving to save them  consent then was given and it was further arranged that dennet and her escort should be ready at the early hour of halfpast four so as to elude the guards who were placed in the streets and also because king henry in the summer went very early to mass and then to some outofdoor sport  randall said he would have taken his own good woman to have the care of the little mistress but that the poor little orphan spanish wench had wept herself so sick that she could not be left to a stranger  master headley himself brought the child by back streets to the river and thence down to the temple stairs accompanied by tibble steelman and a maidservant on whose presence her grandmother had insisted  dennet had hardly slept all night for excitement and perturbation and she looked very white small and insignificant for her thirteen years when randall and ambrose met her and placed her carefully in the barge which was to take them to richmond  it was somewhat fresh in the very early morning and no one was surprised that master randall wore a large dark cloak as they rowed up the river  there was very little speech between the passengers dennet sat between ambrose and tibble  they kept their heads bowed ambroses brow was on one hand his elbow on his knee but he spared the other to hold dennet  he had been longing for the old assurance he would once have had that to vow himself to a life of hard service in a convent would be the way to win his brothers life but he had ceased to be able to feel that such bargains were the right course or that a convent necessarily afforded sure way of service and he never felt mere insecure of the way and means to prayer than in this hour of anguished supplication  when they came beyond the city within sight of the trees of sheen as richmond was still often called randall insisted that dennet should eat some of the bread and meat that tibble had brought in a wallet for her  she must look her best he said aside to the foreman  i would that she were either more of a babe or better favoured  our hal hath a tender heart for a babe and an eye for a buxom lass  he bade the maid trim up the childs cap and make the best of her array and presently reached some stairs leading up to the park there he let ambrose lift her out of the boat  the maid would fain have followed but he prevented this and when she spoke of her mistress having bidden her follow wherever the child went tibble interfered telling her that his masters orders were that master randall should do with her as he thought meet  tibble himself followed until they reached a thicket entirely concealing them from the river  halting here randall with his nephews help divested himself of his long gown and cloak his beard and wig produced cockscomb and bauble from his pouch and stood before the astonished eyes of dennet as the jester  she recoiled upon tibble with a little cry oh why should he make sport of us  why disguise himself  listen pretty mistress said randall  tis no disguise tibble there can tell you or my nephew  my disguise lies there pointing to his sober raiment  thus only can i bring thee to the kings presence  didst think it was jest  nay verily i am as bound to try to save my sweet stevies life my sisters own gallant son as thou canst be to plead for thy betrothed  dennet winced  ay mistress dennet said tibble thou mayst trust him spite of his garb and tis the sole hope  he could only thus bring thee in go thou on and the lad and i will fall to our prayers  dennets bosom heaved but she looked up in the jesters dark eyes saw the tears in them made an effort put her hand in his and said i will go with him  hal led her away and they saw tibble and ambrose both fall on their knees behind the hawthorn bush to speed them with their prayers while all the joyous birds singing their carols around seemed to protest against the cruel captivity and dreadful doom of the young gladsome spirits pent up in the city prisons  one full gush of a thrushs song in especial made dennets eyes overflow which the jester perceived and said nay sweet maid no tears  kings brook not to be approached with blubbered faces  i marvel not that it seems hard to thee to go along with such as i but let me be what i will outside mine heart is heavy enough and thou wilt learn sooner or later that fools are not the only folk who needs must smile when they have a load within  and then as much to distract her thoughts and prevent tears as to reassure her he told her what he had before told his nephews of the inducements that had made him wolseys jester and impressed on her the forms of address  thoult hear me make free with him but thats part of mine office like the kitten ive seen tickling the mane of the lion in the tower  thou must say an it please your grace and thou needst not speak of his rolling in the mire thou wottest or it may anger him  the girl showed that her confidence became warmer by keeping nearer to his side and presently she said i must beg for stephen first for tis his whistle  blessings on thee fair wench for that yet seest thou tis the other springald who is in the greater peril and he is closer to thy father and to thee  he fled when stephen made in to the rescue of my father said dennet  the saints grant we may so work with the king that he may spare them both ejaculated randall  by this time the strange pair were reaching the precincts of the great dwellinghouse where about the wideopen door loitered gentlemen grooms lacqueys and attendants of all kinds  randall reconnoitred  an we go up among all these he said they might make their sport of us both so that we might have time  let us see whether the little garden postern be open  henry viii had no fears of his people and kept his dwellings more accessible than were the castles of many a subject  the door in the wall proved to be open and with an exclamation of joy randall pointed out two figures one in a white silken doublet and hose with a short crimson cloak over his shoulder the other in scarlet and purple robes pacing the walk under the wallhenrys way of holding a cabinet council with his prime minister on a summers morning  come on mistress put a brave face on it the jester encouraged the girl as he led her forward while the king catching sight of them exclaimed ha theres old patch  what doth he there  but the cardinal impatient of interruption spoke imperiously what dost thou here merriman  away this is no time for thy fooleries and frolics  but the king with some pleasure in teasing and some of the enjoyment of a schoolboy at a break in his tasks called out nay come hither quipsome one  what new puppet hast brought hither to play off on us  yea brother hal said the jester i have brought one to let thee know how tom of norfolk and his crew are playing the fool in the guildhall and to ask who will be the fool to let them wreak their spite on the best blood in london and leave a sore that will take many a day to heal  how is this my lord cardinal said henry i bade them make an example of a few worthless hinds such as might teach the lusty burghers to hold their lads in bounds and prove to our neighbours that their churlishness was by no consent of ours  i trow returned the cardinal that one of these same hinds is a boon companion of the foolshinc illae lachrymae and a speech that would have befitted a wise mans mouth  there is work that may well make even a fool grave friend thomas replied the jester  nay but what hath this little wench to say asked the king looking down on the child from under his plumed cap with a face set in golden hair the fairest and sweetest as it seemed to her that she had ever seen as he smiled upon her  methinks she is too small to be thy love  speak out little one  i love little maids i have one of mine own  hast thou a brother among these misguided lads  not so an please your grace said dennet who fortunately was not in the least shy and was still too young for a maidens shamefastness  he is to be my betrothed  i would say one of them is but the otherhe saved my fathers life once  the latter words were lost in the laughter of the king and cardinal at the unblushing avowal of the small primfaced maiden  oh ho  so tis a case of true love whereto a kings face must needs show grace  who art thou fair suppliant and who may this swain of thine be  i am dennet headley so please your grace my father is giles headley the armourer alderman of cheap ward said dennet doing her part bravely though puzzled by the kings tone of banter and see here your grace  ha the hawks whistle that archduke philip gave me  what of that i gave itay i gave it to a youth that came to mine aid and reclaimed a falcon for me  ist he child  oh sir tis he who came in second at the butts next to barlow tis stephen birkenholt  and he did nought  they bore no illwill to strangers  no they were falling on the wicked fellows who had robbed and slain good old master michael who taught our folk to make the only real true damascus blades welded in england  but the lawyers of the inns of court fell on them all alike and have driven them off to newgate and poor little jasper hope too  and alderman mundy bears illwill to giles  and the cruel duke of norfolk and his men swear theyll have vengeance on the cheap and therell be hanging and quartering this very morn  oh your grace your grace save our lads for stephen saved my father  thy tongue wags fast little one said the king goodnaturedly with thy stephen and thy giles  is this same stephen the knight of the whistle and the bow thy betrothed and giles thy brother  nay your grace said dennet hanging her head giles headley is my betrothedthat is when his time is served he will befather sets great store by him for he is the only one of our name to keep up the armoury and he has a mother sir a mother at salisbury but oh sir sir  stephen is so good and brave a had  he made in to save father from the robbers and he draws the best bow in cheapside and he can grave steel as well as tibble himself and this is the whistle your grace wots of  henry listened with an amused smile that grew broader as dennets voice all unconsciously became infinitely more animated and earnest when she began to plead stephens cause  well well sweetheart he said i trow thou must have the twain of them though he added to the cardinal who smiled broadly it might perchance be more for the maids peace than she wots of now were we to leave this same knight of the whistle to be strung up at once ere she have found her heart but in sooth that i cannot do owing well nigh a life to him and his brother  moreover we may not have old headleys skill in weapons lost  dennet held her hands close clasped while these words were spoken apart  she felt as if her hope half granted were being snatched from her as another actor appeared on the scene a gentleman in a lawyers gown and square cap which he doffed as he advanced and put his knee to the ground before the king who greeted him with save you good sir thomas a fair morning to you  they told me your grace was in council with my lord cardinal said sir thomas more but seeing that there was likewise this merry company i durst venture to thrust in since my business is urgent  dennet here forgot court manners enough to cry out o your grace your grace be pleased for pitys sake to let me have the pardon for them first or theyll be hanged and dead  i saw the gallows in cheapside and when they are dead what good will your graces mercy do them  i see said sir thomas  this little maids errand jumps with mine own which was to tell your grace that unless there be speedy commands to the howards to hold their hands there will be wailing like that of egypt in the city  the poor boys who were but shouting and brawling after the nature of mettled youththe most with nought of maliceare penned up like sheep for the slaughter ay and worse than sheep for we quarter not our mutton alive whereas these poor younglingsbabes of thirteen some of thembe indicted for high treason  will the parents shut in from coming to them by my lord of norfolks men ever forget their agonies i ask your grace  henrys face grew red with passion  if norfolk thinks to act the king and turn the city into a shambleswith a mighty oathhe shall abye it  here lord cardinalmore let the free pardon be drawn up for the two lads  and we will ourselves write to the lord mayor and to norfolk that though they may work their will on the movers of the riotthat pestilent lincoln and his sortnot a prentice lad shall be touched till our pleasure be known  there now child thou hast won the lives of thy lads as thou callest them  wilt thou rue the day i marvel  why cannot some of their mothers pluck up spirit and beg them off as thou hast done  yea said wolsey  that were the right course  if the queen were moved to pray your grace to pity the striplings then could the spaniards make no plaint of too much clemency being shown  they were all this time getting nearer the palace and being now at a door opening into the hall henry turned round  there pretty maid spread the tidings among thy gossips that they have a tender hearted queen and a gracious king  the lord cardinal will presently give thee the pardon for both thy lads and by and by thou wilt know whether thou thankest me for it  then putting his hand under her chin he turned up her face to him kissed her on each cheek and touched his feathered cap to the others saying see that my bidding be done and disappeared  it must be prompt if it be to save any marked for death this morn more in a how voice observed to the cardinal  lord edmund howard is keen as a bloodhound on his vengeance  wolsey was far from being a cruel man and besides there was a natural antagonism between him and the old nobility and he liked and valued his fool to whom he turned saying and what stake hast thou in this sirrah  ist all pure charity  im scarce such a fool as that cousin red hat replied randall rallying his powers  i leave that to mr more here whom we all know to be a good fool spoilt  but ill make a clean breast of it this same stephen is my sisters son an orphan lad of good birth and breedingwhom my lord i would die to save  thou shalt have the pardon instantly merriman said the cardinal and beckoning to one of the attendants who clustered round the door he gave orders that a clerk should instantly and very briefly make out the form  sir thomas more hearing the name of headley added that for him indeed the need of haste was great since he was one of the fourteen sentenced to die that morning  quipsome hal was interrogated as to how he had come and the cardinal and sir thomas agreed that the river would be as speedy a way of returning as by land but they decided that a kings pursuivant should accompany him otherwise there would be no chance of forcing his way in time through the streets guarded by the howard retainers  as rapidly as was in the nature of a high officers clerk to produce a dozen lines the precious document was indicted and it was carried at last to dennet bearing henrys signature and seal  she held it to her bosom while accompanied by the pursuivant who happily for themwas interested in one of the unfortunate fourteen and therefore did not wait to stand on his dignity they hurried across to the place where they had left the bargetibble and ambrose joining them on the way  stephen was safe  of his life there could be no doubt and ambrose almost repented of feeling his heart so light while giless fate hung upon their speed  the oars were plied with hearty goodwill but the barge was somewhat heavy and by and by coming to a landingplace where two watermen had a much smaller and lighter boat the pursuivant advised that he should go forward with the more necessary persons leaving the others to follow  after a few words the light weights of tibble and dennet prevailed in their favour and they shot forward in the little boat  they passed the templeon to the stairs nearest cheapsideup the street  there was an awful stillness only broken by heavy knells sounding at intervals from the churches  the back streets were thronged by a trembling weeping people who all eagerly made way for the pursuivant as he called make way good peoplea pardon  they saw the broader space of cheapside  horsemen in armour guarded it but they too opened a passage for the pursuivant  there was to be seen above the peoples heads a scaffold  a fire burnt on it the gallows and noosed rope hung above  a figure was mounting the ladder  a boy  oh heavens would it be too late  who was it  they were still too far off to see  they might only be cruelly holding out hope to one of the doomed  the pursuivant shouted aloudin the kings name hold  he lifted dennet on his shoulder and bade her wave her parchment  an overpowering roar arose  a pardon a pardon  god save the king  every hand seemed to be forwarding the pursuivant and the child and it was giles headley who loosed from the hold of the executioner stared wildly about him like one distraught    chapter xviii  pardon    what if quoth she by spanish blood have londons stately streets been wet yet will i seek this countrys good and pardon for these young men get  churchill  the night and morning had been terrible to the poor boys who only had begun to understand what awaited them  the fourteen selected had little hope and indeed a priest came in early morning to hear the confessions of giles headley and george bates the only two who were in newgate  george bates was of the stolid heavy disposition that seems armed by outward indifference or mayhap pride  he knew that his case was hopeless and he would not thaw even to the priest  but giles had been quite unmanned and when he found that for the doleful procession to the guildhall he was to be coupled with george bates instead of either of his roomfellows he flung himself on stephens neck sobbing out messages for his mother and entreaties that if stephen survived he would be good to aldonza  for you will wed dennet and  there the jailers roughly ordered him to hold his peace and dragged him off to be pinioned to his fellowsufferer  stephen was not called till some minutes later and had not seen him since  he himself was of course overshadowed by the awful gloom of apprehension for himself and pity for his comrades and he was grieved at not having seen or heard of his brother or master but he had a very present care in jasper who was sickening in the prison atmosphere and when fastened to his arm seemed hardly able to walk  leashed as they were stephen could only help him by holding the free hand and when they came to the hall supporting him as much as possible as they stood in the miserable throng during the conclusion of the formalities which ended by the horrible sentence of the traitor being pronounced on the whole two hundred and seventyeight  poor little jasper woke for an interval from the sense of present discomfort to hear it he seemed to stiffen all over with the shock of horror and then hung a dead weight on stephens arm  it would have dragged him down but there was no room to fall and the wretchedness of the lad against whom he staggered found vent in a surly imprecation which was lost among the cries and the entreaties of some of the others  the london magistracy were some of them in tears but the indictment for high treason removed the poor lads from their jurisdiction to that of the earl marshal and thus they could do nothing to save the fourteen foremost victims  the others were again driven out of the hall to return to their prisons the nearest pair of lads doing their best to help stephen drag his burthen along  in the halt outside to arrange the sad processions one of the guards of milder mood cut the cord that bound the lifeless weight to stephen and permitted the child to be laid on the stones of the court his collar unbuttoned and water to be brought  jasper was just reviving when the word came to march but still he could not stand and stephen was therefore permitted the free use of his arms in order to carry the poor little fellow  thirteen years made a considerable load for seventeen though stephens arms were exercised in the smithy and it was a sore pull from the guildhall  jasper presently recovered enough to walk with a good deal of support  when he was laid on the bed he fell unto an exhausted sleep while stephen kneeling as the strokes of the knell smote on his ear prayedas he had never prayed beforefor his comrade for his enemy and for all the unhappy boys who were being led to their death wherever the outrages had been committed  once indeed there was a strange sound coming across that of the knell  it almost sounded like an acclamation of joy  could people be so cruel thought stephen as to mock poor giless agonies there were the knells still sounding  how long he did not know for a beneficent drowsiness stole over him as he knelt and he was only awakened at the same time as jasper by the opening of his door  he looked up to see three figureshis brother his uncle his master  were they come to take leave of him  but the one conviction that their faces beamed with joy was all that he could gather for little jasper sprang up with a scream of terror stephen stephen save me  they will cut out my heart and clung trembling to his breast with arms round his neck  poor child poor child sighed master headley  would that i brought him the same tidings as to thee  is it so asked stephen reading confirmation as he looked from the one to the other  though he was unable to rise under the weight of the boy life and light were coming to his eye while ambrose clasped his hand tightly chocked by the swelling of his heart in almost an agony of joy and thankfulness  yea my good lad said the alderman  thy good kinsman took my little wench to bear to the king the token he gave thee  and giles stephen asked and the rest  giles is safe  for the restmay god have mercy on their souls  these words passed while stephen rocked jasper backwards and forwards his face hidden on his neck  come home added master headley  my little dennet and giles cannot yet rejoice till thou art with them  giles would have come himself but he is sorely shaken and could scarce stand  jasper caught the words and loosing his friends neck looked up oh are we going home  come stephen  wheres brother simon  i want my good sister  i want nurse  oh take me home  for as he tried to sit up he fell back sick and dizzy on the bed  alack alack mourned master headley and the jester muttering that it was not the little wenchs fault turned to the window and burst into tears  stephen understood it all and though he felt a passionate longing for freedom he considered in one moment whether there were any one of his fellow prisoners to whom jasper could be left or who would be of the least comfort to him but could find no one and resolved to cling to him as once to old spring  sir he said as he rose to his master i fear me he is very sick  will theywill your worship give me licence to bide with him till this ends  thou art a goodhearted lad said the alderman with a hand on his shoulder  there is no further danger of life to the prentice lads the king hath sent to forbid all further dealing with them and hath bidden my little maid to set it about that if their mothers beg them grace from good queen katherine they shall have it  but this poor child  he can scarce be left  his brother will take it well of thee if thou wilt stay with him till some tendance can be had  we can see to that  thanks be to st george and our good king this good city is our own again  the alderman turned away and ambrose and stephen exchanged a passionate embrace feeling what it was to be still left to one another  the jester too shook his nephews hand saying boy boy the blessing of such as i is scarce worth the having but i would thy mother could see thee this day  stephen was left with these words and his brothers look to bear him through a trying time  for the captain of newgate was an autocrat who looked on his captives as compulsory lodgers out of whom he was entitled to wring as much as possibleas indeed he had no other salary nor means of maintaining his underlings a state of things which lasted for two hundred years longer until the days of james oglethorpe and john howard  even in the rare cases of acquittals the prisoner could not be released till he had paid his fees and that giles headley should have been borne off from the scaffold itself in debt to him was an invasion of his privileges which did not dispose him to be favourable to any one connected with that affair and he liked to show his power and dignity even to an alderman  he was found sitting in a comfortable tapestried chamber handsomely dressed in orange and brown and with a smooth sleek countenance and the appearance of a goodnatured substantial citizen  he only half rose from his big carved chair and touched without removing his cap to greet the alderman as he observed without the accustomed prefix of your worshipso you are come about your prentices fees and dues  by st peter of the fetters tis an irksome matter to have such a troop of idle mischievous dainty striplings thrust on one giving more trouble and making more call and outcry than twice as many honest thieves and pickpurses  be assured sir they will scarce trouble you longer than they can help said master headley  yea the duke and my lord edmund are making brief work of them quoth the jailer  ha with an oath whats that  nought will daunt those lads till the hangman is at their throats  for it was a real hurrah that reached his ears  the jester had got all the boys round him in the court and was bidding them keep up a good heart for their lives were safe and their mothers would beg them off  their shouts did not tend to increase the captains good humour and though he certainly would not have let out alderman headleys remaining apprentice without his fee he made as great a favour of permission and charged as exorbitantly for a pardoned man to remain within his domains as if they had been the most costly and delightful hostel in the kingdom  master hope who presently arrived had to pay a high fee for leave to bring master todd the barbersurgeon with him to see his brother but though he offered a mark a day a huge amount at that time the captain was obdurate in refusing to allow the patient to be attended by his own old nurse declaring that it was contrary to discipline and what probably affected him much more one such woman could cause more trouble than a dozen felons  no doubt it was true for she would have insisted on moderate cleanliness and comfort  no other attendant whom mr hope could find would endure the disgrace the discomfort and alarm of a residence in newgate for jaspers sake so that the drapers gratitude to stephen birkenholt for voluntarily sharing the little fellows captivity was great and he gave payment to one or two of the officials to secure the two lads being civilly treated and that the provisions sent in reached them duly  jasper did not in general seem very ill by day only heavy listless and dull unable to eat too giddy to sit up and unable to help crying like a babe if stephen left him for a moment but he never fell asleep without all the horror and dread of the sentence coming over him  like all the boys in london he had gazed at executions with the sort of curiosity that leads rustic lads to run to see pigs killed and now the details came over him in semidelirium as acted out on himself and he shrieked and struggled in an anguish which was only mitigated by stephens reassurances caresses even scoldings  the other youths relieved from the apprehension of death agreed to regard their detention as a holiday and not being squeamish turned the yard into a playground and there they certainly made uproar and played pranks enough to justify the preference of the captain for full grown criminals  but stephen could not join them for jasper would not spare him for an instant and he himself though at first sorely missing employment and exercise was growing drowsy and heavy limbed in his cramped life and the evil atmosphere even the sick longings for liberty were gradually passing away from him so that sometimes he felt as if he had lived here for ages and known no other life though no sooner did he lie down to rest and shut his eyes than the trees and green glades of the new forest rose before him with all the hollies shining in the summer light or the gorse making a sheet of gold  the time was not in reality so very long  on the 7th of may john lincoln the broker who had incited canon peale to preach against the foreigners was led forth with several others of the real promoters of the riot to the centre of cheapside where lincoln was put death but orders were brought to respite the rest and at the same time all the armed men were withdrawn the city began to breathe and the women who had been kept within doors to go abroad again  the recorder of london and several aldermen were to meet the king at his manor at greenwich  this was the mothers opportunity  the civic dignitaries rode in mourning robes but the wives and mothers sweethearts and sisters every woman who had a youths life at stake came together took boat and went down the river a strange fleet of barges all containing white caps and black gowns and hoods for all were clad in the most correct and humble citizens costume  never was such a sight said jester randall who had taken care to secure a view and who had come with his report to the dragon court it might have been ash wednesday for the look of them when they landed and got into order  one would think every prentice lad had got at least three mothers and four or five aunts and sisters  i trow verily that half of them came to look on at the other half and get a sight of greenwich and the three queens  however be that as it might not one of them but knew how to open the sluices queen katharine noted well what was coming and she and the queens of scotland and france sat in the great chamber with the doors open and immediately theres a knock at the door and so soon as the usher opens it in they come three and three every good wife of them with her napkin to her eyes and working away with her sobs then mistress todd the barbersurgeons wife she spoke for all being thought to have the more courtly tongue having been tirewoman to queen mary ere she went to france  verily her husband must have penned the speech for herfor it began right scholarly and flowery with a likening of themselves to the mothers of bethlehem lusty innocents theirs i trow but ere long the good woman faltered and forgot her part and broke out oh madam you that are a mother yourself for the sake of your own sweet babe give us back our sons and therewith they all fell on their knees weeping and wringing their hands and crying out mercy mercy  for our blessed ladys sake have pity on our children till the good queen with the tears running down her cheeks for very ruth told them that the power was not in her hands but the will was for them and their poor sons and that she would strive so to plead for them with the king as to win their freedom  meantime there were the aldermen watching for the king in his chamber of presence till forth he came when all fell on their knees and the recorder spake for them casting all the blame on the vain and light persons who had made that enormity  thereupon what does our hal but make himself as stern as though he meant to string them all up in a line ye ought to wail and be sorry said he whereas ye say that substantial persons were not concerned it appeareth to the contrary  you did wink at the matter quoth he and at this time we will grant you neither favour nor goodwill  however none who knew hals eye but could tell that twas all very excellent fooling when he bade them get to the cardinal  therewith in came the three queens hand in hand with tears in their eyes so as they might have been the three queens that bore away king arthur and down they went on their knees and cried aloud dear sir we who are mothers ourselves beseech you to set the hearts at ease of all the poor mothers who are mourning for their sons  whereupon the door being opened came in so piteous a sound of wailing and lamentation as our harrys name must have been herod to withstand  stand up kate said he stand up sisters and hark in your ear  not a hair of the silly lads shall be touched but they must bide lock and key long enough to teach them and their masters to keep better ward and then when the queens came back with the good tidings such a storm of blessings was never heard laughings and cryings and the like for verily some of the women seemed as distraught for joy as ever they had been for grief and fear  moreover mistress todd being instructed of her husband led up mistress hope to queen mary and told her the tale of how her husbands little brother a mere babe lay sick in prisona mere babe a suckling as it wereand was like to die there unless the sooner delivered and how our steve was fool enough to tarry with the poor child pardoned though he be  then the good lady wept again and good woman saith she to mistress hope the king will set thy brother free anon  his wrath is not with babes nor with lads like this other of whom thou speakest  so off was she to the king again and though he and his master pished and pshawed and said if one and another were to be set free privily in this sort there would be none to come and beg for mercy as a warming to all malapert youngsters to keep within bounds nay verily quoth i seeing the moment for shooting a fools bolt among them methinks master death will have been a picklock before you are ready for them and then who will stand to cry mercy  the narrative was broken off short by a cry of jubilee in the court workmen boys and all were thronging together kit smallbones head towering in the midst  vehement welcomes seemed in progress stephen  stephen shouted dennet and flew out of the hall and down the steps  the lad himself exclaimed the jester leaping down after her  stephen the good boy said master headley descending more slowly but not less joyfully  yes stephen himself it was who had quietly walked into the court master hope and master todd had brought the order for jaspers release had paid the captains exorbitant fees for both and while the sick boy was carried home in a litter stephen had entered the dragon court through the gates as if he were coming home from an errand though the moment he was recognised by the little fouryear old smallbones there had been a general rush and shout of ecstatic welcome led by giles headley who fairly threw himself on stephens neck as they met like comrades after a desperate battle  not one was there who did not claim a grasp of the boys hand and who did not pour out welcomes and greetings while in the midst the released captive looked to say the truth very spiritless faded dusty nay dirty  the court seemed spinning round with him and the loud welcomes roared in his ears  he was glad that dennet took one hand and giles the other declaring that he must be led to the grandmother instantly  he muttered something about being in too foul trim to go near her but dennet held him fast and he was too dizzy to make much resistance  old mrs headley was better again though not able to do much but sit by the fire kept burning to drive away the plague which was always smouldering in london  she held out her hands to stephen as he knelt down by her  take an old womans blessing my good youth she said  right glad am i to see thee once more  thou wilt not be the worse for the pains thou hast spent on the little lad though they have tried thee sorely  stephen becoming somewhat less dazed tried to fulfil his long cherished intention of thanking dennet for her intercession but the instant he tried to speak to his dismay and indignation tears choked his voice and he could do nothing but weep as if thought he his manhood had been left behind in the jail  vex not thyself said the old dame as she saw him struggling with his sobs  thou art worn outgiles here was not half his own man when he came out nor is he yet  nay beset him not children  he should go to his chamber change these garments and rest ere suppertime  stephen was fain to obey only murmuring an inquiry for his brother to which his uncle responded that if ambrose were at home the tidings would send him to the dragon instantly but he was much with his old master who was preparing to leave england his work here being ruined  the jester then took leave accepting conditionally an invitation to supper  master headley smallbones and tibble now knew who he was but the secret was kept from all the rest of the household lest stephen should be twitted with the connection  cold water was not much affected by the citizens of london but smiths and armourers work entailed a freer use of it than less grimy trades and a bath and sunday garments made stephen more like himself though still he felt so weary and depressed that he missed the buoyant joy of release to which he had been looking forward  he was sitting on the steps leaning against the rail so much tired that he hoped none of his comrades would notice that he had come out when ambrose hurried into the court having just heard tidings of his freedom and was at his side at once  the two brothers sat together leaning against one another as if they had all that they could wish or long for  they had not met for more than a week for ambroses finances had not availed to fee the turnkeys to give him entrance  and what art thou doing ambrose asked stephen rousing a little from his lethargy  methought i heard mine uncle say thine occupation was gone  even so replied ambrose  master lucas will sail in a weeks time to join his brother at rotterdam bearing with him what he hath been able to save out of the havoc  i wot not if i shall ever see the good man more  i am glad thou dost not go with him said stephen with a hand on his brothers leathercovered knee  i would not put seas between us returned ambrose  moreover though i grieve to lose my good master who hath been so scurvily entreated here yet stephen this trouble and turmoil hath brought me that which i longed for above all even to have speech with the dean of st pauls  he then told stephen how he had brought dean colet to administer the last rites to abenali and how that good man had bidden lucas to take shelter at the deanery in the desolation of his own abode this had led to conversation between the dean and the printer lucas who distrusted all ecclesiastics would accept no patronage he had a little hoard buried in the corner of his stall which would suffice to carry him to his native home and he wanted no more but he had spoken of ambrose and the dean was quite ready to be interested in the youth who had led him to abenali  he had me to his privy chamber said ambrose and spake to me as no man hath yet spokenno not even tibble  he let me utter all my mind nay i never wist before even what mine own thoughts were till he set them before meas it were in a mirror  thou wast ever in a harl said stephen drowsily using the hampshire word for whirl or entanglement  yea  on the one side stood all that i had ever believed or learnt before i came hither of the one true and glorious motherchurch to whom the blessed lord had committed the keys of his kingdom through his holy martyrs and priests to give us the blessed host and lead us in the way of salvation  and on the other side i cannot but see the lewd and sinful and worldly lives of the most part and hear the lies whereby they amass wealth and turn men from the spirit of truth and holiness to delude them into believing that wilful sin can be committed without harm and that purchase of a parchment is as good as repentance  that do i see and hear  and therewith my master lucas and dan tindall and those of the new light declare that all has been false even from the very outset and that all the pomp and beauty is but satans bait and that to believe in christ alone is all that needs to justify us casting all the rest aside  all seemed a mist and i was swayed hither and thither till the more i read and thought the greater was the fog  and thisi know not whether i told it to yonder good and holy doctor or whether he knew it for his eyes seemed to see into me and he told me that he had felt and thought much the same  but on that one great truth that faith in the passion is salvation is the church built though sinful men have hidden it by their errors and lies as befell before among the israelites whose law like ours was divine  whatever is entrusted to man he said will become stained soiled and twisted though the power of the holy spirit will strive to renew it  and such an outpouring of cleansing and renewing power is he saith abroad in our day  when he was a young man this good father so he said hoped great things and did his best to set forth the truth both at oxford and here as indeed he hath ever done he and the good doctor erasmus striving to turn mens eyes back to the simplicity of gods word rather than to the arguments and deductions of the schoolmen  and for the abuses of evil priests that have sprung up my lord cardinal sought the legatine commission from our holy father at rome to deal with them  but dr colet saith that there are other forces at work and he doubteth greatly whether this same cleansing can be done without some great and terrible rending and upheaving that may even split the church as it were asunder since judgment surely awaiteth such as will not be reformed  but quoth he our motherchurch is gods own church and i will abide by her to the end as the means of oneness with my lord and head and do thou the same my son for thou art like to be more sorely tried than will a frail old elder like me who would fain say his nunc dimittis if such be the lords will ere the foundations be cast down  ambrose had gone on rehearsing all these words with the absorption of one to whom they were everything till it occurred to him to wonder that stephen had listened to so much with patience and assent and then looking at the position of head and hands he perceived that his brother was asleep and came to a sudden halt this roused stephen to say eh  what  the dean will he do aught for thee  yea said ambrose recollecting that there was little use in returning to the perplexities which stephen could not enter into he deemed that in this mood of mine yea and as matters now be at the universities i had best not as yet study there for the priesthood  but he said he would commend me to a friend whose life would better show me how the new gives life to the old than any man he wots of  one of thy old doctors in barnacles i trow said stephen  nay verily  we saw him tother night perilling his life to stop the poor crazy prentices and save the foreigners  dennet and our uncle saw him pleading for them with the king  what  sir thomas more  ay no other  he needs a clerk for his law matters and the dean said he would speak of me to him  he is to sup at the deanery to morrow and i am to be in waiting to see him  i shall go with a lighter heart now that thou art beyond the clutches of the captain of newgate  speak no more of that said stephen with a shudder  would that i could forget it  in truth stephens health had suffered enough to change the bold highspirited active had so that he hardly knew himself  he was quite incapable of work all the next day and mistress headley began to dread that he had brought home jail fever and insisted on his being inspected by the barbersurgeon todd who proceeded to bleed the patient in order as he said to carry off the humours contracted in the prison  he had done the same by jasper hope and by giles but he followed the treatment up with better counsel namely that the lads should all be sent out of the city to some farm where they might eat curds and whey until their strength should be restored  thus they would be out of reach of the sweating sickness which was already in some of the purlieus of st katharines docks and must be specially dangerous in their lowered condition  master hope came in just after this counsel had been given  he had a sister married to the host of a large prosperous inn near windsor and he proposed to send not only jasper but stephen thither feeling how great a debt of gratitude he owed to the lad  remembering well the good young mistress streatfield and knowing that the antelope was a large old house of excellent repute where she often lodged persons of quality attending on the court or needing country air master headley added giles to the party at his own expense and wished also to send dennet for greater security only neither her grandmother nor mrs hope could leave home  it ended however in perronel randall being asked to take charge of the whole party including aldonza  that little damsel had been in a manner confided to her both by the dean of st pauls and by tibble steelmanand indeed the motherly woman after nursing and soothing her through her first despair at the loss of her father was already loving her heartily and was glad to give her a place in the home which ambrose was leaving on being made an attendant on sir thomas more  for the interview at the deanery was satisfactory  the young man after a good supper enlivened by the sweet singing of some chosen pupils of st pauls school was called up to where the dean sat and with him the man of the peculiarly sweet countenance with the noble and deep expression yet withal something both tender and humorous in it  they made him tell his whole life and asked many questions about abenali specially about the fragment of arabic scroll which had been clutched in his hand even as he lay dying  they much regretted never having known of his existence till too late  jewels lie before the unheeding said more  then ambrose was called on to show a specimen of his own penmanship and to write from sir thomass dictation in english and in latin  the result was that he was engaged to act as one of the clerks sir thomas employed in his occupations alike as lawyer statesman and scholar  methinks i have seen thy face before said sir thomas looking keenly at him  i have beheld those black eyes though with a different favour  ambrose blushed deeply  sir it is but honest to tell you that my mothers brother is jester to my lord cardinal  quipsome hal merriman  patch as the king calleth him exclaimed sir thomas  a man i have ever thought wore the motley rather from excess than infirmity of wit  nay sir so please you it was his good heart that made him a jester said ambrose explaining the story of randall and his perronel in a few words which touched the friends a good deal and the dean remembered that she was in charge of the little moresco girl  he lost nothing by dealing thus openly with his new master who promised to keep his secret for him then gave him handsel of his salary and bade him collect his possessions and come to take up his abode in the house of the more family at chelsea  he would still often see his brother in the intervals of attending sir thomas to the courts of law but the chief present care was to get the boys into purer air both to expedite their recovery and to ensure them against being dragged into the penitential company who were to ask for their lives on the 22nd of may consisting of such of the prisoners who could still stand or gofor jailfever was making havoc among them and some of the betterconditioned had been released by private interest  the remainder not more than half of the original two hundred and seventyeight were stripped to their shirts had halters hung round their necks and then roped together as before were driven through the streets to westminster where the king sat enthroned  there looking utterly miserable they fell on their knees before him and received his pardon for their misdemeanours  they returned to their masters and so ended that ill mayday which was the longer remembered because one churchill a balladmonger in st pauls churchyard indited a poem on it wherein he swelled the number of prentices to two thousand and of the victims to two hundred  will wherry who escaped from among the prisoners very forlorn was recommended by ambrose to the work of a carter at the dragon which he much preferred to printing    chapter xix  at the antelope    say father thames for thou hast seen    full many a sprightly race disporting on thy margent green    the paths of pleasure trace gray  master hope took all the guests by boat to windsor and very soon the little party at the antelope was in a state of such perfect felicity as became a proverb with them all their lives afterwards it was an inn wherein to take ones ease a large hostel full of accommodation for man and horse with a big tapestried room of entertainment below where meals were taken with an oriel window with a view of the round tower and above it a still more charming one known as the red rose because one of the dukes of somerset had been wont to lodge there  the walls were tapestried with the story of st genoveva of brabant fresh and new on mrs streatfields marriage there was a huge bed with green curtains of that dames own work where one might have said   above below the rose of snow twined with her blushing foe we spread   so as to avoid all offence  there was also a cupboard or sideboard of the choicer plate belonging to the establishment and another awmry containing appliances for chess and backgammon likewise two large chairs several stools and numerous chests  this apartment was given up to mistress randall and the two girls subject however to the chance of turning out for any very distinguished guests  the big bed held all three and the chamber was likewise their sittingroom though they took their meals down stairs and joined the party in the common room in the evening whenever they were not out of doors unless there were guests whom perronel did not think desirable company for her charges  stephen and giles were quartered in a small room known as the feathers smelling so sweet of lavender and woodruff that stephen declared it carried him back to the forest  mrs streatfield would have taken jasper to tend among her children but the boy could not bear to be without stephen and his brother advised her to let it be so and not try to make a babe of him again  the guestchamber below stairs opened at one end into the innyard a quadrangle surrounded with stables outhouses and offices with a gallery running round to give access to the chambers above where when the court was at windsor two or three great mens trains of retainers might be crowded together  one door however in the side of the guestchamber had steps down to an orchard full of apple and pear trees in their glory of pink bud and white blossom borders of roses gillyflowers and lilies of the valley running along under the grey walls  there was a broad space of grass near the houses whence could be seen the round tower of the castle looking down in protection while the background of the view was filled up with a mass of the foliage of windsor forest in the spring tints  stephen never thought of its being beautiful but he revelled in the refreshment of anything so like home and he had nothing to wish for but his brother and after all he was too contented and happy even to miss him much  master streatfield was an elderly man fat and easygoing to whom talking seemed rather a trouble than otherwise though he was very goodnatured  his wife was a merry lively active woman who had been handed over to him by her father like a piece of flanders cambric but who never seemed to regret her position managed men and maids farm and guests kept perfect order without seeming to do so and made great friends with perronel never guessing that she had been one of the strolling company who nine or ten years before had been refused admission to the antelope then crowded with my lord of oxfords followers  at first it was enough for the prentices to spend most of their time in lying about on the grass under the trees  giles who was in the best condition exerted himself so far as to try to learn chess from aldonza who seemed to be a proficient in the game and even defeated the goodnatured burly parson who came every evening to the antelope to imbibe slowly a tankard of ale and hear any news there stirring  she and giles were content to spend hours over her instructions in chess on that pleasant balcony in the shade of the house  though really only a year older than dennet headley she looked much more and was so in all her ways  it never occurred to her to run childishly wild with delight in the garden and orchard as did dennet who with little fiveyearsold will streatfield for her guide and playfellow rushed about hither and thither making acquaintance with hens and chickens geese and goslings seeing cows and goats milked watching butter churned bringing all manner of animal and vegetable curiosities to stephen to be named and explained and enjoying his delight in them a delight which after the first few days became more and more vigorous  by and by there was punting and fishing on the river strawberry gathering in the park explorations of the forest expeditions of all sorts and kinds jasper being soon likewise well enough to share in them  the boys and girls were in a kind of fairy hand under perronels kind wing the wandering habits of whose girlhood made the freedom of the country far more congenial to her than it would have been to any regular londoner  stephen was the great oracle of course as to the deer respectfully peeped at in the park or the squirrels the hares and rabbits in the forest and the inhabitants of the stream above or below  it was he who secured and tamed the memorials of their visittwo starlings for dennet and aldonza  the birds were to be taught to speak and to do wonders of all kinds but aldonzas bird was found one morning dead and giles consoled her by the promise of something much bigger and that would talk much better  two days after he brought her a young jackdaw  aldonza clasped her hands and admired its glossy back and queer blue eye and was in transports when it uttered something between jack and good lack  but dennet looked in scorn at it and said thats a bird tamed already  he didnt catch it  he only bought it  i would have none such  an ugsome great thieving bird  nay now mistress dennet argued perronel  thou hast thy bird and alice has lost hers  it is not meet to grudge it to her  i  grudge it to her said dennet with a toss of the head  i grudge her nought from giles headley so long as i have my goldspot that stephen climbed the wall for his very self  and dennet turned majestically away with her birdgoldspot only in the futureperched on her finger while perronel shook her head bodingly  but they were all children still and aldonza was of a nature that was slow to take offence while it was quite true that dennet had been free from jealousy of the jackdaw and only triumphant in stephens prowess and her own starling  the great pleasure of all was a grand staghunt got up for the diversion of the french ambassadors who had come to treat for the espousals of the infant princess mary with the baby dolphyne probably these illustrious personages did not get half the pleasure out of it that the antelope party had  were they not by special management of a yeoman pricker who had recognised in stephen a kindred spirit and had a strong admiration for mistress randall placed where there was the best possible view of hunters horses and hounds lords and ladies king and ambassadors in their gorgeous hunting trim  did not stephen as a true verdurers son interpret every note on the horn and predict just what was going to happen to the edification of all his hearers  and when the final rush took place did not the prentices with their gowns rolled up dart off headlong in pursuit  dennet entertained some hope that stephen would again catch some runaway steed or come to the kings rescue in some way or other but such chances did not happen every day  nay stephen did not even follow up the chase to the death but left giles to do that turning back forsooth because that little jasper thought fit to get tired and out of breath and could not find his way back alone  dennet was quite angry with stephen and turned her back on him when giles came in all glorious at having followed up staunchly all day having seen the fate of the poor stag and having even beheld the king politely hand the knife to monsieur de montmorency to give the first stroke to the quarry  that was the last exploit  there was to be a great tilting match in honour of the betrothal and master alderman headley wanted his apprentices back again and having been satisfied by a laborious letter from dennet sent per carrier that they were in good health despatched orders by the same means that they were to hire horses at the antelope and returnjasper coming back at the same time though his aunt would fain have kept him longer  women on a journey almost always rode double and the arrangement came under debate  perronel well accustomed to horse ass or foot undertook to ride behind the child as she called jasper who as a born londonerknew nothing of horses though both the other prentices did  giles who in right of his name kindred and expectations always held himself a sort of master declared that it was more fitting that stephen should ride before mistiness dennet  and to this none of the party made any objection except that perronel privately observed to him that she should have thought he would have preferred the company of his betrothed  i shall have quite enough of her by and by returned giles then adding she is a good little wench but it is more for her honour that her fathers servant should ride before her  perronel held her tongue and they rode merrily back to london and astonished their several homes by the growth and healthful looks of the young people  even giles was grown though he did not like to be told so and was cherishing the down on his chin  but the most rapid development had been in aldonza or alice as perronel insisted on calling her to suit the ears of her neighbours  the girl was just reaching the borderland of maidenhood which came all the sooner to one of southern birth and extraction when the great change took her from being her fathers childish darling to be perronels companion and assistant  she had lain down on that fatal may eve a child she rose in the little house by the temple gardens a maiden and a very lovely one with delicate refined beautifully cut features of a slightly aquiline cast a bloom on her soft brunette cheek splendid dark liquid eyes shaded by long black lashes under brows as regular and well arched as her eastern cousins could have made them artificially magnificent black hair that could hardly be contained in the close white cap and a lithe beautiful figure on which the plainest dress sat with an eastern grace  perronels neighbours did not admire her  they were not sure whether she were most saracen gipsy or jew  in fact she was as like rachel at the well as her father had been to a patriarch and her descent was of the purest saracen lineage but a christian saracen was an anomaly the london mind could not comprehend and her presence in the family tended to cast suspicion that master randall himself with his gipsy eyes and mysterious comings and goings must have some strange connections  for this however perronel cared little  she had made her own way for many years past and had won respect and affection by many good offices to her neighbours one of whom had taken her laundry work in her absence  aldonza was by no means indocile or incapable  she shared in perronels work without reluctance making good use of her slender dainty brown fingers whether in cooking household work washing ironing plaiting making or mending the stiff lawn collars and cuffs in which her hostesss business lay  there was nothing that she would not do when asked or when she saw that it would save trouble to good mother perronel of whom she was very fond and she seemed serene and contented never wanting to go abroad but she was very silent and perronel declared herself never to have seen any living woman so perfectly satisfied to do nothing  the good dame herself was industrious not only from thrift but from taste and if not busy in her vocation or in household business was either using her distaff or her needle or chatting with her neighboursoften doing both at once but though aldonza could spin sew and embroider admirably and would do so at the least request from her hostess it was always a sort of task and she never seemed so happy as when seated on the floor with her dark eyes dreamily fixed on the narrow window where hung her jackdaws cage and the beads of her rosary passing through her fingers  at first mistress randall thought she was praying but by and by came to the conviction that most of the time the wench was bemused  there was nothing to complain of in one so perfectly gentle and obedient and withal modest and devout but the good woman after having for some time given her the benefit of the supposition that she was grieving for her father began to wonder at such want of activity and animation and to think that on the whole jack was the more talkative companion  aldonza had certainly not taught him the phrases he was so fond of repeating  giles headley had undertaken his education and made it a reason for stealing down to the temple many an evening after work was done declaring that birds never learnt so well as after dark moreover he had possessed himself of a chess board and insisted that aldonza should carry on her instructions in the game he brought her all his holy cross day gain of nuts and he used all his blandishments to persuade mrs randall to come and see the shooting at the popinjay at mile end  all this made the good woman uneasy  her husband was away for the dread of sweating sickness had driven the court from london and she could only take counsel with tibble steelman  it was hallowmas eve and giles had been the bearer of an urgent invitation from dennet to her friend aldonza to come and join the diversions of the evening there was a large number of young folk in the halljasper hope among themmostly contemporaries of dennet and almost children all keen upon the sports of the evening namely a sort of indoor quintain where the revolving beam was decorated with a lighted candle at one end and at the other an apple to be caught at by the players with their mouths their hands being tied behind them  under all the uproarious merriment that each attempt occasioned tibble was about to steal off to his own chamber and his beloved books when as he backed out of the group of spectators he was arrested by mistress randall who had made her way into the rear of the party at the same time  can i have a word with you privily master steelman she asked  unwillingly he muttered yea so please you and they retreated to a window at the dark end of the hall where perronel beganthe aldermans daughter is contracted to young giles her kinsman is she not  not as yet in form but by the will of the parents returned tibble impatiently as he thought of the halfhours reading which he was sacrificing to womans gossip  an it be so returned perronel i would fainwere i master headleythat he spent not so many nights in gazing at mine alice  forbid him the house good dame  easier spoken than done returned perronel  moreover tis better to let the matter such as it is be open in my sight than to teach them to run after one another stealthily whereby worse might ensue  have they spoken then to one another asked tibble beginning to take alarm  i trow not  i deem they know not yet what draweth them together  pish they are mere babes quoth tib hoping he might cast it off his mind  look said perronel and as they stood on the somewhat elevated floor of the bay window they could look over the heads of the other spectators to the seats where the young girls sat  aldonzas beautiful and peculiar contour of head and face rose among the round chubby english faces like a jessamine among daisies and at that moment she was undertaking with an exquisite smile the care of the gown that giles laid at her feet ere making his venture  there said perronel  mark that look on her face  i never see it save for that same youngster  the children are simple and guileless thus far it may be  i dare be sworn that she is but they wot not where they will be led on  you are right dame you know best no doubt said tib in helpless perplexity  i wot nothing of such gear  what would you do  have the maid wedded at once ere any harm come of it returned perronel promptly  she will make a good wifethere will be no complaining of her tongue and she is well instructed in all good housewifery  to whom then would you give her asked tibble  ay thats the question  comely and good she is but she is outlandish and i fear me twould take a handsome portion to get her dark skin and moorish blood oerlooked  nor hath she aught poor maid save yonder gold and pearl earrings and a cross of gold that she says her father bade her never part with  i pledged my word to her father said tibble that i would have a care of her  i have not cared to hoard having none to come after me but if a matter of twenty or fiveandtwenty marks would avail   wherefore not take her yourself said perronel as he stood aghast  she is a maid of sweet obedient conditions trained by a scholar even like yourself  she would make your chamber fair and comfortable and tend you dutifully  whisht good woman  tis too dark to see or you could not speak of wedlock to such as i  think of the poor maid  that is all folly  she would soon know you for a better husband than one of those young featherpates who have no care but of themselves  nay mistress said tibble gravely your advice will not serve here  to bring that fair young wench hither to this very court mind you with a mate loathly to behold as i be and with the lad there ever before her would be verily to give place to the devil  but you are the best swordcutler in london  you could make a living without service  i am bound by too many years of faithful kindness to quit my master or my home at the dragon said tibble  nay that will not serve good friend  then what can be done asked perronel somewhat in despair there are the young sparks at the temple  one or two of them are already beginning to cast eyes at her so that i dare not let her help me carry home my basket far less go alone  tis not the wenchs fault  she shrinks from mens eyes more than any maid i ever saw but if she bide long with me i wot not what may come of it  there be rufflers there who would not stick to carry her off  tibble stood considering and presently said mayhap the dean might aid thee in this matter  he is free of hand and kind of heart and belike he would dower the maid and find an honest man to wed her  perronel thought well of the suggestion and decided that after the mass on all souls day and the general visiting of the graves of kindred she would send aldonza home with dennet whom they were sure to meet in the pardon churchyard since her mother as well as abenali and martin fulford lay there and herself endeavour to see dean colet who was sure to be at home as he was hardly recovered from an attack of the prevalent disorder  then tibble escaped and perronel drew near to the party round the fire where the divination of the burning of nuts was going on but not successfully since no pair hitherto put in would keep together however the next contribution was a snail which had been captured on the wall and was solemnly set to crawl on the hearth by dennet to see whether it would trace a g or an h  however the creature proved sullen or sleepy and no jogging of hands no enticing would induce it to crawl an inch and the alderman taking his daughter on his knee declared that it was a wise beast who knew her hap was fixed  moreover it was time for the rere supper for the servingmen with the lanterns would be coming for the young folk  london entertainments for women or young people had to finish very early unless they had a strong escort to go home with for the streets were far from safe after dark  giless great desire to convoy her home added to perronels determination and on all souls day while knells were ringing from every church in london she roused aldonza from her weeping devotions at her fathers grave and led her to dennet who had just finished her round of prayers at the grave of the mother she had never known under the protection of her nurse and two or three of the servants  the child who had thought little of her mother while her grandmother was alert and supplied the tenderness and care she needed was beginning to yearn after counsel and sympathy and to wonder as she told her beads what might have been had that mother lived  she took aldonzas hand and the two girls threaded their way out of the crowded churchyard together while perronel betook herself to the deanery of st pauls  good colet was always accessible to the meanest but he had been very ill and the porter had some doubts about troubling him respecting the substantial young matron whose trim cap and bodice and full petticoats showed no tokens of distress  however when she begged him to take in her message that she prayed the dean to listen to her touching the child of the old man who was slain on may eve he consented and she was at once admitted to an inner chamber where colet wrapped in a gown lined with lambskin sat by the fire looking so wan and feeble that it went to the good womans heart and she began by an apology for troubling him  heed not that good dame said the dean courteously but sit thee down and let me hear of the poor child  ah reverend sir would that she were still a child and perronel proceeded to tell her difficulties adding that if the dean could of his goodness promise one of the dowries which were yearly given to poor maidens of good character she would inquire among her gossips for some one to marry the girl  she secretly hoped he would take the hint and immediately portion aldonza himself perhaps likewise find the husband  and she was disappointed that he only promised to consider the matter and let her hear from him  she went back and told tibble that his device was nought an old scholar with one foot in the grave knew less of women than even he did  however it was only four days later that as mrs randall was hanging out her collars to dry there came up to her from the temple stairs a figure whom for a moment she hardly knew so different was the long black garb and short gown of the lawyers clerk from the shabby old green suit that all her endeavours had not been able to save from many a stain of printers ink  it was only as he exclaimed good aunt i am fain to see thee here that she answered what thou ambrose  what a fine fellow thou art  truly i knew not thou wast of such good mien  thou thrivest at chelsea  who would not thrive there said ambrose  nay aunt tarry a little i have a message for thee that i would fain give before we go in to aldonza  from his reverence the dean  hath he bethought himself of her  ay that hath he done said ambrose  he is not the man to halt when good may be done  what doth he do since it seems thou hadst speech of him but send for sir thomas more then sitting at westminster to come and see him as soon as the court brake up and i attended my master  they held council together and by and by they sent for me to ask me of what conditions and breeding the maid was and what i knew of her father  will they wed her to thee  that were rarely good so they gave thee some good office cried his aunt  nay nay said ambrose  i have much to learn and understand ere i think of a wifeif ever  nay  but when they had heard all i could tell them they looked at one another and the dean said the maid is no doubt of high blood in her own landscarce a mate for a london butcher or currier  it were matching an arab mare with a costard mongers colt said my master or angelica with ralph roisterdoister  id like to know what were better for the poor outlandish maid than to give her to some honest man put in perronel  the end of it was said ambrose that sir thomas said he was to be at the palace the next day and he would strive to move the queen to take her countrywoman into her service  yea and so he did but though queen katharine was moved by hearing of a fatherless maid of spain and at first spake of taking her to wait on herself yet when she heard the maids name and that she was of moorish blood she would none of her  she said that heresy lurked in them all and though sir thomas offered that the dean or the queens own chaplain should question her on the faith it was all lost labour  i heard him tell the dean as much and thus it is that they bade me come for thee and for the maid take boat and bring you down to chelsea where sir thomas will let her be bred up to wait on his little daughters till he can see what best may be done for her  i trow his spirit was moved by the queens hardness  i heard the dean mutter et venient ab oriente et occidente  perronel hooked alarmed  the queen deemed her heretic in grain ah  she is a good wench and of kind conditions  i would have no ill befall her but i am glad to be rid of her  sir thomashe is a wise man ay and a married man with maidens of his own and he may have more wit in the business than the rest of his kind  be the matter instant  methinks sir thomas would have it so since this being a holy day the courts be not sitting and he is himself at home so that he can present the maid to his lady  and that makes no small odds  yea but what the lady is makes the greater odds to the maid i trow said perronel anxiously  fear not on that score  dame alice more is of kindly conditions and will be good to any whom her lord commends to her and as to the young ladies never saw i any so sweet or so wise as the two elder ones specially mistress margaret  welladay  what must be must philosophically observed perronel now i have my wish i could mourn over it  i am loth to part with the wench and my man when he comes home will make an outcry for his pretty ally but tis best so  come alice girl bestir thyself  heres preferment for thee  aldonza raised her great soft eyes in slow wonder and when she had heard what was to befall her declared that she wanted no advancement and wished only to remain with mother perronel  nay she clung to the kind woman beseeching that she might not be sent away from the only motherly tenderness she had ever known and declaring that she would work all day and all night rather than leave her but the more reluctance she showed the more determined was perronel and she could not but submit to her fate only adding one more entreaty that she might take her jackdaw which was now a spruce greyheaded bird  perronel said it would be presumption in a waitingwoman but ambrose declared that at chelsea there were all manner of beasts and birds beloved by the children and by their father himself and that he believed the daw would be welcome  at any rate if the lady of the house objected to it it could return with mistress randall  perronel hurried the few preparations being afraid that giles might take advantage of the holiday to appear on the scene and presently aldonza was seated in the boat making no more lamentations after she found that her fate was inevitable but sitting silent with downcast head now and then brushing away a stray tear as it stole down under her long eyelashes  meantime ambrose hoping to raise her spirits talked to his aunt of the friendly ease and kindliness of the new home where he was evidently as thoroughly happy as it was in his nature to be  he was much in the position of a barristers clerk superior to that of the mere servants but inferior to the young gentlemen of larger means though not perhaps of better birth who had studied law regularly and aspired to offices or to legal practice  but though ambrose was ranked with the three or four other clerks his functions had more relation to sir thomass literary and diplomatic avocations than his legal ones  from lucas hansen he had learnt dutch and french and he was thus available for copying and translating foreign correspondence  his knowledge of latin and smattering of greek enabled him to be employed in copying into a book some of the inestimable letters of erasmus which arrived from time to time and sir thomas promoted his desire to improve himself and had requested mr clements the tutor of the children of the house to give him weekly lessons in latin and greek  sir thomas had himself pointed out to him books calculated to settle his mind on the truth and catholicity of the church and had warned him against meddling with the fiery controversial tracts which smuggled in often through lucass means had set his mind in commotion  and for the present at least beneath the shadow of the great mans intelligent devotion ambroses restless spirit was tranquil  of course he did not explain his state of mind to his aunt but she gathered enough to be well content and tried to encourage aldonza when at length they landed near chelsea church and ambrose led the way to an extensive pleasaunce or park full of elms and oaks whose yellow leaves were floating like golden rain in the sunshine  presently childrens voices guided them to a large chestnut tree lo you now i hear mistress megs voice and where she is his honour will ever be said ambrose  and sure enough among a group of five girls and one boy all between fourteen and nine years old was the great lawyer knocking down the chestnuts with a long pole while the young ones flew about picking up the burrs from the grass exclaiming joyously when they found a full one  ambrose explained that of the young ladies one was mistress middleton lady mores daughter by a former marriage another a kinswoman  perronel was for passing by unnoticed but ambrose knew better and sir thomas leaning on the pole called out ha my birkenholt a forester born knowst thou any mode of bringing down yonder chestnuts which being the least within reach seem in course the meetest of all  i would i were my brother your honour said ambrose then would i climb the thee  thou shouldst bring him one of these days said sir thomas  but thou hast instead brought in a fair maid  see meg yonder is the poor young girl who lost her father on ill may day  lead her on and make her good cheer while i speak to this good dame  margaret more a slender darkeyed girl of thirteen went forward with a peculiar gentle grace to the stranger saying welcome sweet maid  i hope we shall make thee happy and seeing the mournful countenance she not only took aldonzas hand but kissed her cheek  sir thomas had exchanged a word or two with perronel when there was a cry from the younger children who had detected the wicker cage which perronel was trying to keep in the background  a daw a daw was the cry  ist for us  oh mistress faltered aldonza tis minethere was one who tamed it for me and i promised ever to keep it but if the good knight and lady forbid it we will send it back  nay now john cicely was margaret saying tis her own bird wot ye not our father will let us take nought of them that come to him  yea aldonzais not that thy namei am sure my father will have thee keep it  she led up aldonza making the request for her  sir thomas smiled  keep thy bird  nay that thou shalt  look at him meg is he not in fit livery for a lawyers house  mark his trim legs sable doublet and hose and grey hoodand see he hath the very eye of a councillor seeking for suits as he looketh at the chestnuts john holdeth to him  i warrant he hath a tongue likewise  canst plead for thy dinner bird  i love giles uttered the black beak to the confusion and indignation of perronel  the perverse bird had heard giles often dictate this avowal but had entirely refused to repeat it till stimulated by the new surroundings it had for the first time uttered it  ah thou foolish daw  crow that thou art  had i known thou hadst such a word in thy beak id have wrung thy neck sooner than have brought thee muttered perronel  i had best take thee home without more ado  it was too late however the children were delighted and perfectly willing that aldonza should own the bird so they might hear it speak and thus the introduction was over  aldonza and her daw were conveyed to dame alice more a stout goodtempered woman who had too many dependents about her house to concern herself greatly about the introduction of another  and thus aldonza was installed in the long low twostoried red house which was to be her place of homelike service    chapter xx  cloth of gold on the seamy side          then you lost the view of earthly glory  men might say till this time pomp was single but now married to one above itselfshakespeare  if giles headley murmured at aldonzas removal it was only to perronel and that discreet woman kept it to herself  in the summer of 1519 he was out of his apprenticeship and though dennet was only fifteen it was not uncommon for brides to be even younger  however the autumn of that year was signalised by a fresh outbreak of the sweating sickness apparently a sort of influenza and no festivities could be thought of  the king and queen kept at a safe distance from london and escaped so did the inmates of the pleasant house at chelsea but the cardinal who as lord chancellor could not entirely absent himself from westminster was four times attacked by it and dean colet a far less robust man had it three times and sank at last under it  sir thomas more went to see his beloved old friend and knowing ambroses devotion let the young man be his attendant  nor could those who saw the good man ever forget his peaceful farewells grieving only for the old mother who had lived with him in the deanery and in the ninetieth year of her age thus was bereaved of the last of her twentyone children  for himself he was thankful to be taken away from the evil times he already beheld threatening his beloved st pauls as well as the entire church both in england and abroad looking back with a sad sweet smile to the happy oxford days when he with more and erasmus   strained the watchful eye if chance the golden hours were nigh by youthful hope seen gleaming round her walls   but said he as he laid his hand in blessing for the last time on ambroses head let men say what they will do thou cling fast to the church nor let thyself be swept away  there are sure promises to her and grace is with her to purify herself even though it be obscured for a time  be not of little faith but believe that christ is with us in the ship though he seem to be asleep  he spoke as much to his friend as to the youth and there can be no doubt that this consideration was the restraining force with many who have been stigmatised as halfhearted reformers because though they loved truth they feared to lose unity  he was a great loss at that especial time as a restraining power trusted by the innovators and a personal friend both of king and cardinal and his preaching and catechising were sorely missed at st pauls  tibble steelman though thinking he did not go far enough deplored him deeply but tibble himself was laid by for many days  the epidemic went through the dragon court though some had it lightly and only two young children actually died of it  it laid a heavy hand on tibble and as his distaste for women rendered his den almost inaccessible to bet smallbones who looked after most of the patients stephen birkenholt whose nursing capacities had been developed in newgate spent his spare hours in attending him sat with him in the evenings slept on a pallet by his side carried him his meals and often administered them and finally pulled him through the illness and its effects which left him much broken and never likely to be the same man again  old mistress headley who was already failing did not have the actual disease severely but she never again left her bed and died just after christmas sinking slowly away with little pain and her memory having failed from the first  household affairs had thus shipped so gradually into dennets hands that no change of government was perceptible except that the keys hung at the maidens girdle  she had grown out of the child during this winter of trouble and was here there and everywhere the busy nurse and housewife seldom pausing to laugh or play except with her father and now and then to chat with her old friend and playfellow kit smallbones  her childish freedom of manner had given way to grave discretion not to say primness in her behaviour to her fathers guests and even the apprentices  it was of course the unconscious reaction of the maidenly spirit aware that she had nothing but her own modesty to protect her  she was on a small scale with no pretensions to beauty but with a fresh honest sensible young face a clear skin and dark eyes that could be very merry when she would let them and her whole air and dress were trimness itself with an inclination to the choicest materials permitted to an aldermans daughter  things were going on so smoothly that the alderman was taken by surprise when all the good wives around began to press on him that it was incumbent on him to lose no time in marrying his daughter to her cousin if not before lent yet certainly in the easter holidays  dennet looked very grave thereon  was it not over soon after the loss of the good grandmother  and when her father said as the gossips had told him that she and giles need only walk quietly down some morning to st faiths and plight their troth she broke out into her girlish wilful manner would she be married at all without a merry wedding  no indeed  she would not have the thing done in a corner  what was the use of her being wedded and having to consort with the tedious old wives instead of the merry wrenches could she not guide the house and rule the maids and get in the stores and hinder waste and make the pasties and brew the possets  had her father found the crust hard or missed his roasted crab or had any one blamed her for want of discretion  nay as to that she was like to be more discreet as she was with only her good old father to please than with a husband to plague her  on the other hand giless demeanour was rather that of one prepared for the inevitable than that of an eager bridegroom and when orders began to pour in for accoutrements of unrivalled magnificence for the king and the gentlemen who were to accompany him to ardres there to meet the young king of france just after whitsuntide dennet was the first to assure her father that there would be no time to think of weddings till all this was over especially as some of the establishment would have to be in attendance to repair casualties at the jousts  at this juncture there arrived on business master tiptoff husband to giless sister bringing greetings from mrs headley at salisbury and inquiries whether the wedding was to take place at whitsuntide in which case she would hasten to be present and to take charge of the household for which her dear daughter was far too young  master tiptoff showed a suspicious alacrity in undertaking the forwarding of his motherinlaw and her stuff  the faces of master headley and tib steelman were a sight both having seen only too much of what the housewifery at salisbury had been  the alderman decided on the spot that there could be no marriage till after the journey to france since giles was certainly to go upon it and lest mrs headley should be starting on her journey he said he should despatch a special messenger to stay her giles who had of course been longing for the splendid pageant cheered up into great amiability and volunteered to write to his mother that she had best not think of coming till he sent word to her that matters were forward  even thus master headley was somewhat insecure  he thought the dame quite capable of coming and taking possession of his house in his absence and therefore resolved upon staying at home to garrison it but there was then the further difficulty that tibble was in no condition to take his place on the journey  if the rheumatism seized his right arm as it had done in the winter he would be unable to drive a rivet and there would be every danger of it high summer though it were for though the party would carry their own tent and bedding the knights and gentlemen would be certain to take all the best places and they might be driven into a damp corner  indeed it was not impossible that their tent itself might be seized for many a noble or his attendants might think that beggarly artisans had no right to comforts which he had been too improvident to afford especially if the alderman himself were absent  not only did master headley really love his trusty foreman too well to expose him to such chances but tibble knew too well that there were brutal young men to whom his contortedvisage would be an incitement to contempt and outrage and that if racked with rheumatism he would only be an incumbrance  there was nothing for it but to put kit smallbones at the head of the party  his imposing presence would keep off wanton insults but on the other hand he had not the moral weight of authority possessed by tibble and though far from being a drunkard he was not proof against a carouse especially when out of reach of his bet and of his master and he was not by any means tibs equal in fine and delicate workmanship  but on the other hand tib pronounced that stephen birkenholt was already well skilled in chasing metal and the difficult art of restoring inlaid work and he showed some black and silver armour that was in hand for the king which fully bore out his words  and thou thinkst kit can rule the lads said the alderman scarce willingly  one of them at least can rule himself said tibble  they have both been far more discreet since the fright they got on ill may day and as for stephen he hath seemed to me to have no eyes nor thought save for his work of late  i have marked him said the master and have marvelled what ailed the lad  his merry temper hath left him  i never hear him singing to keep time with his hammer nor keeping the court in a roar with his gibes  i trust he is not running after the new doctrine of the hawkers and pedlars  his brother was inclined that way  there be worse folk than they your worship protested tib but he did not pursue their defence only adding but tis not that which ails young stephen  i would it were he sighed to himself inaudibly  well said the goodnatured alderman it may be he misseth his brother  the boys will care for this rareeshow more than thou or i tib  weve seen enough of them in our day though verily they say this is to surpass all that ever were beheld  the question of who was to go had not been hitherto decided and giles and stephen were both so excited at being chosen that all low spirits and moodiness were dispelled and the work which went on almost all night was merrily got through  the dragon court was in a perpetual commotion with knights squires and grooms coming in with orders for new armour or for old to be furbished and the tentmakers lorimers mercers and tailors had their hands equally full  these lengthening mornings heard the hammer ringing at sunrise and in the final rush smallbones never went to bed at all he said he should make it up in the waggon on the way to dover some hinted that he preferred the clang of his hammer to the good advice his bet lavished on him at every leisure moment to forewarn him against french winepots  the alderman might be content with the party he sent forth for kit had hardly his equal in size strength and good humour  giles had developed into a tall comely young man who had got rid of his country slouch and whose tall figure light locks and ruddy cheeks looked well in the new suit which gratified his love of finery soberhued as it needs must be  stephen was still bound to the old prentice garb though it could not conceal his good mien the bright sparkling dark eyes crisp black hair healthy brown skin and lithe active figure  giles had a stout roadster to ride on the others were to travel in their own waggon furnished with four powerful horses which if possible they were to take to calais so as to be independent of hiring  their needments clothes and tools were packed in the waggon with store of lances and other appliances of the tourney  a carter and will wherry who was selected as being supposed to be conversant with foreign tongues were to attend on them smallbones as senior journeyman had the control of the party and giles had sufficiently learnt subordination not to be likely to give himself dangerous airs of mastership  dennet was astir early to see them off and she had a little gift for each  she began with her oldest friend  see here kit she said heres a wallet to hold thy nails and rivets  what wilt thou say to me for such a piece of stitchery  say pretty mistress  why this quoth the giant and he picked her up by the slim waist in his great hands and kissed her on the forehead  he had done the like many a time nine or ten years ago and though master headley laughed dennet was not one bit embarrassed and turned to the next traveller  thou art no more a prentice giles and canst wear this in thy bonnet she said holding out to him a short silver chain and medal of st george and the dragon  thanks gentle maid said giles taking the handsome gift a little sheepishly  my bonnet will make a fair show and he bent down as she stood on the step and saluted her lips then began eagerly fastening the chain round his cap as one delighted with the ornament  stephen was some distance off  he had turned aside when she spoke to giles and was asking of tibble last instructions about the restoration of enamel when he felt a touch on his arm and saw dennet standing by him  she looked up in his face and held up a crimson silken purse with s b embroidered on it with a wreath of oak and holly leaves  with the air that ever showed his gentle blood stephen put a knee to the ground and kissed the fingers that held it to him whereupon dennet a sudden burning blush overspreading her face under her little pointed hood turned suddenly round and ran into the house she was out again on the steps when the waggon finally got under weigh and as her eyes met stephens he doffed his flat cap with one hand and laid the other on his heart so that she knew where her purse had taken up its abode  of the field of the cloth of gold not much need be said  to the end of the lives of the spectators it was a tale of wonder  indeed without that the very sight of the pavilions was a marvel in itself the blue dome of francis spangled in imitation of the sky with sun moon and stars and the feudal castle of henry a three months work each surrounded with tents of every colour and pattern which fancy could devise with the owners banners or pennons floating from the summits and every creature man and horse within the enchanted precincts equally gorgeous  it was the brightest and the last full display of magnificent pseudo chivalry and to stephens dazzled eye seeing it beneath the slant rays of the setting sun of june it was a fairy tale come to life  hal randall who was in attendance on the cardinal declared that it was a mere surfeit of jewels and gold and silver and that a frieze jerkin or leathern coat was an absolute refreshment to the sight he therefore spent all the time he was off duty in the forge far in the rear where smallbones and his party had very little but hard work mending whetting furbishing and even changing devices those six days of tilting when every man that stood showed like a mine kept the armourers in full occupation night and day and only now and then could the youths try to make their way to some spot whence they could see the tournament  smallbones was more excited by the report of fountains of good red and white wines of all sorts flowing perpetually in the court of king henrys splended mock castle but fortunately one gulp was enough for an english palate nurtured on ale and mead and he was disgusted at the heaps of country folk menatarms beggars and vagabonds of all kinds who swilled the liquor continually and in loathsome contrast to the external splendours lay wallowing on the ground so thickly that it was sometimes hardly possible to move without treading on them  i stumbled over a dozen said the jester as he strolled into the little staked inclosure that the dragon party had arranged round their tent for the prosecution of their labours which were too important to all the champions not to be respected  lance and sword have not laid so many low in the lists as have the doughty baron burgundy and the heady knight messire sherris sack  villain verjuice and varlet vinegar is what kit there calls them said stephen looking up from the work he was carrying on over a pan of glowing charcoal  yea said smallbones intermitting his noisy operations and the more of swine be they that gorge themselves on it  i told jack and hob that twould be shame for english folk to drown themselves like french frogs or flemish hogs  hogs returned randall  a decent hampshire hog would scorn to be lodged as many a knight and squire and lady too is now pigging it in styes and hovels and haylofts by night and pranking it by day with the best  sooth enough said smallbones  yea we have had two knights and their squires beseeching us for leave to sleep under our waggon not an angel had they got among the four of them either having all their years income on their backs and more too  i trow they and their heirs will have good cause to remember this same field of gold  and what best thou doing nevvy asked the jester  thy trade seems as brisk as though red blood were flowing instead of red wine  i am doing my part towards making the king into hercules said stephen though verily the tailor hath more part therein than we have but he must needs have a breastplate of scales of gold and that by tomorrows morn  as ambrose would say if he will be a pagan god he should have whatshisname the smith of the gods to work for him  i heard of that freak said the jester  there be a dozen tailors and all the queens tirewomen frizzling up a good piece of cloth of gold for the lions mane covering a club with green damask with pricks cutting out green velvet and gummed silk for his garland in sooth these graces have left me so far behind in foolery that i have not a jest left in my pouch  so here i be while my lord cardinal is shut up with madame dangouleme in the castlethe real old castle mind youdoing the work leaving the kings and queens to do their own fooling  have you spoken with the french king hal asked smallbones who had become a great crony of his since the anxieties of may eve  so far as i may when i have no french and he no english  he is a comely fellow with a blithe tongue and a merry eye i warrant you a chanticleer who will lose nought for lack of crowing  hell crow louder than ever now he hath given our harry a fall  no hath he and giles stephen and smallbones all suspended their work to listen in concern  ay marry hath he  the two took it into their royal noddles to try a fall and wrestled together on the grass when by some ill hap this same francis tripped up our harry so that he was on the sward for a moment  he was up again forthwith and in full heart for another round when all the frenchmen burst in gabbling and though their king was willing to play the match out fairly they wouldnt let him and my lord cardinal said something about making ill blood whereat our king laughed and was content to leave it  as i told him we have given the french falls enough to let them make much of this one  i hope he will yet give the mounseer a good shaking muttered smallbones  how now will  whos that at the door  we are on his graces work and can touch none other mans were it the king of france himself or his constable who is finer still  by way of expressing no admittance except on business smallbones kept will wherry in charge of the door of his little territory which having a mud wall on two sides and a broad brook with quaking banks on a third had been easily fenced on the fourth so as to protect tent waggon horses and work from the incursions of idlers  will however answered the gentleman saith he hath kindred here  ay and there pushed in past the lad a tall lean form with a gay but soiled short cloak over one shoulder a suit of worn buff a cap garnished with a dilapidated black and yellow feather and a pair of gilt spurs  if this be as they told me where armourer headleys folk lodgei have here a sort of a cousin  yea yonders the brave lad who had no qualms at the flash of a good toledo in a knights fist  how now my nevvy  is not my daughters nevvy mine  save your knighthood said smallbones  who would have looked to see you here sir john  methought you were in the emperors service  a stout manatarms is of all services returned fulford  im here with half flanders to see this mighty show and pick up a few more lusty badgers at this encounter of old comrades  is old headley here  nay he is safe at home where i would i were sighed kit  and you are my young master his nephew who knew where to purvey me of good steel added fulford shaking giless hand  you are fain doubtless you youngsters to be forth without the old man  ha and youve no lack of merry company  harry randalls first impulse had been to look to the right and left for the means of avoiding this encounter but there was no escape and he was moreover in most fantastic motley arrayed in one of the many suits provided for the occasion  it was in imitation of a parrot brilliant grassgreen velvet touched here and there with scarlet yellow or blue  he had been only half disguised on the occasion of fulfords visit to his wife and he perceived the start of recognition in the eyes of the condottiere so that he knew it would be vain to try to conceal his identity  you sought stephen birkenholt he said  and youve lit on something nearer if so be youll acknowledge the paraquito that your perronel hath mated with  the condottiere burst into a roar of laughter so violent that he had to lean against the mud wall and hold his sides  ha ha that i should be fatherinlaw to a fool and then he set off again that the sober dainty little wench should have wedded a fool  ha ha ha  sir cried stephen hotly i would have you to know that mine uncle here master harry randall is a yeoman of good birth and that he undertook his present part to support your own father and child  methinks you are the last who should jeer at and insult him  stephen is right said giles  this is my kinsmans tent and no man shall say a word against master harry randall therein  well crowed my young london gamebirds returned fulford coolly i meant no disrespect to the gentleman in green  nay i am mightily beholden to him for acting his part out and taking on himself that would scarce befit a gentleman of a company impedimenta as we used to say in the grammar school  how does the old mani must find some token to send him  he is beyond the reach of all tokens from you save prayers and masses returned randall gravely  ay  you say not so  old gaffer dead  and when the soldier was told how the feeble thread of life had been snapped by the shock of joy on his coming a fit of compunction and sorrow seized him  he covered his face with his hands and wept with a loudness of grief that surprised and touched his hearers and presently began to bemoan himself that he had hardly a mark in his purse to pay for a mass but therewith he proceeded to erect before him the cross hilt of poor abenalis sword and to vow thereupon that the first spoil and the first ransom that it should please the saints to send him should be entirely spent in masses for the soul of martin fulford this tribute apparently stilled both grief and remorse for looking up at the grotesque figure of randall he said methought they told me master son that you were in the right quarters for beads and masses and all that geara varlet of master butchercardinals or the likebut mayhap twas part of your fooling  not so replied randall  tis to the cardinal that i belong holding out his sleeve where the scarlet hat was neatly worked and ill brook no word against his honour  ho ho  maybe you looked to have the hat on your own head quoth fulford waxing familiar if your master comes to be pope after his own reckoning  why ive known a cardinal get the scarlet because an ape had danced on the roof with him in his arms  you forget  im a wedded man said randall who certainly in private life had much less of the buffoon about him than his fatherinlaw  impedimentum again whistled the knight  put a halter round her neck and sell her for a pot of beer  id rather put a halter round my own neck for good and all said hal his face reddening but among other accomplishments of his position he had learnt to keep his temper however indignant he felt  wellshes a knights daughter and preferments will be plenty thoult make me captain of the popes guard fair sontheres no post i should like better  or i might put up with an italian earldom or the like  honour would befit me quite as well as that old fellow prosper colonna and the badgers would well become the popes scarlet and yellow liveries  the badgers it appeared were in camp not far from gravelines whence the emperor was watching the conference between his unclein law and his chief enemy and thence fulford who had a good many french acquaintance having once served under francis i had come over to see the sport  moreover he contrived to attach himself to the armourers party in a manner that either alderman headley himself or tibble steelman would effectually have prevented but which kit smallbones had not sufficient moral weight to hinder even if he had had a greater dislike to being treated as a boon companion by a knight who had seen the world could appreciate good ale and tell all manner of tales of his experiences  so the odd sort of kindred that the captain chose to claim with stephen birkenholt was allowed and in right of it he was permitted to sleep in the waggon and thereupon his big rawboned charger was found sharing the fodder of the plump broadbacked cart horses while he himself whenever sport was not going forward for him or work for the armourers sat discussing with kit the merits or demerits of the liquors of all nations either in their own yard or in some of the numerous drinking booths that had sprung up around  to no one was this arrangement so distasteful as to quipsome hal who felt himself in some sort the occasion of the intrusion and yet was quite unable to prevent it while everything he said was treated as a joke by his unwelcome fatherinlaw  it was a coarse time and wolseys was not a refined or spiritual establishment but it was decorous and randall had such an affection and respect for the innocence of his sisters young son that he could not bear to have him exposed to the company of one habituated to the licentiousness of the mercenary soldier  at first the jester hoped to remove the lads from the danger for the brief remainder of their stay by making double exertion to obtain places for them at any diversion which might be going on when their days work was ended and of these of course there was a wide choice subordinate to the magnificent masquing of kings and queens  on the last midsummer evening while their majesties were taking leave of one another a company of strolling players were exhibiting in an extemporary theatre and here hal incited both the youths to obtain seats  the drama was on one of the ordinary and frequent topics of that as of all other times and the dumb show and gestures were far more effective than the words so that even those who did not understand the language of the comedians who seemed to be italians could enter into it especially as it was interspersed with very expressive songs  an old baron insists on betrothing his daughter and heiress to her kinsman freshly knighted  she is reluctant weeps and is threatened singing afterwards her despair of course she really was a blackeyed boy  that song was followed by a still more despairing one from the barons squire and a tender interview between them followed  then came discovery the baron descending as a thunderbolt the banishment of the squire the lady driven at last to wed the young knight her weeping and bewailing herself under his illtreatment which extended to pulling her about by the hair the return of the lover notified by a song behind the scenes a dangerously affectionate meeting interrupted by the husband a fierce clashing of swords mutual slaughter by the two gentlemen and the lady dying of grief on the top of her lover  such was the argument of this tragedy which giles headley pronounced to be very dreary pastime indeed he was amusing himself with an exchange of comfits with a youth who sat next him all the timefor he had found stephen utterly deaf to aught but the tragedy following every gesture with eager eyes lips quivering and eyes filling at the strains of the love songs though they were in their native italian of which he understood not a word  he rose up with a heavy groan when all was over as if not yet disenchanted and hardly answered when his uncle spoke to him afterwards  it was to ask whether the dragon party were to return at once to london or to accompany the court to gravelines where it had just been announced the king intended to pay a visit to his nephew the emperor  neither stephen nor giles knew but when they reached their own quarters they found that smallbones had received an intimation that there might be jousts and that the offices of the armourers would be required  he was very busy packing up his tools but loudly hilarious and sir john fulford with a flask of wine beside him was swaggering and shouting orders to the men as though he were the head of the expedition  revelations come in strange ways  perhaps that italian play might be called galeotto to stephen birkenholt  it affected him all the more because he was not distracted by the dialogue but was only powerfully touched by the music and in the gestures of the lovers felt all the force of sympathy  it was to him like a kind of prophetic mirror revealing to him the true meaning of all he had ever felt for dennet headley and of his vexation and impatience at seeing her bestowed upon a dull and indifferent lout like her kinsman who not only was not good enough for her but did not even love her or accept her as anything but his title to the dragon court  he now thrilled and tingled from head to foot with the perceptions that all this meant lovelove to dennet and in every act of the drama he beheld only himself giles and dennet watching at first with a sweet fascination his feelings changed now to strong yearning now to hot wrath and then to horror and dismay  in his troubled sleep after the spectacle he identified himself with the lover sang wooed and struggled in his person woke with a start of relief to find giles snoring safely beside him and the watchdog on his chest instead of an expiring lady  he had not made unholy love to sweet dennet nor imperilled her good name nor slain his comrade  nor was she yet wedded to that oaf giles  but she would be in a few weeks and then  how was he to brook the sight chained as he was to the dragon courtsee giles lord it over her and all of them see her missing the love that was burning for her elsewhere  stephen lost his boyhood on that evening and though force of habit kept him like himself outwardly he never was alone without feeling dazed and torn in every direction at once    chapter xxi  sword or smithy    darest thou be so valiant as to play the coward with thy indenture and to show it a fair pair of heels and run from it  shakespeare  tidings came forth on the parting from the french king that the english court was about to move to gravelines to pay a visit to the emperor and his aunt the duchess of savoy  as it was hoped that jousts might make part of the entertainment the attendance of the dragon party was required  giles was unfeignedly delighted at this extension of holiday stephen felt that it deferred the daywould it be of strange joy or painof standing face to face with dennet and even kit had come to tolerate foreign parts more with sir john fulford to show him the way to the best flemish ale  the knight took upon himself the conduct of the dragons  he understood how to lead them by routes where all provisions and ale had not been consumed and he knew how to swagger and threaten so as to obtain the best of liquor and provisions at each kermesseat least so he said though it might be doubted whether the flemings might not have been more willing to yield up their stores to kits open honest face and free hand  however fulford seemed to consider himself one with the party and he beguiled the way by tales of the doings of the badgers in italy and savoy which were listened to with avidity by the lads distracting stephen from the pain at his heart and filling both with excitement  they were to have the honour of seeing the badgers at gravelines where they were encamped outside the city to serve as a guard to the great inclosure that was being made of canvas stretched on the masts of ships to mark out the space for a great banquet and dance  the weather broke however just as henry his wife and his sister entered gravelines it rained pertinaciously a tempestuous wind blew down the erection and as there was no time to set it up again the sports necessarily took place in the castle and town hall there was no occasion for the exercise of the armourers craft and as charles had forbidden the concourse of all save invited guests everything was comparatively quiet and dull though the entertainment was on the most liberal scale  lodgings were provided in the city at the emperors expense and wherever an englishman was quartered each night the imperial officers brought a cast of fine manchet bread two great silver pots with wine a pound of sugar white and yellow candles and a torch  as randall said charles gave solid pudding where francis gave empty praise  smallbones and the two youths had very little to do save to consume these provisions and accept the hospitality freely offered to them at the camp of the badgers where smallbones and the ancient of the troop sat fraternising over big flagons of flemish ale which did not visibly intoxicate the honest smith but kept him in the dull and drowsy state which was his idea of the dolce far niente of a holiday  meanwhile the two youths were made much of by the warriors stephens dexterity with the bow and backsword were shown off and lauded giless strength was praised and all manner of new feats were taught them all manner of stories told them and the shrinking of welltrained young citizens from these lawless me full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard and some very truculentlooking had given way to judicious flattery and to the attractions of adventure and of a free life where wealth and honour awaited the bold  stephen was told that the gentleman in him was visible that he ought to disdain the flat cap and blue gown that here was his opportunity and that among the badgers he would soon be so rich famous glorious as to wonder that he had ever tolerated the greasy mechanical life of a base burgher  respect to his oaths to his mastersir john laughed the scruple to scorn nay if he were so tender he could buy his absolution the first time he had his pouch full of gold  what shall i do was the cry of stephens heart  my honour and my oath  they bind me  she would weep  my master would deem me ungrateful ambrose break his heart  and yet who knows but i should do worse if i stayed i shall break my own heart if i do  i shall not seei may forget  no no never but at least i shall never know the moment when the lubber takes the jewel he knows not how to prize  marchessiegesthere shall i quell this wild beating  i may die there  at least they will allay this present frenzy of my blood  and he listened when fulford and will marden a young english man atarms with whom he had made friends concerted how he should meet them at an innthe sign of the seven starsin gravelines and there exchange his prentices garb for the buff coat and corslet of a badger with the austrian black and yellow scarf  he listened but he had not promised  the sense of duty to his master the honour to his word always recurred like first thoughts though the longing to escape the restlessness of hopeless love the youthful eagerness for adventure and freedom swept it aside again and again  he had not seen his uncle since the evening of the comedy for hal had travelled in the cardinals suite and the amusements being all within doors jesters were much in request as indeed charles v was curious in fools and generally had at least three in attendance stephen moreover always shrank from his uncle when acting professionally  he had learnt to love and esteem the man during his troubles but this only rendered the sight of his buffoonery more distressing and as randall had not provided himself with his home suit they were the more cut off from one another  thus there was all the less to counteract or show the fallacy of fulfords recruiting blandishments  the day had come on the evening of which stephen was to meet fulford and marden at the seven stars and give them his final answer in time to allow of their smuggling him out of the city and sending him away into the country since smallbones would certainly suspect him to be in the camp and as he was still an apprentice it was possible though not probable that the town magistrates might be incited to make search on inquiry as they were very jealous of the luring away of their apprentices by the free companies and moreover his uncle might move the cardinal and the king to cause measures to be taken for his recovery  ill at ease stephen wandered away from the hostel where smallbones was entertaining his friend the ancient  he had not gone far down the street when a familiar figure met his eye no other than that of lucas hansen his brothers old master walking along with a pack on his back  grown as stephen was the old mans recognition was as rapid as his own and there was a clasp of the hand an exchange of greeting while lucas eagerly asked after his dear pupil ambrose  come in hither and we can speak more at ease said lucas leading the way up the common staircase of a tall house whose upper stories overhung the street  up and up lucas led the way to a room in the high peaked roof looking out at the back  here stephen recognised a press but it was not at work only a young friar was sitting there engaged in sewing up sheets so as to form a pamphlet  lucas spoke to him in flemish to explain his own return with the english prentice  dost thou dwell here sir asked stephen  i thought rotterdam was thine home  yea said lucas so it be but i am sojourning here to aid in bearing about the seed of the gospel for which i walk through these lands of ours  but tell me of thy brother and of the little moorish maiden  stephen replied with an account of both ambrose and aldonza and likewise of tibble steelman explaining how ill the last had been in the winter and that therefore he could not be with the party  i would i had a token to send him said lucas but i have nought here that is not either in the dutch or the french and neither of those tongues doth he understand  but thy brother the good ambrose can read the dutch  wilt thou carry him from me this fresh tractate showing how many there be that make light of the apostle pauls words not to do evil that good may come  stephen had been hearing rather listlessly thinking how little the good man suspected how doubtful it was that he should bear messages to ambrose  now on that sore spot in his conscience that sentence darted like an arrow the shaft finding mark the archer little meant and with a start not lost on lucas he exclaimed saith the holy saint paul that  assuredly my son  brother cornelis who is one whose eyes have been opened can show you the very words if thou hast any latin  perhaps to gain time stephen assented and the young friar with a somewhat inquisitive look presently brought him the sentence et non faciamus mala ut veniant bona  stephens latin was not very fresh and he hardly comprehended the words but he stood gazing with a frown of distress on his brow which made lucas say my son thou art sorely bestead  is there aught in which a plain old man can help thee for thy brothers sake  speak freely  brother cornelis knows not a word of english dost thou owe aught to any man  nay naynot that said stephen drawn in his trouble and perplexity to open his heart to this incongruous confidant but sir sir which be the worst to break my pledge to my master or to run into a trial whichwhich will last from day to day and may be too much for meyea and for anotherat last  the colour the trembling of limb the passion of voice revealed enough to lucas to make him say in the voice of one who dried up as he was had once proved the trial tis love thou wouldst say  ay sir said stephen turning away but in another moment bursting forth i love my masters daughter and she is to wed her cousin who takes her as her fathers chattel  i wist not why the world had grown dark to me till i saw a comedy at ardres where as in a mirror twas all set forthyea and how love was too strong for him and for her and how shame and death came thereof  those players are good for nought but to wake the passions muttered lucas  nay methought they warned me said stephen  for sirhe hid his burning face in his hands as he leant on the back of a chairi wot that she has ever liked me better far better than him  and scarce a night have i closed an eye without dreaming it all and finding myself bringing evil on her till i deemed twere better i never saw her more and left her to think of me as a forsworn runagate rather than see her wedded only to be floutedand maybe do worse  poor lad said lucas and what wouldst thou do  i have not pledged myselfbut i said i would consider ofservice among fulfords troop faltered stephen  among those ruffiansgodless lawless men exclaimed lucas  yea i know what you would say returned stephen but they are brave men better than you deem sir  were they angels or saints said lucas rallying his forces thou hast no right to join them  thine oath fetters thee  thou hast no right to break it and do a sure and certain evil to avoid one that may never befall  how knowst thou how it may be  nay if the trial seem to thee over great thine apprenticeship will soon be at an end  not for two years  or thy master if thou spakest the whole truth would transfer thine indentures  he is a good man and if it be as thou sayest would not see his child tried too sorely  god will make a way for the tempted to escape  they need not take the devils way  sir said stephen lifting up his head i thank you  thus was what i needed  i will tell sir john fulford that i ought never to have heeded him  must thou see him again  i must  i am to give him his answer at the seven stars  but fear not me master lucas he shall not lead me away  and stephen took a grateful leave of the little dutchman and charged himself with more messages for ambrose and tibble than his overburdened spirit was likely to retain  lucas went down the stairs with him and as a sudden thought said at the foot of them tis at the seven stars thou meetest this knight  take an old mans counsel  taste no liquor there  i am no ale bibber said stephen  nay i deemed thee nonebut heed my wordscaptains of landsknechts in kermesses are scarce to be trusted  taste not  stephen gave a sort of laugh at the precaution and shook himself loose  it was still an hour to the time of meeting and the ave bell was ringing  a church door stood open and for the first time since he had been at gravelines he felt that there would be the calm he needed to adjust the conflict of his spirits and comprehend the new situation or rather the recurrence to the old one  he seemed to have recovered his former self and to be able to perceive that things might go on as before and his heart really leapt at finding he might return to the sight of dennet and ambrose and all he loved  his wishes were really that way and fulfords allurements had become very shadowy when he made his way to the seven stars whose vinecovered window allowed many loud voices and fumes of beer and wine to escape into the summer evening air  the room was perhaps cleaner than an english one would have been but it was reeking with heat and odours and the forestbred youth was unwilling to enter but fulford and two or three badgers greeted him noisily and called on him to partake of the supper they had ready prepared  no sir knight i thank you said stephen  i am bound for my quarters i came but to thank you for your goodness to me and to bid you farewell  and how as to thy pledge to join us young man demanded fulford sternly  i gave no pledge said stephen  i said i would consider of it  fainthearted ha ha and the english badgers translated the word to the germans and set them shouting with derision  i am not fainthearted said stephen but i will not break mine oath to my master  and thine oath to me  ha said fulford  i sware you no oath i gave you no word said stephen  ha  thou darest give me the lie base prentice  take that  and therewith he struck stephen a crushing blow on the head which felled him to the ground  the host and all the company used to pothouse quarrels and perhaps playing into his hands took little heed stephen was dragged insensible into another room and there the badgers began hastily to divest him of his prentices gown and draw his arms into a buff coat  fulford had really been struck with his bravery and knew besides that his skill in the armourers craft would be valuable so that it had been determined beforehand that he shouldby fair means or foulleave the seven stars a badger  by all the powers of hell you have struck too hard sir  he is sped said marden anxiously  ass tut said fulford  only enough to daze him till he be safe in our quartersand for that the sooner the better  here call anton to take his heels  well get him forth now as a fellow of our own  hark  whats that  gentlemen said the host hurrying in here be some of the gentlemen of the english cardinal calling for a nephew of one of them who they say is in this house  with an imprecation fulford denied all connection with gentlemen of the cardinal but there was evidently an invasion and in another moment several powerfullooking men in the crimson and black velvet of wolseys train had forced their way into the chamber and the foremost seeing stephens condition at a glance exclaimed loudly thou villain traitor kidnapper  this is thy work  ha ha shouted fulford whom have we here  the cardinals fool a masquing  treat us to a caper quipsome sir  im more like to treat you to the gyves returned randall  away with you  the watch are at hand  were it not for my wifes sake they should bear you off to the city jail the emperor should know how you fill your ranks  it was quite true  the city guard were entering at the street door and the host hurried fulford and his men swearing and raging out at a back door provided for such emergencies  stephen was beginning to recover by this time  his uncle knelt down took his head on his shoulder and lucas washed off the blood and administered a drop of wine  his first words were  was it giles  where is she  still going over the play thought lucas  nay nay lad  twas one of the soldiers who played thee this scurvy trick  alls well now  thou wilt soon be able to quit this place  i remember now said stephen sir john said i gave him the lie when i said i had given no pledge  but i had not  thou hast been a brave fellow and better broken head than broken troth said his uncle  but how came you here asked stephen  in the nick of time  it was explained that lucas not doubting stephens resolution but quite aware of the tricks of landsknecht captains with promising recruits in view had gone first in search of smallbones but had found him and the ancient so deeply engaged in potations from the liberal supply of the emperor to all english guests that there was no getting him apart and he was too much muddled to comprehend if he could have been spoken with  lucas then in desperation betook himself to the convent where wolsey was magnificently lodged  ill may day had made him as well as others well acquainted with the relationship between stephen and randall though he was not aware of the further connection with fulford  he hoped even if unable to see randall to obtain help on behalf of an english lad in danger and happily he arrived at a moment when state affairs were going on and randall was refreshing himself by a stroll in the cloister  when lucas had made him understand the situation his dismay was only equalled by his promptitude  he easily obtained the loan of one of the splendid suits of scarlet and crimson guarded with black velvet a hand broad which were worn by the cardinals secular attendantsfor he was well known by this time in the household to be very far from an absolute fool and indeed had done many a good turn to his comrades several of the gentlemen indignant at the threatened outrage on a young englishman and esteeming the craftsmen of the dragon volunteered to accompany him and others warned the watch  there was some difficulty still for the burgher guards coming up puffing and blowing wanted to carry off the victim and keep him in ward to give evidence against the mercenaries whom they regarded as a sort of wolves so that even the emperor never durst quarter them within one of the cities  the drawn swords of randalls friends however settled that matter and stephen though still dizzy was able to walk  thus leaning on his uncle he was escorted back to the hostel  the villain the jester said on the way i mistrusted him but i never thought he would have abused our kindred in this fashion  i would fain have come down to look after thee nevvy but these kings and queens are troublesome folk  the emperorhe is a pale shame faced solemn lad  maybe he museth but he had scarce a word to say for himself  our hal tried clapping on the shoulder calling him fair coz and the like in his hearty fashion  behold what doth he but turn round with such a look about the long lip of him as my lord of buckingham might have if his scullion made free with him  his aunt the duchess of savoy is a merry dame and a wise  she and our king can talk by the ell but as for the emperor he speaketh to none willingly save queen katharine who is of his own stiff spanish humour and he hath eyes for none save queen mary who would have been his empress had high folk held to their word  and with so tonguetied a host and the rain without what had the poor things to do by way of disporting themselves with but a show of fools ive had to go through every trick and quip i learnt when i was with old nat fireeater  and im stiffer in the joints and weightier in the heft than i was in those days when i slept in the fields and fasted more than ever holy church meant  but heigh ho  i ought to be supple enough after the practice of these three days  moreover if it could loose a fools tongue to have a king and queen for interpreters i had themfor there were our harry and moll catching at every gibe as fast as my brain could hatch it and rendering it into french as best thy might carping and quibbling the while underhand at one anothers renderings and the emperor sitting by in his black velvet smiling about as much as a felon at the hangmans jests  all his poor fools moreover and the kings own ready to gnaw their baubles for envy  that was the only sport i had  im wearier than if id been plying smallbones biggest hammer  the worst of it is that my lord cardinal is to stay behind and go on to bruges as ambassador and i with him so thou must bear my greetings to thy naunt and tell her im keeping from picking up a word of french or flemish lest this same charles should take a fancy to me and ask me of my master who would give away his own head to get the popes fools cap  wer da  qui va la asked a voice and the summer twilight revealed two figures with cloaks held high and drooping spanish hats one of whom a slender youthful figure so far as could be seen under his cloak made inquiries first in flemish then in french as to what ailed the youth  lucas replied in the former tongue and one of the englishmen could speak french  the gentleman seemed much concerned asked if the watch had been at hand and desired lucas to assure the young englishman that the emperor would be much distressed at the tidings asked where he was lodged and passed on  ah ha muttered the jester if my ears deceive me now ill never trust them again  mynheer charles knows a few more tricks than he is fain to show off in royal company  come on stevie  ill see thee to thy bed  old kit is too far gone to ask after thee  in sooth i trow that my sweet fatherinlaw set his ancient to nail him to the wine pot  and master giles i saw last with some of the grooms  i said nought to him for i trow thou wouldst not have him know thy plight  ill be with thee in the morning ere thou partest if kings queens and cardinals roar themselves hoarse for the quipsome  with this promise hal randall bestowed his still dulled and half stunned nephew carefully on the pallet provided by the care of the purveyors  stephen slept dreamily at first then soundly and woke at the sound of the bells of gravelines to the sense that a great crisis in his life was over a strange wild dream of evil dispelled and that he was to go home to see hear and act as he could with a heartache indeed but with the resolve to do his best as a true and honest man  smallbones was already afootfor the start for calais was to be made on that very day  the smith was fully himself again and was bawling for his subordinates who had followed his example in indulging in the good cheer and did not carry it off so easily giles rather silent and surly was out of bed shouting answers to smallbones and calling on stephen to truss his points  he was in a mood not easy to understand he would hardly speak and never noticed the marks of the fray on stephens templeonly half hidden by the dark curly hair  this was of course a relief but stephen could not help suspecting that he had been last night engaged in some revel about which he desired no inquiries  randall came just as the operation was completed  he was in a good deal of haste having to restore the grooms dress he wore by the time the owner had finished the morning toilet of the lord cardinals palfreys  he could not wait to inquire how stephen had contrived to fall into the hands of fulford his chief business being to put under safe charge a bag of coins the largesse from the various princes and nobles whom he had divertedducats crowns dollars and angels all jingling togetherto be bestowed wherever perronel kept her store a matter which hal was content not to know though the pair cherished a hope some day to retire on it from fooling  thou art a good lad steve said hal  im right glad thou leavest this father of mine behind thee  i would not see thee such as heno not for all the gold we saw on the frenchmens backs  this was the jesters farewell but it was some time before the waggon was under way for the carter and one of the smiths were missing and were only at noon found in an alehouse both very far gone in liquor and one with a black eye  kit discoursed on sobriety in the most edifying manner as at last he drove heavily along the street almost the last in the baggage train of the king and queensbut still in time to be so included in it so as to save all difficulty at the gates  it was however very late in the evening when they reached calais so that darkness was coming on as they waited their turn at the drawbridge with a cart full of scullions and pots and pans before them and a waggonload of tents behind  the warders in charge of the gateway had orders to count over all whom they admitted so that no unauthorised person might enter that muchvalued fortress  when at length the waggon rolled forward into the shadow of the great towered gateway on the outer side of the moat the demand was made who was there  giles had always insisted as leader of the party on making reply to such questions and smallbones waited for his answer but none was forthcoming  therefore kit shouted in reply alderman headleys wain and armourers  two journeymen one prentice two smiths two waggoners  seven rejoined the warder  onetwothreefourfive  ha your company seems to be lacking  giles must have ridden on suggested stephen while kit growling angrily called on the lazy fellow will wherry to wake and show himself  but the officials were greatly hurried and as long as no dangerous person got into calais it mattered little to them who might be left outside so they hurried on the waggon into the narrow street  it was well that it was a summer night for lodgings there were none  every hostel was full and all the houses besides  the earlier comers assured kit that it was of no use to try to go on the streets up to the wharf were choked and he might think himself lucky to have his waggon to sleep in  but the horses  and food however there was one comfortenglish tongues answered if it was only with denials  kits store of travelling money was at a low ebb and it was nearly exhausted by the time at an exorbitant price he had managed to get a little hay and water for the horses and a couple of loaves and a haunch of bacon among the five hungry men  they were quite content to believe that master giles had ridden on before and secured better quarters and viands nor could they much regret the absence of will wherrys wide mouth  kit called stephen to council in the morning  his funds would not permit waiting for the missing ones if he were to bring home any reasonable proportion of gain to his master  he believed that master headley would by no means risk the whole party loitering at calais when it was highly probable that giles might have joined some of the other travellers and embarked by himself  after all kits store had to be wellnigh expended before the horses waggon and all could find means to encounter the miseries of the transit to dover  then glad as he was to be on his native soil his spirits sank lower and lower as the waggon creaked on under the hot sun towards london  he had actually brought home only four marks to make over to his master and although he could show a considerable score against the king and various nobles these debts were not apt to be promptly discharged and what was worse two members of his party and one horse were missing  he little knew how narrow an escape he had had of losing a third    chapter xxii  an invasion    what shall be the maidens fate who shall be the maidens mate  scott  no giles headley appeared to greet the travellers though kit smallbones had halted at canterbury to pour out entreaties to st thomas and the vow of a steel and gilt reliquary of his best workmanship to contain the old shoe which a few years previously had so much disgusted erasmus and his companion  poor old fellow he was too much crestfallen thoroughly to enjoy even the gladness of his little children and his wife made no secret of her previous conviction that he was too dunderheaded not to run into some coil when she was not there to look after him the alderman was more merciful  since there had been no invasion from salisbury he had regretted the not having gone himself to ardres and he knew pretty well that kits power lay more in his arms than in his brain  he did not wonder at the small gain nor at the having lost sight of the young man and confidently expected the lost ones soon to appear  as to dennet her eyes shone quietly and she took upon herself to send down to let mistress randall know of her nephews return and invite her to supper to hear the story of his doings  the girl did not look at all like a maiden uneasy about her lost lover but much more like one enjoying for the moment the immunity from a kind of burthen and as she smiled called for stephens help in her little arrangements and treated him in the friendly manner of old times he could not but wonder at the panic that had overpowered him for a time like a fever of the mind  there was plenty to speak of in the glories of the field of the cloth of gold and the transactions with the knights and nobles and stephen held his peace as to his adventure but dennets eyes were sharper than kits  she spied the remains of the bruise under his black curly hair and while her father and tib were unravelling the accounts from kits brain and tallysticks she got the youth out into the gallery and observed so thou hast a broken head  see here are grandmothers lilyleaves in strong waters  let me lay one on for thee  there sit down on the step then i can reach  tis well nigh whole now sweet mistress said stephen complying however for it was too sweet to have those little fingers busy about him for the offer to be declined  how gatst thou the blow asked dennet  was it at singlestick come thou mayst tell me  twas in standing up for some one  nay mistress i would it had been  thou hast been in trouble she said leaning on the baluster above him  or did ill men set on thee  thats the nearest guess said stephen  twas that tall father of mine aunts the fellow that came here for armour and bought poor master michaels sword  and sliced the apple on thine hand  ay  he would have me for one of his badgers  thee  stephen  it was a cry of pain as well as horror  yea mistress and when i refused the fellow dealt me a blow and laid me down senseless to bear me off willy nilly but that good old lucas hansen brought mine uncle to mine aid  dennet clasped her hands  o stephen stephen  now i know how good the lord is  wot ye i asked of tibble to take me daily to st faiths to crave of good st julian to have you all in his keeping and saith he on the way methinks mistress our dear lord would hear you if you spake to him direct with no gobetween  i did as he bade me stephen i went to the high altar and prayed there and tibble went with me and lo now he hath brought you back safe  we will have a mass of thanksgiving on the very morn  stephens heart could not but bound for it was plain enough for whom the chief force of these prayers had been offered  sweet mistress he said they have availed me indeed  certes they warded me in the time of sore trial and temptation  nay said dennet thou couldst not have longed to go away from hence with those ill men who live by slaying and plundering  the present temptation was to say that he had doubted whether this course would not have been for the best both for himself and for her but he recollected that giles might be at the gate and if so he should feel as if he had rather have bitten out his tongue than have let dennet know the state of the case so he only answered   there be sorer temptations in the world for us poor rogues than little homebiding house crickets like thee wot of mistress  well that ye can pray for us without knowing all  stephen had never consciously come so near lovemaking and his honest face was all one burning glow with the suppressed feeling while dennet lingered till the curfew warned them of the lateness of the hour both with a strange sense of undefined pleasure in the being together in the summer twilight  day after day passed on with no news of giles or will wherry  the alderman grew uneasy and sent stephen to ask his brother to write to randall or to some one else in wolseys suite to make inquiries at bruges  but ambrose was found to have gone abroad in the train of sir thomas more and nothing was heard till their return six weeks later when ambrose brought home a small packet which had been conveyed to him through one of the emperors suite  it was tied up with a long tough pale wisp of hair evidently from the mane or tail of some flemish horse and was addressed to master ambrose birkenholt menial clerk to the most worshipful sir thomas more knight under sheriff of the city of london  these greeting  within when ambrose could open the missive was another small parcel and a piece of brown coarse paper on which was scrawled   good ambrose birkenholti pray thee to stand my friend and let all know whom it may concern that when this same billet comes to hand i shall be far on the march to high germany with a company of lusty fellows in the emperors service  they be commanded by the good knight sir john fulford  if thou canst send tidings to my mother bid her keep her heart up for i shall come back a captain full of wealth and honour and that will be better than hammering for lifeor being wedded against mine own will  there never was troth plight between my masters daughter and me and my time is over so i be quit with them and i thank my master for his goodness  they shall all hear of me some of these days  will wherry is my groom and commends him to his mother  and so commending thee and all the rest to our lady and the saints  thine to command  giles headley  manatarms in the honourable company of sir john fulford knight   on a separate strip was written    give this packet to the little moorish maid and tell her that i will bring her better by and by and mayhap make her a knights lady but on thy life say nought to any other   it was out now  ambroses head was more in sir thomass books than in real life at all times or he would long ago have inferred somethingfrom the jackdaws favourite phrasefrom giless modes of haunting his steps and making him the bearer of small tokensan orange a simnel cake a bag of walnuts or almonds to mistress aldonza and of the smiles blushes and thanks with which she greeted them  nay had she not burst into tears and entreated to be spared when lady more wanted to make a match between her and the big porter and had not her distress led mistress margaret to appeal to her father who had said he should as soon think of wedding the silverfooted thetis to polyphemus  tilley valley  master more the lady had answered will all your fine pagan gods hinder the wench from starving on earth and leading apes in hell  margaret had answered that aldonza should never do the first and sir thomas had gravely said that he thought those black eyes would lead many a man on earth before they came to the latter fate  ambrose hid the parcel for her deep in his bosom before he asked permission of his master to go to the dragon court with the rest of the tidings  he always was an unmannerly cub said master headley as he read the letter  well ive done my best to make a silk purse of a sows ear  ive done my duty by poor roberts son and if he will be such a fool as to run after blood and wounds i have no more to say  though tis pity of the old name  ha whats this  wedded against my willno troth plight  forsooth i thought my young master was mighty slack  he hath some other matter in his mind hath he  run into some coil mayhap with a beggar wench  well we need not be beholden to him  ha dennet my maid  dennet screwed up her little mouth and looked very demure but she twinkled her bright eyes and said my heart will not break sir i am in no haste to be wed  her father pinched her cheek and said she was a silly wench but perhaps he marked the dancing step with which the young mistress went about her household cares and how she was singing to herself songs that certainly were not willow willow  ambrose had no scruple in delivering to aldonza the message and token when he overtook her on the stairs of the house at chelsea carrying up a lapful of roses to the stillroom where dame alice more was rejoicing in setting her stepdaughters to housewifely tasks  there came a wonderful illumination and agitation over the girls usually impassive features giving all that they needed to make them surpassingly beautiful  woe is me was however her first exclamation  that he should have given up all for me  oh if i had thought it  but while she spoke as if she were shocked and appalled her eyes belied her words  they shone with the first absolute certainty of love and there was no realising as yet the years of silent waiting and anxiety that must go by nay perhaps an entire lifetime of uncertainty of her lovers truth or untruth life or death  dame alice called her and in a rambling maundering way charged her with loitering and gadding with the young men and margaret saw by her colour and by her eyes that some strange thing had happened to her  margaret had perhaps some intuition for was not her heart very tender towards a certain young barrister by name roper whom her father doubted as yet because of his lutheran inclinations  by and by she discovered that she needed aldonza to comb out her long dark hair and ere long she had heard all the tale of the youth cured by the girls father and all his gifts and how aldonza deemed him too great and too good for her poor giles though she knew she should never do more than look up to him with love and gratitude from afar  and she never so much as dreamt that he would cast an eye on her save in kindness  oh yes she knew what he had taught the daw to say but then she was a child she durst not deem it more  and margaret more was more kind and eager than worldly wise and she encouraged aldonza to watch and wait promised protection from all enforced suits and suitors and gave assurances of shelter as her own attendant as long as the girl should need it  master headley with some sighing and groaning applied himself to write to the mother at salisbury what had become of her son but he had only spent one evening over the trying task when just as the supper bell was ringing with master hope and his wife as guests there were horses feet in the court and master tiptoff appeared with a servant on another horse which carried besides a figure in camlet on a pillion  no sooner was this same figure lifted from her steed and set down on the steps while the master of the house and his daughter came out to greet her than she began master alderman headley i am here to know what you have done with my poor son  alack good cousin  alack me no alacks she interrupted holding up her riding rod ill have no dissembling there hath been enough of that giles headley  thou hast sold him soul and body to one of yon cruel bloodthirsty plundering burning captains that the poor child may be slain and murthered  is this the fair promises you made to his fatherwiling him away from his poor mother a widow with talking of teaching him the craft and giving him your daughter  my son tiptoff here told me the spousal was delayed and delayed and he doubted whether it would ever come off but i thought not of this sending him beyond seas to make merchandise of him  and you call yourself an alderman  the gown should be stript off the back of you and shall be if there be any justice in london for a widow woman  nay cousin you have heard some strange tale said master headley who much as he would have dreaded the attack beforehand faced it the more calmly and manfully because the accusation was so outrageous  ay so i told her began her soninlaw but she hath been neither to have nor to hold since the  and how should i be to have or to hold by a nincompoop like thee she said turning round on him that would have me sit down and be content forsooth when mine only son is kidnapped to be sold to the turks or to work in the galleys for aught i know  mistress here master hopes voice came in i would counsel you to speak less loud and hear before you accuse  we of the city of london know master alderman headley too well to hear him railed against  ah youre all of a piece she began but by this time master tiptoff had managed at least to get her into the hall and had exchanged words enough with the alderman to assure himself that there was an explanation nay that there was a letter from giles himself  this the indignant mother presently was made to understandand as the alderman had borrowed the letter in order to copy it for her it was given to her  she could not read and would trust no one but her soninlaw to read it to her  yea you have it very pat she said but how am i to be assured tis not all writ here to hoodwink a poor woman like me  tis giless hand averred tiptoff  and if you will added the alderman with wonderful patience to morrow you may speak with the youth who received it  come sit down and sup with us and then you shall learn from smallbones how this mischance befel all from my sending two young heads together and one who though a good fellow could not hold all in rule  ayyouve your reasons for anything she muttered but being both weary and hungry she consented to eat and drink while tiptoff who was evidently ashamed of her violence and anxious to excuse it managed to explain that a report had been picked up at romsey by a barefooted friar from salisbury that young giles headley had been seen at ghent by one of the servants of a wool merchant riding with a troop of free companions in the emperors service  all the rest was deduced from this intelligence by the dames own imagination  after supper she was invited to interrogate kit and stephen and her grief and anxiety found vent in fierce scolding at the misrule which had permitted such a villain as fulford to be haunting and tempting poor fatherless lads  master headley had reproached poor kit for the same thing but he could only represent that giles being a freeman was no longer under his authority  however she stormed on being absolutely convinced that her sons evasion was every ones fault but his own  now it was the alderman for misusing him overtasking the poor child and deferring the marriage now it was that little pert poppet dennet who had flouted him now it was the bad company he had been led intothe poor babe who had been bred to godly ways  the alderman was really sorry for her and felt himself to blame so far as that he had shifted the guidance of the expedition to such an insufficient head as poor smallbones so he let her rail on as much as she would till the storm exhausted itself and she settled into the trust that giles would soon grow weary and return  the good man felt bound to show her all hospitality and the civilities to country cousins were in proportion to the rarity of their visits so mrs headley stayed on after tiptoffs return to salisbury and had the best view feasible of all the pageants and diversions of autumn  she saw some magnificent processions of clergy she was welcomed at a civic banquet and drank of the loving cup and she beheld the lord mayors show in all its picturesque glory of emblazoned barges on the river  in fact she found the position of denizen of an aldermans household so very agreeable that she did her best to make it a permanency  nay dennet soon found that she considered herself to be waiting there and keeping guard till her sons return should establish her there and that she viewed the girl already as a daughterfor which dennet was by no means obliged to her  she lavished counsel on her hostess found fault with the maidens criticised the cookery walked into the kitchen and still room with assistance and directions and even made a strong effort to possess herself of the keys  it must be confessed that dennet was saucy  it was her weapon of selfdefence and she considered herself insulted in her own house  there she stood exalted on a tall pair of pattens before the stout oaken table in the kitchen where a glowing fire burned pewter red and yellow earthenware and clean scrubbed trenchers made a goodly show a couple of mencooks and twice as many scullions obeyed her behestsonly the superior of the two first ever daring to argue a point with her  there she stood in her white apron with sleeves turned up daintily compounding her mincemeat for christmas when in stalked mrs headley to offer her counsel and aidbut this was lost in a volley of barking from the longbacked bandylegged turnspit dog which was awaiting its turn at the wheel and which ran forward yapping with malign intentions towards the dames scarlet hosed ankles  she shook her petticoats at him but dennet tittered even while declaring that tray hurt nobody  mrs headley reviled the dog and then proceeded to advise dennet that she should chop her citron finer  dennet made answer that father liked a good stout piece of it  mistress headley offered to take the chopper and instruct her how to compound all in the true sarum style  grammercy mistress but we follow my granddames recipe said dennet grasping her implement firmly  come child be not above taking a lesson from thine elders wheres the goose  what as the girl looked amazed where hast thou lived not to know that a live goose should be bled into the mincemeat  i have never lived with barbarous savage folk said dennetand therewith she burst into an irrepressible fit of laughter trying in vain to check it for a small and mischievous elf freshly promoted to the office of scullion had crept up and pinned a dishcloth to the substantial petticoats and as mistress headley whisked round to see what was the matter like a kitten after its tail it followed her like a train while she rushed to box the ears of the offender crying  you set him on you little saucy vixen  i saw it in your eyes let the rascal be scourged  not so said dennet with prim mouth and laughing eyes  far be it from me  but tis ever the wont of the kitchen when those come there who have no call thither  mistress headley flounced away dishcloth and all to go whimpering to the alderman with her tale of insults  she trusted that her cousin would give the pert wench a good beating  she was not a whit too old for it  how oft did you beat giles good kinswoman said dennet demurely as she stood by her father  whisht whisht child said her father this may not be  i cannot have my guest flouted  if she act as our guest i will treat her with all honour and courtesy said the maiden but when she comes where we look not for guests there is no saying what the black guard may take it on them to do  master headley was mischievously tickled at the retort and not without hope that it might offend his kinswoman into departing but she contented herself with denouncing all imaginable evils from dennets ungoverned condition with which she was prevented in her beneficence from interfering by the fathers foolish fondness  he would rue the day  meantime if the aldermans peace on one side was disturbed by his visitor on the other suitors for dennets hand gave him little rest  she was known to be a considerable heiress and though mistress headley gave every one to understand that there was a contract with giles and that she was awaiting his return this did not deter more wooers than dennet ever knew of from making proposals to her father  jasper hope was offered but he was too young and besides was a mercerand dennet and her father were agreed that her husband must go on with the trade  then there was a master armourer but he was a widower with sons and daughters as old as dennet and she shook her head and laughed at the bare notion there also came a young knight who would have turned the dragon court into a tiltyard and spent all the gold that long years of prudent toil had amassed  if mistress headley deemed each denial the result of her vigilance for her sons interests she was the more impelled to expatiate on the folly of leaving a maid of sixteen to herself to let the household go to rack and ruin while as to the wench she might prank herself in her own conceit but no honest man would soon look at her for a wife if her father left her to herself without giving her a good stepmother or at least putting a kinswoman in authority over her  the alderman was stung  he certainly had warmed a snake on his hearth and how was he to be rid of it  he secretly winked at the resumption of a forge fire that had been abandoned because the noise and smoke incommoded the dwellinghouse and kit smallbones hammered his loudest there when the guest might be taking her morning nap but this had no effect in driving her away though it may have told upon her temper and goodhumoured master headley was harassed more than he had ever been in his life  it puts me past my patience said he turning into tibbles special workshop one afternoon  here hath mistress hillyer of the eagle been with me full of proposals that i would give my poor wench to that scapegrace lad of hers who hath been twice called to account before the guild but who now forsooth is to turn over a new leaf  so i wis would the dragon under him quoth tibble  i told her twas not to be thought of and then what does the dame but sniff the air and protest that i had better take heed for there may not be so many who would choose a spoilt misruled maid like mine  theres the work of yonder sarum woman  i tell thee tib never was bull in the ring more baited than am i  yea sir returned tib therell be no help for it till our young mistress be wed  ay thats the rub  but ive not seen one whom i could mate with herlet alone one who would keep up the old house  giles would have done that passably though he were scarce worthy of the wench even without  an expressive shake of the head denoted the rest and now if he ever come home at all twill be as a foulmouthed plundering scarecrow like the kites of menatarms who if they lose not their lives lose all that makes an honest life in the italian wars  i would have writ to edmund burgess but i hear his elder brother is dead and he is driving a good traffic at york belike too he is wedded  nay said tibble i could tell of one who would be true and faithful to your worship and a loving husband to mistress dennet ay and would be a master that all of us would gladly cleave to for he is godly after his lights and soundhearted and wots what good work be and can do it  that were a soninlaw tib  of who speakest thou  is he of good birth  yea of gentle birth and breeding  and willing  but that they all are  wherefore then hath he never made suit  he hath not yet his freedom  who be it then  he that made this elbowpiece for the suit that queen margaret ordered for the little king of scots returned tibble producing an exquisite miniature bit of workmanship  stephen birkenholt  the fools nephew  mine own prentice  yea and the best worker in steel we have yet turned out  since the sickness of last winter hath stiffened my joints and dimmed mine eyes i had rather trust dainty work such as this to him than to myself  stephen  tibble hath he set thee on to this  no sir  we both know too well what becometh us but when you were casting about for a mate for my young mistress i could not but think how men seek far and overlook the jewel at their feet  he hath nought  that brother of his will give him nought  he hath what will be better for the old dragon and for your worships self than many a bag of gold sir  thou sayst truly there tib  i know him so far that he would not be the ingrate jack to turn his back on the old master or the old man  he is a good lad  butbutive ever set my face against the prentice wedding the masters daughter save when he is of her own house like giles  tell me tibble deemst thou that the varlet hath dared to lift his eyes to the lass  i wot nothing of love said tibble somewhat grimly  i have seen nought  i only told your worship where a good son and a good master might be had  is it your pleasure sir that we take in a freight of seacoal from simon collier for the new furnace  his is purest if a mark more the chaldron  he spoke as if he put the recommendation of the son and master on the same line as that of the coal  mr headley answered the business matters absently and ended by saying he would think on the council  in tibbles workroom with the clatter of a forge close to them they had not heard a commotion in the court outside  dennet had been standing on the steps cleaning her tame starlings cage when mistress headley had suddenly come out on the gallery behind her hotly scolding her laundress and waving her cap to show how ill starched it was  the bird had taken fright and flown to the tree in the court dennet hastened in pursuit but all the boys and children in the court rushing out after her her blandishments had no chance and goldspot had fluttered on to the gateway  stephen had by this time come out and hastened to the gate hoping to turn the truant back from escaping into cheapside but all in vain it flew out while the market was in full career and he could only call back to her that he would not lose sight of it  out he hurried dennet waiting in a sort of despair by the tree for a time that seemed to her endless until stephen reappeared under the gate with a signal that all was well  she darted to meet him yea mistress here he is the little caitiff  he was just knocked down by this country lads caphappily not hurt  i told him you would give him a tester for your bird  with all my heart and dennet produced the coin  oh  stephen are you sure he is safe  thou bad goldspot to fly away from me wink with thine eyethou saucy rogue  wottest thou not but for stephen they might be blinding thy sweet blue eyes with hot needles  his wing is grown since the moulting said stephen  it should be cut to hinder such mischances  will you do it  i will hold him said dennet  ah tis pity the beauteous green goldbedropped wingthat no armour of thine can equal stephen not even that for the little king of scots  but shouldst not be so silly a bird goldie even though thou hast thine excuse  there  peck not ill birdling  know thy friends master stare  and with such pretty nonsense the two stood together dennet in her white cap short crimson kirtle little stiff collar and white bib and apron holding her bird upside down in one hand and with the other trying to keep his angry beak from pecking stephen who in his leathern coat and apron grimed as well as his crisp black hair with soot stood towering above her stooping to hold out the lustrous wing with one hand while he used his smallest pair of shears with the other to clip the penfeathers  see there master alderman cried mistress headley bursting on him from the gallery stairs  be that what you call fitting for your daughter and your prentice a beggar lad from the heath  i ever told you she would bring you to shame thus left to herself and now you see it  their heads had been near together over the starling but at this objurgation they started apart both crimson in the cheeks and dennet flew up to her father bird in hand crying o father father suffer her not  he did no wrong  he was cutting my birds wing  i suffer no one to insult my child in her own house said the alderman so much provoked as to be determined to put an end to it all at once  stephen birkenholt come here  stephen came cap in hand red in the face with a strange tumult in his heart ready to plead guilty though he had done nothing but imagining at the moment that his feelings had been actions  stephen said the alderman thou art a true and worthy lad canst thou love my daughter  ii crave your pardon sir there was no helping it stammered stephen not catching the tone of the strange interrogation and expecting any amount of terrible consequences for his presumption  then thou wilt be a faithful spouse to her and son to me  and dennet my daughter hast thou any distaste to this youththough he bring nought but skill and honesty  o father father  ii had rather have him than any other  then stephen birkenholt and dennet headley ye shall be man and wife so soon as the young mans term be over and he be a freeman so he continue to be that which he seems at present  thereto i give my word i giles headley alderman of the chepe ward and thereof ye are witnesses all of you  and gods blessing on it  a tremendous hurrah arose led by kit smallbones from every workman in the court and the while stephen and dennet unaware of anything else flew into one anothers arms while goldspot on whom the operation had been fortunately completed took refuge upon stephens head  o mistress dennet i have made you black all over was stephens first word  heed not i ever loved the black she cried as her eyes sparkled  so i have done what was to thy mind my lass said master headley who without ever having thought of consulting his daughter was delighted to see that her heart was with him  sir i did not know fullybut indeed i should never have been so happy as i am now  sir added stephen putting his knee to the ground it nearly wrung my heart to think of her as belonging to another though i never durst utter aughtand while dennet embraced her father stephen sobbed for very joy and with difficulty said in broken words something about a sons duty and devotion  they were broken in upon by mistress headley who after standing in mute consternation fell on them in a fury  she understood the device now  all had been a scheme laid amongst them for defrauding her poor fatherless child driving him away and taking up this beggarly brat  she had seen through the little baggage from the first and she pitied master headley  rage was utterly ungovernable in those days and she actually was flying to attack dennet with her nails when the alderman caught her by the wrists and she would have been almost too much for him had not kit smallbones come to his assistance and carried her kicking and screaming like a naughty child into the house  there was small restraint of temper in those days even in high life and below it there was some reason for the employment of the padlock and the ducking stool  floods of tears restored the dame to some sort of composure but she declared she could stay no longer in a house where her son had been illused and deceived and she had been insulted  the alderman thought the insult had been the other way but he was too glad to be rid of her on any terms to gainsay her and at his own charge undertook to procure horse and escort to convey her safely to salisbury the next morning  he advised stephen to keep out of her sight for the rest of the day giving leave of absence so that the youth as one treading on air set forth to carry to his brother his aunt and if possible his uncle the intelligence that he could as yet hardly believe was more than a happy dream    chapter xxiii  unwelcome preferment    i am a poor fallen man unworthy now to be thy lord and master  seek the king that sun i pray may never set shakespeare   matters flowed on peaceably with stephen and dennet  the alderman saw no reason to repent his decision hastily as it had been made stephen gave himself no unseemly airs of presumption but worked on as one whose heart was in the business and dennet rewarded her fathers trust by her discretion  they were happily married in the summer of 1522 as soon as stephens apprenticeship was over and from that time he was in the position of the masters son with more and more devolving on him as tibble became increasingly rheumatic every winter and the alderman himself grew in flesh and in distaste to exertion  ambrose meanwhile prospered with his master and could easily have obtained some office in the law courts that would have enabled him to make a home of his own but if he had the least inclination to the love of women it was all merged in a silent distant worship of sweet pale margaret rare pale margaret the likeminded daughter of sir thomas morean affection which was so entirely devotion at a shrine that it suffered no shock when sir thomas at length consented to his daughters marriage with william roper  ambrose was the only person who ever received any communication from giles headley  they were few and far between but when stephen gardiner returned from his embassy to pope clement vii who was then at orvieto one of the suite reported to ambrose how astonished he had been by being accosted in good english by one of the imperial menatarms who were guarding his holiness in actual though unconfessed captivity  this person had sent his commendations to ambrose and likewise a laborious bit of writing which looked as if he were fast forgetting the art  it bade ambrose inform his mother and all his friends and kin that he was well and coming to preferment and inclosed for aldonza a small motherofpearl cross blessed by the pope  giles added that he should bring her finer gifts by and by  seven years constancy  it gave quite a respectability to giless love and aldonza was still ready and patient while waiting in attendance on her beloved mistress  ambrose lived on in the colony at chelsea sometimes attending his master especially on diplomatic missions and generally acting as librarian and foreign secretary and obtaining some notice from erasmus on the great scholars visit to chelsea  under such guidance ambroses opinions had settled down a good deal and he was a disappointment to tibble whose views advanced proportionably as he worked less and read and thought more  he so bitterly resented and deplored the burning of tindals bible that there was constant fear that he might bring on himself the same fate especially as he treasured his own copy and studied it constantly the reform that wolsey had intended to effect when he obtained the legatine authority seemed to fall into the background among political interests and his efforts had as yet no result save the suppression of some useless and illmanaged small religious houses to endow his magnificent project of york college at oxford with a feeder at ipswich his native town  he was waiting to obtain the papacy when he would deal better with the abuses  randall once asked him if he were not waiting to be king of heaven when he could make root and branch work at once hal had never so nearly incurred a flogging  and in the meantime another influence was at work an influence only heard of at first in whispered jests which made loyalhearted dennet blush and look indignant but which soon grew to sad earnest as she could not but avow when she beheld the stately pomp of the two cardinals wolsey and campeggio sweep up to the blackfriars convent to sit in judgment on the marriage of poor queen katharine  out on them she said  so many learned men to set their wits against one poor woman  and she heartily rejoiced when they came to no decision and the pope was appealed to  as to understanding all the explanations that ambrose brought from time to time she called them quirks and quiddities and left them to her father and tibble to discuss in their chimney corners  they had seen nothing of the jester for a good while for he was with wolsey who was attending the king on a progress through the midland shires  when the cardinal returned to open the law courts as chancellor at the beginning of the autumn term still randall kept away from home perhaps because he had forebodings that he could not bear to mention  on the evening of that very day london rang with the tidings that the great seal had been taken from the cardinal and that he was under orders to yield up his noble mansion of york house and to retire to esher nay it was reported that he was to be imprisoned in the tower and the next day the thames was crowded with more than a thousand boats filled with people expecting to see him landed at the traitors gate and much disappointed when his barge turned towards putney  in the afternoon ambrose came to the dragon court  even as stephen figured now as a handsome prosperous young freeman of the city ambrose looked well in the sober black apparel and neat ruff of a lawyers clerkclerk indeed to the first lawyer in the kingdom for the news had spread before him that sir thomas more had become lord chancellor  thou art come to bear us word of thy promotionfor thy masters is thine own said the alderman heartily as he entered shaking hands with him  never was the great seal in better hands  tis true indeed your worship said ambrose though it will lay a heavy charge on him and divert him from much that he loveth better still  i came to ask of my sister dennet a supper and a bed for the night as i have been on business for him and can scarce get back to chelsea  and welcome said dennet  little giles and bess have been wearying for their uncle  i must not toy with them yet said ambrose i have a message for my aunt  brother wilt thou walk down to the temple with me before supper  yea and how is it with master randall asked dennet  be he gone with my lord cardinal  he is made over to the king said ambrose briefly  tis that which i must tell his wife  have with thee then said stephen linking his arm into that of his brother for to be together was still as great an enjoyment to them as in forest days  and on the way ambrose told what he had not been willing to utter in full assembly in the hall  he had been sent by his master with a letter of condolence to the fallen cardinal and likewise of inquiry into some necessary business connected with the chancellorship  wolsey had not time to answer before embarking but as sir thomas had vouched for the messengers ability and trustiness he had bidden ambrose come into his barge and receive his instructions  thus ambrose had landed with him just as a messenger came riding in haste from the king with a kind greeting assuring his old friend that his seeming disgrace was only for a time and for political reasons and sending him a ring in token thereof  the cardinal had fallen on his knees to receive the message had snatched a gold chain and precious relic from his own neck to reward the messenger and then casting about for some gift for the king by ill luck said ambrose his eye lit upon our uncle and he instantly declared that he would bestow patch as the court chooses to call him on the king  well as thou canst guess hal is hotly wroth at the treatment of his lord whom he truly loveth and he flung himself before the cardinal and besought that he might not be sent from his good lord  but the cardinal was only chafed at aught that gainsaid him and all he did was to say he would have no more ado he had made his gift  get thee gone he said as if he had been ordering off a horse or dog  welladay it was hard to brook the sight and hals blood was up  he flatly refused to go saying he was the cardinals servant but no villain nor serf to be thus made over without his own will  he was in the right there returned stephen hotly  yea save that by playing the fool poor fellow he hath yielded up the rights of a wise man  any way all he gat by it was that the cardinal bade two of the yeomen lay hands on him and bear him off then there came on him that reckless mood which i trow banished him long ago from the forest and brought him to the motley  he fought with them with all his force and broke away onceas if that were of any use for a man in motleybut he was bound at last and borne off by six of them to windsor  and thou stoodst by and beheld it cried stephen  nay what could i have done save to make his plight worse and forfeit all chance of yet speaking to him  thou wert ever cool  i wot that i could not have borne it said stephen  they told the story to perronel who was on the whole elated by her husbands promotion declaring that the king loved him well and that he would soon come to his senses though for a wise man he certainly had too much of the fool even as he had too much of the wise man for the fool  she became anxious however as the weeks passed by without hearing of or from him and at length ambrose confessed his uneasiness to his kind master and obtained leave to attend him on the next summons to windsor  ambrose could not find his uncle at first  randall who used to pervade york house and turn up everywhere when least expected did not appear among the superior servingmen and secretaries with whom his nephew ranked and of course there was no access to the state apartments  sir thomas however told ambrose that he had seen quipsome hal among the other jesters but that he seemed dull and dejected  then ambrose beheld from a window a cruel sight for the other fools three in number were surrounding hal baiting and teasing him triumphing over him in fact for having formerly outshone them while he stood among them like a big dog worried by little curs against whom he disdained to use his strength ambrose unable to bear this ran down stairs to endeavour to interfere but before he could find his way to the spot an arrival at the gate had attracted the tormentors and ambrose found his uncle leaning against the wall alone  he looked thin and wan the light was gone out of his black eyes and his countenance was in sad contrast to his gay and absurd attire  he scarcely cheered up when his nephew spoke to him though he was glad to hear of perronel  he said he knew not when he should see her again for he had been unable to secure his suit of ordinary garments so that even if the king came to london or if he could elude the other fools he could not get out to visit her  he was no better than a prisoner here he only marvelled that the king retained so wretched a jester with so heavy a heart  once thou wast in favour said ambrose  methought thou couldst have availed thyself of it to speak for the lord cardinal  what  a senseless cur whom he kicked from him said randall twas that took all spirit from me boy  i who thought he loved me as i love him to this day  to send me to be sport for his foes i think of it day and night and ive not a gibe left under my belt  nay said ambrose it may have been that the cardinal hoped to secure a true friend at the kings ear as well as to provide for thee  had he but said so  nay perchance he trusted to thy sharp wit  a gleam came into hals eyes  it might be so  thou always wast a toward lad ambrose and if so i was cur and fool indeed to baulk him  therewith one of the other fools danced back exhibiting a silver crown that had just been flung to him mopping and mowing and demanding when patch would have wit to gain the like  whereto hal replied by pointing to ambrose and declaring that that gentleman had given him better than fifty crowns  and that night sir thomas told ambrose that the quipsome one had recovered himself had been more brilliant than ever and had quite eclipsed the other fools  on the next opportunity ambrose contrived to pack in his cloakbag the cap and loose garment in which his uncle was wont to cover his motley  the court was still at windsor but nearly the whole of sir thomass stay elapsed without ambrose being able to find his uncle wolsey had been very ill and the king had relented enough to send his own physician to attend him  ambrose began to wonder if hal could have found any plea for rejoining his old master but in the last hour of his stay he found hal curled up listlessly on a window seat of a gallery his head resting on his hand  uncle good uncle  at last  thou art sick  sick at heart lad said hal looking up  yea i took thy counsel  i plucked up a spirit i made harry laugh as of old though my heart smote me as i thought how he was wont to be answered by my master  i even brooked to jest with the nightcrow as my own poor lord called this nan boleyn  and lo you now when his grace was touched at my lords sickness i durst say there was one sure elixir for such as he to wit a gold harry and that a kings touch was a sovereign cure for other disorders than the kings evil  harry smiled and in ten minutes more would have taken horse for esher had not madam nan claimed his word to ride out hawking with her  and next she sendeth me a warning by one of her pert maids that i should be whipped if i spoke to his grace of unfitting matters  my flesh could brook no more and like a born natural i made answer that nan boleyn was no mistress of mine to bid me hold a tongue that had spoken sooth to her betters thereupon what think you boy  the grooms came and soundly flogged me for uncomely speech of my lady anne  i that was eighteen years with my lord cardinal and none laid hand on me  yea i was beaten and then shut up in a doghole for three days on bread and water with none to speak to but the other fools jeering at me like a rogue in a pillory  ambrose could hardly speak for hot grief and indignation but he wrung his uncles hand and whispered that he had hid the loose gown behind the arras of his chamber but he could do no more for he was summoned to attend his master and a servant further thrust in to say concern yourself not for that rogue sir he hath been saucy and must mend his manners or he will have worse  away kind sir said hal you can do the poor fool no further good but only bring the pack about the ears of the mangy hound and he sang a stave appropriated by a greater man than he    then let the stricken deer go weep the hart ungalled play   the only hope that ambrose or his good master could devise for poor randall was that sir thomas should watch his opportunity and beg the fool from the king who might part with him as a child gives away the once coveted toy that has failed in its hands but the request would need circumspection for all had already felt the change that had taken place in the temper of the king since henry had resolutely undertaken that the wrong should be the right and ambrose could not but dread the effect of desperation on a man whose nature had in it a vein of impatient recklessness  it was after dinner and dennet with her little boy and girl was on the steps dispensing the salt fish broken bread and pottage of the lenten meal to the daily troop who came for her alms when among them she saw somewhat to her alarm a gipsy man who was talking to little giles  the boy a stout fellow of six was astride on the balustrade looking up eagerly into the face of the man who began imitating the note of a blackbird  dennet remembering the evil propensities of the gipsy race called hastily to her little son to come down and return to her side but little giles was unwilling to move and called to her o mother come  he hath a birdcall  in some perturbation lest the man might be calling her bird away dennet descended the steps  she was about to utter a sharp rebuke but giles held out his hand imploringly and she paused a moment to hear the sweet full note of the ouzel cock with orange tawny bill closely imitated on a tiny bone whistle he will sell it to me for two farthings cried the boy and teach me to sing on it like all the birds  yea good mistress said the gipsy i can whistle a tune that the little master ay and others might be fain to hear  therewith spite of the wild dress dennet knew the eyes and the voice  and perhaps the blackbirds note had awakened echoes in another mind for she saw stephen in his working dress come out to the door of the shop where he continued to do all the finer work which had formerly fallen to tibbles share  she lifted her boy from his perch and bade him take the stranger to his father who would no doubt give him the whistle  and thus having without exciting attention separated the fugitive from the rest of her pensioners she made haste to dismiss them  she was not surprised that little giles came running back to her producing unearthly notes on the instrument and telling her that father had taken the gipsy into his workshop and said they would teach him birds songs by and by  steve steve had been the first words uttered when the boy was out of hearing hast thou a smiths apron and plenty of smut to bestow on me  none can tell what harrys mood may be when he finds ive given him the slip  that is the reason i durst not go to my poor dame  we will send to let her know  i thought i guessed what black ouzel twas  i mind how thou didst make the like notes for us when we were no bigger than my giles  thou hast a kind heart stephen  here  is thy furnace hot enough to make a speedy end of this same greasy gipsy doublet  i trust not the varlet with whom i bartered it for my motley  and a fine bargain he had of what i trust never to wear again to the end of my days  make me a smith complete stephen and then will i tell thee my story  we must call kit into counsel ere we can do that fully said stephen  in a few minutes hal randall was to all appearance a very shabby and grimy smith and then he took breath to explain his anxiety and alarm  once again hearing that the cardinal was to be exiled to york he had ventured on a sorry jest about old friends and old wine being better than new but the king who had once been open to plain speaking was now incensed threatened and swore at him  moreover one of the other fools had told him in the way of boasting that he had heard master cromwell formerly the cardinals secretary informing the king that this rogue was no true natural at all but was blessed or cursed with as good an understanding as other folks as was well known in the cardinals household and that he had no doubt been sent to serve as a spy so that he was to be esteemed a dangerous person and had best be put under ward  hal had not been able to discover whether cromwell had communicated his name but he suspected that it might be known to that acute person and he could not tell whether his compeer spoke out of a sort of goodnatured desire to warn him or simply to triumph in his disgrace and leer at him for being an impostor  at any rate being now desperate he covered his particoloured raiment with the gown ambrose had brought made a perilous descent from a window in the twilight scaled a wall with the agility that seemed to have returned to him and reached windsor forest  there falling on a camp of gipsies he had availed himself of old experiences in his wild shirley days and had obtained an exchange of garb his handsome motley being really a prize to the wanderers thus he had been able to reach london but he did not feel any confidence that if he were pursued to the gipsy tent he would not be betrayed  in this his sagacity was not at fault for he had scarcely made his explanation when there was a knocking at the outer gate and a demand to enter in the name of the king and to see alderman sir giles headley  several of the stout figures of the yeomen of the kings guard were seen crossing the court and stephen committing the charge of his uncle to kit threw off his apron washed his face and went up to the hall not very rapidly for he suspected that since his fatherinlaw knew nothing of the arrival he would best baffle the inquiries by sincere denials  and dennet with her sharp womans wit scenting danger had whisked herself and her children out of the hall at the first moment and taken them down to the kitchen where modelling with a batch of dough occupied both of them  meantime the alderman flatly denied the presence of the jester or the harbouring of the gipsy  he allowed that the jester was of kin to his soninlaw but the good man averred in all honesty that he knew nought of any escape and was absolutely certain that no such person was in the court  then as stephen entered doffing his cap to the kings officer the alderman continued there fair son this is what these gentlemen have come about  thy kinsman it seemeth hath fled from windsor and his grace is mightily incensed they say he changed clothes with a gipsy and was traced hither this morn but i have told them the thing is impossible  will the gentlemen search asked stephen  the gentlemen did search but they only saw the smiths in full work and in smallbones forge there was a roaring glowing furnace with a bare armed fellow feeding it with coals so that it fairly scorched them and gave them double relish for the good wine and beer that was put out on the table to do honour to them  stephen had just with all civility seen them off the premises when perronel came sobbing into the court  they had visited her first for cromwell had evidently known of randalls haunts they had turned her little house upside down and had threatened her hotly in case she harboured a disloyal spy who deserved hanging  she came to consult stephen for the notion of her husband wandering about as a sort of outlaw was almost as terrible as the threat of his being hanged  stephen beckoned her to a storeroom full of gaunt figures of armour upon blocks and there brought up to her his extremely grimy new hand  there was much gladness between them but the future had to be considered  perronel had a little hoard the amount of which she was too shrewd to name to any one even her husband but she considered it sufficient to enable him to fulfil the cherished scheme of his life of retiring to some small farm near his old home and she was for setting off at once  but harry randall declared that he could not go without having offered his services to his old master  he had heard of his good lord as sick sad and deserted by those whom he had cherished and the faithful heart was so true in its loyalty that no persuasion could prevail in making it turn south  nay said the wife did he not cast thee off himself and serve thee like one of his dogs  how canst thou be bound to him  theres the rub sighed hal  he sent me to the king deeming that he should have one full of faithful love to speak a word on his behalf and i brutish oaf as i was must needs take it amiss and sulk and mope till the occasion was past and that viper cromwell was there to back up the woman boleyn and poison his graces ear  as if a man must not have a spirit to be angered by such treatment  thou forgettest good wife  no man but a fool and to be entreated as such  be that as it may to york i must  i have eaten of my lords bread too many years and had too much kindness from him in the days of his glory to seek mine own ease now in his adversity  thou wouldst have a poor bargain of me when my heart is away  perronel saw that thus it would be and that this was one of the points on which to her mind her husband was more than half a veritable fool after all  there had long been a promise that stephen should in some time of slack employment make a visit to his old comrade edmund burgess at york and as some new tools and patterns had to be conveyed thither a sudden resolution was come to in family conclave that stephen himself should convey them taking his uncle with him as a servingman to attend to the horses  the alderman gave full consent he had always wished stephen to see york while he himself with tibble steelman was able to attend to the business and while he pronounced randall to have a heart of gold well worth guarding he still was glad when the risk was over of the kings hearing that the runaway jester was harboured at the dragon  dennet did not like the journey for her husband for to her mind it was perilous but she had had a warm affection for his uncle ever since their expedition to richmond together and she did her best to reconcile the murmuring and wounded perronel by praises of randall a true and noble heart and that as to setting her aside for the cardinal who had heeded him so little such faithfulness only made her more secure of his trueheartedness towards her  perronel was moreover to break up her business dispose of her house and await her husbands return at the dragon  stephen came back after a happy month with his friend stored with wondrous tales and descriptions which would last the children for a month  he had seen his uncle present himself to the cardinal at cawood castle  it had been a touching meeting  hal could hardly restrain his tears when he saw how wolseys sturdy form had wasted and his round ruddy cheeks had fallen away while the attitude in which he sat in his chair was listless and weary though he fitfully exerted himself with his old vigour  hal on his side in the dark plain dress of a citizen was hardly recognisable for not only had he likewise grown thinner and his brown cheeks more hollow but his hair had become almost white during his miserable weeks at windsor though he was not much over forty years old  he came up the last of a number who presented themselves for the archiepiscopal blessing as wolsey sat under a large tree in cawood park  wolsey gave it with his raised fingers without special heed but therewith hal threw himself on the ground kissed his feet and cried my lord my dear lord your pardon  what hast done fellow  speak said the cardinal  grovel not thus  we will be merciful  ah my lord said randall lifting himself up but with clasped hands and tearful eyes i did not serve you as i ought with the king but if you will forgive me and take me back  how now  how couldst thou serve me  whatas hal made a familiar gesturethou art not the poor fool quipsome patch  how comest thou here  methought i had provided well for thee in making thee over to the king  ah my lord i was fool fool indeed but all my jests failed me how could i make sport for your enemies  and thou hast come thou hast left the king to follow my fallen fortunes said wolsey  my poor boy he who is sitting in sackcloth and ashes needs no jester  nay my lord nor can i find one jest to break  would you but let me be your meanest horseboy your scullion  hals voice was cut short by tears as the cardinal abandoned to him one hand  the other was drying eyes that seldom wept  my faithful hal he said this is love indeed  and stephen ere he came away had seen his uncle fully established as a rational creature and by his true name as one of the personal attendants on the cardinals bedchamber and treated with the affection he well deserved  wolsey had really seemed cheered by his affection and was devoting himself to the care of his hitherto neglected and even unvisited diocese in a way that delighted the hearts of the yorkshiremen  the first idea was that perronel should join her husband at york but safe modes of travelling were not easy to be found and before any satisfactory escort offered there were rumours that made it prudent to delay  as autumn advanced it was known that the earl of northumberland had been sent to attach the cardinal of high treason then ensued other reports that the great cardinal had sunk and died on his way to london for trial and at last one dark winter evening a sorrowful man stumbled up the steps of the dragon and as he came into the bright light of the fire and perronel sprang to meet him he sank into a chair and wept aloud  he had been one of those who had lifted the brokenhearted wolsey from his mule in the cloister of leicester abbey he had carried him to his bed watched over him and supported him as the abbot of leicester gave him the last sacraments  he had heard and treasured up those mournful words which are wolseys chief legacy to the world had i but served my god as i have served my king he would not have forsaken me in my old age  for himself he had the dying mans blessing and assurance that nothing had so much availed to cheer in these sad hours as his faithful love  now perronel might do what she would with himhe cared not  and what she did was to set forth with him for hampshire on a pair of stout mules with a strong servingman behind them    chapter xxiv  the soldier    of a worthy london prentice    my purpose is to speak and tell his brave adventures    done for his countrys sake seek all the world about    and you shall hardly find a man in valour to exceed    a prentice gallant mind  the homes of a london prentice  six more years had passed over the dragon court when one fine summer evening as the old walls rang with the merriment of the young boys at play there entered through the gateway a tall well equipped soldierly figure which caught the eyes of the little armourer world in a moment  oh thats a real milan helmet exclaimed the one lad  and oh what a belt and buff coat cried another  the subject of their admiration advanced muttering as if id not been away a week adding i pray you pretty lads doth master alderman headley still dwell here  yea sir he is our grandfather said the elder boy holding a lesser one by the shoulder as he spoke  verily  and what may be your names  i am giles birkenholt and this is my little brother dick  even as i thought  wilt thou run in to your grandsire and tell him  the bigger boy interrupted grandfather is going to bed  he is old and weary and cannot see strangers so late  tis our father who heareth all the orders  and added the little one with wide open grave eyes mother bade us run out and play and not trouble father because uncle ambrose is so downcast because they have cut off the head of good sir thomas more  yet said the visitor methinks your father would hear of an old comrade  or stay where be tibble steelman and kit smallbones  tibble is in the hall wellnigh as sad as uncle ambrose began dick but giles better able to draw conclusions exclaimed tibble  kit  you know them sir  oh are you the giles headley that ran away to be a soldier ere i was born  kit  kit see here  as the giant broader and perhaps a little more bent but with little loss of strength came forward out of his hut and taking up the matter just where it had been left fourteen years before demanded as they shook hands ah  master giles how couldst thou play me such a scurvy trick  nay kit was it not best for all that i turned my back to make way for honest stephen  by this time young giles had rushed up the stair to the hall where as he said truly stephen was giving his brother such poor comfort as could be had from sympathy when listening to the story of the cheerful brave resignation of the noblest of all the victims of henry viii  ambrose had been with sir thomas wellnigh to the last had carried messages between him and his friends during his imprisonment had handed his papers to him at his trial had been with mrs roper when she broke through the crowd and fell on his neck as he walked from westminster hall with the axeedge turned towards him had received his last kind farewell counsel and blessing and had only not been with him on the scaffold because sir thomas had forbidden it saying in the old strain of mirth which never forsook him nay come not my good friend  thou art of a queasy nature and i would fain not haunt thee against thy will  all was over now the wise and faithful head had fallen because it would not own the wrong for the right and ambrose had been brought home by his brother a being confounded dazed seeming hardly able to think or understand aught save that the man whom he had above all loved and looked up to was taken from him judicially murdered and by the king  the whole world seemed utterly changed to him and as to thinking or planning for himself he was incapable of it indeed he looked fearfully ill  his little nephew came up to his fathers knee pausing though openmouthed and at the first token of permission bursting out oh father  heres a soldier in the court  kit is talking to him  and he is giles headley that ran away  he has a beauteous spanish leathern coat and a belt with silver bossesand a morion that phil smallbones saith to be of milan but i say it is french  stephen had no sooner gathered the import of this intelligence than he sprang down almost as rapidly as his little boy with his welcome  nor did giles headley return at all in the dilapidated condition that had been predicted  he was stout comely and well fleshed and very handsomely clad and equipped in a foreign style with nothing of the lean wolfish appearance of sir john fulford the two old comrades heartily shook one another by the hand in real gladness at the meeting  stephens welcome was crossed by the greeting and inquiry whether all was well  yea  the alderman is hale and hearty but aged  your mother is tabled at a religious house at salisbury  i know  i landed at southampton and have seen her  and dennet stephen added with a short laugh she could not wait for you  no verily  did i not wot well that she cared not a fico for me i hoped when i made off that thou wouldst be the winner steve and i am right glad thou art man  i can but thank thee giles said stephen changing to the familiar singular pronoun  i have oft since thought what a foolish figure i should have cut had i met thee among the badgers after having given leg bail because i might not brook seeing thee wedded to her  for i was sore temptedonly thou wast free and mine indenture held me fast  then it was so  and i did thee a good turn  for i tell thee steve i never knew how well i liked thee till i was wounded and sick among those who heeded neither god nor man  but one word more stephen ere we go in  the moors little maiden is she still unwedded  yea was stephens answer  she is still waitingmaid to mistress roper daughter to good sir thomas more but alack giles they are in sore trouble as it may be thou hast heardand my poor brother is like one distraught  ambrose did indeed meet giles like one in a dream  he probably would have made the same mechanical greeting if the emperor or the pope had been at that moment presented to him but dennet who had been attending to her father made up all that was wanting in cordiality  she had always had a certain sense of shame for having flouted her cousin and as his mother told her driven him to death and destruction and it was highly satisfactory to see him safe and sound and apparently respectable and prosperous  moreover grieved as all the family were for the fate of the admirable and excellent more it was a relief to those less closely connected with him to attend to something beyond poor ambroses sorrow and his talk the which moreover might be perilous if any outsider listened and reported it to the authorities as disaffection to the king  so giles told his story sitting on the gallery in the cool of the summer evening and marvelling over and over again how entirely unchanged all was since his first view of the dragon court as a proud sullen raw lad twenty summers ago  since that time he had seen so much that the time appeared far longer to him than to those who had stayed at home  it seemed that fulford had from the first fascinated him more than any of the party guessed and that each day of the free life of the expedition and of contact with the soldiery made a return to the monotony of the forge the decorous life of a london citizen and the bridal with a child to whom he was indifferent seem more intolerable to him  fulford imagining rightly that the knowledge of his intentions might deter young birkenholt from escaping enjoined strict secrecy on either lad not intending them to meet till it should be too late to return and therefore had arranged that giles should quit the party on the way to calais bringing with him will wherry and the horse he rode  giles had then been enrolled among the badgers  he had little to tell about his life among them till the battle of pavia where he had had the good fortune to take three french prisoners but a stray shot from a fugitive had broken his leg during the pursuit and he had been laid up in a merchants house at pavia for several months he evidently looked back to the time with gratitude as having wakened his better associations which had been wellnigh stifled during the previous years of the wild life of a soldier of fortune his hosts young daughter had eyes like aldonza and the almost forgotten possibility of returning to his love a brave and distinguished man awoke once more  his burgher thrift began to assert itself again and he deposited a nestegg from the ransoms of his prisoners in the hands of his host who gave him bonds by which he could recover the sum from lombard correspondents in london  he was bound by his engagements to join the badgers again or he would have gone home on his recovery and he had shared in the terrible taking of rome of which he declared that he could not speakwith a significant look at dennet and her children who were devouring his words  he had however stood guard over a lady and her young children whom some savage spaniards were about to murder and the whole family had overpowered him with gratitude lodged him sumptuously in their house and shown themselves as grateful to him as if he had given them all the treasure which he had abstained from seizing  the sickness brought on by their savage excesses together with the roman summer had laid low many of the badgers  when the prince of orange drew off the army from the miserable city scarce seven score of that once gallant troop were in marching order and sir john fulford himself was dying  he sent for giles as less of a demon than most of the troop and sent a gold medal the only fragment of spoil remaining to him to his daughter perronel  to giles himself fulford bequeathed abenalis welltested sword and he died in the comfortable beliefso far as he troubled himself about the matter at allthat there were special exemptions for soldiers  the badgers now incorporated themselves with another broken body of landsknechts and fell under the command of a better and more conscientious captain  giles who had been horrified rather than hardened by the experiences of rome was found trustworthy and rose in command  the troop was sent to take charge of the pope at orvieto and thus it was that he had fallen in with the englishmen of gardiners suite and had been able to send his letter to ambrose  since he had found the means of rising out of the slough he had made up his mind to continue to serve till he had won some honour and had obtained enough to prevent his return as a hungry beggar  his corps became known for discipline and valour  it was trusted often was in attendance on the emperor and was fairly well paid giles was their ancient and had charge of the banner nor could it be doubted that he had flourished  his last adventure had been the expedition to tunis when 20000 christian captives had been set free from the dungeons and galleys and so grand a treasure had been shared among the soldiery that giles having completed the term of service for which he was engaged decided on returning to england before as he said he grew any older to see how matters were going  for the future he said it depended on how he found things  if aldonza would none of him he should return to the emperors service  if she would go with him he held such a position that he could provide for her honourably  or he could settle in england for he had a good sum in the hands of lombard merchants having made over to them spoils of war ransoms and arrears when he obtained them and having at times earned something by exercising his craft which he said had been most valuable to him  indeed he thought he could show stephen and tibble a few fresh arts he had picked up at milan  meantime his first desire was to see aldonza  she was still at chelsea with her mistress and ambrose to his brothers regret went thither every day partly because he could not keep away and partly to try to be of use to the family  giles might accompany him though he still looked so absorbed in his trouble that it was doubtful whether he had really understood what was passing or that he was wanted to bring about an interview between his companion and aldonza  the beautiful grounds at chelsea in their summer beauty looked inexpressibly mournful deprived of him who had planted and cherished the trees and roses  as they passed along in the barge one spot after another recalled mores bright jests or wise words above all the very place where he had told his soninlaw roper that he was merry not because he was safe but because the fight was won and his conscience had triumphed against the king he loved and feared  giles told of the report that the emperor had said he would have given a hundred of his nobles for one such councillor as more and the prospect of telling this to the daughters had somewhat cheered ambrose  they found a guard in the royal livery at the stairs to the river and at the door of the house but these had been there ever since sir thomass apprehension  they knew ambrose birkenholt and made no objection to his passing in and leaving his companion to walk about among the borders and paths once so trim but already missing their masters hand and eye  very long it seemed to giles who was nearly despairing when a female figure in black came out of one of the side doors which were not guarded and seemed to be timidly looking for him  instantly he was at her side  not here she said and in silence led the way to a pleached alley out of sight of the windows  there they stood still  it was a strange meeting of two who had not seen each other for fourteen years when the one was a tall ungainly youth the other wellnigh a child  and now giles was a fine soldierly man in the prime of life with a short curled beard and powerful alert bearing and aldonza though the first flower of her youth had gone by yet having lived a sheltered and far from toilsome life was a really beautiful woman gracefully proportioned and with the delicate features and clear olive skin of the andalusian moor  her eyes always her finest feature were sunken with weeping but their soft beauty could still be seen  giles threw himself on his knee and grasped at her hand  my lovemy only love he cried  oh how can i think of such matters nownow when it is thus with my dear mistress said aldonza in a mournful voice as though her tears were all spentyet not withholding her hand  you knew me before you knew her said giles  see aldonza what i have brought back to you  and he half drew the sword her father had made  she gave a gasp of delight for well she knew every device in the gold inlaying of the blade and she looked at giles with eyes fall of gratitude  i knew thou wouldst own me said giles  i have fought and gone far from thee aldonza  canst not spare one word for thine old giles  ah gilesthere is one thing which if you will do for my mistress i would be yours fromfrom my heart of hearts  say it sweetheart and it is done  you know not  it is perilous and may be many would quail  yet it may be less perilous for you than for one who is better known  peril and i are well acquainted my heart  she lowered her voice as her eyes dilated and she laid her hand on his arm  thou wottest what is on london bridge gates  i saw it a sorry sight  my mistress will not rest till that dear and sacred head holy as any blessed relic be taken down so as not to be the sport of sun and wind and cruel men gaping beneath  she cannot sleep she cannot sit or stand still she cannot even kiss her child for thinking of it  her mind is set on taking it down yet she will not peril her husband  nor verily know i how any here could do the deed  ha  i have scaled a wall ere now  i bare our banner at goletta with the battlements full of angry moors not far behind the emperors  you would  and be secret  then indeed nought would be overmuch for you  and this very night  the sooner the better  she not only clasped his hand in thanks but let him raise her face to his and take the reward he felt his due  then she said she must return but ambrose would bring him all particulars  ambrose was as anxious as herself and her mistress that the thing should be done but was unfit by all his habits and his dainty scholarly niceness to render such effectual assistance as the soldier could do  giles offered to scale the gate by night himself carry off the head and take it to any place mrs roper might appoint with no assistance save such as ambrose could afford  aldonza shuddered a little at this proving that her heart had gone out to him already but with this he had to be contented for she went back into the house and he saw her no more  ambrose came back to him and with something more like cheerfulness than he had yet seen said thou art happy giles  more happy than i durst hopeto find her  tush  i meant not that  but to be able to do the work of the holy ones of old who gathered the remnants of the martyrs while i have indeed the will but am but a poor craven  it is gone nearer to comfort that sadhearted lady than aught else  it appeared that mrs roper would not be satisfied unless she herself were present at the undertaking and this was contrary to the views of giles who thought the further off women were in such a matter the better  there was a watch at the outer entrance of london bridge the trainbands taking turns to supply it but it was known by experience that they did not think it necessary to keep awake after belated travellers had ceased to come in and sir thomas mores head was set over the opposite gateway looking inwards at the city  the most suitable hour would be between one and two oclock when no one would be stirring and the summer night would be at the shortest  mrs roper was exceedingly anxious to implicate no one and to prevent her husband and brother from having any knowledge of an act that william roper might have prohibited as if she could not absolutely exculpate him it might be fatal to him she would therefore allow no one to assist save ambrose and a few more devoted old servants of condition too low for anger to be likely to light upon them  she was to be rowed with muffled oars to the spot to lie hid in the shadow of the bridge till a signal like the cry of the peewit was exchanged from the bridge then approach the stairs at the inner angle of the bridge where giles and ambrose would meet her  giless experience as a manatarms stood him in good stead  he purchased a rope as he went home also some iron ramps  he took a survey of the arched gateway in the course of the afternoon and shutting himself into one of the worksheds with ambrose he constructed such a rope ladder as was used in scaling fortresses especially when seized at night by surprise  he beguiled the work by a long series of anecdotes of adventures of the kind of all of which ambrose heard not one word  the whole court and especially giles number three were very curious as to their occupation but nothing was said even to stephen for it was better if ambrose should be suspected that he should be wholly ignorant but he had they knew not howgathered somewhat  only ambrose was at parting for the night obliged to ask him for the key of the gate  brother then he said what is this work i see  dost think i can let thee go into a danger i do not partake  i will share in this pious act towards the man i have ever reverenced  so at dead of night the three men stole out together all in the plainest leathern suits  the deed was done in the perfect stillness of the sleeping city and without mishap or mischance  stephens strong hand held the ladder securely and aided to fix it to the ramps and just as the early dawn was touching the summit of st pauls spire with a promise of light giles stepped into the boat and reverently placed his burden within the opening of a velvet cushion that had been ripped up and deprived of part of the stuffing so as to conceal it effectually  the brave margaret roper the english antigone well knowing that all depended on her selfcontrol refrained from aught that might shake it  she only raised her face to giles and murmured from dry lips sir god must reward you  and aldonza who sat beside her held out her hand  ambrose was to go with them to the priests house where mrs roper was forced to leave her treasure since she durst not take it to chelsea as the royal officers were already in possession and the whole family were to depart on the ensuing day  stephen and giles returned safely to cheapside    chapter xxv  old haunts    o the oak and the birch and the bonny holly tree they flourish best at home in my own countree  when the absence of the barbarous token of the execution was discovered suspicion instantly fell on the more family and margaret her husband and her brother were all imprisoned  the brave lady took all upon herself and gave no names of her associates in the deed and as henry viii still sometimes had better moods all were soon released  but that night had given ambrose a terrible cough so that dennet kept him in bed two days  indeed he hardly cared to rise from it his whole nature health spirits and mind had been so cruelly strained and he was so listless so weak so incapable of rousing himself or turning to any fresh scheme of life that stephen decided on fulfilling a longcherished plan of visiting their native home and seeing their uncle who had as he had contrived to send them word settled down on a farm which he had bought with perronels savings near romsey  headley who was lingering till aldonza could leave her mistress and decide on any plan undertook to attend to the business and little giles to his great delight was to accompany them  so the brothers went over the old ground  they slept in the hostel at dogmersfield where the dragon mark and the badge of the armourers company had first appeared before them  they found the very tree where the alderman had been tied and beneath which spring lay buried while little giles gazed with ecstatic almost religious veneration and ambrose seemed to draw in new life with the fresh air of the heath now becoming rich with crimson bells  they visited hyde abbey and the wellclothed wellmounted travellers received a better welcome than had fallen to the lot of the hungry lads  they were shown the grave of old richard birkenholt in the cloister and stephen left a sum to be expended in masses for his behoof  they looked into st elizabeths college but the kind warden was dead and a trembling old man who looked at them through the wicket hoped they were not sent from the commissioners  for the visitation of the lesser religious houses was going on and st elizabeths was already doomed  stephen inquired at the white hart for father shoveller and heard that he had grown too old to perform the office of a bailiff and had retired to the parent abbey  the brothers therefore renounced their first scheme of taking silkstede in their way and made for romsey  there under the shadow of the magnificent nunnery they dined pleasantly by the waterside at the sign of bishop blaise patron of the woolcombers of the town and halted long enough to refresh ambrose who was equal to very little fatigue  it amused stephen to recollect how mighty a place he had once thought the little town  did mine host know master randall  what master randall of baddesley  he should think so  was not the good man or his good wife here every market day with a pleasant word for every one  men said he had had some good office about the court as steward or the likefor he was plainly conversant with great men though he made no boast  if these guests were kin of his they were welcome for his sake  so the brothers rode on amid the gorse and heather till they came to a broadspreading oak tree sheltering a farmhouse built in frames of heavy timber filled up with bricks set in zigzag patterns with a highpitched roof and tall chimneys  barns and stacks were near it and fields reclaimed from the heath were waving with corn just tinged with the gold of harvest  three or four cows of the tawny hue that looked so homelike to the brothers were being released from the stackyard after being milked and conducted to their field by a tall whitehaired man in a farmers smock with a little child perched on his shoulder who gave a loud jubilant cry at the sight of the riders  stephen pushing on began the question whether master randall dwelt there but it broke off half way into a cry of recognition on either side harrys an absolute shout  the lads the lads  wife wife tis our own lads  and as perronel more buxom and rosy than london had ever made her came forth from her dairy and there was a melee of greetings and stephen would have asked what homeless little one the pair had adopted he was cut short by an exulting laugh  no more adopted than thy giles there stephen  tis our own boy thomas randall yea and if he have come late he is the better loved though i trow perronel there will ever look on ambrose as her eldest son  and by my troth he needs good country diet and air cried perronel  thou hast had none to take care of thee ambrose  they have let thee pine and dwine over thy books  i must take thee in hand  tis what i brought him to thee for good aunt said stephen smiling  great was the interchange of news over the homely hearty meal  it was plain that no one could be happier or more prosperous in a humble way than the exjester and his wife and if anything could restore ambrose it would surely be the homely plenty and motherly care he found there  stephen heard another tale of his halfbrother  his wife had soon been disgusted by the loneliness of the verdurers lodge and was always finding excuses for going to southampton where she and her daughter had both caught the plague imported in some eastern merchandise and had died  the only son had turned out wild and wicked and had been killed in a broil which he had provoked  and john a brokendown man with no one to enjoy the wealth he had accumulated had given up his office as verdurer and retired to an estate which he had purchased on the skirts of the forest  stephen rode thither to see him and found him a dying man tyrannised over and neglected by his servants and having often bitterly regretted his hardness towards his young brothers  all that stephen did for him he received as tokens of pardon and it was not possible to leave him until after a fortnights watching he died in his brothers arms  he had made no will and ambrose thus inherited a property which made his future maintenance no longer an anxiety to his brother  he himself seemed to care very little for the matter  to be allowed to rest under perronels care to read his erasmus testament and attend mass on sundays at the little norman church seemed all that he wished  stephen tried to persuade him that he was young enough at thirtyfive to marry and begin life again on the fair woodland riverbordered estate that was his portion but he shook his head no stephen my work is over  i could only help my dear master and that is at an end  dean colet is gone sir thomas is gone what more have i to do here  old ties are broken old bonds severed crime and corruption were protested against in vain and now that judgment is beginning at the house of god i am thankful that i am not like to live to see it  perronel scolded and exhorted him and told him he would be stronger when the hot weather was over but ambrose only smiled and stephen saw a change in him even in this fortnight which justified his forebodings  stephen and his uncle found a trustworthy bailiff to manage the estate and ambrose remained in the house where he could now be no burthen  stephen was obliged to leave him and take home young giles who had he found become so completely a country lad enjoying everything to the utmost that he already declared that he would much rather be a yeoman and forester than an armourer and that he did not want to be apprenticed to that black forge  this again made ambrose smile with pleasure as he thought of the boy as keeping up the name of birkenholt in the forest  the one wish he expressed was that stephen would send down tibble steelman to be with him  for in truth they both felt that in london tib might at any time be laid hands on and suffer at smithfield for his opinions  the hope of being a comfort to ambrose was perhaps the only idea that could have counterbalanced the sense that he ought not to fly from martyrdom and as it proved the invitation came only just in time  three days after tibble had been despatched by the southampton carrier in charge of all the comforts dennet could put together bishop stokesleys grim soumpnour came to summon him to the bishops court and there could be little question that he would have courted the faggot and stake  but as he was gone out of reach no further inquiries were made after him  dennet had told her husband that she had been amazed to find how in spite of a very warm affection for her her husband and children her father hankered after the old name and grieved that he could not fulfil his old engagement to his cousin robert  giles headley had managed the business excellently during stephens absence had shown himself very capable and gained good opinions from all rubbing about in the world had been very good for him and she verily believed that nothing would make her father so happy as for them to offer to share the business with giles  she would on her part make aldonza welcome and had no fears of not agreeing with her  besidesif little giles were indeed to be heir to testside was not the way made clear  so thus it was  the alderman was very happy in the arrangement and giles headley had not forfeited his rights to be a freeman of london or a member of the armourers guild  he married aldonza at michaelmas and all went well and peacefully in the household dennet never quitted her father while he lived but stephen struggled through winter roads and floods and reached baddesley in time to watch his brother depart in peace his sorrow and indignation for his master healed by the sense of his martyrdom and his trust firm and joyful  if this be as it is dying of grief said hal randall surely it is a blessed way to die  a few winters later stephen and dennet left giles headley in sole possession of the dragon with their second son as an apprentice while they themselves took up the old forest life as master and mistress birkenholt of testside where they lived and died honoured and loved
