and received the benediction  in vain luis endeavored to persuade the devoted girl to withdraw   illustration     preface   so much has been written of late years touching the discovery of america that it would not be at all surprising should there exist a disposition in a certain class of readers to deny the accuracy of all the statements in this work some may refer to history with a view to prove that there never were such persons as our hero and heroine and fancy that by establishing these facts they completely destroy the authenticity of the whole book in answer to this anticipated objection we will state that after carefully perusing several of the spanish writersfrom cervantes to the translator of the journal of columbus the alpha and omega of peninsular literatureand after having read both irving and prescott from beginning to end we do not find a syllable in either of them that we understand to be conclusive evidence or indeed to be any evidence at all on the portions of our subject that are likely to be disputed until some solid affirmative proof therefore can be produced against us we shall hold our case to be made out and rest our claims to be believed on the authority of our own statements nor do we think there is any thing either unreasonable or unusual in this course as perhaps the greater portion of that which is daily and hourly offered to the credence of the american public rests on the same species of testimonywith the trifling difference that we state truths with a profession of fiction while the great moral caterers of the age state fiction with the profession of truth if any advantage can be fairly obtained over us in consequence of this trifling discrepancy we must submit  there is one point notwithstanding concerning which it may be well to be frank at once the narrative of the voyage to cathay has been written with the journal of the admiral before us or rather with all of that journal that has been given to the world through the agency of a very incompetent and meagre editor nothing is plainer than the general fact that this person did not always understand his author and in one particular circumstance he has written so obscurely as not a little to embarrass even a novelist whose functions naturally include an entire familiarity with the thoughts emotions characters and occasionally with the unknown fates of the subjects of his pen the nautical day formerly commenced at meridian and with all our native ingenuity and high professional prerogatives we have not been able to discover whether the editor of the journal has adopted that mode of counting time or whether he has condescended to use the more vulgar and irrational practice of landsmen it is our opinion however that in the spirit of impartiality which becomes an historian he has adopted both this little peculiarity might possibly embarrass a superficial critic but accurate critics being so very common we feel no concern on this head well knowing that they will be much more apt to wink at these minor inconsistencies than to pass over an error of the press or a comma with a broken tail as we wish to live on good terms with this useful class of our fellowcreatures we have directed the printers to misspell some eight or ten words for their convenience and to save them from headaches have honestly stated this principal difficulty ourselves  should the publicity which is now given to the consequences of commencing a day in the middle have the effect to induce the government to order that it shall in future with all american seamen commence at one of its ends something will be gained in the way of simplicity and the writing of novels will insomuch be rendered easier and more agreeable  as respects the minor characters of this work very little need be said every one knows that columbus had seamen in his vessels and that he brought some of the natives of the islands he had discovered back with him to spain the reader is now made much more intimately acquainted with certain of these individuals we will venture to say than he can be possibly by the perusal of any work previously written as for the subordinate incidents connected with the more familiar events of the age it is hoped they will be found so completely to fill up this branch of the subject as to render future investigations

scarcely less meritorious author from whom le sage has borrowed his immortal tale for our guides whether we confide in the graver legends of history or put our trust in the accounts of modern travellers the time has scarcely ever existed when the inns of spain were good or the roads safe these are two of the blessings of civilization which the people of the peninsula would really seem destined never to attain for in all ages we hear or have heard of wrongs done the traveller equally by the robber and the host if such are the facts today such also were the facts in the middle of the fifteenth century the period to which we desire to carry back the reader in imagination  at the commencement of the month of october in the year of our lord 1469 john of trastamara reigned in aragon holding his court at a place called zaragosa a town lying on the ebro the name of which is supposed to be a corruption of cæsar augustus and a city that has become celebrated in our own times under the more anglicised term of saragossa for its deeds in arms john of trastamara or as it was more usual to style him agreeably to the nomenclature of kings john ii was one of the most sagacious monarchs of his age but he had become impoverished by many conflicts with the turbulent or as it may be more courtly to say the libertyloving catalonians had frequently enough to do to maintain his seat on the throne possessed a partycolored empire that included within its sway besides his native aragon with its dependencies of valencia and catalonia sicily and the balearic islands with some very questionable rights in navarre by the will of his elder brother and predecessor the crown of naples had descended to an illegitimate son of the latter else would that kingdom have been added to the list the king of aragon had seen a long and troubled reign and at this very moment his treasury was nearly exhausted by his efforts to subdue the truculent catalans though he was nearer a triumph than he could then foresee his competitor the duke of lorraine dying suddenly only two short months after the precise period chosen for the commencement of our tale but it is denied to man to look into the future and on the 9th of the month just mentioned the ingenuity of the royal treasurer was most sorely taxed there having arisen an unexpected demand for a considerable sum of money at the very moment that the army was about to disband itself for the want of pay and the public coffers contained only the very moderate sum of three hundred enriques or henrysa gold coin named after a previous monarch and which had a value not far from that of the modern ducat or our own quarter eagle the matter however was too pressing to be deferred and even the objects of the war were considered as secondary to those connected with this suddenlyconceived and more private enterprise councils were held moneydealers were cajoled or frightened and the confidants of the court were very manifestly in a state of great and earnest excitement at length the time of preparation appeared to be passed and the instant of action arrived curiosity was relieved and the citizens of saragossa were permitted to know that their sovereign was about to send a solemn embassy on matters of high moment to his neighbor kinsman and ally the monarch of castile in 1469 henry also of trastamara sat upon the throne of the adjoining kingdom under the title of henry iv he was the grandson in the male line of the brother of john iis father and consequently a firstcousin once removed of the monarch of aragon notwithstanding this affinity and the strong family interests that might be supposed to unite them it required many friendly embassies to preserve the peace between the two monarchs and the announcement of that which was about to depart produced more satisfaction than wonder in the streets of the town  henry of castile though he reigned over broader and richer peninsular territories than his relative of aragon had his cares and troubles also he had been twice married having repudiated his first consort blanche of aragon to wed joanna of portugal a princess of a levity of character so marked as not only to bring great scandal on the court generally but to throw so much distrust on the birth of her only child a daughter as to push discontent to disaffection and eventually to deprive the infant itself of the rights of royalty henrys father like himself had been twice married and the issue of the second union was a son and a daughter alfonso and isabella the latter becoming subsequently illustrious under the double titles of the queen of castile and of the catholic the luxurious impotency of henry as a monarch had driven a portion of his subjects into open rebellion three years preceding that selected for our opening his brother alfonso had been proclaimed king in his stead and a civil war had raged throughout his provinces this war had been recently terminated by the death of alfonso when the peace of the kingdom was temporarily restored by a treaty in which henry consented to the setting aside of his own daughteror rather of the daughter of joanna of portugaland to the recognition of his halfsister isabella as the rightful heiress of the throne the last concession was the result of dire necessity and as might have been expected it led to many secret and violent measures with a view to defeat its objects among the other expedients adopted by the kingor it might be better to say by his favorites the inaction and indolence of the selfindulgent but kindhearted prince being proverbialwith a view to counteract the probable consequences of the expected accession of isabella were various schemes to control her will and guide her policy by giving her hand first to a subject with a view to reduce her power and subsequently to various foreign princes who were thought to be more or less suited to the furtherance of such schemes just at this moment indeed the marriage of the princess was one of the greatest objects of spanish prudence the son of the king of aragon was one of the suitors for the hand of isabella and most of those who heard of the intended departure of the embassy naturally enough believed that the mission had some connection with that great stroke of aragonese policy  isabella had the reputation of learning modesty discretion piety and beauty besides being the acknowledged heiress of so enviable a crown and there were many competitors for her hand among them were to be ranked french english and portuguese princes besides him of aragon to whom we have already alluded different favorites supported different pretenders struggling to effect their several purposes by the usual intrigues of courtiers and partisans while the royal maiden herself who was the object of so much competition and rivalry observed a discreet and womanly decorum even while firmly bent on indulging her most womanly and dearest sentiments her brother the king was in the south pursuing his pleasures and long accustomed to dwell in comparative solitude the princess was earnestly occupied in arranging her own affairs in a way that she believed would most conduce to her own happiness after several attempts to entrap her person from which she had only escaped by the prompt succor of the forces of her friends she had taken refuge in leon in the capital of which province or kingdom as it was sometimes called valladolid she temporarily took up her abode as henry however still remained in the vicinity of granada it is in that direction we must look for the route taken by the embassy  the cortège left saragossa by one of the southern gates early in the morning of a glorious autumnal day there was the usual escort of lances for this the troubled state of the country demanded bearded nobles well mailedfor few who offered an inducement to the plunderer ventured on the highway without this precaution a long train of sumpter mules and a host of those who by their guise were half menials and half soldiers the gallant display drew crowds after the horses heels and together with some prayers for success a vast deal of crude and shallow conjecture as is still the practice with the uninstructed and gossiping was lavished on the probable objects and results of the journey but curiosity has its limits and even the gossip occasionally grows weary and by the time the sun was setting most of the multitude had already forgotten to think and speak of the parade of the morning as the night drew on however the late pageant was still the subject of discourse between two soldiers who belonged to the guard of the western gate or that which opened on the road to the province of burgos these worthies were loitering away the hours in the listless manner common to men on watch and the spirit of discussion and of critical censure had survived the thoughts and bustle of the day  if don alonso de carbajal thinketh to ride far in that guise observed the elder of the two idlers he would do well to look sharp to his followers for the army of aragon never sent forth a more scurvilyappointed guard than that he hath this day led through the southern gate notwithstanding the glitter of housings and the clangor of trumpets we could have furnished lances from valencia more befitting a kings embassy i tell thee diego ay and worthier knights to lead them than these of aragon but if the king is content it ill becomes soldiers like thee and me to be dissatisfied  there are many who think roderique that it had been better to spare the money lavished in this courtly letterwriting to pay the brave men who so freely shed their blood in order to subdue the rebellious barcelans  this is always the way boy between debtor and creditor don john owes you a few maravedis and you grudge him every enrique he spends on his necessities i am an older soldier and have learned the art of paying myself when the treasury is too poor to save me the trouble  that might do in a foreign war when one is battling against the moor for instance but after all these catalans are as good christians as we are ourselves some of them are as good subjects and it is not as easy to plunder a countryman as to plunder an infidel  easier by twenty fold for the one expects it and like all in that unhappy condition seldom has any thing worth taking while the other opens his stores to you as freely as he does his heartbut who are these setting forth on the highway at this late hour  fellows that pretend to wealth by affecting to conceal it ill warrant you now roderique that there is not money enough among all those varlets to pay the laquais that shall serve them their boiled eggs tonight  by st iago my blessed patron whispered one of the leaders of a small cavalcade who with a single companion rode a little in advance of the others as if not particularly anxious to be too familiar with the rest and laughing lightly as he spoke yonder vagabond is nearer the truth than is comfortable we may have sufficient among us all to pay for an ollapodrida and its service but i much doubt whether there will be a dobla left when the journey shall be once ended  a low but grave rebuke checked this inconsiderate mirth and the party which consisted of merchants or traders mounted on mules as was evident by their appearance for in that age the different classes were easily recognized by their attire halted at the gate the permission to quit the town was regular and the drowsy and consequently surly gatekeeper slowly undid his bars in order that the travellers might pass  while these necessary movements were going on the two soldiers stood a little on one side coolly scanning the group though spanish gravity prevented them from indulging openly in an expression of the scorn that they actually felt for two or three jews who were among the traders the merchants moreover were of a better class as was evident by a follower or two who rode in their train in the garbs of menials and who kept at a respectful distance while their masters paid the light fee that it was customary to give on passing the gates after nightfall one of these menials capitally mounted on a tall spirited mule happened to place himself so near diego during this little ceremony that the latter who was talkative by nature could not refrain from having his say  prithee pepe commenced the soldier how many hundred doblas a year do they pay in that service of thine and how often do they renew that fine leathern doublet  the varlet or follower of the merchant who was still a youth though his vigorous frame and embrowned cheek denoted equally severe exercise and rude exposure started and reddened at this free inquiry which was enforced by a hand slapped familiarly on his knee and such a squeeze of the leg as denoted the freedom of the camp the laugh of diego probably suppressed a sudden outbreak of anger for the soldier was one whose manner indicated too much goodhumor easily to excite resentment  thy gripe is friendly but somewhat close comrade the young domestic mildly observed and if thou wilt take a friends counsel it will be never to indulge in too great familiarity lest some day it lead to a broken pate  by holy san pedroi should relish  it was too late however for his master having proceeded the youth pushed a powerful rowel into the flank of his mule and the vigorous animal dashed ahead nearly upsetting diego who was pressing hard on the pommel of the saddle by the movement  there is mettle in that boy exclaimed the goodnatured soldier as he recovered his feet i thought for one moment he was about to favor me with a visitation of his hand  thou art wrongand too much accustomed to be heedless diego answered his comrade and it had been no wonder had that youth struck thee to the earth for the indignity thou puttst upon him  ha a hireling follower of some cringing hebrew he dare to strike a blow at a soldier of the king  he may have been a soldier of the king himself in his day these are times when most of his frame and muscle are called on to go in harness i think i have seen that face before ay and that too where none of craven hearts would be apt to go  the fellow is a mere varlet and a younker that has just escaped from the hands of the women  ill answer for it that he hath faced both the catalan and the moor in his time young as he may seem thou knowest that the nobles are wont to carry their sons as children early into the fight that they may learn the deeds of chivalry betimes  the nobles repeated diego laughing in the name of all the devils roderique of what art thou thinking that thou likenest this knave to a young noble dost fancy him a guzman or a mendoza in disguise that thou speakest thus of chivalry  trueit doth indeed seem sillyand yet have i before met that frown in battle and heard that sharp quick voice in a rally by st iago de compostello i have it harkee diegoa word in thy ear  the veteran now led his more youthful comrade aside although there was no one near to listen to what he said and looking carefully round to make certain that his words would not be overheard he whispered for a moment in diegos ear  holy mother of god exclaimed the latter recoiling quite three paces in surprise and awe thou canst not be right roderique  i will place my souls welfare on it returned the other positively have i not often seen him with his visor up and followed him time and again to the charge  and he setting forth as a traders varlet nay i know not but as the servitor of a jew  our business diego is to strike without looking into the quarrel to look without seeing and to listen without hearing although his coffers are low don john is a good master and our anointed king and so we will prove ourselves discreet soldiers  but he will never forgive me that gripe of the knee and my foolish tongue i shall never dare meet him again  humphit is not probable thou ever wilt meet him at the table of the king and as for the field as he is wont to go first there will not be much temptation for him to turn back in order to look at thee  thou thinkest then he will not be apt to know me again  if it should prove so boy thou needst not take it in ill part as such as he have more demands on their memories than they can always meet  the blessed maria make thee a true prophetelse would i never dare again to appear in the ranks were it a favor i conferred i might hope it would be forgotten but an indignity sticks long in the memory  here the two soldiers moved away continuing the discourse from time to time although the elder frequently admonished his loquacious companion of the virtue of discretion  in the mean time the travellers pursued their way with a diligence that denoted great distrust of the roads and as great a desire to get on they journeyed throughout the night nor did there occur any relaxation in their speed until the return of the sun exposed them again to the observations of the curious among whom were thought to be many emissaries of henry of castile whose agents were known to be particularly on the alert along all the roads that communicated between the capital of aragon and valladolid the city in which his royal sister had then quite recently taken refuge nothing remarkable occurred however to distinguish this journey from any other of the period there was nothing about the appearance of the travellerswho soon entered the territory of soria a province of old castile where armed parties of the monarch were active in watching the passesto attract the attention of henrys soldiers and as for the more vulgar robber he was temporarily driven from the highways by the presence of those who acted in the name of the prince as respects the youth who had given rise to the discourse between the two soldiers he rode diligently in the rear of his master so long as it pleased the latter to remain in the saddle and during the few and brief pauses that occurred in the travelling he busied himself like the other menials in the duties of his proper vocation on the evening of the second day however about an hour after the party had left a hostelry where it had solaced itself with an ollapodrida and some sour wine the merry young man who has already been mentioned and who still kept his place by the side of his graver and more aged companion in the van suddenly burst into a fit of loud laughter and reining in his mule he allowed the whole train to pass him until he found himself by the side of the young menial already so particularly named the latter cast a severe and rebuking glance at his reputed master as he dropped in by his side and said with a sternness that ill comported with their apparent relations to each other  how now master nuñez what hath called thee from thy position in the van to this unseemly familiarity with the varlets in the rear  i crave ten thousand pardons honest juan returned the master still laughing though he evidently struggled to repress his mirth out of respect to the other but here is a calamity befallen us that outdoes those of the fables and legends of necromancy and knighterrantry the worthy master ferreras yonder who is so skilful in handling gold having passed his whole life in buying and selling barley and oats hath actually mislaid the purse which it would seem he hath forgotten at the inn we have quitted in payment of some very stale bread and rancid oil i doubt if there are twenty reals left in the whole party  and is it a matter of jest master nuñez returned the servant though a slight smile struggled about his mouth as if ready to join in his companions merriment that we are penniless thank heaven the burgo of osma cannot be very distant and we may have less occasion for gold and now master of mine let me command thee to keep thy proper place in this cavalcade and not to forget thyself by such undue familiarity with thy inferiors i have no farther need of thee and therefore hasten back to master ferreras and acquaint him with my sympathy and grief  the young man smiled though the eye of the pretended servant was averted as if he cared to respect his own admonitions while the other evidently sought a look of recognition and favor in another minute the usual order of the journey was resumed  as the night advanced and the hour arrived when man and beast usually betray fatigue these travellers pushed their mules the hardest and about midnight by dint of hard pricking they came under the principal gate of a small walled town called osma that stood not far from the boundary of the province of burgos though still in that of soria no sooner was his mule near enough to the gate to allow of the freedom than the young merchant in advance dealt sundry blows on it with his staff effectually apprising those within of his presence it required no strong pull of the reins to stop the mules of those behind but the pretended varlet now pushed ahead and was about to assume his place among the principal personages near the gate when a heavy stone hurled from the battlements passed so close to his head as vividly to remind him how near he might be to making a hasty journey to another world a cry arose in the whole party at this narrow escape nor were loud imprecations on the hand that had cast the missile spared the youth himself seemed the least disturbed of them all and though his voice was sharp and authoritative as he raised it in remonstrance it was neither angry nor alarmed  how now he said is this the way you treat peaceful travellers merchants who come to ask hospitality and a nights repose at your hands  merchants and travellers growled a voice from abovesay rather spies and agents of king henry who are ye speak promptly or ye may expect something sharper than stones at the next visit  tell me answered the youth as if disdaining to be questioned himselfwho holds this borough is it not the noble count of treviño  the very same señor answered he above with a mollified tone but what can a set of travelling traders know of his excellency and who art thou that speakest up as sharply and as proudly as if thou wert a grandee  i am ferdinand of trastamarathe prince of aragonthe king of sicily go bid thy master hasten to the gate  this sudden announcement which was made in the lofty manner of one accustomed to implicit obedience produced a marked change in the state of affairs the party at the gate so far altered their several positions that the two superior nobles who had ridden in front gave place to the youthful king while the group of knights made such arrangements as showed that disguise was dropped and each man was now expected to appear in his proper character it might have amused a close and philosophical observer to note the promptitude with which the young cavaliers in particular rose in their saddles as if casting aside the lounging mien of grovelling traders in order to appear what they really were men accustomed to the tourney and the field on the ramparts the change was equally sudden and great all appearance of drowsiness vanished the soldiers spoke to each other in suppressed but hurried voices and the distant tramp of feet announced that messengers were dispatched in various directions some ten minutes elapsed in this manner during which an inferior officer showed himself on the ramparts and apologized for a delay that arose altogether from the force of discipline and on no account from any want of respect at length a bustle on the wall with the light of many lanterns betrayed the approach of the governor of the town and the impatience of the young men below that had begun to manifest itself in halfuttered execrations was put under a more decent restraint for the occasion  are the joyful tidings that my people bring me true cried one from the battlements while a lantern was lowered from the wall as if to make a closer inspection of the party at the gate am i really so honored as to receive a summons from don ferdinand of aragon at this unusual hour  cause thy fellow to turn his lantern more closely on my countenance answered the king that thou mayst make thyself sure i will cheerfully overlook the disrespect count of treviño for the advantage of a more speedy admission  tis he exclaimed the noble i know those royal features which bear the lineaments of a long race of kings and that voice have i heard often rallying the squadrons of aragon in their onsets against the moor let the trumpets speak up and proclaim this happy arrival and open wide our gates without delay  this order was promptly obeyed and the youthful king entered osma by sound of trumpet encircled by a strong party of menatarms and with half of the awakened and astonished population at his heels  it is lucky my lord king said don andres de cabrera the young noble already mentioned as he rode familiarly at the side of don ferdinand that we have found these good lodgings without cost it being a melancholy truth that master ferreras hath negligently enough mislaid the only purse there was among us in such a strait it would not have been easy to keep up the character of thrifty traders much longer for while the knaves higgle at the price of every thing they are fond of letting their gold be seen  now that we are in thine own castile don andres returned the king smiling we shall throw ourselves gladly on thy hospitality well knowing that thou hast two most beautiful diamonds always at thy command  i sir king your highness is pleased to be merry at my expense although i believe it is just now the only gratification i can pay for my attachment for the princess isabella hath driven me from my lands and even the humblest cavalier in the aragonese army is not just now poorer than i what diamonds therefore can i command  report speaketh favorably of the two brilliants that are set in the face of the doña beatriz de bobadilla and i hear they are altogether at thy disposal or as much so as a noble maidens inclinations can leave them with a loyal knight  ah my lord king if indeed this adventure end as happily as it commenceth i may indeed look to your royal favor for some aid in that matter  the king smiled in his own sedate manner but the count de treviño pressing nearer to his side at that moment the discourse was changed that night ferdinand of aragon slept soundly but with the dawn he and his followers were again in the saddle the party quitted osma however in a manner very different from that in which it had approached its gate ferdinand now appeared as a knight mounted on a noble andalusian charger and all his followers had still more openly assumed their proper characters a strong body of lancers led by the count of treviño in person composed the escort and on the 9th of the month the whole cavalcade reached dueñas in leon a place quite near to valladolid the disaffected nobles crowded about the prince to pay their court and he was received as became his high rank and still higher destinies  here the more luxurious castilians had an opportunity of observing the severe personal discipline by which don ferdinand at the immature years of eighteen for he was scarcely older had succeeded in hardening his body and in stringing his nerves so as to be equal to any deeds in arms his delight was found in the rudest military exercises and no knight of aragon could better direct his steed in the tourney or in the field like most of the royal races of that period and indeed of this in despite of the burning sun under which he dwelt his native complexion was brilliant though it had already become embrowned by exposure in the chase and in the martial occupations of his boyhood temperate as a mussulman his active and wellproportioned frame seemed to be early indurating as if providence held him in reserve for some of its own dispensations that called for great bodily vigor as well as for deep forethought and a vigilant sagacity during the four or five days that followed the noble castilians who listened to his discourse knew not of which most to approve his fluent eloquence or a wariness of thought and expression which while they might have been deemed prematurely worldly and coldblooded were believed to be particular merits in one destined to control the jarring passions deep deceptions and selfish devices of men     chapter ii      leave to the nightingale her shady wood       a privacy of glorious

     wordsworth   while john of aragon had recourse to such means to enable his son to escape the vigilant and vindictive emissaries of the king of castile there were anxious hearts in valladolid awaiting the result with the impatience and doubt that ever attend the execution of hazardous enterprises among others who felt this deep interest in the movements of ferdinand of aragon and his companions were a few whom it has now become necessary to introduce to the reader  although valladolid had not then reached the magnificence it subsequently acquired as the capital of charles v it was an ancient and for the age a magnificent and luxurious town possessing its palaces as well as its more inferior abodes to the principal of the former the residence of john de viveroa distinguished noble of the kingdomwe must repair in imagination where companions more agreeable than those we have just quitted await us and who were then themselves awaiting with deep anxiety the arrival of a messenger with tidings from dueñas the particular apartment that it will be necessary to imagine had much of the rude splendor of the period united to that air of comfort and fitness that woman seldom fails to impart to the portion of any edifice that comes directly under her control in the year 1469 spain was fast approaching the termination of that great struggle which had already endured seven centuries and in which the christian and the mussulman contended for the mastery of the peninsula the latter had long held sway in the southern parts of leon and had left behind him in the palaces of this town some of the traces of his barbaric magnificence the lofty and fretted ceilings were not as glorious as those to be found further south it is true still the moor had been here and the name of veled vlidsince changed to valladoliddenotes its arabic connection in the room just mentioned and in the principal palace of this ancient townthat of john de viverowere two females in earnest and engrossing discourse both were young and though in very different styles both would have been deemed beautiful in any age or region of the earth one indeed was surpassingly lovely she had just reached her nineteenth yearan age when the female form has received its full development in that generous climate and the most imaginative poet of spaina country so renowned for beauty of form in the sexcould not have conceived of a person more symmetrical the hands feet bust and all the outlines were those of feminine loveliness while the stature without rising to a height to suggest the idea of any thing masculine was sufficient to ennoble an air of quiet dignity the beholder at first was a little at a loss to know whether the influence to which he submitted proceeded most from the perfection of the body itself or from the expression that the soul within imparted to the almost faultless exterior the face was in all respects worthy of the form although born beneath the sun of spain her lineage carried her back through a long line of kings to the gothic sovereigns and its frequent intermarriages with foreign princesses had produced in her countenance that intermixture of the brilliancy of the north with the witchery of the south that probably is nearest to the perfection of feminine loveliness  her complexion was fair and her rich locks had that tint of the auburn which approaches as near as possible to the more marked color that gives it warmth without attaining any of the latters distinctive hue her mild blue eyes says an eminent historian beamed with intelligence and sensibility in these indexes to the soul indeed were to be found her highest claims to loveliness for they bespoke no less the beauty within than the beauty without imparting to features of exquisite delicacy and symmetry a serene expression of dignity and moral excellence that was remarkably softened by a modesty that seemed as much allied to the sensibilities of a woman as to the purity of an angel to add to all these charms though of royal blood and educated in a court an earnest but meek sincerity presided over every look and thoughtas thought was betrayed in the countenanceadding the illumination of truth to the lustre of youth and beauty  the attire of this princess was simple for happily the taste of the age enabled those who worked for the toilet to consult the proportions of nature though the materials were rich and such as became her high rank a single cross of diamonds sparkled on a neck of snow to which it was attached by a short string of pearls and a few rings decked with stones of price rather cumbered than adorned hands that needed no ornaments to rivet the gaze such was isabella of castile in her days of maiden retirement and maiden pridewhile waiting the issues of those changes that were about to put their seal on her own future fortunes as well as on those of posterity even to our own times  her companion was beatriz de bobadilla the friend of her childhood and infancy and who continued to the last the friend of her prime and of her deathbed this lady a little older than the princess was of more decided spanish mien for though of an ancient and illustrious house policy and necessity had not caused so many foreign intermarriages in her race as had been required in that of her royal mistress her eyes were black and sparkling bespeaking a generous soul and a resolution so high that some commentators have termed it valor while her hair was dark as the ravens wing like that of her royal mistress her form exhibited the grace and loveliness of young womanhood developed by the generous warmth of spain though her stature was in a slight degree less noble and the outlines of her figure in about an equal proportion less perfect in short nature had drawn some such distinction between the exceeding grace and high moral charms that encircled the beauty of the princess and those which belonged to her noble friend as the notions of men had established between their respective conditions though considered singly as women either would have been deemed preeminently winning and attractive  at the moment we have selected for the opening of the scene that is to follow isabella fresh from the morning toilet was seated in a chair leaning lightly on one of its arms in an attitude that interest in the subject she was discussing and confidence in her companion had naturally produced while beatriz de bobadilla occupied a low stool at her feet bending her body in respectful affection so far forward as to allow the fairer hair of the princess to mingle with her own dark curls while the face of the latter appeared to repose on the head of her friend as no one else was present the reader will at once infer from the entire absence of castilian etiquette and spanish reserve that the dialogue they held was strictly confidential and that it was governed more by the feelings of nature than by the artificial rules that usually regulate the intercourse of courts  i have prayed beatriz that god would direct my judgment in this weighty concern said the princess in continuation of some previous observation and i hope i have as much kept in view the happiness of my future subjects in the choice i have made as my own  none shall presume to question it said beatriz de bobadilla for had it pleased you to wed the grand turk the castilians would not gainsay your wish such is their love  say rather such is thy love for me my good beatriz that thou fanciest this returned isabella smiling and raising her face from the others head our castilians might overlook such a sin but i could not pardon myself for forgetting that i am a christian beatriz i have been sorely tried in this matter  but the hour of trial is nearly passed holy maria what lightness of reflection and vanity and misjudging of self must exist in man to embolden some who have dared to aspire to become your husband you were yet a child when they betrothed you to don carlos a prince old enough to be your father and then as if that were not sufficient to warm castilian blood they chose the king of portugal for you and he might well have passed for a generation still more remote much as i love you doña isabella and my own soul is scarce dearer to me than your person and mind for nought do i respect you more than for the noble and princely resolution child as you then were with which you denied the king in his wicked wish to make you queen of portugal  don enriquez is my brother beatriz and thine and my royal master  ah bravely did you tell them all continued beatriz de bobadilla with sparkling eyes and a feeling of exultation that caused her to overlook the quiet rebuke of her mistress and worthy was it of a princess of the royal house of castile the infantas of castile you said could not be disposed of in marriage without the consent of the nobles of the realm and with that fit reply they were glad to be content  and yet beatriz am i about to dispose of an infanta of castile without even consulting its nobles  say not that my excellent mistress there is not a loyal and gallant cavalier between the pyrenees and the sea who will not in his heart approve of your choice the character and age and other qualities of the suitor make a sensible difference in these concerns but unfit as don alfonso of portugal was and is to be the wedded husband of doña isabella of castile what shall we say to the next suitor who appeared as a pretender to your royal handdon pedro giron the master of calatrava truly a most worthy lord for a maiden of the royal house out upon him a pachecho might think himself full honorably mated could he have found a damsel of bobadilla to elevate his race  that illassorted union was imposed upon my brother by unworthy favorites and god in his holy providence saw fit to defeat their wishes by hurrying their intended bridegroom to an unexpected grave  ay had it not pleased his blessed will so to dispose of don pedro other means would not have been wanting  this little hand of thine beatriz returned the princess gravely though she smiled affectionately on her friend as she took the hand in question was not made for the deed its owner menaced  that which its owner menaced replied beatriz with eyes flashing fire this hand would have executed before isabella of castile should be the doomed bride of the grand master of calatrava what was the purest loveliest virgin of castile and she of royal birthnay the rightful heiress of the crownto be sacrificed to a lawless libertine because it had pleased don henry to forget his station and duties and make a favorite of a craven miscreant  thou always forgettest beatriz that don enriquez is our lord the king and my royal brother  i do not forget señora that you are the royal sister of our lord the king and that pedro de giron or pachecho whichever it might suit the ancient portuguese page to style him was altogether unworthy to sit in your presence much less to become your wedded husband oh what days of anguish were those my gracious lady when your knees ached with bending in prayer that this might not be but god would not permit itneither would i that dagger should have pierced his heart before ear of his should have heard the vows of isabella of castile  speak no more of this good beatriz i pray thee said the princess shuddering and crossing herself they were in sooth days of anguish but what were they in comparison with the passion of the son of god who gave himself a sacrifice for our sins name it not then it was good for my soul to be thus tried and thou knowest that the evil was turned from memore i doubt not by the efficacy of our prayers than by that of thy dagger if thou wilt speak of my suitors surely there are others better worthy of the trouble  a light gleamed about the dark eye of beatriz and a smile struggled toward her pretty mouth for well did she understand that the royal but bashful maiden would gladly hear something of him on whom her choice had finally fallen although ever disposed to do that which was grateful to her mistress with a womans coquetry beatriz determined to approach the more pleasing part of the subject coyly and by a regular gradation of events in the order in which they had actually occurred  then there was monsieur de guienne the brother of king louis of france she resumed affecting contempt in her manner he would fain become the husband of the future queen of castile but even our most unworthy castilians soon saw the unfitness of that union their pride was unwilling to run the chance of becoming a fief of france  that misfortune could never have befallen our beloved castile interrupted isabella with dignity had i espoused the king of france himself he would have learned to respect me as the queen proprietor of this ancient realm and not have looked upon me as a subject  then señora continued beatriz looking up into isabellas face and laughingwas your own royal kinsman don ricardo of gloucester he that they say was born with teeth and who carries already a burthen so heavy on his back that he may well thank his patron saint that he is not also to be loaded with the affairs of castile1  footnote 1 notethe authorities differ as to which of the english princes was the suitor of isabella edward iv himself clarence or richard isabella was the granddaughter of catherine of lancaster who was a daughter of john of gaunt  thy tongue runneth riot beatriz they tell me that don ricardo is a noble and aspiring prince that he is one day likely to wed some princess whose merit may well console him for his failure in castile but what more hast thou to offer concerning my suitors  nay what more can i say my beloved mistress we have now reached don fernando literally the first as he proveth to be the last and as we know him to be the best of them all  i think i have been guided by the motives that become my birth and future hopes in choosing don ferdinand said isabella meekly though she was uneasy in spite of her royal views of matrimony since nothing can so much tend to the peace of our dear kingdom and to the success of the great cause of christianity as to unite castile and aragon under one crown  by uniting their sovereigns in holy wedlock returned beatriz with respectful gravity though a smile again struggled around her pouting lips what if don fernando is the most youthful the handsomest the most valiant and the most agreeable prince in christendom it is no fault of yours since you did not make him but have only accepted him for a husband  nay this exceedeth discretion and respect my good beatriz returned isabella affecting to frown even while she blushed deeply at her own emotions and looked gratified at the praises of her betrothed thou knowest that i have never beheld my cousin the king of sicily  very true señora but father alonso de coca hathand a surer eye or truer tongue than his do not exist in castile  beatriz i pardon thy license however unjust and unseemly because i know thou lovest me and lookest rather at mine own happiness than at that of my people said the princess the effect of whose gravity now was not diminished by any betrayal of natural feminine weaknessfor she felt slightly offended thou knowest or oughtst to know that a maiden of royal birth is bound principally to consult the interests of the state in bestowing her hand and that the idle fancies of village girls have little in common with her duties nay what virgin of noble extraction like thyself even would dream of aught else than of submitting to the counsel of her family in taking a husband if i have selected don fernando of aragon from among many princes it is doubtless because the alliance is more suited to the interests of castile than any other that hath offered thou seest beatriz that the castilians and the aragonese spring from the same source and have the same habits and prejudices they speak the same language  nay dearest lady do not confound the pure castilian with the dialect of the mountains  well have thy fling wayward one if thou wilt but we can easier teach the nobles of aragon our purer spanish than we can teach it to the gaul then don fernando is of my own race the house of trastamara cometh of castile and her monarchs and we may at least hope that the king of sicily will be able to make himself understood  if he could not he were no true knight the man whose tongue should fail him when the stake was a royal maiden of a beauty surpassing that of the dawnof an excellence that already touches on heavenof a crown  girl girl thy tongue is getting the mastery of theesuch discourse ill befitteth thee and me  and yet doña ysabel my tongue is close bound to my heart  i do believe thee my good beatriz but we should bethink us both of our last shrivings and of the ghostly counsel that we then received such nattering discourse seemeth light when we remember our manifold transgressions and our many occasions for forgiveness as for this marriage i would have thee think that it has been contracted on my part with the considerations and motives of a princess and not through any light indulgence of my fancies thou knowest that i have never beheld don fernando and that he hath never even looked upon me  assuredly dearest lady and honored mistress all this i know and see and believe and i also agree that it were unseemly and little befitting her birth for even a noble maiden to contract the allimportant obligations of marriage with no better motive than the light impulses of a country wench nothing is more just than that we are alike bound to consult our own dignity and the wishes of kinsmen and friends and that our duty and the habits of piety and submission in which we have been reared are better pledges for our connubial affection than any caprices of a girlish imagination still my honored lady it is most fortunate that your high obligations point to one as youthful brave noble and chivalrous as is the king of sicily as we well know by father alonsos representations to be the fact and that all my friends unite in saying that don andres de cabrera madcap and silly as he is will make an exceedingly excellent husband for beatriz de bobadilla  isabella habitually dignified and reserved as she was had her confidants and her moments for unbending and beatriz was the principal among the former while the present instant was one of the latter she smiled therefore at this sally and parting with her own fair hand the dark locks on the brow of her friend she regarded her much as the mother regards her child when sudden passages of tenderness come over the heart  if madcap should wed madcap thy friends at least have judged rightly answered the princess then pausing an instant as if in deep thought she continued in a graver manner though modesty shone in her telltale complexion and the sensibility that beamed in her eyes betrayed that she now felt more as a woman than as a future queen bent only on the happiness of her people as this interview draweth near i suffer an embarrassment i had not thought it easy to inflict on an infanta of castile to thee my faithful beatriz i will acknowledge that were the king of sicily as old as don alfonso of portugal or were he as effeminate and unmanly as monsieur of guienne were he in sooth less engaging and young i should feel less embarrassment in meeting him than i now experience  this is passing strange señora now i will confess that i would not willingly abate in don andres one hour of his life which has been sufficiently long as it is one grace of his person if indeed the honest cavalier hath any to boast of or one single perfection of either body or mind  thy case is not mine beatriz thou knowest the marquis of moya hast listened to his discourse and art accustomed to his praises and his admiration  holy st iago of spain do not distrust any thing señora on account of unfamiliarity with such mattersfor of all learning it is easiest to learn to relish praise and admiration  true daughterfor so isabella often termed her friend though her junior in later life and after the princess had become a queen this indeed was her usual term of endearmenttrue daughter when praise and admiration are freely given and fairly merited but i distrust myself my claims to be thus viewed and the feelings with which don fernando may first behold me i knownay i feel him to be graceful and noble and valiant and generous and good comely to the eye and strict of duty to our holy religion as illustrious in qualities as in birth and i tremble to think of my own unsuitableness to be his bride and queen  gods justicei should like to meet the impudent aragonese noble that would dare to hint as much as this if don fernando is noble are you not nobler señora as coming of the senior branch of the same house if he is young are you not equally so if he is wise are you not wiser if he is comely are you not more of an angel than a woman if he is valiant are you not virtuous if he is graceful are you not grace itself if he is generous are you not good and what is more are you not the very soul of generosity if he is strict of duty in matters of our holy religion are you not an angel  good soothgood soothbeatriz thou art a comforter i could reprove thee for this idle tongue but i know thee honest  this is no more than that deep modesty honored mistress which ever maketh you quicker to see the merits of others than to perceive your own let don fernando look to it though he come in all the pomp and glory of his many crowns i warrant you we find him a royal maiden in castile who shall abash him and rebuke his vanity even while she appears before him in the sweet guise of her own meek nature  i have said naught of don fernandos vanity beatriznor do i esteem him in the least inclined to so weak a feeling and as for pomp we well know that gold no more abounds at zaragosa than at valladolid albeit he hath many crowns in possession and in reserve notwithstanding all thy foolish but friendly tongue hath uttered i distrust myself and not the king of sicily methinks i could meet any other prince in christendom with indifferenceor at least as becometh my rank and sex but i confess i tremble at the thought of encountering the eyes and opinions of my noble cousin  beatriz listened with interest and when her royal mistress ceased speaking she kissed her hand affectionately and then pressed it to her heart  let don fernando tremble rather señora at encountering yours she answered  nay beatriz we know that he hath nothing to dread for report speaketh but too favorably of him but why linger here in doubt and apprehension when the staff on which it is my duty to lean is ready to receive its burthen father alonso doubtless waiteth for us and we will now join him  the princess and her friend now repaired to the chapel of the palace where her confessor celebrated the daily mass the selfdistrust which disturbed the feelings of the modest isabella was appeased by the holy rites or rather it took refuge on that rock where she was accustomed to place all her troubles with her sins as the little assemblage left the chapel one hot with haste arrived with the expected but still doubted tidings that the king of sicily had reached dueñas in safety and that as he was now in the very centre of his supporters there could no longer be any reasonable distrust of the speedy celebration of the contemplated marriage  isabella was much overcome with this news and required more than usual of the care of beatriz de bobadilla to restore her to that sweet serenity of mind and air which ordinarily rendered her presence as attractive as it was commanding an hour or two spent in meditation and prayer however finally produced a gentle calm in her feelings and these two friends were again alone in the very apartment where we first introduced them to the reader  hast thou seen don andres de cabrera demanded the princess taking a hand from a brow which had been often pressed in a sort of bewildered recollection  beatriz de bobadilla blushedand then she laughed outright with a freedom that the longestablished affection of her mistress did not rebuke  for a youth of thirty and a cavalier well hacked in the wars of the moors don andres hath a nimble foot she answered he brought hither the tidings of the arrival and with it he brought his own delightful person to show it was no lie for one so experienced he hath a strong propensity to talk and so in sooth while you my honored mistress would be in your closet alone i could but listen to all the marvels of the journey it seems señora that they did not reach dueñas any too soon for the only purse among them was mislaid or blown away by the wind on account of its lightness  i trust this accident hath been repaired few of the house of trastamara have much gold at this trying moment and yet none are wont to be entirely without it  don andres is neither beggar nor miser he is now in our castile where i doubt not he is familiar with the jews and moneylenders as these last must know the full value of his lands the king of sicily will not want i hear too that the count of treviño hath conducted nobly with him  it shall be well for the count of treviño that he hath had this liberality but beatriz bring forth the writing materials it is meet that i at once acquaint don enriquez with this event and with my purpose of marriage  nay dearest mistress this is out of all rule when a maiden gentle or simple intendeth marriage against her kinsmens wishes it is the way to wed first and to write the letter and ask the blessing when the evil is done  go to lightofspeech thou hast spoken now bring the pens and paper the king is not only my lord and sovereign but he is my nearest of kin and should be my father  and doña joanna of portugal his royal consort and our illustrious queen should be your mother and a fitting guide would she be to any modest virgin nonomy beloved mistress your royal mother was the doña isabella of portugaland a very different princess was she from this her wanton niece  thou givest thyself too much license doña beatriz and forgettest my request i desire to write to my brother the king  it was so seldom that isabella spoke sternly that her friend started and the tears rushed to her eyes at this rebuke but she procured the writing materials before she presumed to look into isabellas face in order to ascertain if she were really angered there all was beautiful serenity again and the lady of bobadilla perceiving that her mistresss mind was altogether occupied with the matter before her and that she had already forgotten her displeasure chose to make no further allusion to the subject  isabella now wrote her celebrated letter in which she appeared to forget all her natural timidity and to speak solely as a princess by the treaty of toros de guisando in which setting aside the claims of joanna of portugals daughter she had been recognized as the heiress of the throne it had been stipulated that she should not marry without the kings consent and she now apologized for the step she was about to take on the substantial plea that her enemies had disregarded the solemn compact entered into not to urge her into any union that was unsuitable or disagreeable to herself she then alluded to the political advantages that would follow the union of the crowns of castile and aragon and solicited the kings approbation of the step she was about to take this letter after having been submitted to john de vivero and others of her council was dispatched by a special messengerafter which act the arrangements necessary as preliminaries to a meeting between the betrothed were entered into castilian etiquette was proverbial even in that age and the discussion led to a proposal that isabella rejected with her usual modesty and discretion  it seemeth to me said john de vivero that this alliance should not take place without some admission on the part of don fernando of the inferiority of aragon to our own castile the house of the latter kingdom is but a junior branch of the reigning house of castile and the former territory of old was admitted to have a dependency on the latter  this proposition was much applauded until the beautiful and natural sentiments of the princess herself interposed to expose its weakness and its deformities  it is doubtless true she said that don juan of aragon is the son of the younger brother of my royal grandfather but he is none the less a king nay besides his crown of aragona country if thou wilt which is inferior to castilehe hath those of naples and sicily not to speak of navarre over which he ruleth although it may not be with too much right don fernando even weareth the crown of sicily by the renunciation of don juan and shall he a crowned sovereign make concessions to one who is barely a princess and whom it may never please god to conduct to a throne moreover don john of vivero i beseech thee to remember the errand that bringeth the king of sicily to valladolid both he and i have two parts to perform and two characters to maintainthose of prince and princess and those of christians wedded and bound by holy marriage ties it would ill become one that is about to take on herself the duties and obligations of a wife to begin the intercourse with exactions that should be humiliating to the pride and selfrespect of her lord aragon may truly be an inferior realm to castilebut ferdinand of aragon is even now every way the equal of isabella of castile and when he shall receive my vows and with them my duty and my affectionsisabellas color deepened and her mild eye lighted with a sort of holy enthusiasmas befitteth a woman though an infidel he would become in some particulars my superior let me then hear no more of this for it could not nearly as much pain don fernando to make the concessions ye require as it paineth me to hear of them     chapter iii       nice customs curtsy to great kings dear kate you and i      cannot be confined within the weak list of a countrys fashion      we are the makers of manners and the liberty that follows our      places stops the mouths of all faultfindershenry v   notwithstanding her high resolution habitual firmness and a serenity of mind that seemed to pervade the moral system of isabella like a deep quiet current of enthusiasm but which it were truer to assign to the high and fixed principles that guided all her actions her heart beat tumultuously and her native reserve which almost amounted to shyness troubled her sorely as the hour arrived when she was first to behold the prince she had accepted for a husband castilian etiquette no less than the magnitude of the political interests involved in the intended union had drawn out the preliminary negotiations several days the bridegroom being left all that time to curb his impatience to behold the princess as best he might  on the evening of the 15th of october 1469 however every obstacle being at length removed don fernando threw himself into the saddle and accompanied by only four attendants among whom was andres de cabrera he quietly took his way without any of the usual accompaniments of his high rank toward the palace of john of vivero in the city of valladolid the archbishop of toledo was of the faction of the princess and this prelate a warlike and active partisan was in readiness to receive the accepted suitor and to conduct him to the presence of his mistress  isabella attended only by beatriz de bobadilla was in waiting for the interview in the apartment already mentioned and by one of those mighty efforts that even the most retiring of the sex can make on great occasions she received her future husband with quite as much of the dignity of a princess as of the timidity of a woman ferdinand of aragon had been prepared to meet one of singular grace and beauty but the mixture of angelic modesty with a loveliness that almost surpassed that of her sex produced a picture approaching so much nearer to heaven than to earth that though one of circumspect behavior and much accustomed to suppress emotion he actually started and his feet were momentarily riveted to the floor when the glorious vision first met his eye then recovering himself he advanced eagerly and taking the little hand which neither met nor repulsed the attempt he pressed it to his lips with a warmth that seldom accompanies the first interviews of those whose passions are usually so factitious  this happy moment hath at length arrived my illustrious and beautiful cousin he said with a truth of feeling that went directly to the pure and tender heart of isabella for no skill in courtly phrases can ever give to the accents of deceit the point and emphasis that belong to sincerity i have thought it would never arrive but this blessed momentthanks to our own st iago whom i have not ceased to implore with intercessionsmore than rewards me for all anxieties  i thank my lord the prince and bid him right welcome modestly returned isabella the difficulties that have been overcome in order to effect this meeting are but types of the difficulties we shall have to conquer as we advance through life  then followed a few courteous expressions concerning the hopes of the princess that her cousin had wanted for nothing since his arrival in castile with suitable answers when don ferdinand led her to an armedchair assuming himself the stool on which beatriz de bobadilla was wont to be seated in her familiar intercourse with her royal mistress isabella however sensitively alive to the pretensions of the castilians who were fond of asserting the superiority of their own country over that of aragon would not quietly submit to this arrangement but declined to be seated unless her suitor would take the chair prepared for him also saying  it ill befitteth one who hath little more than some royalty of blood and her dependence on god to be thus placed while the king of sicily is so unworthily bestowed  let me entreat that it may be so returned the king all considerations of earthly rank vanish in this presence view me as a knight ready and desirous of proving his fealty in any court or field of christendom and treat me as such  isabella who had that high tact which teaches the precise point where breeding becomes neuter and airs commence blushed and smiled but no longer declined to be seated it was not so much the mere words of her cousin that went to her heart as the undisguised admiration of his looks the animation of his eye and the frank sincerity of his manner with a womans instinct she perceived that the impression she had made was favorable and with a womans sensibility her heart was ready under the circumstances to dissolve in tenderness at the discovery this mutual satisfaction soon opened the way to a freer conversation and ere half an hour was passed the archbishopwho though officially ignorant of the language and wishes of lovers was practically sufficiently familiar with bothcontrived to draw the two or three courtiers who were present into an adjoining room where though the door continued open he placed them with so much discretion that neither eye nor ear could be any restraint on what was passing as for beatriz de bobadilla whom female etiquette required should remain in the same room with her royal mistress she was so much engaged with andres de cabrera that half a dozen thrones might have been disposed of between the royal pair and she none the wiser  although isabella did not lose that mild reserve and feminine modesty that threw so winning a grace around her person even to the day of her death she gradually grew more calm as the discourse proceeded and falling back on her selfrespect womanly dignity and not a little on those stores of knowledge that she had been diligently collecting while others similarly situated had wasted their time in the vanities of courts she was quickly at her ease if not wholly in that tranquil state of mind to which she had been accustomed  i trust there can now be no longer any delay to the celebration of our union by holy church observed the king in continuation of the subject all that can be required of us both as those entrusted with the cares and interests of realms hath been observed and i may have a claim to look to my own happiness we are not strangers to each other doña isabella for our grandfathers were brothers and from infancy up have i been taught to reverence thy virtues and to strive to emulate thy holy duty to god  i have not betrothed myself lightly don fernando returned the princess blushing even while she assumed the majesty of a queen and with the subject so fully discussed the wisdom of the union so fully established and the necessity of promptness so apparent no idle delays shall proceed from me i had thought that the ceremony might be had on the fourth day from this which will give us both time to prepare for an occasion so solemn by suitable attention to the offices of the church  it must be as thou wiliest said the king respectfully bowing and now there remaineth but a few preparations and we shall have no reproaches of forgetfulness thou knowest doña isabella how sorely my father is beset by his enemies and i need scarce tell thee that his coffers are empty in good sooth my fair cousin nothing but my earnest desire to possess myself at as early a day as possible of the precious boon that providence and thy goodness  mingle not don fernando any of the acts of god and his providence with the wisdom and petty expedients of his creatures said isabella earnestly  to seize upon the precious boon then that providence appeared willing to bestow rejoined the king crossing himself while he bowed his head as much perhaps in deference to the pious feelings of his affianced wife as in deference to a higher powerwould not admit of delay and we quitted zaragosa better provided with hearts loyal toward the treasures we were to find in valladolid than with gold even that we had by a mischance hath gone to enrich some lucky varlet in an inn  doña beatriz de bobadilla hath acquainted me with the mishap said isabella smiling and truly we shall commence our married lives with but few of the goods of the world in present possession i have little more to offer thee fernando than a true heart and a spirit that i think may be trusted for its fidelity  in obtaining thee my excellent cousin i obtain sufficient to satisfy the desires of any reasonable man still something is due to our rank and future prospects and it shall not be said that thy nuptials passed like those of a common subject  under ordinary circumstances it might not appear seemly for one of my sex to furnish the means for her own bridal answered the princess the blood stealing to her face until it crimsoned even her brow and temples maintaining otherwise that beautiful tranquillity of mien which marked her ordinary mannerbut the wellbeing of two states depending on our union vain emotions must be suppressed i am not without jewels and valladolid hath many hebrews thou wilt permit me to part with the baubles for such an object  so that thou preservest for me the jewel in which that pure mind is encased said the king of sicily gallantly i care not if i never see another but there will not be this need for our friends who have more generous souls than wellfilled coffers too can give such warranty to the lenders as will procure the means i charge myself with this duty for henceforth my cousinmay i not say my betrothed  the term is even dearer than any that belongeth to blood fernando answered the princess with a simple sincerity of manner that set at nought the ordinary affectations and artificial feelings of her sex while it left the deepest reverence for her modestyand we might be excused for using it i trust god will bless our union not only to our own happiness but to that of our people  then my betrothed henceforth we have but a common fortune and thou wilt trust in me for the provision for thy wants  nay fernando answered isabella smiling imagine what we will we cannot imagine ourselves the children of two hidalgos about to set forth in the world with humble dowries thou art a king even now and by the treaty of toros de guisando i am solemnly recognized as the heiress of castile we must therefore have our separate means as well as our separate duties though i trust hardly our separate interests  thou wilt never find me failing in that respect which is due to thy rank or in that duty which it befitteth me to render thee as the head of our ancient house next to thy royal brother the king  thou hast well considered don fernando the treaty of marriage and accepted cheerfully i trust all of its several conditions  as becometh the importance of the measures and the magnitude of the benefit i was to receive  i would have them acceptable to thee as well as expedient for though so soon to become thy wife i can never cease to remember that i shall be queen of this country  thou mayest be assured my beautiful betrothed that ferdinand of aragon will be the last to deem thee aught else  i look on my duties as coming from god and on myself as one rigidly accountable to him for their faithful discharge sceptres may not be treated as toys fernando to be trifled with for man beareth no heavier burden than when he beareth a crown  the maxims of our house have not been forgotten in aragon my betrothedand i rejoice to find that they are the same in both kingdoms  we are not to think principally of ourselves in entering upon this engagement continued isabella earnestlyfor that would be supplanting the duties of princes by the feelings of the lover thou hast frequently perused and sufficiently conned the marriage articles i trust  there hath been sufficient leisure for that my cousin as they have now been signed these nine months  if i may have seemed to thee exacting in some particulars continued isabella with the same earnest and beautiful simplicity as usually marked her deportment in all the relations of lifeit is because the duties of a sovereign may not be overlooked thou knowest moreover fernando the influence that the husband is wont to acquire over the wife and wilt feel the necessity of my protecting my castilians in the fullest manner against my own weaknesses  if thy castilians do not suffer until they suffer from that cause doña isabella their lot will indeed be blessed  these are words of gallantry and i must reprove their use on an occasion so serious fernando i am a few months thy senior and shall assume an elder sisters rights until they are lost in the obligations of a wife thou hast seen in those articles how anxiously i would protect my castilians against any supremacy of the stranger thou knowest that many of the greatest of this realm are opposed to our union through apprehension of aragonese sway and wilt observe how studiously we have striven to appease their jealousies  thy motives doña isabella have been understood and thy wishes in this and all other particulars shall be respected  i would be thy faithful and submissive wife returned the princess with an earnest but gentle look at her betrothed but i would also that castile should preserve her rights and her independence what will be thy influence the maiden that freely bestoweth her hand need hardly say but we must preserve the appearance of separate states  confide in me my cousin they who live fifty years hence will say that don fernando knew how to respect his obligations and to discharge his duty  there is the stipulation too to war upon the moor i shall never feel that the christians of spain have been true to the faith while the follower of the archimposter of mecca remaineth in the peninsula  thou and thy archbishop could not have imposed a more agreeable duty than to place my lance in rest against the infidels my spurs have been gained in those wars already and no sooner shall we be crowned than thou wilt see my perfect willingness to aid in driving back the miscreants to their original sands  there remaineth but one thing more upon my mind gentle cousin thou knowest the evil influence that besets my brother and that it hath disaffected a large portion of his nobles as well as of his cities we shall both be sorely tempted to wage war upon him and to assume the sceptre before it pleaseth god to accord it to us in the course of nature i would have thee respect don enriquez not only as the head of our royal house but as my brother and anointed master should evil counsellors press him to attempt aught against our persons or rights it will be lawful to resist but i pray thee fernando on no excuse seek to raise thy hand in rebellion against my rightful sovereign  let don enriquez then be chary of his beltraneja answered the prince with warmth by st peter i have rights of mine own that come before those of that illgotten mongrel the whole house of trastamara hath an interest in stifling that spurious scion which hath been so fraudulently engrafted on its princely stock  thou art warm don fernando and even the eye of beatriz de bobadilla reproveth thy heat the unfortunate joanna never can impair our rights to the throne for there are few nobles in castile so unworthy as to wish to see the crown bestowed where it is believed the blood of pelayo doth not flow  don enriquez hath not kept faith with thee isabella since the treaty of toros de guisando  my brother is surrounded by wicked counsellorsand then fernandothe princess blushed crimson as she spokeneither have we been able rigidly to adhere to that convention since one of its conditions was that my hand should not be bestowed without the consent of the king  he hath driven us into this measure and hath only to reproach himself with our failure on this point  i endeavor so to view it though many have been my prayers for forgiveness of this seeming breach of faith i am not superstitious fernando else might i think god would frown on a union that is contracted in the face of pledges like these but it is well to distinguish between motives and we have a right to believe that he who readeth the heart will not judge the wellintentioned severely had not don enriquez attempted to seize my person with the plain purpose of forcing me to a marriage against my will this decisive step could not have been necessary and would not have been taken  i have reason to thank my patron saint beautiful cousin that thy will was less compliant than thy tyrants had believed  i could not plight my troth to the king of portugal or to monsieur de guienne or to any that they proposed to me for my future lord answered isabella ingenuously it ill befitted royal or noble maidens to set up their own inexperienced caprices in opposition to the wisdom of their friends and the task is not difficult for a virtuous wife to learn to love her husband when nature and opinion are not too openly violated in the choice but i have had too much thought for my soul to wish to expose it to so severe a trial in contracting the marriage duties  i feel that i am only too unworthy of thee isabellabut thou must train me to be that thou wouldst wish i can only promise thee a most willing and attentive scholar  the discourse now became more general isabella indulging her natural curiosity and affectionate nature by making many inquiries concerning her different relatives in aragon after the interview had lasted two hours or more the king of sicily returned to dueñas with the same privacy as he had observed in entering the town the royal pair parted with feelings of increased esteem and respect isabella indulging in those gentle anticipations of domestic happiness that more properly belong to the tender nature of woman  the marriage took place with suitable pomp on the morning of the 19th october 1469 in the chapel of john de viveros palace no less than two thousand persons principally of condition witnessing the ceremony just as the officiating priest was about to commence the offices the eye of isabella betrayed uneasiness and turning to the archbishop of toledo she said  your grace hath promised that there should be nothing wanting to the consent of the church on this solemn occasion it is known that don fernando of aragon and i stand within the prohibited degrees  most true my lady isabella returned the prelate with a composed mien and a paternal smile happily our holy father pius hath removed this impediment and the church smileth on this blessed union in every particular  the archbishop then took out of his pocket a dispensation which he read in a clear sonorous steady voice when every shade disappeared from the serene brow of isabella and the ceremony proceeded years elapsed before this pious and submissive christian princess discovered that she had been imposed on the bull that was then read having been an invention of the old king of aragon and the prelate not without suspicions of a connivance on the part of the bridegroom this deception had been practised from a perfect conviction that the sovereign pontiff was too much under the influence of the king of castile to consent to bestow the boon in opposition to that monarchs wishes it was several years before sixtus iv repaired this wrong by granting a more genuine authority  nevertheless ferdinand and isabella became man and wife what followed in the next twenty years must be rather glanced at than related henry iv resented the step and vain attempts were made to substitute his supposititious child la beltraneja in the place of his sister as successor to the throne a civil war ensued during which isabella steadily refused to assume the crown though often entreated limiting her efforts to the maintenance of her rights as heiress presumptive in 1474 or five years after her marriage don henry died and she then became queen of castile though her spurious niece was also proclaimed by a small party among her subjects the war of the succession as it was called lasted five years longer when joanna or la beltraneja assumed the veil and the rights of isabella were generally acknowledged about the same time died don john ii when ferdinand mounted the throne of aragon these events virtually reduced the sovereignties of the peninsula which had so long been cut up into petty states to four viz the possessions of ferdinand and isabella which included castile leon aragon valencia and many other of the finest provinces of spain navarre an insignificant kingdom in the pyrenees portugal much as it exists today and granada the last abidingplace of the moor north of the strait of gibraltar  neither ferdinand nor his royal consort was forgetful of that clause in their marriage contract which bound the former to undertake a war for the destruction of the moorish power the course of events however caused a delay of many years in putting this longprojected plan in execution but when the time finally arrived that providence which seemed disposed to conduct the pious isabella through a train of important incidents from the reduced condition in which we have just described her to have been to the summit of human power did not desert its favorite success succeeded successand victory victory until the moor had lost fortress after fortress town after town and was finally besieged in his very capitalhis last hold in the peninsula as the reduction of granada was an event that in christian eyes was to be ranked second only to the rescuing of the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels so was it distinguished by some features of singularity that have probably never before marked the course of a siege the place submitted on the 25th november 1491twentytwo years after the date of the marriage just mentioned and it may not be amiss to observe on the very day of the year that has become memorable in the annals of this country as that on which the english three centuries later reluctantly yielded their last foothold on the coast of the republic  in the course of the preceding summer while the spanish forces lay before the town and isabella with her children were anxious witnesses of the progress of events an accident occurred that had well nigh proved fatal to the royal family and brought destruction on the christian arms the pavillion of the queen took fire and was consumed placing the whole encampment in the utmost jeopardy many of the tents of the nobles were also destroyed and much treasure in the shape of jewelry and plate was lost though the injury went no further in order to guard against the recurrence of such an accident and probably viewing the subjection of granada as the great act of their mutual reignfor as yet time threw his veil around the future and but one human eye foresaw the greatest of all the events of the period which was still in reservethe sovereigns resolved on attempting a work that of itself would render this siege memorable the plan of a regular town was made and laborers set about the construction of good substantial edifices in which to lodge the army thus converting the warfare into that of something like city against city in three months this stupendous work was completed with its avenues streets and squares and received the name of santa fé or holy faithan appellation quite as well suited to the zeal which could achieve such a work in the heat of a campaign as to that general reliance on the providence of god which animated the christians in carrying on the war the construction of this place struck terror into the hearts of the moors for they considered it a proof that their enemies intended to give up the conflict only with their lives and it is highly probable that it had a direct and immediate influence on the submission of boabdil the king of granada who yielded the alhambra a few weeks after the spaniards had taken possession of their new abodes  santa fé still exists and is visited by the traveller as a place of curious origin while it is rendered remarkable by the factreal or assumedthat it is the only town of any size in spain that has never been under moorish sway  the main incidents of our tale will now transport us to this era and to this scene all that has been related as yet being merely introductory matter to prepare the reader for the events that are to follow  illustration     chapter iv      what thing a right line isthe learned know       but how availes that him who in the right     of life and manners doth desire to grow       what then are all these humane arts and lights     but seas of errors in whose depths who sound     of truth finde only shadowes and no ground      human learning   the morning of the 2d of january 1492 was ushered in with a solemnity and pomp that were unusual even in a court and camp as much addicted to religious observances and royal magnificence as that of ferdinand and isabella the sun had scarce appeared when all in the extraordinary little city of santa fé were afoot and elate with triumph the negotiations for the surrender of granada which had been going on secretly for weeks were terminated the army and nation had been formally apprised of their results and this was the day set for the entry of the conquerors  the court had been in mourning for don alonso of portugal the husband of the princess royal of castile who had died a bridegroom but on this joyous occasion the trappings of woe were cast aside and all appeared in their gayest and most magnificent apparel at an hour that was still early the grand cardinal moved forward ascending what is called the hill of martyrs at the head of a strong body of troops with a view to take possession while making the ascent a party of moorish cavaliers was met and at their head rode one in whom by the dignity of his mien and the anguish of his countenance it was easy to recognize the mental suffering of boabdil or abdallah the deposed monarch the cardinal pointed out the position occupied by ferdinand who with that admixture of piety and worldly policy which were so closely interwoven in his character had refused to enter within the walls of the conquered city until the symbol of christ had superseded the banners of mahomet and who had taken his station at some distance from the gates with a purpose and display of humility that were suited to the particular fanaticism of the period as the interview that occurred has often been related and twice quite recently by distinguished writers of our own country it is unnecessary to dwell on it here abdallah next sought the presence of the purerminded and gentle isabella where his reception with less affection of the character had more of the real charity and compassion of the christian when he went his way toward that pass in the mountains that has ever since been celebrated as the point where he took his last view of the palaces and towers of his fathers from which it has obtained the poetical and touching name of el ultimo suspiro del moro  although the passage of the last king of granada from his palace to the hills was in no manner delayed as it was grave and conducted with dignity it consequently occupied some time these were hours in which the multitude covered the highways and the adjacent fields were garnished with a living throng all of whom kept their eyes riveted on the towers of the alhambra where the signs of possession were anxiously looked for by every good catholic who witnessed the triumph of his religion  isabella who had made this conquest a condition in the articles of marriagewhose victory in truth it wasabstained with her native modesty from pressing forward on this occasion she had placed herself at some distance in the rear of the position of ferdinand stillunless indeed we except the longcoveted towers of the alhambrashe was the centre of attraction she appeared in royal magnificence as due to the glory of the occasion her beauty always rendered her an object of admiration her mildness inflexible justice and unyielding truth had won all hearts and she was really the person who was most to profit by the victory granada being attached to her own crown of castile and not to that of aragon a country that possessed little or no contiguous territory  previously to the appearance of abdallah the crowd moved freely in all directions multitudes of civilians having flocked to the camp to witness the entry among others were many friars priests and monksthe war indeed having the character of a crusade the throng of the curious was densest near the person of the queen where in truth the magnificence of the court was the most imposing around this spot in particular congregated most of the religious for they felt that the pious mind of isabella created a sort of moral atmosphere in and near her presence that was peculiarly suited to their habits and favorable to their consideration among others was a friar of prepossessing mien and in fact of noble birth who had been respectfully addressed as father pedro by several grandees as he made his way from the immediate presence of the queen to a spot where the circulation was easier he was accompanied by a youth of an air so much superior to that of most of those who did not appear that day in the saddle that he attracted general attention although not more than twenty it was evident from his muscular frame and embrowned but florid cheeks that he was acquainted with exposure and by his bearing many thought notwithstanding he did not appear in armor on an occasion so peculiarly military that both his mien and his frame had been improved by familiarity with war his attire was simple as if he rather avoided than sought observation but it was nevertheless such as was worn by none but the noble several of those who watched this youth as he reached the less confined portions of the crowd had seen him received graciously by isabella whose hand he had even been permitted to kiss a favor that the formal and fastidious court of castile seldom bestowed except on the worthy or on those at least who were unusually illustrious from their birth some whispered that he was a guzman a family that was almost royal while others thought that he might be a ponce a name that had got to be one of the first in spain through the deeds of the renowned marquisduke of cadiz in this very war while others again affected to discern in his lofty brow firm step and animated eye the port and countenance of a mendoza  it was evident that the subject of all these commentaries was unconscious of the notice that was attracted by his vigorous form handsome face and elastic lofty tread for like one accustomed to be observed by inferiors his attention was confined to such objects as amused his eye or pleased his fancy while he lent a willing ear to the remarks that from time to time fell from the lips of his reverend companion  this is a most blessed and glorious day for christianity observed the friar after a pause a little longer than common an impious reign of seven hundred years hath expired and the moor is at length lowered from his pride while the cross is elevated above the banners of the false prophet thou hast had ancestors my son who might almost arise from their tombs and walk the earth in exultation if the tidings of these changes were permitted to reach the souls of christians long since departed  the blessed maria intercede for them father that they may not be disturbed even to see the moor unhoused for i doubt much agreeable as the infidel hath made it if they find granada as pleasant as paradise  son don luis thou hast got much levity of speech in thy late journeyings and i doubt if thou art as mindful of thy paters and confessions as when under the care of thy excellent mother of sainted memory  this was not only said reprovingly but with a warmth that amounted nearly to anger  chide me not so warmly father for a lightness of speech that cometh of youthful levity rather than of disrespect for holy church nay thou rebukest warmly and then as i come like a penitent to lay my transgressions before thee and to seek absolution thou fastenest thine eye on vacancy and gazest as if one of the spirits of which thou so lately spokest actually had arisen and come to see the moor crack his heart strings at quitting his beloved alhambra  dost see that man luis demanded the friar still gazing in a fixed direction though he made no gesture to indicate to which particular individual of the many who were passing in all directions he especially alluded  by my veracity i see a thousand father though not one to fasten the eye as if he were fresh from paradise would it be exceeding discretion to ask who or what hath thus riveted thy gaze  dost see yonder person of high and commanding stature and in whom gravity and dignity are so singularly mingled with an air of poverty or if not absolutely of povertyfor he is better clad and seemingly in more prosperity now than i remember ever to have seen himstill evidently not of the rich and noble while his bearing and carriage would seem to bespeak him at least a monarch  i think i now perceive him thou meanest father a man of very grave and reverend appearance though of simple deportment i see nothing extravagant or illplaced either in his attire or in his bearing  i mean not that but there is a loftiness in his dignified countenance that one is not accustomed to meet in those who are unused to power  to me he hath the air and dress of a superior navigator or pilotof a man accustomed to the seasay he hath sundry symbols about him that bespeak such a pursuit  thou art right don luis for such is his calling he cometh of genoa and his name is christoval colon or as they term it in italy christoforo colombo  i remember to have heard of an admiral of that name who did good service in the wars of the south and who formerly led a fleet into the far east  this is not he but one of humbler habits though possibly of the same blood seeing that both are derived from the identical place this is no admiral though he would fain become oneay even a king  the man is then either of a weak mind or of a light ambition  he is neither in mind he hath outdone many of our most learned churchmen and it is due to his piety to say that a more devout christian doth not exist in spain it is plain son that thou hast been much abroad and little at court or thou wouldst have known the history of this extraordinary being at the mention of his name which has been the source of merriment for the frivolous and gay this many a year and which has thrown the thoughtful and prudent into more doubts than many a fierce and baneful heresy  thou stirrest my curiosity father by such language who and what is the man  an enigma that neither prayers to the virgin the learning of the cloisters nor a zealous wish to reach the truth hath enabled me to read come hither luis to this bit of rock where we can be seated and i will relate to thee the opinions that render this being so extraordinary thou must know son it is now seven years since this man first appeared among us he sought employment as a discoverer pretending that by steering out into the ocean on a western course for a great and unheardof distance he could reach the farther indies with the rich island of cipango and the kingdom of cathay of which one marco polo hath left us some most extraordinary legends  by st james of blessed memory the man must be short of his wits interrupted don luis laughing in what way could this thing be unless the earth were roundthe indies lying east and not west of us  that hath been often objected to his notions but the man hath ready answers to much weightier arguments  what weightier than this can be found our own eyes tell us that the earth is flat  therein he differeth from most menand to own the truth son luis not without some show of reason he is a navigator as thou wilt understand and he replies that on the ocean when a ship is seen from afar her upper sails are first perceived and that as she draweth nearer her lower sails and finally her hull cometh into view but thou hast been over sea and may have observed something of this  truly have i father while mounting the english sea we met a gallant cruiser of the kings and as thou saidst we first perceived her upper sail a white speck upon the water then followed sail after sail until we came nigh and saw her gigantic hull with a very goodly show of bombards and cannonsome twenty at least in all  then thou agreest with this colon and thinkest the earth round  by st george of england not i i have seen too much of the world to traduce its fair surface in so heedless a manner england france burgundy germany and all those distant countries of the north are just as level and flat as our own castile  why then didst thou see the upper sails of the englishman first  why fatherwhybecause they were first visible yes because they came first into view  do the english put the largest of their sails uppermost on the masts  they would be fools if they did though no great navigatorsour neighbors the portuguese and the people of genoa exceeding all others in that craftthough no great navigators the english are not so surpassingly stupid thou wilt remember the force of the winds and understand that the larger the sail the lower should be its position  then how happened it that thou sawest the smaller object before the larger  truly excellent fray pedro thou hast not conversed with this christoforo for nothing a question is not a reason  socrates was fond of questions son but he expected answers  peste as they say at the court of king louis i am not socrates my good father but thy old pupil and kinsman luis de bobadilla the truant nephew of the queens favorite the marchioness of moya and as wellborn a cavalier as there is in spainthough somewhat given to roving if my enemies are to be believed  neither thy pedigree thy character nor thy vagaries need be given to me don luis de bobadilla since i have known thee and thy career from childhood thou hast one merit that none will deny thee and that is a respect for truth and never hast thou more completely vindicated thy character in this particular than when thou saidst thou were not socrates  the worthy friars goodnatured smile as he made this sally took off some of its edge and the young man laughed as if too conscious of his own youthful follies to resent what he heard  but dear fray pedro lay aside thy government for once and stoop to a rational discourse with me on this extraordinary subject thou surely wilt not pretend that the earth is round  i do not go as far as some on this point luis for i see difficulties with holy writ by the admission still this matter of the sails much puzzleth me and i have often felt a desire to go from one port to another by sea in order to witness it were it not for the exceeding nausea that i ever feel in a boat i might attempt the experiment  that would be a worthy consummation of all thy wisdom exclaimed the young man laughing fray pedro de carrascal turned rover like his old pupil and that too astride a vagary but set thy heart at rest my honored kinsman and excellent instructor for i can save thee the trouble in all my journeyings by sea and by landand thou knowest that for my years they have been manyi have ever found the earth flat and the ocean the flattest portion of it always excepting a few turbulent and uneasy waves  no doubt it so seemeth to the eye but this colon who hath voyaged far more than thou thinketh otherwise he contendeth that the earth is a sphere and that by sailing west he can reach points that have been already attained by journeying east  by san lorenzo but the idea is a bold one doth the man really propose to venture out into the broad atlantic and even to cross it to some distant and unknown land  that is his very idea and for seven weary years hath he solicited the court to furnish him with the means nay as i hear he hath passed much more timeother seven years perhapsin urging his suit in different lands  if the earth be round continued don luis with a musing air what preventeth all the water from flowing to the lower parts of it how is it that we have any seas at all and if as thou hast hinted he deemeth the indies on the other side how is it that their people stand erectit cannot be done without placing the feet uppermost  that difficulty hath been presented to colon but he treateth it lightly indeed most of our churchmen are getting to believe that there is no up or down except as it relateth to the surface of the earth so that no great obstacle existeth in that point  thou wouldst not have me understand father that a man can walk on his headand that too with the noble member in the air by san francisco thy men of cathay must have talons like a cat or they would be falling quickly  whither luis  whither fray pedroto tophet or the bottomless pit it can never be that men walk on their heads heels uppermost with no better foundation than the atmosphere the caravels too must sail on their mastsand that would be rare navigation what would prevent the sea from tumbling out of its bed and falling on the devils fires and extinguishing them  son luis interrupted the monk gravely thy lightness of speech is carried too far but if thou so much deridest the opinion of this colon what are thine own notions of the formation of this earth that god hath so honored with his spirit and his presence  that it is as flat as the buckler of the moor i slew in the last sortie which is as flat as steel can hammer iron  dost thou think it hath limits  that do iand please heaven and doña mercedes de valverde i will see them before i die  then thou fanciest there is an edge or precipice at the four sides of the world which men may reach and where they can stand and look off as from an exceeding high platform  the picture doth not lose father for the touch of thy pencil i have never bethought me of this before and yet some such spot there must be one would think by san fernando himself that would be a place to try the metal of even don alonso de ojeda who might stand on the margin of the earth put his foot on a cloud and cast an orange to the moon  thou hast bethought thee little of any thing serious i fear luis but to me this opinion and this project of colon are not without merit i see but two serious objections to them one of which is the difficulty connected with holy writ and the other the vast and incomprehensible nay useless extent of the ocean that must necessarily separate us from cathay else should we long since have heard from that quarter of the world  do the learned favor the mans notions  the matter hath been seriously argued before a council held at salamanca where men were much divided upon it one serious obstacle is the apprehension that should the world prove to be round and could a ship even succeed in getting to cathay by the west there would be great difficulty in her ever returning since there must be in some manner an ascent and a descent i must say that most men deride this colon and i fear he will never reach his island of cipango as he doth not seem in the way even to set forth on the journey i marvel that he should now be here it having been said he had taken his final departure for portugal  dost thou say father that the man hath long been in spain demanded don luis gravely with his eye riveted on the dignified form of columbus who stood calmly regarding the gorgeous spectacle of the triumph at no great distance from the rock where the two had taken their seats  seven weary years hath he been soliciting the rich and the great to furnish him with the means of undertaking his favorite voyage  hath he the gold to prefer so long a suit  by his appearance i should think him poornay i know that he hath toiled for bread at the occupation of a mapmaker one hour he hath passed in arguing with philosophers and in soliciting princes while the next hath been occupied in laboring for the food that he hath taken for sustenance  thy description father hath whetted curiosity to so keen an edge that i would fain speak with this colon i see he remaineth yonder in the crowd and will go and tell him that i too am somewhat of a navigator and will extract from him a few of his peculiar ideas  and in what manner wilt thou open the acquaintance son  by telling him that i am don luis de bobadilla the nephew of the doña beatriz of moya and a noble of one of the best houses of castile  and this thou thinkest will suffice for thy purpose luis returned the friar smiling nonomy son this may do with most mapsellers but it will not effect thy wishes with yonder christoval colon that man is so filled with the vastness of his purposes is so much raised up with the magnitude of the results that his mind intently contemplateth day and night seemeth so conscious of his own powers that even kings and princes can in no manner lessen his dignity that which thou proposest don fernando our honored master might scarcely attempt and hope to escape without some rebuke of manner if not of tongue  by all the blessed saints fray pedro thou givest an extraordinary account of this man and only increasest the desire to know him wilt thou charge thyself with the introduction  most willingly for i wish to inquire what hath brought him back to court whence i had understood he lately went with the intent to go elsewhere with his projects leave the mode in my hands son luis and we will see what can be accomplished  the friar and his mercurial young companion now arose from their seats on the rock and threaded the throng taking the direction necessary to approach the man who had been the subject of their discourse and still remained that of their thoughts when near enough to speak fray pedro stopped and stood patiently waiting for a moment when he might catch the navigators eye this did not occur for several minutes the looks of colon being riveted on the towers of the alhambra where at each instant the signal of possession was expected to appear and luis de bobadilla who truant and errant and volatile and difficult to curb as he had proved himself to be never forgot his illustrious birth and the conventional distinctions attached to personal rank began to manifest his impatience at being kept so long dancing attendance on a mere mapseller and a pilot he in vain urged his companion to advance however but one of his own hurried movements at length drew aside the look of columbus when the eyes of the latter and of the friar met and being old acquaintances they saluted in the courteous manner of the age  i felicitate you señor colon on the glorious termination of this siege and rejoice that you are here to witness it as i had heard affairs of magnitude had called you to another country  the hand of god father is to be traced in all things you perceive in this success the victory of the cross but to me it conveyeth a lesson of perseverance and sayeth as plainly as events can speak that what god hath decreed must come to pass  i like your application señor as indeed i do most of your thoughts on our holy religion perseverance is truly necessary to salvation and i doubt not that a fitting symbol to the same may be found in the manner in which our pious sovereigns have conducted this war as well as in its glorious termination  true father and also doth it furnish a symbol to the fortunes of all enterprises that have the glory of god and the welfare of the church in view answered colon or columbus as the name has been latinized his eye kindling with that latent fire which seems so deeply seated in the visionary and the enthusiast it may seem out of reason to you to make such applications of these great events but the triumph of their highnesses this day marvellously encourageth me to persevere and not to faint in my own weary pilgrimage both leading to triumphs of the cross  since you are pleased to speak of your own schemes señor colon returned the friar ingenuously i am not sorry that the matter hath come up between us for here is a youthful kinsman of mine who hath been somewhat of a rover himself in the indulgence of a youthful fancy that neither friends nor yet love could restrain and having heard of your noble projects he is burning with a desire to learn more of them from your own mouth should it suit your condescension so to indulge him  i am always happy to yield to the praiseworthy wishes of the young and adventurous and shall cheerfully communicate to your young friend all he may desire to know answered columbus with a simplicity and dignity that at once put to flight all the notions of superiority and affability with which don luis had intended to carry on the conversation and which had the immediate effect to satisfy the young man that he was to be the obliged and honored party in the intercourse that was to follow but señor you have forgotten to give me the name of the cavalier  it is don luis de bobadilla a youth whose best claims to your notice perhaps are a most adventurous and roving spirit and the fact that he may call your honored friend the marchioness of moya his aunt  either would be sufficient father i love the spirit of adventure in the youthful for it is implanted no doubt by god in order that they may serve his allwise and beneficent designs and it is of such as these that my own chief worldly stay and support must be found then next to father juan perez de marchena and señor alonzo de quintanilla do i esteem doña beatriz among my fastest friends her kinsman therefore will be certain of my esteem and respect  all this sounded extraordinary to don luis for though the dress and appearance of this unknown stranger who even spoke the castilian with a foreign accent were respectable he had been told he was merely a pilot or navigator who earned his bread by toil and it was not usual for the noblest of castile to be thus regarded as it might be with a condescending favor by any inferior to those who could claim the blood and lineage of princes at first he was disposed to resent the words of the stranger then to laugh in his face but observing that the friar treated him with great deference and secretly awed by the air of the reputed projector he was not only successful in maintaining a suitable deportment but he made a proper and courteous reply such as became his name and breeding the three then retired together a little aloof from the thickest of the throng and found seats also on one of the rocks of which so many were scattered about the place  don luis hath visited foreign lands you say father said columbus who did not fail to lead the discourse like one entitled to it by rank or personal claims and hath a craving for the wonders and dangers of the ocean  such hath been either his merit or his fault señor had he listened to the wishes of doña beatriz or to my advice he would not have thrown aside his knightly career for one so little in unison with his training and birth  nay father you treat the youth with unmerited severity he who passeth a life on the ocean cannot be said to pass it in either an ignoble or a useless manner god separated different countries by vast bodies of water not with any intent to render their people strangers to each other but doubtless that they might meet amid the wonders with which he hath adorned the ocean and glorify his name and power so much the more we all have our moments of thoughtlessness in youtha period when we yield to our impulses rather than to our reason and as i confess to mine i am little disposed to bear too hard on señor don luis that he hath had his  you have probably battled with the infidel by sea señor colon observed the young man not a little embarrassed as to the manner in which he should introduce the subject he most desired  ay and by land too sonthe familiarity startled the young noble though he could not take offence at itand by land too the time hath been when i had a pleasure in relating my perils and escapes which have been numerous both from war and tempests but since the power of god hath awakened my spirit to mightier things that his will may be done and his word spread throughout the whole earth my memory ceaseth to dwell on them fray pedro crossed himself and don luis smiled and shrugged his shoulders as one is apt to do when he listens to any thing extravagant but the navigator proceeded in the earnest grave manner that appeared to belong to his character it is now very many years since i was engaged in that remarkable combat between the forces of my kinsman and namesake the younger colombo as he was called to distinguish him from his uncle the ancient admiral of the same name which took place not far north from cape st vincent on that bloody day we contended with the foevenetians richly ladenfrom morn till even and yet the lord carried me through the hot contest unharmed on another occasion the galley in which i fought was consumed by fire and i had to find my way to landno trifling distanceby the aid of an oar to me it seemeth that the hand of god was in this and that he would not have taken so signal and tender a care of one of his insignificant creatures unless to use him largely for his own honor and glory  although the eye of the navigator grew brighter as he uttered this and his cheek flushed with a species of holy enthusiasm it was impossible to confound one so grave so dignified so measured even in his exaggerations if such they were with the idle and lightminded who mistake momentary impulses for indelible impressions and passing vanities for the convictions that temper character fray pedro instead of smiling or in any manner betraying that he regarded the others opinions lightly devoutly crossed himself again and showed by the sympathy expressed in his countenance how much he entered into the profound religious faith of the speaker  the ways of god are often mysterious to his creatures said the friar but we are taught that they all lead to the exaltation of his name and to the glory of his attributes  it is so that i consider it father and with such views have i always regarded my own humble efforts to honor him we are but instruments and useless instruments too when we look at how little proceedeth from our own spirits and power  there cometh the blessed symbol that is our salvation and guide exclaimed the friar holding out both arms eagerly as if to embrace some distant object in the heavens immediately falling to his knees and bowing his shaven and naked head in deep humility to the earth  columbus turned his eyes in the direction indicated by his companions gestures and he beheld the large silver cross that the sovereigns had carried with them throughout the late war as a pledge of its objects glittering on the principal tower of the alhambra at the next instant the banners of castile and of st james were unfolded from other elevated places then came the song of triumph mingled with the chants of the church te deum was sung and the choirs of the royal chapel chanted in the open fields the praises of the lord of hosts a scene of magnificent religious pomp mingled with martial array followed that belongs rather to general history than to the particular and private incidents of our tale     chapter v      who hath not proved how feebly words essay     to fix one spark of beautys heavenly ray     who doth not feel until his failing sight     faints into dimness with its own delight     his changing cheek his sinking heart confess     the mightthe majesty of loveliness      byron   that night the court of castile and aragon slept in the palace of the alhambra as soon as the religious ceremony alluded to in the last chapter had terminated the crowd rushed into the place and the princes followed with a dignity and state better suited to their high character the young christian nobles accompanied by their wives and sistersfor the presence of isabella and the delay that attended the surrender had drawn together a vast many of the gentler sex in addition to those whose duty it was to accompany their royal mistresshurried eagerly through the celebrated courts and fretted apartments of this remarkable residence nor was curiosity appeased even when night came to place a temporary stay to its indulgence the court of the lions in particular a place still renowned throughout christendom for its remains of oriental beauty had been left by boabdil in the best condition and although it was midwinter by the aid of human art it was even then gay with flowers while the adjacent halls those of the two sisters and of abencerrages were brilliant with light and alive with warriors and courtiers dignified priests and luxuriant beauty  although no spanish eye could be otherwise than familiar with the light peculiar graces of moorish architecture these of the alhambra so much surpassed those of any other palace which had been erected by the mussulman dynasties of that part of the world that their glories struck the beholders with the freshness of novelty as well as with the magnificence of royalty the rich conceits in stucco an art of eastern origin then little understood in christendom the graceful and fanciful arabesqueswhich improved on by the fancies of some of the greatest geniuses the world ever saw have descended to our own times and got to be so familiar in europe though little known on this side of the atlanticdecorated the walls while brilliant fountains cast their waters into the air and fell in glittering spray resembling diamonds  among the throng that moved through this scene of almost magical beauty was beatriz de bobadilla who had long been the wife of don andres de cabrera and was now generally known as the marchioness of moya the constant near and confidential friend of the queen a character she retained until her royal mistress was numbered with the dead on her arm leaned lightly a youthful female of an appearance so remarkable that few strangers would have passed her without turning to take a second look at features and a countenance that were seldom seen and forgotten this was doña mercedes de valverde one of the noblest and richest heiresses of castile the relative ward and adopted daughter of the queens friendfavorite being hardly the term one would apply to the relation in which doña beatriz stood toward isabella it was not the particular beauty of doña mercedes however that rendered her appearance so remarkable and attractive for though feminine graceful of exquisite form and even of pleasing features there were many in that brilliant court who would generally be deemed fairer but no other maiden of castile had a countenance so illuminated by the soul within or no other female face habitually wore so deep an impression of sentiment and sensibility and the professed physiognomist would have delighted to trace the evidences of a deeplyseated earnest but unobtrusive enthusiasm which even cast a shade of melancholy over a face that fortune and the heart had equally intended should be sunny and serene serene it was notwithstanding the shadow that rested on it seeming to soften and render interesting its expression rather than to disturb its tranquillity or to cloud its loveliness  on the other side of the noble matron walked luis de bobadilla keeping a little in advance of his aunt in a way to permit his own dark flashing looks to meet whenever feeling and modesty would allow it the fine expressive blue eyes of mercedes the three conversed freely for the royal personages had retired to their private apartments and each group of passengers was so much entranced with the novelty of its situation and its own conversation as to disregard the remarks of others  this is a marvel luis observed doña beatriz in continuation of a subject that evidently much interested them all that thou a truant and a rover thyself should now have heard for the first time of this colon it is many years since he has been soliciting their highnesses for their royal aid in effecting his purposes the matter of his schemes was solemnly debated before a council at salamanca and he hath not been without believers at the court itself  among whom is to be classed doña beatriz de cabrera said mercedes with that melancholy smile that had the effect to bring out glimpses of all the deep but latent feeling that lay concealed beneath the surface i have often heard her highness declare that colon hath no truer friend in castile  her highness is seldom mistaken childand never in my heart i do uphold the man for to me he seemeth one fitted for some great and honorable undertaking and surely none greater hath ever been proposed or imagined by human mind than this he urgeth think of our becoming acquainted with the nations of the other side of the earth and of finding easy and direct means of communicating with them and of imparting to them the consolations of holy church  ay señora my aunt cried luis laughing and of walking in their delightful company with all our heels in the air and our heads downward i hope this colon hath not neglected to practice a little in the art for it will need some time to gain a sure foot in such circumstances he might commence on the sides of these mountains by way of a hornbook throwing the head boldly off at a rightangle after which the walls and towers of this alhambra would make a very pretty grammar or steppingstone to new progress  mercedes had unconsciously but fervently pressed the arm of her guardian as doña beatriz admitted her interest in the success of the great project but at this sally of don luis she looked serious and threw a glance at him that he himself felt to be reproachful to win the love of his aunts ward was the young mans most ardent wish and a look of dissatisfaction could at any moment repress that exuberance of spirits which often led him into an appearance of levity that did injustice to the really sterling qualities of both his heart and mind under the influence of that look then he was not slow to repair the wrong he had done himself by adding almost as soon as he had ceased to speak  the doña mercedes is of the discovering party too i see this colon appeareth to have had more success with the dames of castile than with her nobles  is it extraordinary don luis interrupted the pensivelooking girl that women should have more confidence in merit more generous impulses more zeal for god than men  it must be even so since you and my aunt doña beatriz side with the navigator but i am not always to be understood in the light i express myself mercedes now smiled but this time it was archlyi have never studied with the minstrels nor sooth to say deeply with the churchmen to be honest with you i have been much struck with this noble idea and if señor colon doth in reality sail in quest of cathay and the indies i shall pray their highnesses to let me be one of the party for now that the moor is subdued there remaineth little for a noble to do in spain  if thou shouldst really go on this expedition said doña beatriz with grave irony there will at least be one human being topsyturvy in the event of thy reaching cathay but yonder is an attendant of the court i doubt if her highness doth not desire my presence  the lady of moya was rightthe messenger coming to announce to her that the queen required her attendance the manners of the day and country rendered it unseemly that doña mercedes should continue her promenade accompanied only by don luis and the marchioness led the way to her own apartments where a saloon suitable to her rank and to her favor with the queen had been selected for her from among the numberless gorgeous rooms of the moorish kings even here the marchioness paused a moment in thought before she would leave her errant nephew alone with her ward  though a rover he is no troubadour and cannot charm thy ear with false rhymes it were better perhaps that i sent him beneath thy balcony with his guitar but knowing so well his dulness i will confide in it and leave him with thee for the few minutes that i shall be absent a cavalier who hath so strong a dislike to reversing the order of nature will not surely condescend to go on his knees even though it be to win a smile from the sweetest maiden in all castile  don luis laughed doña beatriz smiled as she kissed her ward and left the room while doña mercedes blushed and riveted her gaze on the floor luis de bobadilla was the declared suitor and sworn knight of mercedes de valverde but though so much favored by birth fortune affinity and figure there existed some serious impediments to his success in all that was connected with the considerations that usually decide such things the union was desirable but there existed nevertheless a strong influence to overcome in the scruples of doña beatriz herself highprincipled accustomed to the justminded views of her royal mistress and too proud to do an unworthy act the very advantages that a marriage with her ward offered to her nephew had caused the marchioness to hesitate don luis had little of the castilian gravity of characterand by many his animal spirits were mistaken for lightness of disposition and levity of thought his mother was a woman of a very illustrious french family and national pride had induced most observers to fancy that the son inherited a constitutional disposition to frivolity that was to be traced to the besetting weakness of a whole people a consciousness of his being so viewed at home had indeed driven the youth abroad and as like all observant travellers he was made doubly sensible of the defects of his own state of society on his return a species of estrangement had grown up between him and his natural associates that had urged the young man again and again to wander into foreign lands nothing indeed but his early and constantly increasing passion for mercedes had induced him to return a step that fortunately for himself he had last taken in time to assist in the reduction of granada notwithstanding these traits which in a country like castile might be properly enough termed peculiarities don luis de bobadilla was a knight worthy of his lineage and name his prowess in the field and in the tourney indeed was so very marked as to give him a high military character in despite of what were deemed his failings and he passed rather as an inconsiderate and unsafe young man than as one who was either debased or wicked martial qualities in that age in particular redeemed a thousand faults and don luis had even been known to unhorse in the tourney alonzo de ojeda then the most expert lance in spain such a man could not be despised though he might be distrusted but the feeling which governed his aunt referred quite as much to her own character as to his deeply conscientious while she understood her nephews real qualities much better than mere superficial observers she had her doubts about the propriety of giving the rich heiress who was entrusted to her care to so near a relative when all could not applaud the act she feared too that her own partiality might deceive her and that luis might in truth be the light and frivolous being he sometimes appeared to be in castilian eyes and that the happiness of her ward would prove the sacrifice of the indiscretion with these doubts then while she secretly desired the union she had in public looked coldly on her nephews suit and though unable without a harshness that circumstances would not warrant to prevent all intercourse she had not only taken frequent occasions to let mercedes understand her distrust but she had observed the precaution not to leave so handsome a suitor notwithstanding he was often domiciliated in her own house much alone with her ward  the state of mercedes feelings was known only to herself she was beautiful of an honorable family and an heiress and as human infirmities were as besetting beneath the stately mien of the fifteenth century as they are today she had often heard the supposed faults of don luis character sneered at by those who felt distrustful of his good looks and his opportunities few young females would have had the courage to betray any marked preference under such circumstances until prepared to avow their choice and to take sides with its subject against the world and the quiet but deep enthusiasm that prevailed in the moral system of the fair young castilian was tempered by a prudence that prevented her from running into most of its lighter excesses the forms and observances that usually surround young women of rank came in aid of this native prudence and even don luis himself though he had watched the countenance and emotions of her to whom he had so long urged his suit with a lovers jealousy and a lovers instincts was greatly in doubt whether he had succeeded in the least in touching her heart by one of those unlookedfor concurrences of circumstances that so often decide the fortunes of men whether as lovers or in more worldlyminded pursuits these doubts were now about to be unexpectedly and suddenly removed  the triumph of the christian arms the novelty of her situation and the excitement of the whole scene had aroused the feelings of mercedes from that coy concealment in which they usually lay smothered beneath the covering of maiden diffidence and throughout the evening her smile had been more open her eye brighter and her cheeks more deeply flushed than was usual even with one whose smiles were always sweet whose eyes were never dull and whose cheeks answered so sensitively to the varying impulses within  as his aunt quitted the room leaving him alone with mercedes for the first time since his return from his last ramble don luis eagerly threw himself on a stool that stood near the feet of his adored who placed herself on a sumptuous couch that twentyfour hours before had held the person of a princess of abdallahs family  much as i honor and reverence her highness the young man hurriedly commenced my respect and veneration are now increased tenfold would that she might send for my beloved aunt thrice where she now wants her services only once and may her presence become so necessary to her sovereign that the affairs of castile cannot go on without her counsel if so blessed an opportunity as this to tell you all i feel doña mercedes is to follow her obedience  it is not they who are most fluent of speech or the most vehement who always feel the deepest don luis de bobadilla  nor do they feel the least mercedes thou canst not doubt my love it hath grown with my growthincreased with each increase of my ideasuntil it hath got to be so interwoven with my mind itself that i can scarce use a faculty that thy dear image doth not mingle with it in all that is beautiful i behold thee if i listen to the song of a bird it is thy carol to the lute or if i feel the gentle south wind from the fragrant isles fanning my cheek i would fain think it thy sigh  you have dwelt so much among the light conceits of the french court don luis you appear to have forgotten that the heart of a castilian girl is too true and too sincere to meet such rhapsodies with favor  had don luis been older or more experienced in the sex he would have been flattered by this rebukefor he would have detected in the speakers manner both feeling of a gentler nature than her words expressed and a tender regret  if thou ascribest to me rhapsodies thou dost me great injustice i may not do credit to my own thoughts and feelings but never hath my tongue uttered aught to thee mercedes that the heart hath not honestly urged have i not loved thee since thou and i were children did i ever fail to show my preference for thee when we were boy and girl in all the sports and lighthearted enjoyments of that guileless period  guileless truly answered mercedes her look brightening as it might be with agreeable fancies and a flood of pleasant recollectionsdoing more in a single instant to break down the barriers of her reserve than years of schooling had effected toward building them up thou wert then at least sincere luis and i placed full faith in thy friendship and in thy desire to please  bless thee bless thee for these precious words mercedes for the first time in two years hast thou spoken to me as thou wert wont to do and called me luis without that courtly accursed don  a noble castilian should never regard his honors lightly and he oweth it to his rank to see that others respect them too answered our heroine looking down as if she already half repented of the familiarity you are quick to remind me of my forgetfulness don luis de bobadilla  this unlucky tongue of mine can never follow the path that its owner wisheth hast thou not seen in all my looksall my actsall my motivesa desire to please thee and thee alone lovely mercedes when her highness gave her royal approbation of my success in the last tourney did i not seek thine eye in order to ask if thou notedst it hast thou ever expressed a wish that i have not proved an eager desire to see it accomplished  nay now luis thou emboldenest me to remind thee that i expressed a wish that thou wouldst not go on thy last voyage to the north and yet thou didst depart i felt that it would displease doña beatriz thy truant disposition having made her uneasy lest thou shouldst get altogether into the habits of a rover and into disfavor with the queen  it was for this that thou madst the request and it wounded my pride to think that mercedes de valverde should so little understand my character as to believe it possible a noble of my name and lineage could so far forget his duties as to sink into the mere associate of pilots and adventurers  thou didst not know that i believed this of thee  hadst thou asked of me mercedes to remain for thy sakenay hadst thou imposed the heaviest services on me as thy knight or as one who enjoyed the smallest degree of thy favori would have parted with life sooner than i would have parted from castile but not even a look of kindness could i obtain in reward for all the pain i had felt on thy account  pain luis  is it not pain to love to the degree that one might kiss the earth that received the footprint of its objectand yet to meet with no encouragement from fair words no friendly glance of the eye nor any sign or symbol to betoken that the being one hath enshrined in his hearts core ever thinketh of her suitor except as a reckless rover and a hairbrained adventurer  luis de bobadilla no one that really knoweth thy character can ever truly think thus of thee  a million of thanks for these few words beloved girl and ten millions for the gentle smile that hath accompanied them thou mightst mould me to all thy wishes  my wishes don luis  to all thy severe opinions of sobriety and dignity of conduct wouldst thou but feel sufficient interest in me to let me know that my acts can give thee either pain or pleasure  can it be otherwise couldst thou luis see with indifference the proceedings of one thou hast known from childhood and esteemed as a friend  esteem blessed mercedes dost thou own even that little in my favor  it is not little luis to esteembut much they who prize virtue never esteem the unworthy and it is not possible to know thy excellent heart and manly nature without esteeming thee surely i have never concealed my esteem from thee or from any one else  hast thou concealed aught ah mercedes complete this heavenly condescension and admit that oneas lightly as thou wiltbut that one soft sentiment hath at times mingled with this esteem  mercedes blushed brightly but she would not make the oftensolicited acknowledgment it was some little time before she answered at all when she did speak it was hesitatingly and with frequent pauses as if she distrusted the propriety or the discretion of that which she was about to utter  thou hast travelled much and far luis she said and hast lost some favor on account of thy roving propensities why not regain the confidence of thy aunt by the very means through which it has been lost  i do not comprehend thee this is singular counsel to come from one like thee who art prudence itself  the prudent and discreet think well of their acts and words and are the more to be confided in thou seemest to have been struck with these bold opinions of the señor colon and while thou hast derided them i can see that they have great weight on thy mind  i shall henceforth regard thee with tenfold respect mercedes for thou hast penetrated deeper than my foolish affectation of contempt and all my light language and discovered the real feeling that lieth underneath ever since i have heard of this vast project it hath indeed haunted my imagination and the image of the genoese hath constantly stood beside thine dearest girl before my eyes if not in my heart i doubt if there be not some truth in his opinions so noble an idea cannot be wholly false  the fine full eye of mercedes was fastened intently on the countenance of don luis and its brilliancy increased as some of that latent enthusiasm which dwelt within kindled and began to glow at this outlet of the feelings of the soul  there is she answered solemnlythere must be truth in it the genoese hath been inspired of heaven with his sublime thoughts and he will live sooner or later to prove their truth imagine this earth fairly encircled by a ship the farthest east the land of the heathen brought in close communion with ourselves and the cross casting its shadows under the burning sun of cathay these are glorious heavenly anticipations luis and would it not be an imperishable renown to share in the honor of having aided in bringing about so great a discovery  by heaven i will see the genoese as soon as the morrows sun shall appear and offer to make one in his enterprise he shall not need for gold if that be his only want  thou speakest like a generous nobleminded fearless young castilian as thou art said mercedes with an enthusiasm that set at naught the usual guards of her discretion and her habits and as becometh luis de bobadilla but gold is not plenty with any of us at this moment and it will surpass the power of an ordinary subject to furnish that which will be necessary nor is it meet than any but sovereigns should send forth such an expedition as there may be vast territories to govern and dispose of should colon succeed my powerful kinsmanthe duke of medina celihath had this matter in close deliberation and he viewed it favorably as is shown by his letters to her highness but even he conceived it a matter too weighty to be attempted by aught but a crowned head and he hath used much influence with our mistress to gain her over to the opinion of the genoeses sagacity it is idle to think therefore of aiding effectually in this noble enterprise unless it be through their highnesses  thou knowest mercedes that i can do naught for colon with the court the king is the enemy of all who are not as wary cold and as much given to artifice as himself  luis thou art in his palacebeneath his roof enjoying his hospitality and protection at this very moment  not i answered the young man with warmththis is the abode of my royal mistress doña isabella granada being a conquest of castile and not of aragon touching the queen mercedes thou shalt never hear disrespectful word from me for like thyself she is all that is virtuous gentle and kind in woman but the king hath many of the faults of us corrupt and mercenary men thou canst not tell me of a young generous warmblooded cavalier even among his own aragonese who truly and confidingly loveth don fernando whilst all of castile adore the doña isabella  this may be true in part luis but it is altogether imprudent don fernando is a king and i fear me from the little i have seen while dwelling in a court that they who manage the affairs of mortals must make large concessions to their failings or human depravity will thwart the wisest measures that can be devised moreover can one truly love the wife and not esteem the husband to me it seemeth that the tie is so near and dear as to leave the virtues and the characters of a common identity  surely thou dost not mean to compare the modest piety the holy truth the sincere virtue of our royal mistress with the cautious wily policy of our scheming master  i desire not to make comparisons between them luis we are bound to honor and obey both and if doña isabella hath more of the confiding truth and pureheartedness of her sex than his highness is it not ever so as between man and woman  if i could really think that thou likenest me in any way with that managing and falsefaced king of aragon much as i love thee mercedes i would withdraw forever in pure shame  no one will liken thee luis to the falsetongued or the doublefaced for it is thy failing to speak truth when it might be better to say nothing as witness the present discourse and to look at those who displease thee as if ever ready to point thy lance and spur thy charger in their very teeth  my looks have been most unfortunate fair mercedes if they have left such memories in thee answered the youth reproachfully  i speak not in any manner touching myself for to me luis thou hast ever been gentle and kind interrupted the young castilian girl with a haste and earnestness that hurried the blood to her cheeks a moment afterward but solely that thou mayst be more guarded in thy remarks on the king  thou beganst by saying that i was a rover  nay i have used no such term of reproach don luis thy aunt may have said this but it could have been with no intent to wound i said that thou hadst travelled far and much  wellwelli merit the title and shall not complain of my honors thou saidst that i had travelled far and much and thou spokest approvingly of the project of this genoese am i to understand mercedes it is thy wish that i should make one of the adventurers  such was my meaning luis for i have thought it an emprise fitting thy daring mind and willing sword and the glory of success would atone for a thousand trifling errors committed under the heat and inconsideration of youth  don luis regarded the flushed cheek and brightened eyes of the beautiful enthusiast nearly a minute in silent but intense observation for the tooth of doubt and jealousy had fastened on him and with the selfdistrust of true affection he questioned how far he was worthy to interest so fair a being and had misgivings concerning the motive that induced her to wish him to depart  i wish i could read thy heart doña mercedes he at length resumed for while the witching modesty and coy reserve of thy sex serve but to bind us so much the closer in thy chains they puzzle the understanding of men more accustomed to rude encounters in the field than to the mazes of their ingenuity dost thou desire me to embark in an adventure that most men the wise and prudent don fernando at their headhe whom thou so much esteemest toolook upon as the project of a visionary and as leading to certain destruction did i think this i would depart tomorrow if it were only that my hated presence should never more disturb thy happiness  don luis you have no justification for this cruel suspicion said mercedes endeavoring to punish her lovers distrust by an affectation of resentment though the tears struggled through her pride and fell from her reproachful eyes you know that no one here or elsewhere hateth you you know that you are a general favorite though castilian prudence and castilian reserve may not always view your wandering life with the same applause as they give to the more attentive courtier and rigidly observant knight  pardon me dearest most beloved mercedes thy coldness and aversion sometime madden me  coldness aversion luis de bobadilla when hath mercedes de valverde ever shown either to thee  i fear that doña mercedes de valverde is even now putting me to some such proof  then thou little knowest her motives and ill appreciatest her heart no luis i am not averse and would not appear cold to thee if thy wayward feelings get so much the mastery and pain thee thus i will strive to be more plain yes rather than thou shouldst carry away with thee the false notion and perhaps plunge again into some unthinking seaadventure i will subdue my maiden pride and forget the reserve and caution that best become my sex and rank to relieve thy mind in advising thee to attach thyself to this colon and to enter freely into his noble schemes i had thine own happiness in view as thou hast time and again sworn to me thy happiness could only be secured  mercedes what meanest thou my happiness can only be secured by a union with thee  and thy union with me can only be secured by thy ennobling that besetting propensity to roving by some act of worthy renown that shall justify doña beatriz in bestowing her ward on a truant nephew and gain the favor of doña isabella  and thouwould this adventure win thee too to view me with kindness  luis if thou wilt know all i am won alreadynayrestrain this impetuosity and hear all i have to say even while i confess so much more than is seemly in a maiden thou art not to suppose i can further forget myself without the cheerful consent of my guardian and the gracious approbation of her highness i will wed no manno not even thee luis de bobadilla dear as i acknowledge thee to be to my heartthe ungovernable emotions of female tenderness caused the words to be nearly smothered in tearswould i wed without the smiles and congratulations of all who have a right to smile or weep for any of the house of valverde thou and i cannot marry like a village hind and village girl it is suitable that we stand before a prelate with a large circle of approving friends to grace our union ah luis thou hast reproached me with coldness and indifference to theesobs nearly stifled the generous girlbut others have not been so blindnay speak not but suffer me now that my heart is overflowing to unburden myself to thee entirely for i fear that shame and regret will come soon enough to cause repentance for what i now confessbut all have not been blind as thou our gracious queen well understandeth the female heart and that thou hast been so slow to discover she hath long seen and her quickness of eye and thought hath alone prevented me from saying to thee earlier a part at least of that which i now reluctantly confess  how is doña isabella too my enemy have i her highness scruples to overcome as well as those of my coldhearted and prudish aunt  luis thy intemperance causeth thee to be unjust doña beatriz of moya is neither coldhearted nor prudish but all that is the reverse a more generous or truer spirit never sacrificed self to friendship and her very nature is frankness and simplicity much of that i so love in thee cometh of her family and thou shouldst not reproach her for it as for her highness certes it is not needed that i should proclaim her qualities thou knowest that she is deemed the mother of her people that she regardeth the interests of all equally or so far as her knowledge will allow and that what she doth for any is ever done with true affection and a prudence that i have heard the cardinal say seemeth to be inspired by infinite wisdom  ay it is not difficult mercedes to seem prudent and benevolent and inspired with castile for a throne and leon with other rich provinces for a footstool  don luis if you would retain my esteem answered the singleminded girl with a gravity that had none of her sexs weakness in it though much of her sexs truthspeak not lightly of my royal mistress whatever she may have done in this matter hath been done with a mothers feelings and a mothers kindnessthy injustice maketh me almost to apprehend with a mothers wisdom  forgive me adored beloved mercedes a thousand times more adored and loved than ever now that thou hast been so generous and confiding but i cannot rest in peace until i know what the queen hath said and done in any thing that toucheth thee and me  thou knowest how kind and gracious the queen hath ever been to me luis and how much i have reason to be grateful for her many condescensions and favors i know not how it is but while thy aunt hath never seemed to detect my feelings and all those related to me by blood have appeared to be in the same darkness the royal eye hath penetrated a mystery that at the moment i do think was even concealed from myself thou rememberest the tourney that took place just before thou left us on thy last mad expedition  do i not was it not thy coldness after my success in that tourney and when i even wore thy favors that not only drove me out of spain but almost drove me out of the world  if the world could impute thy acts to such a cause all obstacles would at once be removed and we might be happy without further efforts but and mercedes smiled archly though with great tenderness in her voice and looks as she added i fear thou art much addicted to these fits of madness and that thou wilt never cease to wish to be driven to the uttermost limits of the world if not fairly out of it  it is in thy power to make me as stationary as the towers of this alhambra one such smile daily would chain me like a captive moor at thy feet and take away all desire to look at other objects than thy beauty but her highnessthou hast forgotten to add what her highness hath said and done  in that tourney thou wert conqueror luis the whole chivalry of castile was in the saddle that glorious day and yet none could cope with thee even alonzo de ojeda was unhorsed by thy lance and all mouths were filled with thy praises all memoriesperhaps it would be better to say that all memories but oneforgot thy failings  and that one was thine cruel mercedes  thou knowest better unkind luis that day i remembered nothing but thy noble generous heart manly bearing in the tiltyard and excellent qualities the more mindful memory was the queens who sent for me to her closet when the festivities were over and caused me to pass an hour with her in gentle affectionate discourse before she touched at all on the real object of her command she spoke to me luis of our duties as christians of our duties as females and most of all of the solemn obligations that we contract in wedlock and of the many pains that at best attend that honored condition when she had melted me to tears by an affection that equalled a mothers love she made me promiseand i confirmed it with a respectful vowthat i would never appear at the altar while she lived without her being present to approve of my nuptials or if prevented by disease or duty at least not without a consent given under her royal signature  by st denis of paris her highness endeavored to influence thy generous and pure mind against me  thy name was not even mentioned luis nor would it have been in any way concerned in the discourse had not my unbidden thoughts turned anxiously toward thee what her highness meditated i do not even now know but it was the manner in which my own sensitive feelings brought up thy image that hath made me perhaps idly fancy the effect might be to prevent me from wedding thee without doña isabellas consent but knowing as i well do her maternal heart and gentle affections how can i doubt that she will yield to my wishes when she knoweth that my choice is not really unworthy though it may seem to the severely prudent in some measure indiscreet  but thou thinkestthou feelest mercedes that it was in fear of me that her highness extorted the vow  i apprehended it as i have confessed with more readiness than became a maidens pride because thou wert uppermost in my mind then thy triumphs throughout the day and the manner in which thy name was in all mens mouths might well tempt the thoughts to dwell on thy person  mercedes thou canst not deny that thou believest her highness extorted that vow in dread of me  i wish to deny nothing that is true don luis and you are early teaching me to repent of the indiscreet avowal i have made that it was in dread of you that her highness spoke i do deny for i cannot think she has any such feelings toward you she was full of maternal affection for me and i think for i will conceal naught that i truly believe that apprehension of thy powers to please luis may have induced her to apprehend that an orphan girl like myself might possibly consult her fancy more than her prudence and wed one who seemed to love the uttermost limits of the earth so much better than his own noble castles and his proper home  and thou meanest to respect this vow  luis thou scarce reflectest on thy words or a question so sinful would not be put to me what christian maiden ever forgets her vows whether of pilgrimage penitence or performanceand why should i be the first to incur this disgraceful guilt besides had i not vowed the simple wish of the queen expressed in her own royal person would have been enough to deter me from wedding any she is my sovereign mistress and i might almost say mother doña beatriz herself scarce manifesting greater interest in my welfare now luis thou must listen to my suit although i see thou art ready to exclaim and protest and invoke but i have heard thee patiently some years and it is now my turn to speak and thine to listen i do not think the queen had thee in her mind on the occasion of that vow which was offered freely by me rather than extorted as thou seemest to think by her highness i do then believe that doña isabella supposed there might be a danger of my yielding to thy suit and that she had apprehensions that one so much given to roving might not bring or keep happiness in the bosom of a family but luis if her highness hath not done thy noble generous heart justice if she hath been deceived by appearances like most of those around her if she hath not known thee in short is it not thine own fault hast thou not been a frequent truant from castile and even when present hast thou been as attentive and assiduous in thy duties at court as becometh thy high birth and admitted claims it is true her highness and all others who were present witnessed thy skill in the tourney and in these wars thy name hath had frequent and honorable mention for prowess against the moor but while the female imagination yields ready homage to this manliness the female heart yearneth for other and gentler and steadier virtues at the fireside and in the circle within this doña isabella hath seen and felt and knoweth happy as hath been her own marriage with the king of aragon and is it surprising that she hath felt this concern for me no luis feeling hath made thee unjust to our royal mistress whom it is now manifestly thy interest to propitiate if thou art sincere in thy avowed desire to obtain my hand  and how is this to be done mercedes the moor is conquered and i know not that any knight would meet me to do battle for thy favor  the queen wisheth nothing of this sortneither do i we both know thee as an accomplished christian knight already and as thou hast just said there is no one to meet thy lance for no one hath met with the encouragement to justify the folly it is through this colon that thou art to win the royal consent  i believe i have in part conceived thy meaning but would fain hear thee speak more plainly  then i will tell thee in words as distinct as my tongue can utter them rejoined the ardent girl the tint of tenderness gradually deepening on her cheek to the flush of a holy enthusiasm as she proceeded thou knowest already the general opinions of the señor colon and the mode in which he proposeth to effect his ends i was still a child when he first appeared in castile to urge the court to embark in this great enterprise and i can see that her highness hath often been disposed to yield her aid when the coldness of don fernando or the narrowness of her ministers hath diverted her mind from the object i think she yet regardeth the scheme with favor for it is quite lately that colon who had taken leave of us all with the intent to quit spain and seek elsewhere for means was summoned to return through the influence of fray juan perez the ancient confessor of her highness he is now here as thou hast seen waiting impatiently for an audience and it needeth only to quicken the queens memory to obtain for him that favor should he get the caravels he asketh no doubt many of the nobles will feel a desire to share in an enterprise that will confer lasting honor on all concerned if successful and thou mightst make one  i know not how to regard this solicitude mercedes for it seemeth strange to wish to urge those we affect to value to enter on an expedition whence they may never return  god will protect thee answered the girl her face glowing with pious ardour the enterprise will be undertaken for his glory and his powerful hand will guide and shield the caravels  don luis de bobadilla smiled having far less religious faith and more knowledge of physical obstacles than his mistress he did full justice to her motives notwithstanding his hastily expressed doubts and the adventure was of a nature to arouse his constitutional love of roving and his desire for encountering dangers both he and mercedes well knew that he had fairly earned no small part of that distrust of his character which alone thwarted their wishes and quick of intellect he well understood the means and manner by which he was to gain doña isabellas consent the few doubts that he really entertained were revealed by the question that succeeded  if her highness is disposed to favor this colon he asked why hath the measure been so long delayed  this moorish war an empty treasury and the wary coldness of the king have prevented it  might not her highness look upon all the followers of the man as so many vain schemers should we return without success as will most likely be the caseif indeed we ever return  such is not doña isabellas character she will enter into this project in honor of god if she entereth into it at all and she will regard all who accompany colon voluntarily as so many crusaders well entitled to her esteem thou wilt not return unsuccessful luis but with such credit as will cause thy wife to glory in her choice and to be proud of thy name  thou art a most dear enthusiast beloved girl if i could take thee with me i would embark in the adventure with no other companion  a fitting reply was made to this gallant and at the moment certainly sincere speech after which the matter was discussed between the two with greater calmness and far more intelligibly don luis succeeded in restraining his impatience and the generous confidence with which mercedes gradually got to betray her interest in him and the sweet holy earnestness with which she urged the probability of success brought him at length to view the enterprise as one of lofty objects rather than as a scheme which flattered his love of adventure  doña beatriz left the lovers alone for quite two hours the queen requiring her presence all that time and soon after she returned her reckless roving indiscreet but noblehearted and manly nephew took his leave mercedes and her guardian however did not retire until midnight the former laying open her whole heart to the marchioness and explaining all her hopes as they were connected with the enterprise of colon doña beatriz was both gratified and pained by this confession while she smiled at the ingenuity of love in coupling the great designs of the genoese with the gratification of its own wishes still she was not displeased luis de bobadilla was the son of an only and muchbeloved brother and she had transferred to her nephew most of the affection she had felt for the father all who knew him indeed were fond of the handsome and gallant young cavalier though the prudent felt compelled to frown on his indiscretions and he might have chosen a wife at will from among the fair and highborn of castile with the few occasional exceptions that denote the circumspection and reserve of higher principles than common and a forethought that extends beyond the usual considerations of marriage the marchioness therefore was not an unwilling listener to her ward and ere they separated for the night the ingenuous but modest confessions the earnest eloquence and the tender ingenuity of mercedes had almost made a convert of doña beatriz     chapter vi      looke back who list unto the former ages       and call to count what is of them become     where be those learned wits and antique sages       which of all wisdom knew the perfect somme       where those great warriors which did overcome     the world with conquest of their might and maine     and made one meare of thearth and of their raigne      ruins of time   two or three days had passed before the christians began to feel at home in the ancient seat of mahommedan power by that time however the alhambra and the town got to be more regulated than they were during the hurry delight and grief of taking possession and departing and as the politic and far from illdisposed ferdinand had issued strict orders that the moors should not only be treated with kindness but with delicacy the place gradually settled down into tranquillity and men began to fall into their ancient habits and to interest themselves in their customary pursuits  don fernando was much occupied with new cares as a matter of course but his illustrious consort who reserved herself for great occasions exercising her ordinary powers in the quiet gentle manner that became her sex and native disposition her truth and piety had already withdrawn as far as her high rank and substantial authority would allow from the pageantry and martial scenes of a warlike court and was seeking with her wonted readiness the haunts of private affection and that intercourse which is most congenial to the softer affections of a woman her surviving children were with her and they occupied much of her maternal care but she had also many hours for friendship and for the indulgence of an affection that appeared to include all her subjects within the ties of family  on the morning of the third day that succeeded the evening of the interview related in the preceding chapter doña isabella had collected about her person a few of those privileged individuals who might be said to have the entrée to her more private hours for while that of castile was renowned among christian courts for etiquette habits that it had probably derived from the stately oriental usages of its mahommedan neighbors the affectionate nature of the queen had cast a halo around her own private circle that at once rendered it graceful as well as delightful to all who enjoyed the high honor of entering it at that day churchmen enjoyed a species of exclusive favor mingling with all the concerns of life and not unfrequently controlling them while we are quick to detect blemishes of this sort among foreign nations and are particularly prone to point out the evils that have flowed from the meddling of the romish divines we verify the truth of the venerable axiom that teaches us how much easier it is to see the faults of others than to discover our own for no people afford stronger evidences of the existence of this control than the people of the united states more especially that portion of them who dwell in places that were originally settled by religionists and which still continue under the influence of the particular sects that first prevailed and perhaps the strongest national trait that exists among us at this momentthat of a disposition to extend the control of society beyond the limits set by the institutions and the laws under the taking and plausible appellation of public opinionhas its origin in the polity of churches of a democratic character that have aspired to be an imperium in imperio confirmed and strengthened by their modes of government and by provincial habits be the fact as it may among ourselves there is no question of the ascendency of the catholic priesthood throughout christendom previously to the reformation and isabella was too sincerely devout too unostentatiously pious not to allow them every indulgence that comported with her own sense of right and among others that of a free access to her presence and an influence on all her measures  on the occasion just named among others who were present was fernando de talavera a prelate of high station who had just been named to the new dignity of archbishop of granada and the fray pedro de carrascal the former teacher of luis de bobadilla an unbeneficed divine who owed his favor to great simplicity of character aided by his high birth isabella herself was seated at a little table where she was employed with her needle the subject of her toil being a task as homely as a shirt for the king it being a part of her womanly propensities to acquit herself of this humble duty as scrupulously as if she had been the wife of a common tradesman of her own capital this was one of the habits of the age however if not a part of the policy of princes for most travellers have seen the celebrated saddle of the queen of burgundy with a place arranged for the distaff that when its owner rode forth she might set an example of thrift to her admiring subjects and with our own eyes in these luxurious times when few private ladies even condescend to touch any thing as useful as the garment that occupied the needle of isabella of castile we have seen a queen seated amid her royal daughters as diligently employed with the needle as if her livelihood depended on her industry but doña isabella had no affectations in feelings speech nature and acts she was truth itself and matrimonial tenderness gave her a deeply felt pleasure in thus being occupied for a husband whom she tenderly loved as a man while it was impossible she could entirely conceal from herself all his faults as a monarch near her sat the companion of her girlish days the longtried and devoted beatriz de cabrera mercedes occupied a stool at the feet of the infanta isabella while one or two other ladies of the household were placed at hand with such slight distinctions of rank as denoted the presence of royalty but with a domestic freedom that made these observances graceful without rendering them fatiguing the king himself was writing at a table in a distant corner of the vast apartment and no one the newlycreated archbishop not excepted presumed to approach that side of the room the discourse was conducted in a tone a little lower than common even the queen whose voice was always melody modulating its tones in a way not to interfere with the train of thought into which her illustrious consort appeared to be profoundly plunged but at the precise moment that we now desire to present to the reader isabella had been deeply lost in reflection for some time and a general silence prevailed in the female circle around the little worktables  daughtermarchionessfor so the queen usually addressed her frienddaughtermarchioness said isabella arousing herself from the long silence hath aught been seen or heard of late of the señor colon the pilot who hath so long urged us on the subject of this western voyage  the quick hurried glance of intelligence and gratification that passed between mercedes and her guardian betrayed the interest they felt in this question while the latter answered as became her duty and her respect for her mistress  you remember señora that he was written for by fray juan perez your highness ancient confessor who journeyed all the way from his convent of santa maria de rabida in andalusia to intercede in his behalf that his great designs might not be lost to castile  thou thinkest his designs then great daughtermarchioness  can any think them otherwise señora they seem reasonable and natural and if just is it not a great and laudable undertaking to extend the bounds of the church and to confer honor and wealth on ones own country my enthusiastic ward mercedes de valverde is so zealous in behalf of this navigators great project that next to her duty to her god and her duty to her sovereigns it seemeth to make the great concern of her life  the queen turned a smiling face toward the blushing girl who was the subject of this remark and she gazed at her for an instant with the expression of affection that was so wont to illuminate her lovely countenance when dwelling on the features of her own daughters  dost thou acknowledge this doña mercedes she said hath colon so convinced thee that thou art thus zealous in his behalf  mercedes arose respectfully when addressed by the queen and she advanced a step or two nearer to the royal person before she made any reply  it becometh me to speak modestly in this presence said the beautiful girl but i shall not deny that i feel deep concern for the success of the señor colon the thought is so noble señora that it were a pity it should not be just  this is the reasoning of the young and generousminded and i confess myself beatrice almost as childish as any on this matter at timescolon out of question is still here  indeed he is señora answered mercedes eagerly and with a haste she immediately repented for the inquiry was not made directly to herself i know of one who hath seen him as lately as the day the troops took possession of the town  who is that person asked the queen steadily but not severely her eye having turned again to the face of the girl with an interest that continued to increase as she gazed  mercedes now bitterly regretted her indiscretion and in spite of a mighty effort to repress her feelings the telltale blood mounted to her temples ere she could find resolution to reply  don luis de bobadilla señora the nephew of my guardian doña beatriz she at length answered for the love of truth was stronger in this purehearted young creature even than the dread of shame  thou art particular señorita isabella observed calmly severity seldom entering into her communication with the justminded and good don luis cometh of too illustrious a house to need a herald to proclaim his alliances it is only the obscure that the world doth not trouble itself about daughtermarchioness relieving mercedes from a state scarcely less painful than the rack by turning her eyes toward her friend this nephew of thine is a confirmed roverbut i doubt if he could be prevailed on to undertake an expedition like this of colons that hath in view the glory of god and the benefit of the realm  indeed señoramercedes repressed her zeal by a sudden and triumphant effort  thou wert about to speak doña mercedes gravely observed the queen  i crave your highness forgiveness it was improperly as your own words were not addressed to me  this is not the court of the queen of castile daughter but the private room of isabella de trastamara said the queen willing to lessen the effect of what had already passed thou hast the blood of the admiral of castile in thy veins and art even akin to our lord the king speak freely then  i know your gracious goodness to me señora and had nearly forgotten myself under its influence all i had to say was that don luis de bobadilla desireth exceedingly that the señor colon might get the caravels he seeketh and that he himself might obtain the royal permission to make one among the adventurers  can this be so beatriz  luis is a truant señora beyond a question but it is not with ignoble motives i have heard him ardently express his desire to be one of colons followers should that person be sent by your highness in search of the land of cathay  isabella made no reply but she laid her homely work in her lap and sat musing in pensive silence for several minutes during this interval none near her presumed to speak and mercedes retired stealthily to her stool at the feet of the infanta at length the queen arose and crossing the room she approached the table where don fernando was still busily engaged with the pen here she paused a moment as if unwilling to disturb him but soon laying a hand kindly on his shoulder she drew his attention to herself the king as if conscious whence such familiarity could alone proceed looked around immediately and rising from his chair he was the first to speak  these moriscoes need looking to he said betraying the direction that his thoughts had so early taken toward the increase of his poweri find we have left abdallah many strongholds in the apulxarras that may make him a troublesome neighbor unless we can push him across the mediterranean  of this fernando we will converse on some other opportunity interrupted the queen whose pure mind disliked every thing that even had an approach to a breach of faith it is hard enough for those who control the affairs of men always to obey god and their own consciences without seeking occasions to violate their faith i have come to thee on another matter the hurry of the times and the magnitude of our affairs have caused us to overlook the promise given to colon the navigator  still busied with thy needle isabella and for my comfort observed the king playing with the shirt that his royal consort had unconsciously brought in her hand few subjects have wives as considerate and kind as thou  thy comfort and happiness stand next to my duty to god and the care of my people returned isabella gratified at the notice the king of aragon had taken of this little homage of her sex even while she suspected that it came from a wish to parry the subject that was then uppermost in her thoughts i would do naught in this important concern without thy fullest approbation if that may be had and i think it toucheth our royal words to delay no longer seven years are a most cruel probation and unless we are active we shall have some of the hotblooded young nobles of the kingdom undertaking the matter as their holiday sports  thou sayst true señora and we will refer the subject at once to fernando de talavera yonder who is of approved discretion and one to be relied on as the king spoke he beckoned to the individual named who immediately approached the royal pair archbishop of granada continued the wily king who had as many politic arts as a modern patriot intently bent on his own advancementarchbishop of granada our royal consort hath a desire that this affair of colon should be immediately inquired into and reported on to ourselves it is our joint command that you and others take the matter before the next twentyfour hours shall pass into mature consideration and inquiry and that you lay the result before ourselves the names of your associates shall be given to you in the course of the day  while the tongue of ferdinand was thus instructing the prelate the latter read in the expression of the monarchs eye and in the coldness of his countenance a meaning that his quick and practiced wits were not slow in interpreting he signified his dutiful assent however received the names of his associates in the commission of whom isabella pointed out one or two and then waited to join in the discourse  this project of colons is worthy of being more seriously inquired into resumed the king when these preliminaries were settled and it shall be our care to see that he hath all consideration they tell me the honest navigator is a good christian  i think him devotedly so don fernando he hath a purpose should god prosper his present undertaking to join in a new effort to regain the holy sepulchre  umph such designs may be meritorious but ours is the true way to advance the faiththis conquest of our own we have raised the cross my wife where the ensigns of infidelity were lately seen and granada is so near castile that it will not be difficult to maintain our altars such at least are the opinions of a laymanholy prelateon these matters  and most just and wise opinions are they señor returned the archbishop that which can be retained it is wisest to seek for we lose our labors in gaining things that providence hath placed so far beyond our control that they do not seem designed for our purposes  there are those my lord archbishop observed the queen who might argue against all attempts to recover the holy sepulchre hearing opinions like these from so high authority  then señora they would misconceive that authority the politic prelate hurriedly replied it is well for all christendom to drive the infidels from the holy land but for castile it is better to dispossess them of granada the distinction is a very plain one as every sound casuist must admit  this truth is as evident to our reason added ferdinand casting a look of calm exultation out at a window as that yonder towers were once abdallahs and that they are now our own  better for castile repeated isabella in the tones of one who mused for her worldly power better perhaps but not better for the souls of those who achieve the deedsurely not better for the glory of god  my muchhonored wife and beloved consortsaid the king  señoraadded the prelate  but isabella walked slowly away pondering on principles while the eyes of the two worldings she left behind her met with the sort of freemasonry that is in much request among those who are too apt to substitute the expedient for the right the queen did not return to her seat but she walked up and down that part of the room which the archbishop had left vacant when he approached herself and her husband here she remained alone for several minutes even ferdinand holding her in too much reverence to presume to disturb her meditations uninvited the queen several times cast glances at mercedes and at length she commanded her to draw near  daughter said isabella who frequently addressed those she loved by this endearing term thou hast not forgotten thy freelyoffered vow  next to my duty to god señora i most consider my duty to my sovereign  mercedes spoke firmly and in those tones that seldom deceive isabella riveted her eyes on the pale features of the beautiful girl and when the words just quoted were uttered a tender mother could not have regarded a beloved child with stronger proofs of affection  thy duty to god overshadoweth all other feelings daughter as is just answered the queen thy duty to me is secondary and inferior still thou and all others owe a solemn duty to your sovereign and i should be unfit for the high trust that i have received from providence did i permit any of these obligations to lessen it is not i that reign in castile but providence through its humble and unworthy instrument my people are my children and i often pray that i may have heart enough to hold them all if princes are sometimes obliged to frown on the unworthy it is but in humble and distant imitation of that power which cannot smile on evil  i hope señora said the girl timidly observing that the queen paused i have not been so unfortunate as to displease you a frown from your highness would indeed be a calamity  thou no daughter i would that all the maidens of castile noble and simple were of thy truth and modesty and obedience but we cannot permit thee to become the victim of the senses thou art too well taught doña mercedes not to distinguish between that which is brilliant and that which is truly virtuous  señora cried mercedes eagerlythen checking herself immediately for she felt it was a disrespect to interrupt her sovereign  i listen to what thou wouldst say daughter isabella answered after pausing for the frightened girl to continue speak freely thou addressest a parent  i was about to say señora that if all that is brilliant is not virtuous neither is all that is unpleasant to the sight or what prudence might condemn actually vicious  i understand thee señorita and the remark hath truth in it now let us speak of other things thou appearest to be friendly to the designs of this navigator colon  the opinion of one untaught and youthful as i can have little weight with the queen of castile who can ask counsel of prelates and learned churchmen besides consulting her own wisdom mercedes modestly answered  but thou thinkest well of his project or have i mistaken thy meaning  no señora i do think well of colons scheme for to me it seemeth of that nobleness and grandeur that providence would favor for the good of man and the advancement of the church  and thou believest that nobles and cavaliers can be found willing to embark with this obscure genoese in his bold undertaking  the queen felt the hand that she affectionately held in both her own tremble and when she looked at her companion she perceived that her face was crimsoned and her eyes lowered but the generous girl thought the moment critical for the fortunes of her lover and she rallied all her energies in order to serve his interests  señora i do she answered with a steadiness that both surprised and pleased the queen who entered into and appreciated all her feelings i think don luis de bobadilla will embark with him since his aunt hath conversed freely with him on the nature and magnitude of the enterprise his mind dwelleth on little else he would be willing to furnish gold for the occasion could his guardians be made to consent  which any guardian would be very wrong to do we may deal freely with our own but it is forbidden to jeopard the goods of another if don luis de bobadilla persevere in this intention and act up to his professions i shall think more favorably of his character than circumstances have hitherto led me to do  señora  hear me daughter we cannot now converse longer on this point the council waiting my presence and the king having already left us thy guardian and i will confer together and thou shalt not be kept in undue suspense but mercedes de valverde  my lady the queen  remember thy vow daughter it was freely given and must not be hastily forgotten  isabella now kissed the pale cheek of the girl and withdrew followed by all the ladies leaving the halfpleased and yet halfterrified mercedes standing in the centre of the vast apartment resembling a beautiful statue of doubt  illustration     chapter vii      he that of such a height hath built his mind     and reared the dwelling of his thoughts so strong     as neither fear nor hope can shake the frame     of his resolved powers      daniel   the following day the alhambra was crowded with courtiers as usual applicants for favors those who sought their own and those who solicited the redress of imaginary wrongs the antechambers were thronged and the different individuals in waiting jealously eyed each other as if to inquire how far their neighbors would be likely to thwart their several views or to advance their wishes men bowed in general coldly and with distrust and the few that did directly pass their greetings met with the elaborated civility that commonly characterizes the intercourse of palaces  while curiosity was active in guessing at the business of the different individuals present and whispers nods shrugs of the shoulders and meaning glances passed among the old stagers as they communicated to each other the little they knew or thought they knew on different subjects there stood in the corner of the principal apartment one in particular who might be distinguished from all around him by his stature the gravity and dignity of his air and the peculiar sort of notice that he attracted few approached him and they that did as they turned their backs cast those glances of selfsufficiency and ridicule about them that characterize the vulgarminded when they fancy that they are deriding or sneering in consonance with popular opinion this was columbus who was very generally regarded by the multitude as a visionary schemer and who necessarily shared in that sort of contemptuous obloquy that attaches itself to the character but even the wit and jokes of the crowd had been expended upon this subject and the patience of those who danced attendance was getting to be exhausted when a little stir at the door announced the approach of some new courtier the manner in which the throng quickly gave way denoted the presence of some one of high rank and presently don luis de bobadilla stood in the centre of the room  it is the nephew of her highness favorite whispered one  a noble of one of the most illustrious families of castile said another but a fitting associate of this colon as neither the authority of his guardians the wishes of the queen nor his high station can keep him from the life of a vagabond  one of the best lances in spain if he had the prudence and wisdom to turn his skill to profit observed a third  that is the youthful knight who hath so well deported himself in this last campaign growled an inferior officer of the infantry and who unhorsed don alonso de ojeda in the tourney but his lance is as unsteady in its aim as it is good in the rest they tell me he is a rover  as if purposely to justify this character luis looked about him anxiously a moment and then made his way directly to the side of colon the smiles nods shrugs and halfsuppressed whispers that followed betrayed the common feeling but a door on the side of the closet opening all eyes were immediately bent in that direction and the little interruption just mentioned was as soon forgotten  i greet you señor said luis bowing respectfully to columbus since our discourse of last evening i have thought of little besides its subject and have come hither to renew it  that columbus was pleased by this homage appeared in his eye his smile and the manner in which he raised his body as if full of the grandeur of his own designs but he was compelled to defer the pleasure that it always gave him to dilate on his enterprise  i am commanded hither noble señor he answered cordially by the holy archbishop of granada who it seemeth hath it in charge from their highnesses to bring my affair to a speedy issue and who hath named this very morning for that purpose we touch upon the verge of great events the day is not distant when this conquest of granada will be forgotten in the greater importance of the mighty things that god hath held in reserve  by san pedro my new patron i do believe you señor cathay must lie at or near the spot you have named and your own eyes shall not see it and its gorgeous stories of wealth sooner than mine remember pedro de muños i pray you señor colon  he shall not be forgotten i promise you young lord and all the great deeds of your ancestors will be eclipsed by the glory achieved by their son but i hear my name called we will talk of this anon  el señor christoval colon was called by one of the pages in a loud authoritative voice and the navigator hurried forward buoyed up with hope and joy  the manner in which one so generally regarded with indifference if not with contempt had been selected from all that crowd of courtiers excited some surprise but as the ordinary business of the antechamber went on and the subordinates of office soon appeared in the rooms to hear solicitations and answer questions the affair was quickly forgotten luis withdrew disappointed for he had hoped to enjoy another long discourse with columbus on a subject which as it was connected with his dearest hopes now occupied most of his thoughts we shall leave him however and all in the antechambers to follow the great navigator further into the depths of the palace  fernando de talavera had not been unmindful of his orders instead however of associating with this prelate men known to be well disposed to listen to the propositions of columbus the king and queen had made the mistake of choosing some six or eight of their courtiers persons of probity and of good general characters but who were too little accustomed to learned research properly to appreciate the magnitude of the proposed discoveries into the presence of these distinguished nobles and churchmen was columbus now ushered and among them is the reader to suppose him seated we pass over the customary ceremonies of the introduction and proceed at once to the material part of the narrative the archbishop of granada was the principal speaker on the part of the commissioners  we understand señor colon continued the prelate should you be favored by their highnesses power and authority that you propose to undertake a voyage into the unknown atlantic in quest of the land of cathay and the celebrated island of cipango  that is my design holy and illustrious prelate the matter hath been so often up between the agents of the two sovereigns and myself that there is little occasion to enlarge on my views  these were fully discussed at salamanca of a verity where many learned churchmen were of your way of thinking señor though more were against it our lord the king and our lady the queen however are disposed to view the matter favorably and this commission hath been commanded that we might arrange all previous principles and determine the rights of the respective parties what force in vessels and equipments do you demand in order to achieve the great objects you expect under the blessing of god to accomplish  you have well spoken lord archbishop it will be by the blessing of god and under his especial care that all will be done for his glory and worship are involved in the success with so good an ally on my side little worldly means will be necessary two caravels of light burden are all i ask with the flag of the sovereigns and a sufficiency of mariners  the commissioners turned toward each other in surprise and while some saw in the moderate request the enthusiastic heedlessness of a visionary others detected the steady reliance of faith  that is not asking much truly observed the prelate who was among the first and though these wars have left us of castile with an exhausted treasury we could compass that little without the aid of a miracle the caravels might be found and the mariners levied but there are weighty points to determine before we reach that concession you expect señor to be intrusted with the command of the expedition in your own person  without that confidence i could not be answerable for success i ask the full and complete authority of an admiral or a seacommander of their highnesses the force employed will be trifling in appearance but the risks will be great and the power of the two crowns must completely sustain that of him on whose shoulders will rest the entire weight of the responsibility  this is but just and none will gainsay it but señor have you thought maturely on the advantages that are to accrue to the sovereigns should they sustain you in this undertaking  lord archbishop for eighteen years hath this subject occupied my thoughts and employed my studies both by day and by night in the whole of that long period have i done little that hath not had a direct bearing on the success of this mighty enterprise the advantages to all concerned that will flow from it have therefore scarce been forgotten  name them señor  first then as is due to his allseeing and omnipotent protection glory will be given to the almighty by the spreading of his church and the increase of his worshippers fernando de talavera and all the churchmen present piously crossed themselves an act in which columbus himself joined their highnesses as is meet will reap the next advantages in the extension of their empire and in the increase of their subjects wealth will flow in upon castile and aragon in a rapid stream his holiness freely granting to christian monarchs the thrones and territories of all infidel princes whose possessions may be discovered or people converted to the faith through their means  this is plausible señor returned the prelate and founded on just principles his holiness certainly is entrusted with that power and hath been known to use it for the glory of god you doubtless know señor colon that don john of portugal hath paid great attention to these matters already and that he and his predecessors have probably pushed discovery to the verge of its final limits his enterprise hath also obtained from rome certain privileges that may not be meddled with  i am not ignorant of the portuguese enterprise holy prelate nor of the spirit with which don john hath exercised his power his vessels voyage along the western shore of africa and in a direction altogether different from that i propose to take my purpose is to launch forth at once into the broad atlantic and by following the sun toward his place of evening retirement reach the eastern bounds of the indies by a road that will lessen the journey many months  although the archbishop and most of his coadjutors belonged to the numerous class of those who regarded columbus as a brainheated visionary the earnest but lofty dignity with which he thus simply touched upon his projects the manner in which he quietly smoothed down his white locks when he had spoken and the enthusiasm that never failed to kindle in his eye as he dwelt on his noble designs produced a deep impression on all present and there was a moment when the general feeling was to aid him to the extent of the common means it was a singular and peculiar proof of the existence of this transient feeling that one of the commissioners immediately inquired  do you propose señor colon to seek the court of prestor john  i know not noble señor that such a potentate hath even an existence answered columbus whose notions had got the fixed and philosophical bias that is derived from science and who entered little into the popular fallacies of the day though necessarily subject to much of the ignorance of the age i find nothing to establish the truth of there being such a monarch at all or such territories  this admission did not help the navigators cause for to affirm that the earth was a sphere and that prestor john was a creature of the imagination was abandoning the marvellous to fall back on demonstration and probabilitiesa course that the human mind in its uncultivated condition is not fond of taking  there are men who will be willing to put faith in the truth of prestor johns power and territories interrupted one of the commissioners who was indebted to his present situation purely to king ferdinands policy who will flatly deny that the earth is round since we all know that there are kings and territories and christians while we see that the earth and the ocean are plains  this opinion was received with an assenting smile by most present though fernando de talavera had doubts of its justice  señor answered columbus mildly if all in this world was in truth what it seemeth confessions would be little needed and penance would be much lighter  i esteem you a good christian señor colon observed the archbishop sharply  i am such as the grace of god and a weak nature have made me lord archbishop though i humbly trust that when i shall have achieved this great end that i may be deemed more worthy of the divine protection as well as of the divine favor  it hath been said that thou deemest thyself especially set apart by providence for this work  i feel that within me holy prelate that encourageth such a hope but i build naught on mysteries that exceed my comprehension  it would be difficult to say whether columbus lost or gained in the opinions of his auditors by this answer the religious feeling of the age was in perfect consonance with the sentiment but to the churchmen present it seemed arrogant in a humble and unknown layman even to believe it possible that he could be the chosen vessel when so many who appeared to have higher claims were rejected still no expression of this feeling was permitted for it was then as it is nowhe who seemed to rely on the power of god carrying with him a weight and an influence that ordinarily checked rebukes  you propose to endeavor to reach cathay by means of sailing forth into the broad atlantic resumed the archbishop and yet you deny the existence of prestor john  your pardon holy prelatei do propose to reach cathay and cipango in the mode you mention but i do not absolutely deny the existence of the monarch you have named for the probability of the success of my enterprise i have already produced my proofs and reasons which have satisfied many learned churchmen but evidence is wanting to establish the last  and yet giovanni di montecorvino a pious bishop of our holy church is said to have converted such a prince to the true faith nearly two centuries since  the power of god can do any thing lord archbishop and i am not one to question the merits of his chosen ministers all i can answer on this point is to say that i find no scientific or plausible reasons to justify me in pursuing what may prove to be as deceptive as the light which recedes before the hand that would touch it as for cathay and its position and its wonders we have the better established evidence of the renowned venetians marco and nicolo polo who not only travelled in those territories but sojourned years at the court of their monarch but noble gentlemen whether there is a prestor john or a cathay there is certainly a limit to the western side of the atlantic and that limit i am ready to seek  the archbishop betrayed his incredulity in the upward turn of his eyes but having his commands from those who were accustomed to be obeyed and knowing that the theory of columbus had been gravely heard and reported on years before at salamanca he determined prudently to keep within his proper sphere and to proceed at once to that into which it was his duty to inquire  you have set forth the advantages that you think may be derived to the sovereigns should your project succeed señor he said and truly they are not light if all your brilliant hopes may be realized but it now remaineth to know what conditions you reserve for yourself as the reward of all your risks and many years of anxious labor  all that hath been duly considered illustrious archbishop and you will find the substance of my wishes set forth in this paper though many of the smaller provisions will remain to be enumerated  as columbus spoke he handed the paper in question to ferdinand of talavera the prelate ran his eyes over it hastily at first but a second time with more deliberation and it would be difficult to say whether ridicule or indignation was most strongly expressed in his countenance as he deridingly threw the document on a table when this act of contempt was performed he turned toward columbus as if to satisfy himself that the navigator was not mad  art thou serious in demanding these terms señor he asked sternly and with a look that would have caused most men in the humble station of the applicant to swerve from their purpose  lord archbishop answered columbus with a dignity that was not easily disturbed this matter hath now occupied my mind quite eighteen years during the whole of this long period i have thought seriously of little else and it may be said to have engaged my mind sleeping and waking i saw the truth early and intensely but every day seems to bring it brighter and brighter before my eyes i feel a reliance on success that cometh from dependence on god i think myself an agent chosen for the accomplishment of great ends and ends that will not be decided by the success of this one enterprise there is more beyond and i must retain the dignity and the means necessary to accomplish it i cannot abate in the smallest degree the nature or the amount of these conditions  although the manner in which these words were uttered lent them weight the prelate fancied that the mind of the navigator had got to be unsettled by his long contemplation of a single subject the only things that left any doubt concerning the accuracy of this opinion were the method and science with which he had often maintained even in his own presence the reasonableness of his geographical suppositions arguments which though they had failed to convince one bent on believing the projector a visionary had nevertheless greatly puzzled the listener still the demands he had just read seemed so extravagant that for a single instant a sentiment of pity repressed the burst of indignation to which he felt disposed to give vent  how like ye noble lords he cried sarcastically turning to two or three of his fellowcommissioners who had eagerly seized the paper and were endeavoring to read it and all at the same moment the moderate and modest demands of the señor christoval colon the celebrated navigator who confounded the council of salamanca are they not such as becometh their highnesses to accept on bended knees and with many thanks  read them lord archbishop exclaimed several in a breath let us first know their nature  there are many minor conditions that might be granted as unworthy of discussion resumed the prelate taking the paper but here are two that must give the sovereigns infinite satisfaction the señor colon actually satisfieth himself with the rank of admiral and viceroy over all the countries he may discover and as for gains onetenththe churchs share my brethrenyea even onetenth one humble tenth of the proceeds and customs will content him  the general murmur that passed among the commissioners denoted a common dissatisfaction and at that instant columbus had not a true supporter in the room  nor is this all illustrious nobles and holy priests continued the archbishop following up his advantage as soon as he believed his auditors ready to hear himnor is this all lest these high dignities should weary their highnesses shoulders and those of their royal progeny the liberal genoese actually consenteth to transmit them to his own posterity in all time to come converting the kingdom of cathay into a realm for the uses of the house of colon to maintain the dignity of which the tenth of all the benefits are to be consigned to its especial care  there would have been an open laugh at this sally had not the noble bearing of columbus checked its indulgence and even ferdinand of talavera under the stern rebuke of an eye and mien that carried with them a grave authority began to think he had gone too far  your pardon señor colon he immediately and more courteously added but your conditions sounded so lofty that they have quite taken me by surprise you cannot seriously mean to maintain them  not one jot will i abate lord priest that much will be my due and he that consenteth to less than he deserveth becometh an instrument of his own humiliation i shall give to the sovereigns an empire that will far exceed in value all their other possessions and i claim my reward i tell you moreover reverend prelate that there is much in reserve and that these conditions will be needed to fulfil the future  these are truly modest proposals for a nameless genoese exclaimed one of the courtiers who had been gradually swelling with disgust and contempt the señor colon will be certain of commanding in the service of their highnesses and if nothing is done he will have that high honor without cost whereas should this most improbable scheme lead to any benefits he will become a viceking humbly contenting himself with the churchs revenue  this remark appeared to determine the wavering and the commissioners rose in a body as if the matter were thought to be unworthy of further discussion with the view to preserve at least the appearance of impartiality and discretion however the archbishop turned once more toward columbus and now certain of obtaining his ends he spoke to him in milder tones  for the last time señor he said i ask if you still insist on these unheardof terms  on them and on no other said columbus firmly i know the magnitude of the services i shall perform and will not degrade themwill in no manner lessen their dignity by accepting aught else but lord archbishop and you too noble señor that treateth my claims so lightly i am ready to add to the risk of person life and name that of gold i will furnish oneeighth of the needful sums if ye will increase my benefits in that proportion  enough enough returned the prelate preparing to quit the room we will make our report to the sovereigns this instant and thou shalt speedily know their pleasure  thus terminated the conference the courtiers left the room conversing earnestly among themselves like men who did not care to repress their indignation while columbus filled with the noble character of his own designs disappeared in another direction with the bearing of one whose selfrespect was not to be lessened by clamor and who appreciated ignorance and narrowness of views too justly to suffer them to change his own high purposes  ferdinand of talavera was as good as his word he was the queens confessor and in virtue of that holy office had at all times access to her presence full of the subject of the late interview he took his way directly to the private apartments of the queen and as a matter of course was at once admitted isabella heard his representations with mortification and regret for she had begun to set her heart on the sailing of this extraordinary expedition but the influence of the archbishop was very great for his royal penitent knew the sincerity and devotedness of his heart  this carrieth presumption to insolence señora continued the irritated churchman have we not here a mendicant adventurer demanding honors and authority that belong only to god and his anointed the princes of the earth who is this colona nameless genoese without rank services or modesty and yet doth he carry his pretensions to a height that might cause even a guzman to hesitate  he is a good christian holy prelate isabella meekly answered and seemeth to delight in the service and glory of god and to wish to favor the extension of his visible and catholic church  true señora and yet may there be deceit in this  nay lord archbishop i do not think that deceit is the mans failing for franker speech and more manly bearing it is not usual to see even in the most powerful he hath solicited us for years and yet no act of meanness may be fairly laid to his charge  i shall not judge the heart of this man harshly doña isabella but we may judge of his actions and his pretensions and how far they may be suitable to the dignity of the two crowns freely and without censure i confess him grave and plausible and light of neither discourse nor manner virtues certainly as the world moveth in courtsisabella smiled but she said nothing for her ghostly counsellor was wont to rebuke with freedom and she to listen with humilitywhere the age is not exhibiting its purest models of sobriety of thought and devotion but even these may exist without the spirit that shall be fitted for heaven but what are gravity and decorum if sustained by an inflated pride and inordinate rapacity ambition being a term too lofty for such a craving reflect señora on the full nature of these demands this colon requireth to be established forever in the high state of a substitute for a king not only for his own person but for those of his descendants throughout all time with the title and authority of admiral over all adjacent seas should he discover any of the lands he so much exalts before he will consent to enter into the command of certain of your highnesses vessels a station of itself only too honorable for one of so little note should his most extravagant pretensions be realizedand the probabilities are that they will entirely failhis demands would exceed his services whereas in the case of failure the castilian and aragonese names would be covered with ridicule and a sore disrespect would befal the royal dignity for having been thus duped by an adventurer much of the glory of this late conquest would be tarnished by a mistake so unfortunate  daughtermarchioness observed the queen turning toward the faithful and longtried friend who was occupied with her needle near her own sidethese conditions of colon do truly seem to exceed the bounds of reason  the enterprise also exceedeth all the usual bounds of risks and adventures señora was the steady reply of doña beatriz as she glanced toward the countenance of mercedes noble efforts deserve noble rewards  the eye of isabella followed the glance of her friend and it remained fixed for some time on the pale anxious features of her favorites ward the beautiful girl herself was unconscious of the attention she excited but one who knew her secret might easily detect the intense feeling with which she awaited the issue the opinions of her confessor had seemed so reasonable that isabella was on the point of assenting to the report of the commissioners and of abandoning altogether the secret hopes and expectations she had begun to couple with the success of the navigators schemes when a gentler feeling one that belonged peculiarly to her own feminine heart interposed to give the mariner another chance it is seldom that woman is dead to the sympathies connected with the affections and the wishes that sprang from the love of mercedes de valverde were the active cause of the decision that the queen of castile came to at that critical moment  we must be neither harsh nor hasty with this genoese lord archbishop she said turning again to the prelate he hath the virtues of devoutness and fairdealing and these are qualities that sovereigns learn to prize his demands no doubt have become somewhat exaggerated by long brooding in his thoughts on a favorite and great scheme but kind words and reason may yet lead him to more moderation let him then be tried with propositions of our own and doubtless his necessities if not a sense of justice will cause him to accept them the viceroyalty doth indeed exceed the usual policy of princes and as you say holy prelate the tenth is the churchs share but the admirals rank may be fairly claimed meet him then with these moderated proposals and substitute a fifteenth for a tenth let him be a viceroy in his own person during the pleasure of don fernando and myself but let him relinquish the claim for his posterity  fernando de talavera thought even these concessions too considerable but while he exercised his sacred office with a high authority he too well knew the character of isabella to presume to dispute an order she had once issued although it was in her own mild and feminine manner after receiving a few more instructions therefore and obtaining the counsel of the king who was at work in an adjoining cabinet the prelate went to execute this new commission  two or three days now passed before the subject was finally disposed of and isabella was again seated in the domestic circle when admission was once more demanded in behalf of her confessor the archbishop entered with a flushed face and his whole appearance was so disturbed that it must have been observed by the most indifferent person  how now holy archbishopdemanded isabelladoth thy new flock vex thy spirit and is it so very hard to deal with an infidel  tis naught of that señoratis naught relating to my new people i find even the followers of the false prophet more reasonable than some who exult in christs name and favor this colon is a madman and better fitted to become a saint in mussulmans eyes than even a pilot in your highness service  at this burst of indignation the queen the marchioness of moya and doña mercedes de valverde simultaneously dropped their needlework and sat looking at the prelate with a common concern they had all hoped that the difficulties which stood in the way of a favorable termination to the negotiation would be removed and that the time was at hand when the being who in spite of the boldness and unusual character of his projects had succeeded in so signally commanding their respect and in interesting their feelings was about to depart and to furnish a practical solution to problems that had as much puzzled their reasons as they had excited their curiosity but here was something like a sudden and unlookedfor termination to all their expectations and while mercedes felt something like despair chilling her heart the queen and doña beatriz were both displeased  didst thou duly explain to señor colon the nature of our proposals lord archbishop the former asked with more severity of manner than she was accustomed to betray and doth he still insist on the pretensions to a viceregal power and on the offensive condition in behalf of his posterity  even so your highness were it isabella of castile treating with henry of england or louis of france the starving genoese could not hold higher terms or more inflexible conditions he abateth nothing the man deemeth himself chosen of god to answer certain ends and his language and conditions are such as one who felt a holy impulse to his course could scarcely feel warranted in assuming  this constancy hath its merit observed the queen but there is a limit to concession i shall urge no more in the navigators favor but leave him to the fortune that naturally followeth selfexaltation and all extravagance of demand  this speech apparently sealed the fate of columbus in castile the archbishop was appeased and first holding a short private conference with his royal penitent he left the room shortly after christoval colon as he was called by the spaniardscolumbus as he styled himself in later lifereceived for a definite answer the information that his conditions were rejected and that the negotiation for the projected voyage to the indies was finally at an end  illustration     chapter viii      oh ever thus from childhoods hour       ive seen my fondest hopes decay     i never loved a tree or flower       but twas the first to fade away      lalla rookh   the season had now advanced to the first days of february and in that low latitude the weather was becoming genial and springlike on the morning succeeding that of the interview just related some six or eight individuals attracted by the loveliness of the day and induced morally by a higher motive were assembled before the door of one of those low dwellings of santa fé that had been erected for the accommodation of the conquering army most of these persons were grave spaniards of a certain age though young luis de bobadilla was also there and the tall dignified form of columbus was in the group the latter was equipped for the road and a stout serviceable andalusian mule stood ready to receive its burden near at hand a charger was by the side of the mule showing that the rider of the last was about to have company among the spaniards were alonzo de quintanilla the accountantgeneral of castile a firm friend of the navigator and luis de st angel the receiver of the ecclesiastical revenues of aragon who was one of the firmest converts that columbus had made to the philosophical accuracy of his opinions and to the truth of his vast conceptions  the two last had been in earnest discourse with the navigator but the discussion had closed and señor de st angel a man of generous feelings and ardent imagination was just expressing himself warmly in the following words  by the lustre of the two crowns he cried this ought not to come to pass but adieu señor colongod have you in his holy keeping and send you wiser and less prejudiced judges hereafter the past can only cause us shame and grief while the future is in the womb of time  the whole party with the exception of luis de bobadilla then took their leave as soon as the place was clear columbus mounted and passed through the thronged streets attended by the young noble on his charger not a syllable was uttered by either until they were fairly on the plain though columbus often sighed like a man oppressed with grief still his mien was calm his bearing dignified and his eye lighted with that unquenchable fire which finds its fuel in the soul within  when fairly without the gates columbus turned courteously to his young companion and thanked him for his escort but with a consideration for the other that was creditable to his heart he added  while i am so grateful for this honor coming from one so noble and full of hopes i must not forget your own character didst thou not remark friend luis as we passed through the streets that divers spaniards pointed at me as the object of scorn  i did señor answered luis his cheek glowing with indignation and had it not been that i dreaded your displeasure i would have trodden the vagabonds beneath my horses feet failing of a lance to spit them on  thou hast acted most wisely in showing forbearance but these are men and their common judgment maketh public opinion nor do i perceive that the birth or the opportunities causeth material distinctions between them though the manner of expression vary there are vulgar among the noble and noble among the lowly this very act of kindness of thine will find its deriders and contemners in the court of the two sovereigns  let him look to it who presumeth to speak lightly of you señor to luis de bobadilla we are not a patient race and castilian blood is apt to be hot blood  i should be sorry that any man but myself should draw in my quarrel but if we take offence at all who think and speak folly we may pass our days in harness let the young nobles have their jest if it give them pleasurebut do not let me regret my friendship for thee  luis promised fairly and then as if his truant thoughts would revert to the subject unbidden he hastily resumed  you speak of the noble as of a class different from your ownsurely señor colon thou art noble  would it make aught different in thy opinions and feelings young man were i to answer no  the cheek of don luis flushed and for an instant he repented of his remark but falling back on his own frank and generous nature he answered immediately without reservation or duplicity  by san pedro my new patron i could wish you were noble señor if it were merely for the honor of the class there are so many among us who do no credit to their spurs that we might gladly receive such an acquisition  this world is made up of changes young señor returned columbus smiling the seasons undergo their changes night follows day comets come and go monarchs become subjects and subjects monarchs nobles lose the knowledge of their descent and plebeians rise to the rank of nobles there is a tradition among us that we were formerly of the privileged class but time and our unlucky fortune have brought us down to humble employments am i to lose the honor of don luis de bobadillas company in the great voyage should i be more fortunate in france than i have been in castile because his commander happeneth to have lost the evidences of his nobility  that would be a most unworthy motive señor and i hasten to correct your mistake as we are now about to part for some time i ask permission to lay bare my whole soul to you i confess that when first i heard of this voyage it struck me as a madmans scheme  ah friend luis interrupted columbus with a melancholy shake of the head this is the opinion of but too many i fear don ferdinand of aragon as well as that stern prelate his namesake who hath lately disposed of the question thinketh in the same manner  i crave your pardon señor colon if i have uttered aught to give you pain but if i have once done you injustice i am ready enough to expiate the wrong as you will quickly see thinking thus i entered into discourse with you with a view to amuse myself with fancied ravings but though no immediate change of opinion followed as to the truth of the theory i soon perceived that a great philosopher and profound reasoner had the matter in hand here my judgment might have rested and my opinion been satisfied but for a circumstance of deep moment to myself you must know señor though come of the oldest blood of spain and not without fair possessions that i may not always have answered the hopes of those who have been charged with the care of my youth  this is unnecessary noble sir  nay by st luke it shall be said now i have two great and engrossing passions that sometimes interfere with each other the one is a love for ramblinga burning desire to see foreign lands and this too in a free and roving fashionwith a disposition for the sea and the doings of havens and the other is a love for mercedes de valverde the fairest gentlest most affectionate warmesthearted and truest maiden of castile  noble withal put in columbus smiling  señor answered luis gravely i jest not concerning my guardian angel she is not only noble and every way fitted to honor my name but she hath the blood of the guzmans themselves in her veins but i have lost favor with others if not with my lovely mistress in yielding to this rambling inclination and even my own aunt who is her guardian hath not looked smilingly on my suit doña isabella whose word is law among all the noble virgins of the court hath also her prejudices and it hath become necessary to regain her good opinion to win the doña mercedes it struck meluis was too manly to betray his mistress by confessing that the thought was hersit struck me that if my rambling tastes took the direction of some noble enterprise like this you urge that what hath been a demerit might be deemed a merit in the royal eyes which would be certain soon to draw all other eyes after them with this hope then i first entered into the present intercourse until the force of your arguments hath completed my conversion and now no churchman hath more faith in the head of his religion than i have that the shortest road to cathay is athwart the broad atlantic or no lombard is more persuaded that his lombardy is flat than i feel convinced that this good earth of ours is a sphere  speak reverently of the ministers of the altar young señor said columbus crossing himself for no levity should be used in connection with their holy office it seemeth then he added smiling i owe my disciple to the two potent agents of love and reason the former as most potent overcoming the first obstacles and the latter getting uppermost at the close of the affair as is wont to happenlove generally triumphing in the onset and reason last  ill not deny the potency of the power señor for i feel it too deeply to rebel against it you now know my secret and when i have made you acquainted with my intentions all will be laid bare i here solemnly vowdon luis lifted his cap and looked to heaven as he spoketo join you in this voyage on due notice sail from whence you may in whatever bark you shall choose and whenever you please in doing this i trust first to serve god and his church secondly to visit cathay and those distant and wonderful lands and lastly to win doña mercedes de valverde  i accept the pledge young sir rejoined columbus struck by his earnestness and pleased with his sinceritythough it might have been a more faithful representation of your thoughts had the order of the motives been reversed  in a few months i shall be master of my own means continued the youth too intent on his own purposes to heed what the navigator had saidand then nothing but the solemn command of doña isabella herself shall prevent our having one caravel at least and the coffers of bobadilla must have been foully dealt by during their masters childhood if they do not afford two i am no subject of don fernandos but a servant of the elder branch of the house of trastamara and the cold judgment of the king even shall not prevent it  this soundeth generously and thy sentiments are such as become a youthful and enterprising noble but the offer cannot be accepted it would not become columbus to use gold that came from so confiding a spirit and so inexperienced a head and there are still greater obstacles than this my enterprise must rest on the support of some powerful prince even the guzman hath not deemed himself of sufficient authority to uphold a scheme so large did we make the discoveries without that sanction we should be toiling for others without security for ourselves since the portuguese or some other monarch would wrong us of our reward that i am destined to effect this great work i feel and it must be done in a manner suited to the majesty of the thought and to the magnitude of the subject and here don luis we must part should my suit be successful at the court of france thou shalt hear from me for i ask no better than to be sustained by hearts and hands like thine still thou must not mar thy fortunes unheedingly and i am now a fallen man in castile it may not serve thee a good turn to be known to frequent my company any longerand i again say here we must part  luis de bobadilla protested his indifference to what others might think but the more experienced columbus who rose so high above popular clamor in matters that affected himself felt a generous reluctance to permit this confiding youth to sacrifice his hopes to any friendly impressions in his own favor the leavetaking was warm and the navigator felt a glow at his heart as he witnessed the sincere and honest emotions that the young man could not repress at parting they separated however about half a league from the town and each bent his way in his own direction don luis de bobadillas heart swelling with indignation at the unworthy treatment that there was in sooth so much reason for thinking his new friend had received  columbus journeyed on with very different emotions seven weary years had he been soliciting the monarchs and nobles of spain to aid him in his enterprise in that long period how much of poverty contempt ridicule and even odium had he not patiently encountered rather than abandon the slight hold that he had obtained on a few of the more liberal and enlightened minds of the nation he had toiled for bread while soliciting the great to aid themselves in becoming still more powerful and each ray of hope however feeble had been eagerly caught at with joy each disappointment borne with a constancy that none but the most exalted spirit could sustain but he was now required to endure the most grievous of all his pains the recall of isabella had awakened within him a confidence to which he had long been a stranger and he awaited the termination of the siege with the calm dignity that became his purpose no less than his lofty philosophy the hour of leisure had come and it produced a fatal destruction to all his buoyant hopes he had thought his motives understood his character appreciated and his high objects felt but he now found himself still regarded as a visionary projector his intentions distrusted and his promised services despised in a word the bright expectations that had cheered his toil for years had vanished in a day and the disappointment was all the greater for the brief but delusive hopes produced by his recent favor  it is not surprising therefore that when left alone on the highway even the spirit of this extraordinary man grew faint within him and he had to look to the highest power for succor his head dropped upon his breast and one of those bitter moments occurred in which the past and the future crowd the mind painfully as to sufferings endured cheerlessly as to hope the time wasted in spain seemed a blot in his existence and then came the probability of another long and exhausting probation that like this might lead to nothing he had already reached the lustrum that would fill his threescore years and life seemed slipping from beneath him while its great object remained unachieved still the high resolution of the man sustained him not once did he think of a compromise of what he felt to be his rightsnot once did he doubt of the practicability of accomplishing the great enterprise that others derided his heart was full of courage even while his bosom was full of grief there is a wise a merciful and omnipotent god he exclaimed raising his eyes to heaven he knoweth what is meet for his own glory and in him do i put my trust there was a pause and the eyes kindled while a scarcely perceptible smile lighted the grave face and then were murmured the wordsyea he taketh his time but the infidel shall be enlightened and the blessed sepulchre redeemed  after this burst of feeling the gravelooking man whose hairs had already become whitened to the color of snow by cares and toils and exposures pursued his way with the quiet dignity of one who believed that he was not created for naught and who trusted in god for the fulfilment of his destiny if quivering sighs occasionally broke out of his breast they did not disturb the placidity of his venerable countenance if grief and disappointment still lay heavy on his heart they rested on a base that was able to support them leaving columbus to follow the common muletrack across the vega we will now return to santa fé where ferdinand and isabella had reestablished their court after the few first days that succeeded the possession of their new conquest  luis de st angel was a man of ardent feelings and generous impulses he was one of those few spirits who live in advance of their age and who permitted his reason to be enlightened and cheered by his imagination though it was never dazzled by it as he and his friend alonzo de quintanilla after quitting columbus as already related walked toward the royal pavillion they conversed freely together concerning the man his vast conceptions the treatment he had received and the shame that would alight on spain in consequence were he suffered thus to depart forever blunt of speech the receiver of the ecclesiastical revenues did not measure his terms every syllable of which found an echo in the heart of the accountantgeneral who was an old and fast friend of the navigator in short by the time they reached the pavilion they had come to the resolution to make one manly effort to induce the queen to yield to columbus terms and to recall him to her presence  isabella was always easy of access to such of her servants as she knew to be honest and zealous the age was one of formality and in many respects of exaggeration while the court was renowned for ceremony but the pure spirit of the queen threw a truth and a natural grace around all that depended on her which rendered mere forms except as they were connected with delicacy and propriety useless and indeed impracticable both the applicants for the interview enjoyed her favor and the request was granted with that simple directness that this estimable woman loved to manifest whenever she thought she was about to oblige any whom she esteemed  the queen was surrounded by the few ladies among whom she lived in private as luis de st angel and alonzo de quintanilla entered among them of course were the marchioness of moya and doña mercedes de valverde the king on this occasion was in an adjoining closet at work as usual with his calculations and orders official labor was ferdinands relaxation and he seldom manifested more happiness than when clearing off a press of affairs that most men would have found to the last degree burdensome he was a hero in the saddle a warrior at the head of armies a sage in council and respectable if not great in all things but motives  what has brought the señor st angel and the señor quintanilla as suitors so early to my presence asked isabella smiling in a way to assure both that the boon would be asked of a partial mistress ye are not wont to be beggars and the hour is somewhat unusual  all hours are suitable gracious lady when one cometh to confer and not to seek favor returned luis de st angel bluntly we are not here to solicit for ourselves but to show your highness the manner in which the crown of castile may be garnished with brighter jewels than any it now possesseth  isabella looked surprised both at the words of the speaker and at his hurried earnestness as well as his freedom of speech accustomed however to something of the last her own calm manner was not disturbed nor did she even seem displeased  hath the moor another kingdom of which to be despoiled she asked or would the receiver of the churchs revenues have us war upon the holy see  i would have your highness accept the boons that come from god with alacrity and gratitude and not reject them unthankfully returned de st angel kissing the queens offered hand with a respect and affection that neutralized the freedom of his words do you know my gracious mistress that the señor christoval colon he from whose high projects we spaniards have hoped so much hath actually taken mule and quitted santa fé  i expected as much señor though i was not apprized that it had actually come to pass the king and i put the matter into the hands of the archbishop of granada with other trusty counsellors and they have found the terms of the genoese arrogant so full of exceeding and unreasonable extravagance that it ill befitted our dignity and our duty to ourselves to grant them one who hath a scheme of such doubtful results ought to manifest moderation in his preliminaries many even believe the man a visionary  it is unlike an unworthy pretender señora to abandon his hopes before he will yield his dignity this colon feeleth that he is treating for empires and he negotiates like one full of the importance of his subject  he that lightly valueth himself in matters of gravity hath need to expect that he will not stand high in the estimation of others put in alonzo de quintanilla  and moreover my gracious and beloved mistress added de st angel without permitting isabella even to answer the character of the man and the value of his intentions may be appreciated by the price he setteth on his own services if he succeed will not the discovery eclipse all others that have been made since the creation of the world is it nothing to circle the earth to prove the wisdom of god by actual experiment to follow the sun in its daily track and imitate the motions of that glorious moving mass and then the benefits that will flow on castile and aragonare they not incalculable i marvel that a princess who hath shown so high and rare a spirit on all other occasions should shrink from so grand an enterprise as this  thou art earnest my good de st angel returned isabella with a smile that betrayed no anger and when there is much earnestness there is sometimes much forgetfulness if there were honor and profit in success what would there be in failure should the king and myself send out this colon with a commission to be our viceroy forever over undiscovered lands and no lands be discovered the wisdom of our councils might be called in question and the dignity of the two crowns would be fruitlessly and yet deeply committed  the hand of the lord archbishop is in this this prelate hath never been a believer in the justice of the navigators theories and it is easy to raise objections when the feelings lean against an enterprise no glory is obtained without risk look your highness at our neighbors the portuguesehow much have discoveries done for that kingdom and how much more may it do for us we know my honored mistress that the earth is round  are we quite certain of that important fact señor asked the king who attracted by the animated and unusual tones of the speaker had left his closet and approached unseen is that truth established our doctors at salamanca were divided on that great question and by st james i do not see that it is so very clear  if not round my lord the king answered de st angel turning quickly to face this new opponent like a welldrilled corps wheeling into a new front of what form can it be will any doctor come he of salamanca or come he from elsewhere pretend that the earth is a plain and that it hath limits and that one may stand on these limits and jump down upon the sun as he passeth beneath at nightis this reasonable honored señor or is it in conformity with scripture  will any one doctor of salamanca or elsewhere rejoined the king gravely though it was evident his feelings were little interested in the discussion allege that there are nations who forever walk with their heads downward where the rain falleth upward and where the sea remaineth in its bed though its support cometh from above and is not placed beneath  it is to explain these great mysteries señor don fernando my gracious master that i would have this colon at once go forth we may see nay we have demonstration that the earth is a sphere and yet we do not see that the waters fall from its surface any where the hull of a ship is larger than her topmasts and yet the last are first visible on the ocean which proveth that the body of the vessel is concealed by the form of the water this being so and all who have voyaged on the ocean know it to be thus why doth not the water flow into a level here on our own shores if the earth be round there must be means to encircle it by water as well as by landto complete the entire journey as well as to perform a part colon proposeth to open the way to this exploit and the monarch that shall furnish the means will live in the memories of our descendants as one far greater than a conqueror remember illustrious señor that all the east is peopled with infidels and that the head of the church freely bestoweth their lands on any christian monarch that may drag them from their benighted condition into the light of gods favor believe me doña isabella should another sovereign grant the terms colon requireth and reap the advantages that are likely to flow from such discoveries the enemies of spain would make the world ring with their songs of triumph while the whole peninsula would mourn over this unhappy decision  whither hath the señor colon sped demanded the king quickly all his political jealousies being momentarily aroused by the remarks of his receivergeneral he hath not gone again to don john of portugal  no señor my master but to king louis of france a sovereign whose love for aragon amounteth to a proverb  the king muttered a few words between his teeth and he paced the apartment to and fro with a disturbed manner for while no man living cared less to hazard his means without the prospect of a certain return the idea of anothers reaping an advantage that had been neglected by himself brought him at once under the control of those feelings that always influenced his cold and calculating policy with isabella the case was different her pious wishes had ever leaned toward the accomplishment of columbus great project and her generous nature had sympathized deeply with the noble conception vast moral results and the glory of the enterprise nothing but the manner in which her mind as well as her religious aspirations had been occupied by the war in granada had prevented her from entering earlier into a full examination of the navigators views and she had yielded to the counsel of her confessor in denying the terms demanded by columbus with a reluctance it had not been easy to overcome then the gentler feelings of her sex had their influence for while she too reflected on what had just been urged her eye glanced around the room and rested on the beautiful face of mercedes who sat silent from diffidence but whose pale eloquent countenance betrayed all the pleadings of the pure enthusiastic love of woman  daughtermarchioness asked the queen turning as usual to her tried friend in her doubts what thinkest thou of this weighty matter ought we so to humble ourselves as to recal this haughty genoese  say not haughty señora for to me he seemeth much superior to any such feeling but rather regard him as one that hath a just appreciation of that he hath in view i agree fully with the receivergeneral in thinking that castile will be much discredited if in sooth a new world should be discovered and they who favored the enterprise could point to this court and remind it that the glory of the event was in its grasp and that it threw it away heedlessly  and this too on a mere point of dignity señora put in st angelon a question of parchment and of sound  nay nayretorted the queenthere are those who think the honors claimed by colon would far exceed the service even should the latter equal all the representations of the genoese himself  then my honored mistress they know not at what the genoese aims reflect señora that it will not be an everyday deed to prove that this earth is a sphere by actual measurement whatever we may know in theories then cometh the wealth and benefits of those eastern possessions a quarter of the world whence all riches flowspices pearls silks and the most precious metals after these again cometh the great glory of god which crowneth and exceedeth all  isabella crossed herself her cheek flushed her eye kindled and her matronly but fine form seemed to tower with the majesty of the feelings that these pictures created  i do fear don fernando she said that our advisers have been precipitate and that the magnitude of this project may justify more than common conditions  but the king entered little into the generous emotions of his royal consort feeling far more keenly the stings of political jealousy than any promptings of a liberal zeal for either the church or science he was generally esteemed a wise prince a title that would seem to infer neither a generous nor a very just one he smiled at the kindling enthusiasm of his wife but continued to peruse a paper that had just been handed to him by a secretary  your highness feels as doña isabella of castile ought to feel when the glory of god and the honor of her crown are in question added beatriz de cabrera using that freedom of speech that her royal mistress much encouraged in their more private intercourse i would rather hear you utter the words of recall to this colon than again listen to the shouts of our late triumph over the moor  i know that thou lovest me beatriz exclaimed the queen if there is not a true heart in that breast of thine the fallen condition of man does not suffer the gem to exist  we all love and reverence your highness continued de st angel and we wish naught but your glory fancy señora the page of history open and this great exploit of the reduction of the moor succeeded by the still greater deed of a discovery of an easy and swift communication with the indies the spread of the church and the flow of inexhaustible wealth into spain this colon cannot be supported by the colder and more selfish calculations of man but his very enterprise seeks the more generous support of her who can risk much for gods glory and the good of the church  nay señor de st angel thou flatterest and offendest in the same breath  it is an honest nature pouring out its disappointment my beloved mistress and a tongue that hath become bold through much zeal for your highnesses fame alas alas should king louis grant the terms we have declined poor spain will never lift her head again for very shame  art certain st angel that the genoese hath gone for france suddenly demanded the king in his sharp authoritative voice  i have it your highness from his own mouth yes yes he is at this moment striving to forget our castilian dialect and endeavoring to suit his tongue to the language of the frenchman they are bigots and unreflecting disciples of musty prejudices señora that deny the theories of colon the old philosophers have reasoned in the same manner and though it may seem to the timid an audacious and even a heedless adventure to sail out into the broad atlantic had not the portuguese done it he would never have found his islands gods truth it maketh my blood boil when i bethink me of what these lusitanians have done while we of aragon and castile have been tilting with the infidels for a few valleys and mountains and contending for a capital  señor you are forgetful of the honor of the sovereigns as well as of the service of god interrupted the marchioness of moya who had the tact to perceive that the receivergeneral was losing sight of his discretion in the magnitude of his zeal this conquest is one of the victories of the church and will add lustre to the two crowns in all future ages the head of the church himself hath so recognized it and all good christians should acknowledge its character  it is not that i undervalue this success but that i consider the conquest that colon is likely to achieve over so many millions that i have thus spoken doña beatriz  the marchioness whose spirit was as marked as her love for the queen made a sharp reply and for a few minutes she and luis de st angel with alonzo de quintanilla maintained the discussion by themselves while isabella conversed apart with her husband no one presuming to meddle with their private conference the queen was earnest and evidently much excited but ferdinand maintained his customary coolness and caution though his manner was marked with that profound respect which the character of isabella had early inspired and which she succeeded in maintaining throughout her married life this was a picture familiar to the courtiers one of the sovereigns being as remarkable for his wily prudence as was the other for her generous and sincere ardor whenever impelled by a good motive this divided discourse lasted half an hour the queen occasionally pausing to listen to what was passing in the other group and then recurring to her own arguments with her husband  at length isabella left the side of ferdinand who coldly resumed the perusal of a paper and she moved slowly toward the excited party that was now unanimous and rather loud in the expression of its regretsloud for even the indulgence of so gentle a mistress her intention to repress this ardor by her own presence however was momentarily diverted from its object by a glimpse of the face of mercedes who sat alone her work lying neglected in her lap listening anxiously to the opinions that had drawn all her companions to the general circle  thou takest no part in this warm discussion child observed the queen stopping before the chair of our heroine and gazing an instant into her eloquently expressive face hast thou lost all interest in colon  i speak not señora because it becometh youth and ignorance to be modest but though silent i feel none the less  and what are thy feelings daughter dost thou too think the services of the genoese cannot be bought at too high a price  since your highness doth me this honor answered the lovely girl the blood gradually flushing her pale face as she warmed with the subjecti will not hesitate to speak i do believe this great enterprise hath been offered to the sovereigns as a reward for all that they have done and endured for religion and the church i do think that colon hath been guided to this court by a divine hand and by a divine hand hath he been kept here enduring the long servitude of seven years rather than abandon his object and i do think that this late appeal in his favor cometh of a power and spirit that should prevail  thou art an enthusiast daughter more especially in this cause returned the queen smiling kindly on the blushing mercedes i am greatly moved by thy wishes to aid in this enterprise  thus spoke isabella at a moment when she had neither the leisure nor the thought to analyze her own feelings which were influenced by a variety of motives rather than by any single consideration even this passing touch of womans affections however contributed to give her mind a new bias and she joined the group which respectfully opened as she advanced greatly disposed to yield to de st angels wellmeant though somewhat intemperate entreaties still she hesitated for her wary husband had just been reminding her of the exhausted state of the two treasuries and the impoverished condition in which both crowns had been left by the late war  daughtermarchioness said isabella slightly answering the reverences of the circle dost thou still think this colon expressly called of god for the high purposes to which he pretendeth  señora i say not exactly that though i believe the genoese hath some such opinion of himself but this much i do thinkthat heaven beareth in mind its faithful servitors and when there is need of important actions suitable agents are chosen for the work now we do know that the church at some day is to prevail throughout the whole world and why may not this be the allotted time as well as another god ordereth mysteriously and the very adventure that so many of the learned have scoffed at may be intended to hasten the victory of the church we should remember your highness the humility with which this church commenced how few of the seemingly wise lent it their aid and the high pass of glory to which it hath reached this conquest of the moor savoreth of a fulfilment of time and his reign of seven centuries terminated may merely be an opening for a more glorious future  isabella smiled upon her friend for this was reasoning after her own secret thoughts but her greater acquirements rendered her more discriminating in her zeal than was the case with the warmhearted and ardent marchioness  it is not safe to affix the seal of providence to this or that enterprise daughtermarchionessshe answeredand the church alone may say what are intended for miracles and what is left for human agencies what sum doth colon need señor de st angel to carry on the adventure in a manner that will content him  he asketh but two light caravels my honored mistress and three thousand crownsa sum that many a young spendthrift would waste on his pleasures in a few short weeks  it is not much truly observed isabella who had been gradually kindling with the thoughts of the nobleness of the adventure but small as it is my lord the king doubteth if our joint coffers can at this moment well bear the drain  oh it were a pity that such an occasion to serve god such an opportunity to increase the christian sway and to add to the glory of spain should be lost for this trifle of gold exclaimed doña beatriz  it would be truly rejoined the queen whose cheek now glowed with an enthusiasm little less obvious than that which shone so brightly in the countenance of the ardent mercedes señor de st angel the king cannot be prevailed on to enter into this affair in behalf of aragon but i take it on myself as queen of castile and so far as it may properly advance human interests for the benefit of my own muchbeloved people if the royal treasury be drained my private jewels should suffice for that small sum and i will freely pledge them as surety for the gold rather than let this colon depart without putting the truth of his theories to the proof the result truly is of too great magnitude to admit of further discussion  an exclamation of admiration and delight escaped those present for it was not a usual thing for a princess to deprive herself of personal ornaments in order to advance either the interests of the church or those of her subjects the receivergeneral however soon removed all difficulties on the score of money by saying that his coffers could advance the required sum on the guarantee of the crown of castile and that the jewels so freely offered might remain in the keeping of their royal owner  and now to recall colon observed the queen as soon as these preliminaries had been discussed he hath already departed you say and no time should be lost in acquainting him with this new resolution  your highness hath here a willing courier and one already equipped for the road in the person of don luis de bobadilla cried alonzo de quintanilla whose eye had been drawn to a window by the trampling of a horses foot and the man who will more joyfully bear these tidings to the genoese cannot be found in santa fé  tis scarce a service suited to one of his high station answered isabella doubtingly and yet we should consider every moment of delay a wrong to colon  nay señora spare not my nephew eagerly interposed doña beatriz he is only too happy at being employed in doing your highness pleasure  let him then be summoned to our presence without another instants delay i scarce seem to have decided while the principal personage of the great adventure is journeying from the court  a page was immediately despatched in quest of the young noble and in a few minutes the footsteps of the latter were heard in the antechamber luis entered the presence flushed excited and with feelings not a little angered at the compelled departure of his new friend he did not fail to impute the blame of this occurrence to those who had the power to prevent it and when his dark expressive eye met the countenance of his sovereign had it been in her power to read its meaning she would have understood that he viewed her as a person who had thwarted his hopes on more than one occasion nevertheless the influence of doña isabellas pure character and gentle manners was seldom forgotten by any who were permitted to approach her person and his address was respectful if not warm  it is your highness pleasure to command my presence said the young man as soon as he made his reverences to the queen  i thank you for this promptitude don luis having some need of your services can you tell us what hath befel the señor christoval colon the genoese navigator with whom they inform me you have some intimacy  forgive me señora if aught unbecoming escape me but a full heart must be opened lest it break the genoese is about to shake the dust of spain from his shoes and at this moment is on his journey to another court to proffer those services that this should never have rejected  it is plain don luis that all thy leisure time hath not been passed in courts returned the queen smiling but we have now service for thy roving propensities mount thy steed and pursue the señor colon with the tidings that his conditions will be granted and a request that he will forthwith return i pledge my royal word to send him forth on this enterprise with as little delay as the necessary preparations and a suitable prudence will allow  señora doña isabella my gracious queen do i hear aright  as a sign of the fidelity of thy senses don luis here is the pledge of my hand  this was said kindly and the gracious manner in which the hand was offered brought a gleam of hope to the mind of the lover which it had not felt since he had been apprized that the queens good opinion was necessary to secure his happiness kneeling respectfully he kissed the hand of his sovereign after which without changing his attitude he desired to know if he should that instant depart on the duty she had named  rise don luis and lose not a moment to relieve the loaded heart of the genoesei might almost say to relieve ours also for daughtermarchioness since this holy enterprise hath broken on my mind with a sudden and almost miraculous light it seemeth that a mountain must lie on my breast until the señor christoval shall learn the truth  luis de bobadilla did not wait a second bidding but hurried from the presence as fast as etiquette would allow and the next minute he was in the saddle at his appearance mercedes had shrunk into the recess of a window where she now luckily commanded a view of the court as her lover gained his seat he caught a glimpse of her form and though the spurs were already in his chargers flanks the rein tightened and the snorting steed was thrown suddenly on his haunches so elastic are the feelings of youth so deceptive and flattering the hopes of those who love that the glances which were exchanged were those of mutual delight neither thought of all the desperate chances of the contemplated voyage of the probability of its want of success or of the many motives which might still induce the queen to withhold her consent mercedes awoke first from the short trance that succeeded for taking the alarm at luis indiscreet delay she motioned him hurriedly to proceed again the rowels were buried in the flanks of the noble animal fire flashed beneath his armed heels and at the next minute don luis de bobadilla had disappeared  in the mean time columbus had pursued his melancholy journey across the vega he travelled slowly and several times even after his companion had left him did he check his mule and sit with his head dropped upon his breast lost in thought the very picture of woe the noble resignation that he manifested in public nearly gave way in private and he felt indeed how hard his disappointments were to be borne in this desultory manner of travelling he had reached the celebrated pass of the bridge of piños the scene of many a sanguinary combat when the sound of a horses hoofs first overtook his ear turning his head he recognized luis de bobadilla in hot pursuit with the flanks of his horse dyed in blood and his breast white with foam  joy joy a thousand times joy señor colon shouted the eager youth even before he was near enough to be distinctly heard blessed maria be praised joy señor joy and naught but joy  this is unexpected don luis exclaimed the navigator what meaneth thy return  luis now attempted to explain his errand but eagerness and the want of breath rendered his ideas confused and his utterance broken and imperfect  and why should i return to a hesitating cold and undecided court demanded columbus have i not wasted years in striving to urge it to its own good look at these hairs young señor and remember that i have lost a time that nearly equals all thy days in striving uselessly to convince the rulers of this peninsula that my project is founded on truth  at length you have succeeded isabella the truehearted and neverdeceiving queen of castile herself hath awoke to the importance of thy scheme and pledges her royal word to favor it  is this true can this be true don luis  i am sent to you express señor to urge your immediate return  by whom young lord  by doña isabella my gracious mistress through her own personal commands  i cannot forego a single condition already offered  it is not expected señor our excellent and generous mistress granteth all you ask and hath nobly offered as i learn to pledge her private jewels rather than that the enterprise fail  columbus was deeply touched with this information and removing his cap he concealed his face with it for a moment as if ashamed to betray the weakness that came over him when he uncovered his face it was radiant with happiness and every doubt appeared to have vanished years of suffering were forgotten in that moment of joy and he immediately signified his readiness to accompany the youth back to santa fé     chapter ix      how beautiful is genius when combined     with holiness oh how divinely sweet     the tones of earthly harp whose cords are touchd     by the soft hand of piety and hung     upon religions shrine there vibrating     with solemn music in the air of god      john wilson   columbus was received by his friends luis de st angel and alonzo de quintanilla with a gratification they found it difficult to express they were loud in their eulogiums on isabella and added to the assurances of don luis such proofs of the seriousness of the queens intentions as to remove all doubts from the mind of the navigator he was then without further delay conducted to the presence  señor colon said isabella as the genoese advanced and knelt at her feet you are welcome back again all our misunderstandings are finally removed and henceforth i trust that we shall act cheerfully and unitedly to produce the same great end rise señor and receive this as a gage of my support and friendship  columbus saluted the offered hand and arose from his knees at that instant there was probably no one present whose feelings were not raised to the buoyancy of hope for it was a peculiarity connected with the origin and execution of this great enterprise that after having been urged for so long a period amid sneers and doubts and ridicule it was at first adopted with something very like enthusiasm  señora returned columbus whose grave aspect and noble mien contributed not a little to the advancement of his viewsseñora my heart thanks you for this kindnessso welcome because so little hoped for this morningand god will reward it we have great things in reserve and i devoutly wish we may all be found equal to our several duties i hope my lord the king will not withhold from my undertaking the light of his gracious countenance  you are a servitor of castile señor colon though little is attempted for even this kingdom without the approbation and consent of the king of aragon don fernando hath been gained over to our side though his greater caution and superior wisdom have not as easily fallen into the measure as womans faith and womans hopes  i ask no higher wisdom no truer faith than those of isabellas said the navigator with a grave dignity that rendered the compliment so much the more acceptable by giving it every appearance of sincerity her known prudence shall turn from me the derision of the lightminded and idle and on her royal word i place all my hopes henceforth and i trust forever i am your highness subject and servant  the queen was deeply impressed with the air of lofty truth that elevated the thoughts and manners of the speaker hitherto she had seen but little of the navigator and never before under circumstances that enabled her so thoroughly to feel the influence of his air and deportment columbus had not the finish of manner that it is fancied courts only can bestow and which it would be more just to refer to lives devoted to habits of pleasing but the character of the man shone through the exterior and in his case all that artificial training could supply fell short of the noble aspect of nature sustained by high aspirations to a commanding person and a gravity that was heightened by the loftiness of his purposes columbus added the sober earnestness of a deeplyseated and an allpervading enthusiasm which threw the grace of truth and probity on what he said and did no quality of his mind was more apparent than its sense of right as right was then considered in connection with the opinions of the age and it is a singular circumstance that the greatest adventure of modern times was thus confided by providence as it might be with especial objects to the care of a sovereign and to the hands of an executive leader who were equally distinguished by the possession of so rare a characteristic  i thank you señor for this proof of confidence returned the queen both surprised and gratified and so long as god giveth me power to direct and knowledge to decide your interests as well as those of this longcherished scheme shall be looked to but we are not to exclude the king from our confederacy since he hath been finally gained to our opinions and no doubt now as anxiously looketh forward to success as we do ourselves  columbus bowed his acquiescence and the conjugal affection of isabella was satisfied with this concession to her husbands character and motives for while it was impossible that one so pure and ardent in the cause of virtue and as disinterested as the queen should not detect some of the selfishness of ferdinands cautious policy the feelings of a wife so far prevailed in her breast over the sagacity of the sovereign as to leave her blind to faults that the enemies of aragon were fond of dwelling on all admitted the truth of isabella but ferdinand had far less credit with his contemporaries either on the score of faith or on that of motives still he might have been ranked among the most upright of the reigning princes of europe his faults being rendered more conspicuous perhaps from being necessarily placed in such close connection with and in such vivid contrast to the truer virtues of the queen in short these two sovereigns so intimately united by personal and political interests merely exhibited on their thrones a picture that may be seen at any moment in all the inferior gradations of the social scale in which the worldly views and meretricious motives of man serve as foils to the truer heart sincerer character and more chastened conduct of woman  don fernando now appeared and he joined in the discourse in a manner to show that he considered himself fully committed to redeem the pledges given by his wife the historians have told us that he had been won over by the intercessions of a favorite though the better opinion would seem to be that deference for isabella whose pure earnestness in the cause of virtue often led him from his more selfish policy lay at the bottom of his compliance whatever may have been the motive however it is certain that the king never entered into the undertaking with the ardent zealous endeavors to insure success which from that moment distinguished the conduct of his royal consort  we have recovered our truant said isabella as her husband approached her eyes lighting and her cheeks flushed with a pious enthusiasm like those of mercedes de valverde who was an entranced witness of all that was passing we have recovered our truant and there is not a moment of unnecessary delay to be permitted until he shall be sent forth on this great voyage should he truly attain cathay and the indies it will be a triumph to the church even exceeding this conquest of the territories of the moor  i am pleased to see the señor colon at santa fé again courteously returned the king and if he but do the half of that thou seemest to expect we shall have reason to rejoice that our countenance hath not been withheld he may not render the crown of castile still more powerful but he may so far enrich himself that as a subject he will have difficulty in finding the proper uses for his gold  there will always be a use for the gold of a christian answered the navigator while the infidel remaineth the master of the holy sepulchre  how is this exclaimed ferdinand in his quick sharp voice dost thou think señor of a crusade as well as of discovering new regions  such your highness it hath long been my hope would be the first appropriation of the wealth that will out of question flow from the discovery of a new and near route to the indies is it not a blot on christendom that the mussulman should be permitted to raise his profane altars on the spot that christ visited on earth where indeed he was born and where his holy remains lay until his glorious resurrection this foul disgrace there are hearts and swords enough ready to wipe out all that is wanted is gold if the first desire of my heart be to become the instrument of leading the way to the east by a western and direct passage the second is to see the riches that will certainly follow such a discovery devoted to the service of god by rearing anew his altars and reviving his worship in the land where he endured his agony and gave up the ghost for the sins of men  isabella smiled at the navigators enthusiasm though sooth to say the sentiment found something of an echo in her pious bosom albeit the age of crusades appeared to have gone by not so exactly with ferdinand he smiled also but no answering sentiment of holy zeal was awakened within him he felt on the contrary a strong distrust of the wisdom of committing the care of even two insignificant caravels and the fate of a sum as small as three thousand crowns to a visionary who had scarcely made a commencement in one extremely equivocal enterprise before his thoughts were running on the execution of another that had baffled the united efforts and pious constancy of all europe to him the discovery of a western passage to the indies and the repossession of the holy sepulchre were results that were equally problematical and it would have been quite sufficient to incur his distrust to believe in the practicability of either here however was a man who was about to embark in an attempt to execute the first holding in reserve the last as a consequence of success in the undertaking in which he was already engaged  there were a few minutes during which ferdinand seriously contemplated the defeat of the genoeses schemes and had the discourse terminated here it is uncertain how far his cool and calculating policy might have prevailed over the good faith sincere integrity and newly awakened enthusiasm of his wife fortunately the conversation had gone on while he was meditating on this subject and when he rejoined the circle he found the queen and the navigator pursuing the subject with an earnestness that had entirely overlooked his momentary absence  i shall show your highness all that she demandeth continued columbus in answer to a question of the queens it is my expectation to reach the territories of the great khan the descendant of the monarch who was visited by the polos a century since at which time a strong desire to embrace the religion of christ was manifested by many in that gorgeous court the sovereign included we are told in the sacred books of prophecy that the day is to arrive when the whole earth will worship the true and living god and that time it would seem from many signs and tokens that are visible to those who seek them draweth near and is full of hope to such as honor god and seek his glory to bring all those vast regions in subjection to the church needeth but a constant faith sustained by the delegated agencies of the priesthood and the protecting hands of princes  this hath a seeming probability observed the queen and providence so guide us in this mighty undertaking that it may come to pass were those polos pious missionaries señor  they were but travellers men who sought their own advantage while they were not altogether unmindful of the duties of religion it may be well señora first to plant the cross in the islands and thence to spread the truth over the main land cipango in particular is a promising region for the commencement of the glorious work which no doubt will proceed with all the swiftness of a miracle  is this cipango known to produce spices or aught that may serve to uphold a sinking treasury and repay us for so much cost and risk asked the king a little inopportunely for the zeal of the two other interlocutors  isabella looked pained the prevailing trait in ferdinands character often causing her to feel as affectionate wives are wont to feel when their husbands forget to think act or speak up to the level of their own warmhearted and virtuous propensities but she suffered no other sign of the passing emotions to escape her  according to the accounts of marco polo your highness answered columbus earth hath no richer island it aboundeth especially in gold nor are pearls and precious stones at all rare but all that region is a quarter of infinite wealth and benighted infidelity providence seemeth to have united the first with the last as a reward to the christian monarch who shall use his power to extend the sway of the church the sea thereabouts is covered with smaller islands marco telling us that no less than seven thousand four hundred and forty have been enumerated not one of all which doth not produce some odoriferous tree or plant of delicious perfume it is then thither gracious lord and lady my honored sovereigns that i propose to proceed at once leaving all meaner objects to exalt the two kingdoms and to serve the church should we reach cipango in safety as by the blessing of god acting on a zeal and faith that are not easily shaken i trust we shall be able to do in the course of two months diligent navigation it will be my next purpose to pass over to the continent and seek the khan himself in his kingdom of cathay the day that my foot touches the land of asia will be a glorious day for spain and for all who have had a part in the accomplishment of so great an enterprise  ferdinands keen eyes were riveted on the navigator as he thus betrayed his hopes with the quiet but earnest manner of deep enthusiasm and he might have been at a loss himself just at that moment to have analyzed his own feelings the picture of wealth that columbus had conjured to his imagination was as enticing as his cold and calculating habits of distrust and caution rendered it questionable isabella heard only or thought only of the pious longings of her pure spirit for the conversion and salvation of the infidels and thus each of the two sovereigns had a favorite impulse to bind him or her to the prosecution of the voyage  after this the conversation entered more into details and the heads of the terms demanded by columbus were gone over again and approved of by those who were most interested in the matter all thought of the archbishop and his objections was momentarily lost and had the genoese been a monarch treating with monarchs he could not have had more reason to be satisfied with the respectful manner in which his terms were heard even his proposal to receive oneeighth of the profits of this and all future expeditions to the places he might discover on condition of his advancing an equal proportion of the outfits was cheerfully acceded to making him at once a partner with the crown in the risks and benefits of the many undertakings that it was hoped would follow from the success of this  luis de st angel and alonzo de quintanilla quitted the royal presence in company with columbus they saw him to his lodgings and left him with a respect and cordiality of manner that cheered a heart which had lately been so bruised and disappointed as they walked away in company the former who notwithstanding the liberality of his views and his strong support of the navigator was not apt to suppress his thoughts opened a dialogue in the following manner  by all the saints friend alonzo he exclaimed but this colon carrieth it with a high hand among us and in a way sometimes to make me doubt the prudence of our interference he hath treated with the two sovereigns like a monarch and like a monarch hath he carried his point  who hath aided him more than thyself friend luis returned  alonzo de quintanilla for without thy bold assault on doña isabellas patience the matter had been decided against this voyage and the genoese would still be on his way to the court of king louis  i regret it not the chance of keeping the frenchman within modest bounds being worth a harder effort her highnessheaven and all the saints unite to bless her for her upright intentions and generous thoughtswill never regret the trifling cost even though bootless with so great an aim in view but now the thing is done i marvel myself that a queen of castile and a king of aragon should grant such conditions to an unknown and nameless seafarer one that hath neither services family nor gold to recommend him  hath he not had luis de st angel of his side  that hath he returned the receivergeneral and that right stoutly too and for good and sufficient cause i only marvel at our success and at the manner in which this colon hath borne himself in the affair i much feared that the high price he set upon his services might ruin all our hopes  and yet thou didst reason with the queen as if thou thoughtst it insignificant compared with the good that would come of the voyage  is there aught wonderful in this my worthy friend we consume our means in efforts to obtain our ends and while suffering under the exhaustion begin first to see the other side of the question i am chiefly surprised at mine own success as for this genoese he is truly a most wonderful man and in my heart i think him right in demanding such high conditions if he succeed who so great as he and if he fail the conditions will do him no good and castile little harm  i have remarked señor de st angel that when grave men set a light value on themselves the world is apt to take them at their word though willing enough to laugh at the pretensions of triflers after all the high demands of colon may have done him much service since their highnesses could not but feel that they were negotiating with one who had faith in his own projects  it is much as thou sayest alonzo men often prizing us as we seem to prize ourselves so long as we act at all up to the level of our pretensions but there is sterling merit in this colon to sustain him in all that he sayeth and doth wisdom of speech dignity and gravity of mien and nobleness of feeling and sentiment truly i have listened to the man when he hath seemed inspired  well he hath now good occasion to manifest whether this inspiration be of the true quality or not returned the other of a verity i often distrust the wisdom of our own conclusions  in this manner did even these two zealous friends of columbus discuss his character and chances of success for while they were among the most decided of his supporters and had discovered the utmost readiness to uphold him when his cause seemed hopeless now that the means were likely to be afforded to allow him to demonstrate the justice of his opinions doubts and misgivings beset their minds such is human nature opposition awakens our zeal quickens our apprehension stimulates our reason and emboldens our opinions while thrown back upon ourselves for the proofs of what we have been long stoutly maintaining under the pressure of resistance we begin to distrust the truth of our own theories and to dread the demonstrations of a failure even the first disciples of the son of god faltered most in their faith as his predictions were being realized and most reformers are never so dogmatical and certain as when battling for their principles or so timid and wavering as when they are about to put their own longcherished plans in execution in all this we might see a wise provision of providence which gives us zeal to overcome difficulties and prudence when caution and moderation become virtues rather than faults  although luis de st angel and his friend conversed thus freely together however they did not the less continue true to their original feelings their doubts were transient and of little account and it was remarked of them whenever they were in the presence of columbus himself that the calm steady but deeply seated enthusiasm of that extraordinary man did not fail to carry with him the opinions not only of these steady supporters but those of most other listeners     chapter x                    song is on thy hills     oh sweet and mournful melodies of spain     that lulld my boyhood how your memory thrills     the exiles heart with suddenwakening pain      the forest sanctuary   from the moment that isabella pledged her royal word to support columbus in his great design all reasonable doubts of the sailing of the expedition ceased though few anticipated any results of importance of so much greater magnitude indeed did the conquest of the kingdom of granada appear at that instant than any probable consequences which could follow from this novel enterprise that the latter was almost overlooked in the allabsorbing interest that was connected with the former  there was one youthful and generous heart however all of whose hopes were concentrated in the success of the great voyage it is scarcely necessary to add we mean that of mercedes de valverde she had watched the recent events as they occurred with an intensity of expectation that perhaps none but the youthful fervent inexperienced and uncorrupted can feel and now that all her hopes were about to be realized a tender and generous joy diffused itself over her whole moral system in a way to render her happiness for the time even blissful although she loved so truly and with so much feminine devotedness nature had endowed this warmhearted young creature with a sagacity and readiness of apprehension which when quickened by the sentiments that are so apt to concentrate all the energies of her sex showed her the propriety of the distrust of the queen and her guardian and fully justified their hesitation in her eyes which were rather charmed than blinded by the ascendency of her passion she knew too well what was due to her virgin fame her high expectations her great name and her elevated position near the person and in the immediate confidence of isabella even to wish her hand unworthily bestowed and while she deferred with the dignity and discretion of birth and female decorum to all that opinion and prudence could have a right to ask of a noble maiden she confided in her lovers power to justify her choice with the boundless confidence of a woman her aunt had taught her to believe that this voyage of the genoese was likely to lead to great events and her religious enthusiasm like that of the queens led her to expect most of that which she so fervently wished  during the time it was known to those near the person of isabella that the conditions between the sovereigns and the navigators were being reduced to writing and were receiving the necessary forms luis neither sought an interview with his mistress nor was accidentally favored in that way but no sooner was it understood columbus had effected all that he deemed necessary in this particular and had quitted the court for the coast than the young man threw himself at once on the generosity of his aunt beseeching her to favor his views now that he was about to leave spain on an adventure that most regarded as desperate all he asked was a pledge of being well received by his mistress and her friends on his return successful  i see that thou hast taken a lesson from this new master of thine answered the highsouled but kindhearted beatriz smilingand would fain have thy terms also but thou knowest luis that mercedes de valverde is no peasants child to be lightly cared for but that she cometh of the noblest blood of spain having had a guzman for a mother and mendozas out of number among her kinsmen she is moreover one of the richest heiresses of castile and it would ill become her guardian to forget her watchfulness under such circumstances in behalf of one of the idle wanderers of christendom simply because he happeneth to be her own beloved brothers son  and if the doña mercedes be all thou sayest señoraand thou hast not even touched upon her highest claims to merit her heart her beauty her truth and her thousand virtuesbut if she be all that thou sayest doña beatriz is a bobadilla unworthy of her  how if she be moreover all thou sayest too don luis the heart the truth and the thousand virtues methinks a shorter catalogue might content one who is himself so great a rover lest some of these qualities be lost in his many journeys  luis laughed in spite of himself at the affected seriousness of his aunt and then successfully endeavoring to repress a little resentment that her language awakened he answered in a way to do no discredit to a wellestablished reputation for goodnature  i cannot call thee daughtermarchioness in imitation of her highness he answered with a coaxing smile so like that her deceased brother was wont to use when disposed to wheedle her out of some concession that it fairly caused doña beatriz to startbut i can say with more truth auntmarchionessand a very dear aunt toowilt thou visit a little youthful indiscretion so severely i had hoped now colon was about to set forth that all was forgotten in the noble and common end we have in view  luis returned the aunt regarding her nephew with the severe resolution that was so often exhibited in her acts as well as in her words dost think that a mere display of courage will prove sufficient to win mercedes from me to put to sleep the vigilance of her friends to gain the approbation of her guardian learn too confident boy that mercedes de guzman was the companion of my childhood my warmest dearest friend next to her highness and that she put all faith in my disposition to do full justice by her child she died by slow degrees and the fate of the orphan was often discussed between us that she could ever become the wife of any but a christian noble neither of us imagined possible but there are so many different characters under the same outward professions that names deceived us not i do believe that poor woman bethought her more of her childs future worldly fortunes than of her own sins and that she prayed oftener for the happy conclusion of the first than for the pardon of the last thou knowest little of the strength of a mothers love luis and canst not understand all the doubts that beset the heart when the parent is compelled to leave a tender plant like mercedes to the cold nursing of a selfish and unfeeling world  i can readily fancy the mother of my love fitted for heaven without the usual interpositions of masses and paters doña beatriz but have aunts no consideration for nephews as well as mothers for children  the tie is close and strong my child and yet is it not parental nor art thou a sensitive truehearted enthusiastic girl filled with the confidence of thy purity and overflowing with the affections that in the end make mothers what they are  by san iago and am i not the very youth to render such a creature happy i too am sensitivetoo much so in sooth for my own peace i too am truehearted as is seen by my having had but this one love when i might have had fifty and if i am not exactly overflowing with the confidence of purity i have the confidence of youth health strength and courage which is quite as useful for a cavalier and i have abundance of the affection that makes good fathers which is all that can reasonably be asked of a man  thou then thinkest thyself truant every way worthy to be the husband of mercedes de valverde  nay aunt of mine thou hast a searching way with thy questions who is or can be exactly worthy of so much excellence i may not be altogether deserving of her but then again i am not altogether undeserving of her i am quite as noble nearly as well endowed with estates of suitable years of fitting address as a knight and love her better than i love my own soul methinks the last should count for something since he that loveth devotedly will surely strive to render its object happy  thou art a silly inexperienced boy with a most excellent heart a happy careless disposition and a head that was made to hold better thoughts than commonly reside there exclaimed the aunt giving way to an impulse of natural feeling even while she frowned on her nephews folly but hear me and for once think gravely and reflect on what i say i have told thee of the mother of mercedes of her dying doubts her anxiety and of her confidence in me her highness and i were alone with her the morning of the day that her spirit took its flight to heaven and then she poured out all her feelings in a way that has left on us both an impression that can never cease while aught can be done by either for the security of the daughters happiness thou hast thought the queen unkind i know not but in thy intemperate speech thou hast dared to charge her highness with carrying her care for her subjects wellbeing beyond a sovereigns rights  nay doña beatriz hastily interrupted luis herein thou dost me great injustice i may have feltno doubt i have keenly bitterly felt the consequences of doña isabellas distrust of my constancy but never has rebel thought of mine even presumed to doubt her right to command all our services as well as all our lives this is due to her sacred authority from all but we who so well know the heart and motives of the queen also know that she doth naught from caprice or a desire to rule while she doth so much from affection to her people  as don luis uttered this with an earnest look and features flushed with sincerity it was impossible not to see that he meant as much as he said if men considered the consequences that often attend their lightest words less levity of speech would be used and the office of talebearer the meanest station in the whole catalogue of social rank would become extinct for want of occupation few cared less or thought less about the consequences of what they uttered than luis de bobadilla and yet this hasty but sincere reply did him good service with more than one of those who exercised a material influence over his fortunes the honest praise of the queen went directly to the heart of the marchioness who rather idolized than loved her royal mistress the long and close intimacy that had existed between them having made her thoroughly acquainted with the pure and almost holy character of isabella and when she repeated the words of her nephew to the latter her own wellestablished reputation for truth caused them to be implicitly believed whatever may be the correctness of our views in general one of the most certain ways to the feelings is the assurance of being respected and esteemed while of all the divine mandates the most difficult to find obedience is that which tells us to love those who hate us isabella notwithstanding her high destiny and lofty qualities was thoroughly a woman and when she discovered that in spite of her own coldness to the youth he really entertained so much profound deference for her character and appreciated her feelings and motives in a way that conscience told her she merited she was much better disposed to look at his peculiar faults with indulgence and to ascribe that to mere animal spirits which under less favorable auspices might possibly have been mistaken for ignoble propensities  but this is a little anticipating events the first consequence of luis speech was a milder expression in the countenance of his aunt and a disposition to consider his entreaties to be admitted to a private interview with mercedes with more indulgence  i may have done thee injustice in this luis resumed doña beatriz betraying in her manner the sudden change of feeling mentioned for i do think thee conscious of thy duty to her highness and of the almost heavenly sense of justice that reigneth in her heart and through that heart in castile thou hast not lost in my esteem by thus exhibiting thy respect and love for the queen for it is impossible to have any regard for female virtue and not to manifest it to its best representative  do i not also dear aunt in my attachment to thy ward is not my very choice in some sort a pledge of the truth and justice of my feelings in these particulars  ah luis de bobadilla it is not difficult to teach the heart to lean toward the richest and the noblest when she happeneth also to be the fairest maiden of spain  and am i a hypocrite marchioness dost thou accuse the son of thy brother of being a feigner of that which he doth not feelone influenced by so mean a passion as the love of gold and of lands  foreign lands heedless boy returned the aunt smiling but not of others lands no luis none that know thee will accuse thee of hypocrisy we believe in the truth and ardor of thy attachment and it is for that very cause that we most distrust thy passion  how are feigned feelings of more repute with the queen and thyself than real feelings a spurious and fancied love than the honest downright manly passion  it is this genuine feeling this honest downright manly passion as thou termest it which is most apt to awaken sympathy in the tender bosom of a young girl there is no truer touchstone by which to try the faithfulness of feelings than the heart when the head is not turned by vanity and the more unquestionable the passion the easier is it for its subject to make the discovery two drops of water do not glide together more naturally than two hearts nephew when there is a strong affinity between them didst thou not really love mercedes as my near and dear relative thou mightst laugh and sing in her company at all times that should be suitable for the dignity of a maiden and it would not cause me an uneasy moment  i am thy near and dear relative aunt of mine with a miracle and yet it is more difficult for me to get a sight of thy ward  who is the especial care of the queen of castile  well be it so and why should a bobadilla be proscribed by even a queen of castile  luis then had recourse to his most persuasive powers and improving the little advantage he had gained by dint of coaxing and teasing he so far prevailed on doña beatriz as to obtain a promise that she would apply to the queen for permission to grant him one private interview with mercedes we say the queen since isabella distrusting the influence of blood had cautioned the marchioness on this subject and the prudence of letting the young people see each other as little as possible had been fully settled between them it was in redeeming this promise that the aunt related the substance of the conversation that has just been given and mentioned to her royal mistress the state of her nephews feelings as respected herself the effect of such information was necessarily favorable to the young mans views and one of its first fruits was the desired permission to have the interview he sought  they are not sovereigns remarked the queen with a smile that the favorite could see was melancholy though it surpassed her means of penetration to say whether it proceeded from a really saddened feeling or whether it were merely the manner in which the mind is apt to glance backward at emotions that it is known can never be again awakened in our bosomsthey are not sovereigns daughtermarchioness to woo by proxy and wed as strangers it may not be wise to suffer the intercourse to become too common but it were cruel to deny the youth as he is about to depart on an enterprise of so doubtful issue one opportunity to declare his passion and to make his protestations of constancy if thy ward hath in truth any tenderness for him the recollection of this interview will soothe many a weary hour while don luis is away  and add fuel to the flame returned doña beatriz pointedly  we know not that my good beatriz since the heart being softened by the power of god to a sense of its religious duties may not the same kind hand direct it and shield it in the indulgence of its more worldly feelings mercedes will never forget her duty and the imagination feeding itself it may not be the wisest course to leave that of an enthusiast like our young charge so entirely to its own pictures realities are often less hazardous than the creatures of the fancy then thy nephew will not be a loser by the occasion for by keeping constantly in view the object he now seemeth to pursue so earnestly he will the more endeavor to deserve success  i much fear señora that the best conclusions are not to be depended on in an affair that touches the waywardness of the feelings  perhaps not beatriz and yet i do not see that we can well deny this interview now that don luis is so near departure tell him i accord him that which he so desireth and let him bear in mind that a grandee should never quit castile without presenting himself before his sovereign  i fear your highness returned the marchioness laughing that don luis will feel this last command however gracious and kind in fact as a strong rebuke since he hath more than once done this already without even presenting himself before his own aunt  on those occasions he went idly and without consideration but he is now engaged in an honorable and noble enterprise and we will make it apparent to him that all feel the difference  the conversation now changed it being understood that the request of the young man was to be granted isabella had in this instance departed from a law she had laid down for her own government under the influence of her womanly feelings which often caused her to forget that she was a queen when no very grave duties existed to keep alive the recollection for it would have been difficult to decide in which light this pureminded and excellent female most merited the esteem of mankindin her high character as a just and conscientious sovereign or when she acted more directly under the gentler impulses of her sex as for her friend she was perhaps more tenacious of doing what she conceived to be her duty by her ward than the queen herself since with a greater responsibility she was exposed to the suspicion of acting with a design to increase the wealth and to strengthen the connections of her own family still the wishes of isabella were laws to the marchioness of moya and she sought an early opportunity to acquaint her ward with her intention to allow don luis for once to plead his own cause with his mistress before he departed on his perilous and mysterious enterprise  our heroine received this intelligence with the mingled sensations of apprehension delight misgivings and joy that are so apt to beset the female heart in the freshness of its affections when once brought in subjection to the masterpassion she had never thought it possible luis would sail on an expedition like that in which he was engaged without endeavoring to see her alone but now she was assured that both the queen and her guardian acquiesced in his being admitted she almost regretted their compliance these contradictory emotions however soon subsided in the tender melancholy that gradually drew around her manner as the hour for the departure approached nor were her feelings on the subject of luis ready enlistment in the expedition more consistent at times she exulted in her lovers resolution and in his manly devotion to glory and the good of the church remembering with pride that of all the high nobility of castile he alone ventured life and credit with the genoese and then again tormenting doubts came over her as she feared that the love of roving and of adventure was quite as active in his heart as love of herself but in all this there was nothing new the more pure and ingenuous the feelings of those who truly submit to the influence of this passion the more keenly alive are their distrusts apt to be and the more tormenting their misgivings of themselves  her mind made up doña beatriz acted fairly by the young people as soon as luis was admitted to her own presence on the appointed morning she told him that he was expected by mercedes who was waiting his appearance in the usual receptionroom scarce giving himself time to kiss the hand of his aunt and to make those other demonstrations of respect that the customs of the age required from the young to their seniorsmore especially when there existed between them a tie of blood as close as that which united the marchioness of moya with the conde de llerathe young man bounded away and was soon in the presence of his mistress as mercedes was prepared for the interview she betrayed the feeling of the moment merely by a heightened color and the greater lustre of eyes that were always bright though often so soft and melancholy  luis escaped from her and then as if ashamed of the emotion betrayed in the very tones of her voice she withdrew the foot that had involuntarily advanced to meet him even while she kept a hand extended in friendly confidence  mercedes and the hand was withdrawn to put a stop to the kisses with which it was covered thou art harder to be seen of late than it will be to discover this cathay of the genoese for between the doña isabella and doña beatriz never was paradise watched more closely by guardian angels than thy person is watched by thy protectors  and can it be necessary luis when thou art the danger apprehended  do they think i shall carry thee off like some moorish girl borne away on the crupper of a christian knights saddle and place thee in the caravel of colon that we may go in search of prestor john and the great khan in company  they may think thee capable of this act of madness dear luis but they will hardly suspect me  no thou art truly a model of prudence in all matters that require feeling for thy lover  luis exclaimed the girl again and this time unbidden tears started to her eyes  forgive me mercedesdearest dearest mercedes but this delay and all these coldly cruel precautions make me forget myself am i a needy and unknown adventurer that they treat me thus instead of being a noble castilian knight  thou forgettest luis that noble castilian maidens are not wont to see even noble castilian cavaliers alone and but for the gracious condescension of her highness and the indulgence of my guardian who happeneth to be thy aunt this interview could not take place  alone and dost thou call this being alone or any excessive favor on the part of her highness when thou seest that we are watched by the eye if not by the ear i fear to speak above my breath lest the sounds should disturb that venerable ladys meditations  as luis de bobadilla uttered this he glanced his eye at the figure of the dueña of his mistress whose person was visible through an open door in an adjoining room where the good woman sat intently occupied in reading certain homilies  dost mean my poor pepita answered mercedes laughing for the presence of her attendant to whom she had been accustomed from infancy was no more restraint on her own innocent thoughts and words than would have proved a reduplication of herself had such a thing been possible many have been her protestations against this meeting which she insists is contrary to all rule among noble ladies and which she says would never have been accorded by my poor sainted mother were she still living  ay she hath a look that is sufficient of itself to set every generous mind atilting with her one can see envy of thy beauty and youth in every wrinkle of her unamiable face  then little dost thou know my excellent pepita who envieth nothing and who hath but one marked weakness and that is too much affection and too much indulgence for myself  i detest a dueña ay as i detest an infidel  señor said pepita whose vigilant ears notwithstanding her book and the homilies heard all that passed this is a common feeling among youthful cavaliers i fear but they tell me that the very dueña who is so displeasing to the lover getteth to be a grateful object in time with the husband as my features and wrinkles however are so disagreeable to you and no doubt cause you pain by closing this door the sight will be shut out as indeed will be the sound of my unpleasant cough and of your own protestations of love señor knight  this was said in much better language than was commonly used by women of the dueñas class and with a goodnature that seemed indomitable it being completely undisturbed by luis petulant remarks  thou shalt not close the door pepita cried mercedes blushing rosy red and springing forward to interpose her own hand against the act what is there that the conde de llera can have to say to one like me that thou mayest not hear  nay dear child the noble cavalier is about to talk of love  and is it thou with whom the language of affection is so uncommon that it frighteneth thee hath thy discourse been of aught but love since thou hast known and cared for me  it augureth badly for thy suit señor said pepita smiling while she suspended the movement of the hand that was about to close the door if doña mercedes thinketh of your love as she thinketh of mine surely child thou dost not fancy me a gay gallant young noble come to pour out his soul at thy feet and mistakest my simple words of affection for such as will be likely to flow from the honeyed tongue of a bobadilla bent on gaining his suit with the fairest maiden of castile  mercedes shrunk back for though innocent as purity itself her heart taught her the difference between the language of her lover and the language of her nurse even when each most expressed affection her hand released its hold of the wood and unconsciously was laid with its pretty fellow on her crimsoned face pepita profited by her advantage and closed the door a smile of triumph gleamed on the handsome features of luis and after he had forced his mistress by a gentle compulsion to resume the seat from which she had risen to meet him he threw himself on a stool at her feet and stretching out his wellturned limbs in an easy attitude so as to allow himself to gaze into the beautiful face that he had set up like an idol before him he renewed the discourse  this is a paragon of dueñas he cried and i might have known that none of the illtempered unreasonable school of such beings would be tolerated near thy person this pepita is a jewel and she may consider herself established in her office for life if by the cunning of this genoese mine own resolution the queens repentance and thy gentle favor i ever prove so lucky as to become thy husband  thou forgettest luis answered mercedes trembling even while she laughed at her own conceit that if the husband esteemeth the dueña the lover could not endure that the lover may esteem the dueña that the husband may be unwilling to abide  peste these are crooked matters and illsuited to the straightforward philosophy of luis de bobadilla there is one thing only which i can or do pretend to know out of any controversy and that i am ready to maintain in the face of all the doctors of salamanca or all the chivalry of christendom that of the infidel included which is that thou art the fairest sweetest best most virtuous and in all things the most winning maiden of spain and that no other living knight so loveth and honoreth his mistress as i love and honor thee  the language of admiration is ever soothing to female ears and mercedes giving to the words of the youth an impression of sincerity that his manner fully warranted forgot the dueña and her little interruption in the delight of listening to declarations that were so grateful to her affections still the coyness of her sex and the recent date of their mutual confidence rendered her answer less open than it might otherwise have been  i am told she said that you young cavaliers who pant for occasions to show your skill and courage with the lance and in the tourney are ever making some such protestations in favor of this or that noble maiden in order to provoke others like themselves to make counter assertions that they may show their prowess as knights and gain high names for gallantry  this cometh of being so much shut up in doña beatrizs private rooms lest some bold spanish eyes should look profanely on thy beauty mercedes we are not in the age of the errants and the troubadours when men committed a thousand follies that they might be thought weaker even than nature had made them in that age your knights discoursed largely of love but in our own they feel it in sooth i think this savoreth of some of the profound morality of pepita  say naught against pepita luis who hath much befriended thee today else would thy tongue and thine eyes too be under the restraint of her presence but that which thou termest the morality of the good dueña is in truth the morality of the excellent and most noble doña beatriz de cabrera marchioness of moya who was born a lady of the house of bobadilla i believe  well well i dare to say there is no great difference between the lessons of a duchess and the lessons of a dueña in the privacy of the closet when there is one like thee beautiful and rich and virtuous to guard they say you young maidens are told that we cavaliers are so many ogres and that the only way to reach paradise is to think naught of us but evil and then when some suitable marriage hath been decided on the poor young creature is suddenly alarmed by an order to come forth and be wedded to one of these very monsters  and in this mode hast thou been treated it would seem that much pains are taken to make the young of the two sexes think ill of each other but luis this is pure idleness and we waste in it most precious moments moments that may never return how go matters with colonand when is he like to quit the court  he hath already departed for having obtained all he hath sought of the queen he quitted santa fé with the royal authority to sustain him in the fullest manner if thou hearest aught of one pedro de muños or pero gutierrez at the court of cathay thou wilt know on whose shoulders to lay his follies  i would rather that thou shouldst undertake this voyage in thine own name luis than under a feigned appellation concealments of this nature are seldom wise and surely thou dost not undertake the enterprisethe telltale blood stole to the cheeks of mercedes as she proceededwith a motive that need bring shame  tis the wish of my aunt as for myself i would put thy favor in my casque thy emblem on my shield and let it be known far and near that luis of llera sought the court of cathay with the intent to defy its chivalry to produce as fair or as virtuous a maiden as thyself  we are not in the age of errants sir knight but in one of reason and truth returned mercedes laughing though every syllable that proved the earnest and entire devotion of the young man went directly to her heart strengthening his hold on it and increasing the flame that burnt within by adding the fuel that was most adapted to that purposewe are not in the age of knightserrant don luis de bobadilla as thou thyself hast just affirmed but one in which even the lover is reflecting and as apt to discover the faults of his ladylove as to dwell upon her perfections i look for better things from thee than to hear that thou hast ridden through the highways of cathay defying to combat and seeking giants in order to exalt my beauty and tempting others to decry it if it were only out of pure opposition to thy idle boastings ah luis thou art now engaged in a most truly noble enterprise one that will join thy name to those of the applauded of men and which will form thy pride and exultation in afterlife when the eyes of us both shall be dimmed by age and we shall look back with longings to discover aught of which to be proud  it was thrice pleasant to the youth to hear his mistress in the innocence of her heart and in the fulness of her feelings thus uniting his fate with her own and when she ceased speaking all unconscious how much might be indirectly implied from her words he still listened intently as if he would fain hear the sounds after they had died on his ear  what enterprise can be nobler more worthy to awaken all my resolution than to win thy hand he exclaimed after a short pause i follow colon with no other object share his chances to remove the objections of doña isabella and will accompany him to the earths end rather than that thy choice should be dishonored thou art my great khan beloved mercedes and thy smiles and affection are the only cathay i seek  say not so dear luis for thou knowest not the nobility of thine own soul nor the generosity of thine own intentions this is a stupendous project of colons and much as i rejoice that he hath had the imagination to conceive it and the heart to undertake it in his own person on account of the good it must produce to the heathen and the manner in which it will necessarily redound to the glory of god still i fear that i am equally gladdened with the recollection that thy name will be forever associated with the great achievement and thy detractors put to shame with the resolution and spirit with which so noble an end will have been attained  this is nothing but truth mercedes should we reach the indies but should the saints desert us and our project fail i fear that even thou wouldst be ashamed to confess an interest in an unfortunate adventurer who hath returned without success and thereby made himself the subject of sneers and derision instead of wearing the honorable distinction that thou seemest so confidently to expect  then luis de bobadilla thou knowest me not answered mercedes hastily and speaking with a tender earnestness that brought the blood into her cheeks gradually brightening the brilliancy of her eyes until they shone with a lustre that seemed almost supernaturalthen luis de bobadilla thou knowest me not i wish thee to share in the glory of this enterprise because calumny and censure have not been altogether idle with thy youth and because i feel that her highness favor is most easily obtained by it but if thou believest that the spirit to engage with colon was necessary to incline me to think kindly of my guardians nephew thou neither understandest the sentiments that draw me toward thee nor hast a just appreciation of the hours of sorrow i have suffered on thy account  dearest most generous noblehearted girl i am unworthy of thy truth of thy pure sincerity and of all thy devoted feelings drive me from thee at once that i may neer again cause thee a moments grief  nay luis thy remedy i fear me would prove worse than the disease that thou wouldst cure returned the beautiful girl smiling and blushing as she spoke and turning her eloquent eyes on the youth in a way to avow volumes of tenderness with thee must i be happy or unhappy as providence may will it or miserable without thee  the conversation now took that unconnected and yet comprehensive cast which is apt to characterize the discourse of those who feel as much as they reason and it covered more interests sentiments and events than our limits will allow us to record as usual luis was inconsistent jealous repentant full of passion and protestations fancying a thousand evils at one instant and figuring in his imagination a terrestrial paradise at the next while mercedes was enthusiastic generous devoted and yet highprincipled selfdenying and womanly meeting her ardent suitors vows with a tenderness that seemed to lose all other considerations in her love and repelling with maiden coyness and with the dignity of her sex his rhapsodies whenever they touched upon the exaggerated and indiscreet  the interview lasted an hour and it is scarce necessary to say that vows of constancy and pledges never to marry another were given again and again as the time for separating approached mercedes opened a small casket that contained her jewels and drew forth one which she offered to her lover as a gage of her truth  i will not give thee a glove to wear in thy casque at tourneys luis she said but i offer this holy symbol which may remind thee at the same moment of the great pursuit thou hast before thee and of her who will wait its issue with doubts and fears little less active than those of colon himself thou needst no other crucifix to say thy paters before and these stones are sapphires which thou knowest are the tokens of fidelitya feeling that thou mayst encourage as respects thy lasting welfare and which it would not grieve me to know thou keptst ever active in thy bosom when thinking of the unworthy giver of the trifle  this was said half in melancholy and half in lightness of heart for mercedes felt at parting both a weight of sorrow that was hard to be borne and a buoyancy of the very feeling to which she had just alluded that much disposed her to smile and it was said with those winning accents with which the youthful and tender avow their emotions when the heart is subdued by the thoughts of absence and dangers the gift was a small cross formed of the stones she had named and of great intrinsic value as well as precious from the motives and character of her who offered it  thou hast had a care of my soul in this mercedes said luis smiling when he had kissed the jewelled cross again and againand art resolved if the sovereign of cathay should refuse to be converted to our faith that we shall not be converted to his i fear that my offering will appear tame and valueless in thine eyes after so precious a boon  one lock of thy hair luis is all i desire thou knowest that i have no need of jewels  if i thought the sight of my bushy head would give thee pleasure every hair should quit it and i would sail from spain with a poll as naked as a priests or even an infidels but the bobadillas have their jewels and a bobadillas bride shall wear them this necklace was my mothers mercedes it is said to have once been the property of a queen though none have ever worn it who will so honor it as thou  i take it luis for it is thy offering and may not be refused and yet i take it tremblingly for i see signs of our different natures in these gifts thou hast chosen the gorgeous and the brilliant which pall in time and seldom lead to contentment while my womans heart hath led me to constancy i fear some brilliant beauty of the east would better gain thy lasting admiration than a poor castilian maid who hath little but her faith and love to recommend her  protestations on the part of the young man followed and mercedes permitted one fond and long embrace ere they separated she wept on the bosom of don luis and at the final moment of parting as ever happens with woman feeling got the better of form and her whole soul confessed its weakness at length luis tore himself away from her presence and that night he was on his way to the coast under an assumed name and in simple guise whither columbus had already preceded  illustration     chapter xi      but where is harold shall i then forget     to urge the gloomy wanderer oer the wave     little reckd he of all that men regret     no loved one now in feignd lament could rave     no friend the parting hand extended gave     ere the cold stranger passd to other climes      byron   the reader is not to suppose that the eyes of europe were on our adventurers truth and falsehood inseparable companions it would seem throughout all time were not then diffused over the land by means of newspapers with mercenary diligence and it was only the favored few who got early intelligence of enterprises like that in which columbus was engaged luis de bobadilla had therefore stolen from court unnoticed and they who came in time to miss his presence either supposed him to be on a visit to one of his castles or to have gone forth on another of those wandering tours which were supposed to be blemishes on his chivalry and unworthy of his birth as for the genoese himself his absence was scarcely heeded though it was understood among the courtiers generally that isabella had entered into some arrangement with him which gave the adventurer higher rank and greater advantages than his future services would probably ever justify the other principal adventurers were too insignificant to attract much attention and they had severally departed for the coast without the knowledge of their movements extending far beyond the narrow circles of their own acquaintances neither was this expedition so bold in its conception and so momentous in its consequences destined to sail from one of the more important ports of spain but orders to furnish the necessary means had been sent to a haven of altogether inferior rank and which would seem to have possessed no other recommendations for this particular service than hardy mariners and a position without the pass of gibraltar which was sometimes rendered hazardous by the rovers of africa the order however is said to have been issued to the place selected in consequence of its having incurred some legal penalty by which it had been condemned to serve the crown for a twelvemonth with two armed caravels such punishments it would seem were part of the policy of an age in which navies were little more than levies on seaports and when fleets were usually manned by soldiers from the land  palos de moguer the place ordered to pay this tribute for its transgression was a town of little importance even at the close of the fifteenth century and it has since dwindled to an insignificant fishing village like most places that are little favored by nature its population was hardy and adventurous as adventure was then limited by ignorance it possessed no stately caracks its business and want of opulence confining all its efforts to the lighter caravel and the still more diminutive felucca all the succor indeed that columbus had been able to procure from the two crowns by his protracted solicitations was the order for the equipment of the two caravels mentioned with the additional officers and men that always accompanied a royal expedition the reader however is not to infer from this fact any niggardliness of spirit or any want of faith on the part of isabella it was partly owing to the exhausted condition of her treasury a consequence of the late war with the moor and more perhaps to the experience and discretion of the great navigator himself who well understood that for the purposes of discovery vessels of this size would be more useful and secure than those that were larger  on a rocky promontory at a distance of less than a league from the village of palos stood the convent of la rabida since rendered so celebrated by its hospitality to columbus at the gate of this building seven years before the navigator leading his youthful son by the hand had presented himself a solicitor for food in behalf of the wearied boy the story is too well known to need repetition here and we will merely add that his long residence in this convent and the firm friends he had made of the holy franciscans who occupied it as well as among others in their vicinity were also probably motives that influenced him in directing the choice of the crown to this particular place columbus had not only circulated his opinions with the monks but with the more intelligent of the neighborhood and the first converts he made in spain were at this place  notwithstanding all the circumstances named the order of the crown to prepare the caravels in question spread consternation among the mariners of palos in that age it was thought a wonderful achievement to follow the land along the coast of africa and to approach the equator the vaguest notions existed in the popular mind concerning those unknown regions and many even believed that by journeying south it was possible to reach a portion of the earth where animal and vegetable life must cease on account of the intense heat of the sun the revolution of the planets the diurnal motion of the earth and the causes of the changes in the seasons were then profound mysteries even to the learned or if glimmerings of the truth did exist they existed as the first rays of the dawn dimly and hesitatingly announce the approach of day it is not surprising therefore that the simpleminded and unlettered mariners of palos viewed the order of the crown as a sentence of destruction on all who might be fated to obey it the ocean when certain limits were passed was thought to be like the firmament a sort of chaotic void and the imaginations of the ignorant had conjured up currents and whirlpools that were believed to lead to fiery climates and frightful scenes of natural destruction some even fancied it possible to reach the uttermost boundaries of the earth and to slide off into vacuum by means of swift but imperceptible currents  such was the state of things in the middle of the month of july columbus was still in the convent of rabida in the company of his constant friend and adherent fray juan perez when a lay brother came to announce that a stranger had arrived at the gate asking earnestly for the señor christoval colon  hath he the aspect of a messenger from the court demanded the navigator for since the failure of the mission of juan de peñalosa there is need of further orders from their highnesses to enforce their gracious intentions  i think not señor answered the lay brother these hardriding couriers of the queen generally appearing with their steeds in a foam and with hurried air and blustering voices whereas this young cavalier behaveth modestly and rideth a stout andalusian mule  did he give thee his name good sancho  he gave me two señor styling himself pedro de muños or pedro gutierrez without the don  this is well exclaimed columbus turning a little quickly toward the door but otherwise maintaining a perfect selfcommand i expect the youth and he is right welcome let him come in at once good sancho and that without any useless ceremony  an acquaintance of the court señor observed the prior in the way one indirectly asks a question  a youth that hath the spirit father to adventure life and character for the glory of god through the advancement of his church by embarking in our enterprise he cometh of a reputable lineage and is not without the gifts of fortune but for the care of guardians and his own youth gold would not have been wanting in our need as it is he ventureth his own person if one can be said to risk aught in an expedition that seemeth truly to set even the orders of their highnesses at defiance  as columbus ceased speaking the door opened and luis de bobadilla entered the young grandee had laid aside all the outward evidences of his high rank and now appeared in the modest guise of a traveller belonging to a class more likely to furnish a recruit for the voyage than one of the rank he really was saluting columbus with cordial and sincere respect and the franciscan with humble deference the first at once perceived that this gallant and reckless spirit had truly engaged in the enterprise with a determination to use all the means that would enable him to go through with it  thou art welcome pedro columbus observed as soon as luis had made his salutations thou hast reached the coast at a moment when thy presence and support may be exceedingly useful the first order of her highness by which i should have received the services of the two caravels to which the state is entitled hath been utterly disregarded and a second mandate empowering me to seize upon any vessel that may suit our necessities hath fared but little better notwithstanding the señor de peñalosa was sent directly from court to enforce its conditions under a penalty to the port of paying a daily tax of two hundred maravedis until the order should be fulfilled the idiots have conjured all sorts of ills with which to terrify themselves and their neighbors and i seem to be as far from the completion of my hopes as i was before i procured the friendship of this holy friar and the royal protection of doña isabella it is a weary thing my good pedro to waste a life in hopes defeated with such an object in view as the spread of knowledge and the extension of the church  i am the bearer of good tidings señor answered the young noble in coming hither from the town of moguer i journeyed with one martin alonzo pinzon a mariner with whom i have formerly voyaged and we have had much discourse concerning your commission and difficulties he tells me that he is known to you señor colon and i should judge from his discourse that he thinketh favorably of the chances  he dothhe doth indeed good pedro and hath often listened to my reasoning like a discreet and skilful navigator as i make no question he really is but didst thou say that thou wast known to him  señor i did we have voyaged together as far as cyprus on one occasion and again to the island of the english in such long voyages men get to some knowledge of each others temperament and disposition and of a sooth i think well of both in this señor pinzon  thou art young to pass an opinion on a mariner of martin alonzos years and experience son put in the friar a man of much repute in this vicinity and of no little wealth nevertheless i am rejoiced to hear that he continueth of the same mind as formerly in relation to the great voyage for of late i did think even he had begun to waver  don luis had expressed himself of the great man of the vicinity more like a bobadilla than became his assumed name of muños and a glance from the eye of columbus told him to forget his rank and to remember the disguise he had assumed  this is truly encouraging observed the navigator and openeth a brighter view of cathay thou wast journeying between moguer and palos i think thou saidst when this discourse was had with our acquaintance the good martin alonzo  i was señor and it was he who sent me hither in quest of the admiral he gave you the title that the queens favor hath bestowed and i consider that no small sign of friendship as most others with whom i have conversed in this vicinity seem disposed to call you by any other name  none need embark in this enterprise returned the navigator gravely as if he would admonish the youth that this was an occasion on which he might withdraw from the adventure if he saw fit who feel disposed to act differently or who distrust my knowledge  by san pedro my patron they tell another tale at palos and at moguer señor amirale returned luis laughing at which places i hear that no man whose skin hath been a little warmed by the sun of the ocean dare show himself in the highways lest he be sent to cathay by a road that no one ever yet travelled except in fancy there is notwithstanding one free and willing volunteer señor colon who is disposed to follow you to the edge of the earth if it be flat and to follow you quite around it should it prove to be a sphere and that is one pedro de muños who engageth with you from no sordid love of gold or love of aught else that men usually prize but from the pure love of adventure somewhat excited and magnified perhaps by love of the purest and fairest maid of castile  fray juan perez gazed at the speaker whose free manner and open speech a good deal surprised him for columbus had succeeded in awakening so much respect that few presumed to use any levity in his presence even before he was dignified by the high rank so recently conferred by the commission of isabella little did the good monk suspect that one of a still higher personal rank though entirely without official station stood before him in the guise of pedro de muños and he could not refrain from again expressing the little relish he felt for such freedom of speech and deportment toward those whom he himself habitually regarded with so much respect  it would seem señor pedro de muños he said if that be thy namethough duke or marquis or count would be a title better becoming thy bearingthat thou treatest his excellency the admiral with quite as much freedom of thought at least as thou treatest the worthy martin alonzo of our own neighborhood a follower should be more humble and not pass his jokes on the opinions of his leader in this loose style of expression  i crave your pardon holy father and that of the admiral too who better understandeth me i trust if there be any just grounds of offence all i wish to express is that i know this martin alonzo of your neighborhood as an old fellowvoyager that we have ridden some leagues in company this very day and that after close discourse he hath manifested a friendly desire to put his shoulder to the wheel in order to lift the expedition if not from a slough of mud at least from the sands of the river and that he hath promised to come also to this good convent of la rabida for that same purpose and no other as for myself i can only add that here i am ready to follow wheresoever the honorable señor colon may see fit to lead  tis well good pedrotis well rejoined the admiral i give thee full credit for sincerity and spirit and that must content thee until an opportunity offereth to convince others i like these tidings concerning martin alonzo father since he might truly do us much good service and his zeal had assuredly begun to flag  that might he and that will he if he engageth seriously in the affair martin is the greatest navigator on all this coast for though i did not know that he had ever been even to cyprus as would appear by the account of this youth i was well aware that he had frequently sailed as far north as france and as far south as the canaries dost think cathay much more remote than cyprus señor almirante  columbus smiled at this question and shook his head in the manner of one who would prepare a friend for some sore disappointment  although cyprus be not distant from the holy land and the seat of the infidels power he answered cathay must lie much more remote i flatter not myself nor those who are disposed to follow me with the hope of reaching the indies short of a voyage that shall extend to some eight hundred or a thousand leagues  tis a fearful and a weary distance exclaimed the franciscan while luis stood in smiling unconcern equally indifferent whether he had to traverse onethousand or ten thousand leagues of ocean so that the journey led to mercedes and was productive of adventure a fearful and weary distance and yet i doubt not señor almirante that you are the very man designed by providence to overcome it and to open the way for those who will succeed you bearing on high the cross of christ and the promises of his redemption  let us hope this returned columbus reverently making the usual sign of the sacred emblem to which his friend alluded as a proof that we have some worldly foundation for the expectation here cometh the señor pinzon himself apparently hot with haste to see us  martin alonzo pinzon whose name is so familiar to the reader as one who greatly aided the genoese in his vast undertaking now entered the room seemingly earnest and bent on some fixed purpose as columbus observant eye had instantly detected fray juan perez was not a little surprised to see that the first salutation of martin alonzo the great man of the neighborhood was directed to pedro the second to the admiral and the third to himself there was not time however for the worthy franciscan who was a little apt to rebuke any dereliction of decency on the spot to express what he felt on this occasion ere martin alonzo opened his errand with an eagerness that showed he had not come on a mere visit of friendship or of ceremony  i am sorely vexed señor almirante he commenced at learning the obstinacy and the disobedience to the orders of the queen that have been shown among our mariners of palos although a dweller of the port itself and one who hath always viewed your opinions of this western voyage with respect if not with absolute faith i did not know the full extent of this insubordination until i met by accident an old acquaintance on the highway in the person of don pedroi ought to say the señor pedro de muños here who coming from a distance as he doth hath discovered more of our backslidings than i had learned myself on the spot but señor you are not now to hear for the first time of what sort of stuff men are made they are reasoning beings we are told notwithstanding which undeniable truth as there is not one in a hundred who is at the trouble to do his own thinking means may be found to change the opinions of a sufficient number for all your wants without their even suspecting it  this is very true neighbor martin alonzo put in the friarso true that it might go into a homily and do no disservice to religion man is a rational animal and an accountable animal but it is not meet that he should be a thinking animal in matters of the church now its interests being entrusted to a ministry what have the unlearned and ignorant to say of its affairs in matters of navigation it doth indeed seem as if one steersman were better than a hundred although man be a reasoning animal there are quite as many occasions when he is bound to obey without reasoning and few when he should be permitted to reason without obeying  all true holy friar and most excellent neighbor so true that you will find no one in palos to deny that at least and now we are on the subject i may as well add that it is the church that hath thrown more obstacles in the way of the señor almirantes success than any other cause all the old women of the port declare that the notion of the earths being round is a heresy and contrary to the bible and if the truth must be said there are not a few underlings of this very convent who uphold them in the opinion it doth appear unnatural to tell one who hath never quitted the land and who seeth himself much oftener in a valley than on an eminence that the globe is round and though i have had many occasions to see the ocean it would not easily find credit with me were it not for the fact that we see the upper and smaller sails of a ship first when approaching her as well as the vanes and crosses of towns albeit they are the smaller objects about vessels and churches we mariners have one way to inspirit our followers and you churchmen have another and now that i intend to use my means to put wiser thoughts into the heads of the seamen of palos reverend friar i look to you to set the churchs engines at work so as to silence the women and to quell the doubts of the most zealous among your own brotherhood  am i to understand by this señor pinzon demanded columbus that you intend to take a direct and more earnest interest than before in the success of my enterprise  señor you may that is my intention if we can come to as favorable an understanding about the terms as your worship would seem to have entered into with our most honored mistress doña isabella de trastamara i have had some discourse with señor doni would say with the señor pedro de muños hereodds folly an excess of courtesy is getting to be a vice with me of latebut as he is a youth of prudence and manifests a desire to embark with you it hath stirred my fancy so far that i would gladly be of the party señor de muños and i have voyaged so much together that i would fain see his worthy countenance once more upon the ocean  these are cheerful tidings martin alonzoeagerly put in the friar and thy soul and the souls of all who belong to you will reap the benefits of this manly and pious resolution it is one thing señor almirante to have their highnesses of your side in a place like palos and another to have our worthy neighbor pinzon here for if they are sovereigns in law he is an emperor in opinion i doubt not that the caravels will now be speedily forthcoming  since thou seemest to have truly resolved to enter into our enterprise señor martin alonzo added columbus with his dignified gravity out of doubt thou hast well bethought thee of the conditions and art come prepared to let them be known do they savor of the terms that have already been in discussion between us  señor admiral they do though gold is not just now as abundant in our purses as when we last discoursed on this subject on that head some obstacles may exist but on all others i doubt not a brief explanation between us will leave the matter free from doubt  as to the eighth for which i stand committed with their highnesses señor pinzon there will be less reason now to raise that point between us than when we last met as other means may offer to redeem that pledgeas columbus spoke his eyes involuntarily turned toward the pretended pedro whither those of martin alonzo pinzon significantly followed but there will be many difficulties to overcome with these terrified and silly mariners which may yield to thy influence if thou wilt come with me into this chamber we will at once discuss the heads of our treaty leaving this youth the while to the hospitality of our reverend friend  the prior raising no objection to this proposition it was immediately put in execution columbus and pinzon withdrawing to a more private apartment leaving fray juan perez alone with our hero  then thou thinkest seriously son of making one in this great enterprise of the admirals said the franciscan as soon as the door was closed on those who had just left them eyeing luis for the first time with a more strict scrutiny than hitherto he had leisure to exercise thou carriest thyself much like the young lords of the court and wilt have occasion to acquire a less towering air in the narrow limits of one of our palos caravels  i am no stranger to nao carraca fusta pinaza carabelon or felucca holy prior and shall carry myself with the admiral as i should carry myself before don fernando of aragon were he my fellowvoyager or in the presence of boabdil of grenada were that unhappy monarch again seated on the throne from which he hath been so lately hurled urging his chivalry to charge the knights of christian spain  these are fine words son ay and uttered with a tilting air if truth must be said but they will avail thee nothing with this genoese who hath that in him that would leave him unabashed even in the presence of our gracious lady doña isabella herself  thou knowest the queen holy monk inquired luis forgetting his assumed character in the freedom of his address  i ought to know her inmost heart son for often have i listened to her pure and meek spirit in the secrets of the confessional much as she is beloved by us castilians no one can know the true spiritual elevation of that pious princess and most excellent woman but they who have had occasion to shrive her  don luis hemmed played with the handle of his rapier and then gave utterance to the uppermost thought as usual  didst thou by any chance of thy priestly office father ever find it necessary to confess a maiden of the court who is much esteemed by the queen he inquired and whose spirit ill answer for it is as pure as that of doña isabellas itself  son thy question denoteth greater necessity for repairing to salamanca in order to be instructed in the history and practices and faith of the church than to be entering into an enterprise even as commendable as this of colons dost thou not know that we churchmen are not permitted to betray the secrets of the confessional or to draw comparisons between penitents and moreover that we do not take even doña isabella the blessed maria keep her ever in mind as the standard of holiness to which all christians are expected to aim the maiden of whom thou speakest may be virtuous according to worldly notions and yet a grievous sinner in the eyes of mother church  i should like before i quit spain to hear a mendoza or a guzman who hath not a shaven crown venture to hint as much most reverend prior  thou art hot and restive and talkest idly son what would one like thee find to say to a guzman or a mendoza or a bobadilla even did he affirm what thou wishest but who is the maid in whom thy feelings seem to take so deep although i question if it be not an unrequited interest  nay i did but speak in idleness our stations have made such a chasm between us that it is little likely we should ever come to speech nor is my merit such as would be apt to cause her to forget her high advantages  still she hath a name  she hath truly prior and a right noble one it is i had the doña maria de las mercedes de valverde in my thoughts when the light remark found utterance haply thou mayst know that illustrious heiress  fray juan perez a truly guileless priest started at the name then he gazed intently and with a sort of pity at the youth after which he bent his head toward the tiles beneath his feet smiled and shook his head like one whose thoughts were very active  i do indeed know the lady he said and even when last at court on this errand of colons their own confessor being ill i shrived her as well as my royal mistress that she is worthy of doña isabellas esteem is true but thy admiration for this noble maiden which must be something like the distant reverence we feel for the clouds that sail above our heads can scarce be founded on any rational hopes  thou canst not know that father if this expedition end as we trust all who engage in it will be honored and advanced and why not i as well as another  in this thou mayst utter truth but as for the doña the franciscan checked himself for he was about to betray the secret of the confessional he had in truth listened to the contrition of mercedes of which her passion for luis was the principal cause and it was he who with a species of pious fraud of which he was himself unconscious had first pointed out the means by which the truant noble might be made to turn his propensity to rove to the profit of his love and his mind was full of her beautiful exhibition of purity and natural feeling nearly even to overflowing but habit and duty interfered in time and he did not utter the name that had been trembling on his lips still his thoughts continued in this current and his tongue gave utterance to that portion of them which he believed to be harmless thou hast been much about the world it would seem by master alonzos greeting he continued after a short pause didst ever meet son with a certain cavalier of castile named don luis de bobadillaa grandee who also bears the title of conde de llera  i know little of his hopes and care less for his titles returned luis calmly who thought he would manifest a magnanimous indifference to the franciscans opinionsbut i have seen the cavalier and a roving madbrained graceless youth it is of whom no good can be expected  i fear this is but too true rejoined fray juan perez shaking his head in a melancholy mannerand yet they say he is a gallant knight and the very best lance in all spain  ay he may be that answered luis hemming a little louder than was decorous for his throat began to grow huskyay he may be that but of what avail is a good lance without a good character i hear little commendable of this young conde de llera  i trust he is not the man he generally passeth foranswered the simplehearted monk without in the least suspecting his companions disguise and i do know that there are some who think well of himnay whose existence i might say whose very souls are wrapped up in him  holy franciscanwhy wilt thou not mention the names of one or two of these demanded luis with an impetuosity that caused the prior to start  and why should i give this information to thee young man more than to another  why fatherwhy for several most excellent and unanswerable reasons in the first place i am a youth myself as thou seest and example they say is better than precept then too i am somewhat given to roving and it may profit me to know how others of the same propensity have sped moreover it would gladden my inmost heart to hear thatbut two sufficient reasons are better than three and thou hast the first number already  fray juan perez a devout christian a learned churchman and a liberal scholar was as simple as a child in matters that related to the world and its passions nevertheless he was not so dull as to overlook the strange deportment and stranger language of his companion a direction had been given to his thoughts by the mention of the name of our heroine and as he himself had devised the very course taken by our hero the truth began to dawn on his imagination  young cavalier he exclaimed thou art don luis de bobadilla  i shall never deny the prophetic knowledge of a churchman worthy father after this detection i am he thou sayest entered on this expedition to win the love of mercedes de valverde  tis as i thoughtand yet señor you might have taken our poor convent less at an advantage suffer that i command the lay brothers to place refreshments before you  thy pardon excellent priorpedro de muños or even pero gutierrez hath no need of food but now that thou knowest me there can be less reason for not conversing of the doña mercedes  now that i know thee señor conde there is greater reason for silence on that head returned fray juan perez smiling thine aunt the most esteemed and virtuous lady of moya can give thee all occasion to urge thy suit with this charming maiden and it would ill become a churchman to temper her prudence by any indiscreet interference  this explanation was the commencement of a long and confidential dialogue in which the worthy prior now that he was on his guard succeeded in preserving his main secret though he much encouraged the young man in the leading hope of his existence as well as in his project to adhere to the fortunes of columbus in the mean while the great navigator himself continued closeted with his new counsellor and when the two reappeared it was announced to those without that the latter had engaged in the enterprise with so much zeal that he actually entertained the intention of embarking on board of one of the caravels in person     chapter xii      yet he to whom each danger hath become     a dark delight and every wild a home     still urges onwardundismayed to tread     where lifes fond lovers would recoil with dread      the abencerrage   the intelligence that martin alonzo pinzon was to make one of the followers of colon spread through the village of palos like wildfire volunteers were no longer wanting the example of one known and respected in the vicinity operating far more efficiently on the minds of the mariners than the orders of the queen or the philosophy of columbus martin alonzo they knew they were accustomed to submit to his influence they could follow in his footsteps and had confidence in his judgment whereas the naked orders of an unseen sovereign however much beloved had more of the character of a severe judgment than of a generous enterprise and as for columbus though most men were awed by his dignified appearance and grave manner when out of sight he was as much regarded as an adventurer at palos as he had been at santa fé  the pinzons set about their share of the expedition after the manner of those who were more accustomed to execute than to plan several of the family entered cordially into the work and a brother of martin alonzos whose name was vincente yañez also a mariner by profession joined the adventurers as commander of one of the vessels while another took service as a pilot in short the month that succeeded the incidents just mentioned was actively employed and more was done in that short space of time toward bringing about a solution of the great problem of columbus than had been accomplished in a practical way during the seventeen long years that the subject had occupied his time and engrossed his thoughts  notwithstanding the local influence of the pinzons a vigorous opposition to the project still existed in the heart of the little community that had been chosen for the place of equipment of the different vessels required this family had its enemies as well as its friends and as is usual with most human undertakings two parties sprang up one of which was quite as busily occupied in thwarting the plans of the navigator as the other was engaged in promoting them one vessel had been seized for the service under the order of the court and her owners became leaders of the dissatisfied faction many seamen according to the usage of that day had been impressed for duty on this extraordinary and mysterious voyage and as a matter of course they and their friends were not slow to join the ranks of the disaffected much of the necessary work was found to be imperfectly done and when the mechanics were called on to repair these omissions they absconded in a body as the time for sailing approached the contention grew more and more violent and even the pinzons had the mortification of discovering that many of those who had volunteered to follow their fortunes began to waver and that some had unequivocally deserted  such was the state of things toward the close of the month of july when martin alonzo pinzon again repaired to the convent of santa maria de rabida where columbus continued to pass most of the time that was not given to a direct personal superintendence of the preparations and where luis de bobadilla who was altogether useless in the actual condition of affairs also passed many a weary hour chafing for active duty and musing on the loveliness truth and virtues of mercedes de valverde fray juan perez was earnest in his endeavors to facilitate the execution of the objects of his friends and he had actually succeeded if not in absolutely suppressing the expression of all injurious opinion on the part of the less enlightened of the brotherhood at least in rendering the promulgation of them more cautious and private  when columbus and the prior were told that the señor pinzon sought an interview neither was slow in granting the favor as the hour of departure drew nigh the importance of this mans exertions became more and more apparent and both well knew that the royal protection of isabella herself just at that moment and in that place was of less account than that of this active mariner the señor pinzon therefore had not long to wait for his audience having been ushered into the room that was commonly occupied by the zealous franciscan almost as soon as his request was preferred  thou art right welcome worthy martin alonzo exclaimed the prior the moment he caught a glimpse of the features of his old acquaintancehow get on matters at palos and when shall we have this holy undertaking in a fair direction for success  by san francisco reverend prior that is more than it will be safe for any man to answer i have thought we were in a fair way to make sail a score of times when some unforeseen difficulty hath arisen the santa maria on board which the admiral and the señor gutierrez or de muños if he will have it so will embark is already fitted she may be set down as a tight craft and somewhat exceedeth a hundred tons in burthen so that i trust his excellency and all the gallant cavaliers who may accompany him will be as comfortable as the holy monks of rabidamore especially as the good caravel hath a deck  these are truly glad tidings returned the prior rubbing his hands with delightand the excellent craft hath really a deck señor almirante thou mayst not be in a vessel that is altogether worthy of thy high aim but on the whole thou wilt be both safe and comfortable keeping in view in particular this convenient and sheltering deck  neither my safety nor my convenience is a consideration to be mentioned friend juan perez when there is question of so much graver matters i rejoice that thou hast come to the convent this morning señor martin alonzo as being about to address letters to the court by means of an especial courier i desire to know the actual condition of things thou thinkest the santa maria will be in a state for service by the end of the month  señor i do the ship hath been prepared with due diligence and will conveniently hold some three score should the panic that hath seized on so many of the besotted fools of palos leave us that number who may still be disposed to embark i trust that the saints look upon our many efforts and will remember our zeal when we shall come to a joint division of the benefits of this undertaking which hath had no equal in the history of navigation  the benefits honest martin alonzo will be found in the spread of the churchs dominion and the increased glory of god put in the prior significantly  out of all question holy fray juan perezthis is the common aim though i trust it is permitted to a painstaking mariner to bethink him of his wife and children in discreet subordination to those greater ends i have much mistaken the señor colon if he do not look for some little advantage in the way of gold from this visit to cathay  thou hast not mistaken me honest martin alonzo returned columbus gravely i do indeed expect to see the wealth of the indies pouring into the coffers of castile in consequence of this voyage in sooth excellent prior in my view the recovery of the holy sepulchre is dependent mainly on the success of our present undertaking in the way of a substantial worldly success  this is well señor admiral put in martin alonzo a little hastily and ought to gain us great favor in the eyes of all good christiansmore especially with the monks of la rabida but it is hard enough to persuade the mariners of the port to obey the queen in this matter and to fulfil their engagements with ourselves without preaching a crusade as the best means of throwing away the few maravedis they may happen to gain by their hardships and courage the worthy pilots francisco martin pinzon mine own brother sancho ruiz pedro alonzo niño and bartolemeo roldan are all now firmly tied to us by the ropes of the law but should they happen to find a crusade at their end all the saints in the calendar would scarce have influence to make them hesitate about loosening themselves from the agreement  i hold no one but myself bound to this object returned columbus calmly each man friend martin alonzo will be judged by his own deeds and called on to fulfil his own vows of those who pledge naught naught will be exacted and naught given at the great final account of the human race but what are the tidings of the pinta thine own vessel hath she been finally put into a condition to buffet the atlantic  as ever happeneth with a vessel pressed into the royal service señor work hath gone on heavily and things in general have not borne that merry activity which accompanieth the labor of those who toil of a free will and for their own benefit  the silly mariners have toiled in their own behalf without knowing it observed columbus it is the duty of the ignorant to submit to be led by the more enlightened and to be grateful for the advantages they derive from a borrowed knowledge albeit it is obtained contrary to their own wishes  that is it truly added the prior else would the office of us churchmen be reduced to very narrow limits faithfaith in the churchis the christians earliest and latest duty  this seemeth reasonable excellent sirs returned master alonzo though the ignorant find it difficult to comprehend matters that they do not understand when a man fancieth himself condemned to an unheardof death he is little apt to see the benefit that lieth beyond the grave nevertheless the pinta is more nearly ready for the voyage than any other of our craft and hath her crew engaged to a man and that under contracts that will not permit much dispute before a notary  there remaineth only the niña then added columbus with her prepared and our religious duties observed we may hope finally to commence the enterprise  señor you may my brother vicente yañez hath finally consented to take charge of this little craft and that which a pinzon promiseth a pinzon performeth she will be ready to depart with the santa maria and the pinta and cathay must be distant indeed if we do not reach it with one or the other of our vessels  this is right encouraging neighbor martin alonzo returned the friar rubbing his hands with delight and i make no question all will come round in the end what say the crones and loose talkers of moguer and of the other ports touching the shape of the earth and the chances of the admirals reaching the indies nowadays  they discourse much as they did fray juan perez idly and without knowledge although there is not a mariner in any of the havens who doth not admit that the upper sails though so much the smallest are the first seen on the ocean yet do they deny that this cometh of the shape of the earth but as they affirm of the movements of the waters  have none of them ever observed the shadows cast by the earth in the eclipses of the moon asked columbus in his calm manner though he smiled even in putting the question as one smiles who having dipped deeply into a natural problem himself carelessly lays one of its more popular proofs before those who are less disposed to go beneath the surface do they not see that these shadows are round and do they not know that a shadow which is round can only be cast by a body that is round  this is conclusive good martin alonzo put in the prior and it ought to remove the doubts of the silliest gossip on the coast tell them to encircle their dwellings beginning to the right and see if by following the walls they do not return to the spot from which they started coming in from the left  ay reverend prior if we could bring our distant voyage down to these familiar examples there is not a crone in moguer or a courtier at seville that might not be made to comprehend the mystery but it is one thing to state a problem fairly and another to find those who can understand it now i did give some such reasoning to the alguiazil in palos here and the worthy señor asked me if i expected to return from this voyage by the way of the lately captured town of granada i fancy that the easiest method of persuading these good people to believe that cathay can be reached by the western voyage will be by going there and returning  which we will shortly do master martin alonzo observed columbus cheerfullybut the time of our departure draweth near and it is meet that none of us neglect the duties of religion i commend thee to thy confessor señor pinzon and expect that all who sail with me in this great enterprise will receive the holy communion in my company before we quit the haven this excellent prior will shrive pedro de muños and myself and let each man seek such other holy counsellor and monitor as hath been his practice  with this intimation of his intention to pay a due regard to the rites of the church before he departedrites that were seldom neglected in that daythe conversation turned for the moment on the details of the preparations after this the parties separated and a few more days passed away in active exertions  on the morning of thursday august the second 1492 columbus entered the private apartment of fray juan perez habited like a penitent and with an air so devout and yet so calm that it was evident his thoughts were altogether bent on his own transgressions and on the goodness of god the zealous priest was in waiting and the great navigator knelt at the feet of him before whom isabella had often knelt in the fulfilment of the same solemnity the religion of this extraordinary man was colored by the habits and opinions of his age as indeed in a greater or less degree must be the religion of every man his confession consequently had that admixture of deep piety with inconsistent error that so often meets the moralist in his investigations into the philosophy of the human mind the truth of this peculiarity will be seen by adverting to one or two of the admissions of the great navigator as he laid before his ghostly counsellor the catalogue of his sins  then i fear holy father columbus continued after having made most of the usual confessions touching the more familiar weaknesses of the human race that my mind hath become too much exalted in this matter of the voyage and that i may have thought myself more directly set apart by god for some good end than it might please his infinite knowledge and wisdom to grant  that would be a dangerous error my son and i carefully admonish thee against the evils of selfrighteousness that god selecteth his agents is beyond dispute but it is a fearful error to mistake the impulses of selflove for the movements of his divine spirit it is hardly safe for any who have not received the churchs ordination to deem themselves chosen vessels  i endeavor so to consider it holy friar answered columbus meekly and yet there is that within which constantly urgeth to this belief be it a delusion or come it directly from heaven i strive father to keep the feeling in subjection and most of all do i endeavor to see that it taketh a direction that may glorify the name of god and serve the interests of his visible church  this is well and yet do i feel it a duty to admonish thee against too much credence in these inward impulses so long as they tend solely to increase thy love for the supreme father of all to magnify his holiness and glorify his nature thou mayst be certain it is the offspring of good but when selfexaltation seemeth to be its aim beware the impulse as thou wouldst eschew the dictation of the great father of evil  i so consider it and now having truly and sincerely disburdened my conscience father so far as in me lieth may i hope for the churchs consolation with its absolution  canst thou think of naught else son that should not lie hid from before the keeper of all consciences  my sins are many holy prior and cannot be too often or too keenly rebuked but i do think that they may be fairly included in the general heads that i have endeavored to recall  hast thou nothing to charge thyself with in connection with that sex that the devil as often useth as his tempters to evil as the angels would fain employ them as the ministers of grace  i have erred as a man father but do not my confessions already meet those sins  hast thou bethought thee of doña beatriz enriquez of thy son fernando who tarrieth at this moment in our convent of la rabida  columbus bowed his head in submission and the heavy sigh amounting almost to a groan that broke out of his bosom betrayed the weight of his momentary contrition  thou sayst true father that is an offence which should never be forgotten though so often shrived since its commission heap on me the penance that i feel is due and thou shalt see how a christian can bend and kiss the rod that he is conscious of having merited  the spirit thus to do is all that the church requireth and thou art now bent on a service too important to her interests to be drawn aside from thy great intentions for any minor considerations still may not a minister of the altar overlook the offence thou wilt say a pater daily on account of this great sin for the next twenty days all of which will be for the good of thy soul after which the church releaseth thee from this especial duty as thou wilt then be drawing near to the land of cathay and may have occasion for all thy thoughts and efforts to effect thy object  the worthy prior then proceeded to prescribe several light penances most of which were confined to moderate increases of the daily duties of religion after which he shrived the navigator the turn of luis came next and more than once the prior smiled involuntarily as he listened to this hotblooded and impetuous youth whose language irresistibly carried back his thoughts to the more meek natural and the more gentle admissions of the pureminded mercedes the penance prescribed to luis was not entirely free from severity though on the whole the young man who was not much addicted to the duties of the confessional fancied himself well quit of the affair considering the length of the account he was obliged to render and the weight of the balance against him  these duties performed in the persons of the two principal adventurers martin alonzo pinzon and the ruder mariners of the expedition appeared before different priests and gave in the usual reckoning of their sins after this came a scene that was strictly characteristic of the age and which would be impressive and proper in all times and seasons for men about to embark in an undertaking of a result so questionable  high mass was said in the chapel of the convent and columbus received the consecrated bread from the hands of fray juan perez in humble reliance on the allseeing providence of god and with a devout dependence on his fostering protection all who were about to embark with the admiral imitated his example communing in his company for that was a period when the wiredrawn conclusions of man had not yet begun so far to supplant the faith and practices of the earlier church as to consider its rites as the end of religion but he was still content to regard them as its means many a rude sailor whose ordinary life might not have been either saintly or even free from severe censure knelt that day at the altar in devout dependence on god with feelings for the moment that at least placed him on the highway to grace and it would be presumptuous to suppose that the omniscient being to whom his offerings were made did not regard his ignorance with commiseration and even look upon his superstition with pity we scoff at the prayers of those who are in danger without reflecting that they are a homage to the power of god and are apt to fancy that these passages in devotion are mere mockery because the daily mind and the ordinary life are not always elevated to the same standard of godliness and purity it would be more humble to remember the general infirmities of the race to recollect that as none are perfect the question is reduced to one of degree and to bear in mind that the being who reads the heart may accept of any devout petitions even though they come from those who are not disposed habitually to walk in his laws these passing but pious emotions are the workings of the spirit since good can come from no other source and it is as unreasonable as it is irreverent to imagine that the deity will disregard altogether the effects of his own grace however humble  whatever may have been the general disposition of most of the communicants on this occasion there is little doubt that there knelt at the altar of la rabida that day one in the person of the great navigator himself who as far as the eye could perceive lived habitually in profound deference to the dogmas of religion and who paid an undeviating respect to all its rites columbus was not strictly a devotee but a quiet deeply seated enthusiasm which had taken the direction of christianity pervaded his moral system and at all times disposed him to look up to the protecting hand of the deity and to expect its aid the high aims that he entertained for the future have already been mentioned and there is little doubt of his having persuaded himself that he had been set apart by providence as the instrument it designed to employ in making the great discovery on which his mind was so intently engaged as well as in accomplishing other and ulterior purposes if indeed an overruling power directs all the events of this world who will presume to say that this conviction of columbus was erroneous now that it has been justified by the result that he felt this sentiment sustaining his courage and constantly urging him onward is so much additional evidence in favor of his impression since under such circumstances nothing is more probable than that an earnest belief in his destiny would be one of the means most likely to be employed by a supernatural power in inducing its human agent to accomplish the work for which he had actually been selected  let this be as it might there is no doubt that colon observed the rites of the church on the occasion named with a most devout reliance on the truth of his mission and with the brightest hopes as to its successful termination not so however with all of his intended followers their minds had wavered from time to time as the preparations advanced and the last month had seen them eager to depart and dejected with misgivings and doubts although there were days of hope and brightness despondency perhaps prevailed and this so much the more because the apprehensions of mothers wives and of those who felt an equally tender interest in the mariners though less inclined to avow it openly were thrown into the scale by the side of their own distrust gold unquestionably was the great aim of their wishes and there were moments when visions of inexhaustible mines and of oriental treasures floated before their imaginations at which times none could be more eager to engage in the mysterious undertaking or more ready to risk their lives and hopes on its success but these were fleeting impressions and as has just been said despondency was the prevalent feeling among those who were about to embark it heightened the devotion of the communicants and threw a gloom over the chastened sobriety of the altar that weighed heavily on the hearts of most assembled there  our people seem none of the most cheerful señor almirante said luis as they left the conventchapel in company and if truth must be spoken one could wish to set forth on an expedition of this magnitude better sustained by merry hearts and smiling countenances  dost thou imagine young count that he hath the firmest mind who weareth the most smiling visage or that the heart is weak because the countenance is sobered these honest mariners bethink them of their sins and no doubt are desirous that so holy an enterprise be not tainted by the corruption of their own hearts but rather purified and rendered fitting by their longings to obey the will of god i trust luisintercourse had given columbus a sort of paternal interest in the welfare of the young grandee that lessened the distance made by rank between themi trust luis thou art not altogether without these pious longings in thine own person  by san pedro my new patron señor almirante i think more of mercedes de valverde than of aught else in this great affair she is my polar star my religion my cathay go on in heavens name and discover what thou wilt whether it be cipango or the furthest indies beard the great khan on his throne and i will follow in thy train with a poor lance and an indifferent sword swearing that the maid of castile hath no equal and ransacking the east merely to prove in the face of the universe that she is peerless let her rivals come from what part of the earth they may  although columbus permitted his grave countenance slightly to relax at this rhapsody he did not the less deem it prudent to rebuke the spirit in which it was uttered  i grieve my young friend he said to find that thou hast not the feelings proper for one who is engaged as it might be in a work of heavens own ordering canst thou not foresee the long train of mighty and wonderful events that are likely to follow from this voyagethe spread of religion through the holy church the conquest of distant empires with their submission to the sway of castile the settling of disputed points in science and philosophy and the attainment of inexhaustible wealth with the last and most honorable consequence of all the recovery of the sepulchre of the son of god from the hands of the infidels  no doubt señor colonno doubt i see them all but i see the doña mercedes at their end what care i for gold who already possessor shall so soon possessmore than i need what is the extension of the sway of castile to me who can never be its king and as for the holy sepulchre give me but mercedes and like my ancestors that are gone i am ready to break a lance with the stoutest infidel who ever wore a turban be it in that or in any other quarrel in short señor almirante lead on and though we go forth with different objects and different hopes doubt not that they will lead us to the same goal i feel that you ought to be supported in this great and noble design and it matters not what may bring me in your train  thou art a madbrained youth luis and must be humored if it were only for the sake of the sweet and pious young maiden who seemeth to engross all thy thoughts  you have seen her señor and can say whether she be not worthy to occupy the minds of all the youth of spain  she is fair and virtuous and noble and a zealous friend of the voyage these are all rare merits and thou mayst be pardoned for thy enthusiasm in her behalf but forget not that to win her thou must first win a sight of cathay  in the reality you must mean señor almirante for with the minds eye i see it keenly constantly and see little else with mercedes standing on its shores smiling a welcome and by st paul sometimes beckoning me on with that smile that fires the soul with its witchery even while it subdues the temper with its modesty the blessed maria send us a wind right speedily that we may quit this irksome river and wearying convent  columbus made no answer for while he had all consideration for a lovers impatience his thoughts turned to subjects too grave to be long amused even by a lovers follies     chapter xiii      nor zayda weeps him only     but all that dwell between     the great alhambras palace walls     and springs of albalein      bryants translations   the instant of departure at length arrived the moment so long desired by the genoese was at hand and years of poverty neglect and of procrastination were all forgotten at that blessed hour or if they returned in any manner to the constant memory it was no longer with the bitterness of hope deferred the navigator at last saw himself in the possession of the means of achieving the first great object for which he had lived the last fifteen years with the hope in perspective of making the success of his present adventure the steppingstone toward effecting the conquest of the holy sepulchre while those around him were looking with astonishment at the limited means with which ends so great were to be attained or were struck aghast at the apparent temerity of an undertaking that seemed to defy the laws of nature and to set at naught the rules of providence he had grown more tranquil as the time for sailing drew nearer and his mind was oppressed merely by a feeling of intense but of sobered delight fray juan perez whispered to luis that he could best liken the joy of the admiral to the chastened rapture of a christian who was about to quit a world of woe to enter on the untasted but certain fruition of blessed immortality  this however was far from being the state of mind of all in palos the embarkation took place in the course of the afternoon of the 2d of august it being the intention of the pilots to carry the vessels that day to a point off the town of huelvas where the position was more favorable to making sail than when anchored in front of palos the distance was trifling but it was the commencement of the voyage and to many it was like snapping the cords of life to make even this brief movement columbus himself was one of the last to embark having a letter to send to the court and other important duties to discharge at length he quitted the convent and accompanied by luis and the prior he too took his way to the beach the short journey was silent for each of the party was deeply plunged in meditation never before this hour did the enterprise seem so perilous and uncertain to the excellent franciscan columbus was carefully recalling the details of his preparations while luis was thinking of the maid of castile as he was wont to term mercedes and of the many weary days that must elapse before he could hope to see her again  the party stopped on the shore in waiting for a boat to arrive at a place where they were removed from any houses there fray juan perez took his leave of the two adventurers the long silence that all three had maintained was more impressive than any ordinary discourse could have been but it was now necessary to break it the prior was deeply affected and it was some little time before he could even trust his voice to speak  señor christoval he at length commenced it is now many years since thou first appeared at the gate of santa maria de rabidayears of friendship and pleasure have they proved to me  it is full seven fray juan perez returned columbusseven weary years have they proved to me as a solicitor for employmentyears of satisfaction father in all that concerneth thee think not that i can ever forget the hour when leading diego houseless impoverished wanderers journeying on foot i stopped to tax the convents charity for refreshment the future is in the hands of god but the past is imprinted herelaying his hand on his heartand can never be forgotten thou hast been my constant friend holy prior and that too when it was no credit to favor the nameless genoese should my estimation ever change in mens opinions  nay señor almirante it hath changed already eagerly interrupted the prior hast thou not the commission of the queenthe support of don fernandothe presence of this young noble though still as an incognitothe wishes of all the learned dost thou not go forth on this great voyage carrying with thee more of our hopes than of our fears  so far as thou art concerned dear juan perez this may be so i feel that i have all thy best wishes for success i know that i shall have thy prayers few in spain notwithstanding will think of colon with respect or hope while we are wandering on the great desert of the ocean beyond a very narrow circle i fear me that even at this moment when the means of learning the truth of our theories is in actual possessionwhen we stand as it might be on the very threshold of the great portal which opens upon the indiesthat few believe in our chances of success  thou hast doña isabella of thy side señor  and doña mercedes put in luis not to speak of my decided and truehearted aunt  i ask but a few brief months señores returned columbus his face turned to heaven with uncovered head his gray hair floating in the wind and his eye kindling with the light of enthusiasma few short months that will pass away untold with the happythat even the miserable may find supportable but which to us will seem ages must now dispose of this question prior i have often quitted the shore feeling that i carried my life in my hand conscious of all the dangers of the ocean and as much expecting death as a happy return but at this glorious moment no doubts beset me as for life i know it is in the keeping of gods care as for success i feel it is in gods wisdom  these are comfortable sentiments at so serious a moment señor and i devoutly hope the end will justify them but yonder is thy boat and we must now part señor my son thou knowest that my spirit will be with thee in this mighty undertaking  holy prior remember me in thy prayers i am weak and have need of this support i trust much to the efficacy of thy intercessions aided by those of thy pious brotherhood thou wilt bestow on us a few masses  doubt us not my friend all that la rabida can do with the blessed virgin or the saints shall be exercised without ceasing in thy behalf it is not given to man to foresee the events that are controlled by providence and though we deem this enterprise of thine so certain and so reasonable it may nevertheless fail  it may not fail father god hath thus far directed it and he will not permit it to fail  we know not señor colon our wisdom is but as a grain of mustard seed among the sands of this shore as compared with his inscrutable designs i was about to say as it is possible thou mayst return a disappointed a defeated man that thou wilt still find the gate of santa maria open to thee since in our eyes it is as meritorious to attempt nobly as it is often in the eyes of others to achieve successfully  i understand thee holy prior and the cup and the morsel bestowed on the young diego were not more grateful than this proof of thy friendship i would not depart without thy blessing  kneel then señor for in this act it will not be juan perez de marchena that will speak and pronounce but the minister of god and the church even these sands will be no unworthy spot to receive such an advantage  the eyes of both columbus and the prior were suffused with tears for at that moment the heart of each was touched with the emotions natural to a moment so solemn the first loved the last because he had proved himself a friend when friends were few and timid and the worthy monk had some such attachment for the great navigator as men are apt to feel for those they have cherished each also respected and appreciated the others motives and there was a bond of union in their common reverence for the christian religion columbus kneeled on the sands and received the benediction of his friend with the meek submission of faith and with some such feelings of reverence as those with which a pious son would have listened to a blessing pronounced by a natural father  illustration columbus kneeled on the sands and received the benediction  and thou young lord resumed fray juan perez with a husky voicethou too wilt be none the worse for the prayers of an aged churchman  like most of that age luis in the midst of his impetuous feelings and youthful propensities had enshrined in his heart an image of the son of god and entertained an habitual respect for holy things he knelt without hesitation and listened to the trembling words of the priest with thankfulness and respect  adieu holy prior said columbus squeezing his friends hand thou hast befriended me when others held aloof but i trust in god that the day is not now distant when those who have ever shown confidence in my predictions will cease to feel uneasiness at the mention of my name forget us in all things but thy prayers for a few short months and then expect tidings that of a verity shall exalt castile to a point of renown which will render this conquest of granada but an incident of passing interest amid the glory of the reign of ferdinand and isabella  this was not said boastfully but with the quiet earnestness of one who saw a truth that was concealed from most eyes and this with an intensity so great that the effect on his moral vision produced a confidence equalling that which is the fruit of the evidence of the senses in ordinary men the prior understood him and the assurance thus given cheered the mind of the worthy franciscan long after the departure of his friend they embraced and separated  by this time the boat of columbus had reached the shore as the navigator moved slowly toward it a youthful female rushed wildly past him and luis and regardless of their presence she threw her arms around a young mariner who had quitted the boat to meet her and sobbed for a minute on his bosom in uncontrollable agony or as women weep in the first outbreak of their emotions  come then pepe the young wife at length said hurriedly and with low earnestness as one speaks who would fain persuade herself that denial was impossiblecome pepe thy boy hath wept for thee and thou hast pushed this matter already much too far  nay monica returned the husband glancing his eye at columbus who was already near enough to hear his wordsthou knowest it is by no wish of mine that i am to sail on this unknown voyage gladly would i abandon it but the orders of the queen are too strong for a poor mariner like me and they must be obeyed  this is foolish pepe returned the woman pulling at her husbands doublet to drag him from the watersidei have had enough of this sufficient to break my heart come then and look again upon thy boy  thou dost not see that the admiral is near monica and we are showing him disrespect  the habitual deference that was paid by the low to the high induced the woman for a moment to pause she looked imploringly at columbus her fine dark eyes became eloquent with the feelings of a wife and mother and then she addressed the great navigator himself  señor she said eagerly you can have no further need of pepe he hath helped to carry your vessels to huelva and now his wife and boy call for him at home  columbus was touched with the manner of the woman which was not entirely without a show of that wavering of reason which is apt to accompany excessive grief and he answered her less strongly than at a moment so critical he might otherwise have been disposed to do to one who was inciting to disobedience  thy husband is honored in being chosen to be my companion in the great voyage he said instead of bewailing his fate thou wouldst act more like a brave mariners wife in exulting in his good fortune  believe him not pepe he speaketh under the evil ones advice to tempt thee to destruction he hath talked blasphemy and belied the word of god by saying that the world is round and that one may sail east by steering west that he might ruin thee and others by tempting ye all to follow him  and why should i do this good woman demanded the admiral what have i to gain by the destruction of thy husband or by the destruction of any of his comrades  i know noti care notpepe is all to me and he shall not go with you on this mad and wicked voyage no good can come of a journey that is begun by belying the truths of god  and what particular evil dost thou dread in this more than in another voyage that thou thus hangst upon thy husband and usest such discourse to one who beareth their highnesses authority for that he doeth thou knewest he was a mariner when thou wert wedded and yet thou wouldst fain prevent him from serving the queen as becometh his station and duty  he may go against the moor or the portuguese or the people of inghleterra but i would not that he voyage in the service of the prince of darkness why tell us that the earth is round señor when our eyes show that it is flat and if round how can a vessel that hath descended the side of the earth for days ever return the sea doth not flow upward neither can a caravel mount the waterfall and when thou hast wandered about for months in the vacant ocean in what manner wilt thou and those with thee ever discover the direction that must be taken to return whence ye all sailed oh señor palos is but a little town and once lost sight of in such a confusion of ideas it will never be regained  idle and childish as this may seem observed columbus turning quietly to luis it is as reasonable as much that i have been doomed to hear from the learned during the last sixteen years when the night of ignorance obscures the mind the thoughts conjure arguments a thousand times more vain and frivolous than the phenomena of nature that it fancies so unreasonable i will try the effect of religion on this woman converting her present feelings on that head from an enemy into an ally monica calling her kindly and familiarly by name art thou a christian  blessed maria señor almirante what else should i be dost think pepe would have married a moorish girl  listen then to me and learn how unlike a believer thou conductest the moor is not the only infidel but this earth groaneth with the burden of their numbers and of their sins the sands on this shore are not as numerous as the unbelievers in the single kingdom of cathay for as yet god hath allotted but a small portion of the earth to those who have faith in the mediation of his son even the sepulchre of christ is yet retained by infidel hands  this have i heard señor and tis a thousand pities the faith is so weak in those who have vowed to obey the law that so crying an evil hath never been cured  hast thou not been told that such is to be the fate of the world for a time but that light will dawn when the word shall pass like the sound of trumpets into the ears of infidels and when the earth itself shall be but one vast temple filled with the praises of god the love of his name and obedience to his will  señor the good fathers of la rabida and our own parish priests often comfort us with these hopes  and hast thou seen naught of late to encourage that hopeto cause thee to think that god is mindful of his people and that new light is beginning to burst on the darkness of spain  pepe his excellency must mean the late miracle at the convent where they say that real tears were seen to fall from the eyes of the image of the holy maria as she gazed at the child that lay on her bosom  i mean not that interrupted columbus a little sternly though he crossed himself even while he betrayed dissatisfaction at the allusion to a miracle that was much too vulgar for his manly understandingi mean no such questionable wonder which it is permitted us to believe or not as it may be supported by the churchs authority can thy faith and zeal point to no success of the two sovereigns in which the power of god as exercised to the advancement of the faith hath been made signally apparent to believers  he meaneth the expulsion of the moor pepe the woman exclaimed glancing quickly toward her husband with a look of pleasure that hath happened of late they say by conquering the city of granada into which place they tell me doña isabella hath marched in triumph  in that conquest thou seest the commencement of the great acts of our time granada hath now its churches and the distant land of cathay will shortly follow her example these are the doings of the lord foolish woman and in holding back thy husband from this great undertaking thou hinderest him from purchasing a signal reward in heaven and may unwittingly be the instrument of casting a curse instead of a blessing on that very boy whose image now filleth thy thoughts more than that of his maker and redeemer  the woman appeared bewildered first looking at the admiral and then at her husband after which she bowed her head low and devoutly crossed herself recovering from this selfabasement she again turned toward columbus demanding earnestly  and you señordo you sail with the wish and hope of serving god  such is my principal aim good woman i call on heaven itself to witness the truth of what i say may my voyage prosper only as i tell thee naught but truth  and you too señor turning quickly to luis de bobadilla is it to serve god that you also go on this unusual voyage  if not at the orders of god himself my good woman it is at least at the bidding of an angel  dost thou think it is so pepe have we been thus deceived and has so much evil been said of the admiral and his motives wrongfully  what hath been said quietly demanded columbus speak freely thou hast naught to dread from my displeasure  señor you have your enemies as well as another and the wives and mothers and the betrothed of palos have not been slow to give vent to their feelings in the first place they say that you are poor  that is so true and manifest good woman it would be idle to deny it is poverty a crime at palos  the poor are little respected señor in all this region i know not why for to me we seem to be as the rest but few respect us then they say señor that you are not a castilian but a genoese  this is also true is that too a crime among the mariners of moguer who ought to prize a people as much renowned for their deeds on the sea as those of the superb republic  i know not señor but many hold it to be a disadvantage not to belong to spain and particularly to castile which is the country of doña isabella herself and how can it be as honorable to be a genoese as to be a spaniard i should like it better were pepe to sail with one who is a spaniard and that too of palos or moguer  thy argument is ingenious if not conclusive returned columbus smiling the only outward exhibition of feeling he betrayedbut cannot one who is both poor and a genoese serve god  no doubt señor and i think better of this voyage since i know your motive and since i have seen you and spoken with you still it is a great sacrifice for a young wife to let her husband sail on an expedition so distrusted and he the father of her only boy  here is a young noble an only son a lover and that too of impetuous feelings an only child withal rich honored and able to go whither he will who not only embarketh with me but embarketh by the consentnay i had better say by the orders of his mistress  is this so señor the wife asked eagerly  so true my good woman that my greatest hopes depend on this voyage did i not tell thee that i went at the bidding of an angel  ah these young lords have seductive tongues but señor almirante since such is your quality they say moreover that to you this voyage can only bring honors and good while it may bring misery and death on your followers poor and unknown it maketh you a high officer of the queen and some think that the venetian galleys will be none the more heavily freighted should you need them on the high seas  and in what can all this harm thy husband i go whithersoever he goeth share his dangers and expose life for life with him if there is gold gained by the adventure he will not be forgotten and if heaven is made any nearer to us by our dangers and hardships pepe will not be a loser at the last great reckoning woman we shall not be asked who is poor or who is a genoese  this is true señor and yet it is hard for a young wife to part from her husband dost thou wish in truth to sail with the admiral pepe  it matters little with me monica i am commanded to serve the queen and we mariners have no right to question her authority now i have heard his excellencys discourse i think less of the affair than before  if god is really to be served in this voyage continued the woman with dignity thou shouldst not be backward more than another my husband señor will you suffer pepe to pass the night with his family on condition that he goeth on board the santa maria in the morning  what certainty have i that this condition will be respected  señor we are both christians and serve the same godhave been redeemed by the same saviour  this is true and i will confide in it pepe thou canst remain until the morning when i shall expect thee at thy station there will be oarsmen enough without thee  the woman looked her thanks and columbus thought he read an assurance of good faith in her noble spanish manner and lofty look as some trifling preparations were to be made before the boat could quit the shore the admiral and luis paced the sands the while engaged in deep discourse  this hath been a specimen of what i have had to overcome and endure in order to obtain even yonder humble means for effecting the good designs of providence observed columbus mournfully though he spoke without acrimony it is a crime to be poorto be a genoeseto be aught else than the very thing that ones judges and masters fancy themselves to be the day will come conde de llera when genoa shall think herself in no manner disgraced in having given birth to christofero colombo and when your proud castile will be willing to share with her in the dishonor thou little knowst young lord how far thou art on the road to renown and toward high deeds in having been born noble and the master of large possessions thou seest me here a man already stricken in years with a head whitened by time and sufferings and yet am i only on the threshold of the undertaking that is to give my name a place among those of the men who have served god and advanced the welfare of their fellowcreatures  is not this the course of things señor throughout the earth do not those who find themselves placed beneath the level of their merits struggle to rise to the condition to which nature intended them to belong while those whom fortune hath favored through their ancestors are too often content to live on honors that they have not themselves won i see naught in this but the nature of man and the course of the world  thou art right luis but philosophy and fact are different matters we may reason calmly on principles when their application in practice causeth much pain thou hast a frank and manly nature young man one that dreadeth neither the gibe of the christian nor the lance of the moor and wilt answer to any in fearlessness and truth a castilian thyself dost thou too really think one of thy kingdom better than one of genoa  not when he of genoa is christoval colon señor and he of castile is only luis de bobadilla answered the young man laughing  nay i will not be deniedhast thou any such notion as this which the wife of pepe hath so plainly avowed  what will you señor christoval man is the same in spain that he is among the italians or the english is it not his besetting sin to think good of himself and evil of his neighbor  a plain question that is loyally put may not be answered with a truism luis  nor a civil honest reply confounded with one that is evasive we of castile are humble and most devout christians by the same reason that we think ourselves faultless and the rest of mankind notable sinners by san iago of blessed faith and holy memory it is enough to make a people vain to have produced such a queen as doña isabella and such a maiden as mercedes de valverde  this is double loyalty for it is being true to the queen and to thy mistress with this must i satisfy myself even though it be no answer but castilian though i am not even the guzmans have not ventured on the voyage to cathay and the house of trastamara may yet be glad to acknowledge its indebtedness to a genoese god hath no respect to worldly condition or worldly boundaries in choosing his agents for most of the saints were despised hebrews while jesus himself came of nazareth we shall see we shall see young lord what three months will reveal to the admiration of mankind  señor almirante i hope and pray it may be the island of cipango and the realms of the great khan should it not be so we are men who can not only bear our toils but who can bear our disappointments  of disappointments in this matter don luis i look for nonenow that i have the royal faith of isabella and these good caravels to back me the drudge who saileth from madeira to lisbon is not more certain of gaining his port than i am certain of gaining cathay  no doubt señor colon that what any navigator can do you can do and will perform nevertheless disappointment would seem to be the lot of man and it might be well for all of us to be prepared to meet it  the sun that is just sinking beyond yon hill luis is not plainer before my eyes than this route to the indies i have seen it these seventeen years distinct as the vessels in the river bright as the polar star and i make little doubt as faithfully it is well to talk of disappointments since they are the lot of man and who can know this better than one that hath been led on by false hopes during all the better years of his life now encouraged by princes statesmen and churchmen and now derided and scoffed at as a vain projector that hath neither reason nor fact to sustain him  by my new patron san pedro señor almirante but you have led a most grievous life for this last age or so the next three months will indeed be months of moment to you  thou little knowst the calmness of conviction and confidence luis returned columbus if thou fanciest any doubts beset me as the hour of trial approacheth this day is the happiest i have known for many a weary year for though the preparations are not great and our barks are but slight and of trifling bulk yonder lie the means through which a light that hath long been hid is about to break upon the world and to raise castile to an elevation surpassing that of any other christian nation  thou must regret señor colon that it hath not been genoa thy native land that is now about to receive this great boon after having merited it by generous and free gifts in behalf of this great voyage  this hath not been the least of my sorrows luis it is hard to desert ones own country and to seek new connections as life draweth to a close though we mariners perhaps feel the tie less than those who never quit the land but genoa would have none of me and if the child is bound to love and honor the parent so is the parent equally bound to protect and foster the child when the last forgets its duty the first is not to be blamed if it seek support wherever it may be found there are limits to every human duty those we owe to god alone never ceasing to require their fulfilment and our unceasing attention genoa hath proved but a stern mother to me and though naught could induce me to raise a hand against her she hath no longer any claims on my service besides when the object in view is the service of god it mattereth little with which of his creatures we league as instruments one cannot easily hate the land of his birth but injustice may lead him to cease to love it the tie is mutual and when the country ceaseth to protect person character property or rights the subject is liberated from all his duties if allegiance goeth with protection so should protection go with allegiance doña isabella is now my mistress and next to god her will i serve and serve only castile is henceforth my country  at this moment it was announced that the pinnace waited and the two adventurers immediately embarked  it must have required all the deep and fixed convictions of an ardent temperament to induce columbus to rejoice that he had at length obtained the means of satisfying his longings for discovery when he came coolly to consider what those means were the names of his vessels the santa maria the pinta and the niña have already been mentioned and some allusions have been made to their size and construction still it may aid the reader in forming his opinions of the character of this great enterprise if we give a short sketch of the vessels more especially that in which columbus and luis de bobadilla were now received she was of course the santa maria a ship of nearly twice the burden of the craft next her in size this vessel had been prepared with more care than the others and some attention had been paid to the dignity and comfort of the admiral she was destined to carry not only was she decked in but a poop or roundhouse was constructed on her quarterdeck in which he had his berth no proper notion can be obtained of the appearance of the santa maria from the tauntrigged symmetrical and lowsterned ships of the present time for though the santa maria had both a poop and topgallantforecastle as they would be termed today neither was constructed in the snug and unobtrusive manner that is now used the poop or roundhouse was called a castle to which it had some fancied resemblance while the topgallantforecastle in which most of the people lived was out of proportion large rose like a separate structure on the bows of the vessel and occupied about a third of the deck from forward aft to those who never saw the shipping that was used throughout europe a century since it will not be very obvious how vessels so small could rise so far above the water in safety but this difficulty may be explained many very old ships that had some of the peculiarities of this construction existing within the memory of man and a few having fallen under our own immediate inspection the bearings of these vessels were at the loaded waterlines or very little above them and they tumbled home in a way to reduce their beams on their poop decks nearly if not quite a fourth by these precautions their great height out of the water was less dangerous than might otherwise have been the case and as they were uniformly short ships possessing the advantages of lifting easily forward and were moreover lowwaisted they might be considered safe in a sea rather than the reverse being so short too they had great beam for their tonnage which if not an element of speed was at least one of security although termed ships these vessels were not rigged in the manner of the ships of the present day their standing spars being relatively longer than those now in use while their upper or shifting spars were much less numerous and much less important than those which now point upward like needles toward the clouds neither had a ship necessarily the same number of spars in the fifteenth century as belong to a ship in the nineteenth the term itself as it was used in all the southern countries of europe being directly derived from the latin word navis was applied rather as a generic than as a distinctive term and by no means inferred any particular construction or particular rig the caravel was a ship in this sense though not strictly so perhaps when we descend to the more minute classification of seamen  much stress has been justly laid on the fact that two of the vessels in this extraordinary enterprise were undecked in that day when most sea voyages were made in a direction parallel to the main coasts and when even those that extended to the islands occupied but a very few days vessels were seldom far from the land and it was the custom of the mariners a practice that has extended to our own times in the southern seas of europe to seek a port at the approach of bad weather under such circumstances decks were by no means as essential either for the security of the craft the protection of the cargo or the comfort of the people as in those cases in which the full fury of the elements must be encountered nevertheless the reader is not to suppose a vessel entirely without any upper covering because she was not classed among those that were decked even such caravels when used on the high seas usually possessing quarterdecks and forecastles with connecting gangways depending on tarpaulings and other similar preventives to exclude the wash of the sea from injuring their cargoes  after all these explanations however it must be conceded that the preparations for the great undertaking of columbus while the imaginations of landsmen probably aggravate their incompleteness strike the experienced seaman as altogether inadequate to its magnitude and risks that the mariners of the day deemed them positively insufficient is improbable for men as accustomed to the ocean as the pinzons would not have volunteered to risk their vessel their money and their persons in an expedition that did not possess the ordinary means of security     chapter xiv      oer the glad waters of the dark blue sea     our thoughts as boundless and our souls as free     far as the breeze can bear the billows foam     survey our empire and behold our home      byron   as columbus sought his apartment soon after he reached the deck of the holy maria luis had no farther opportunity to converse with him that night he occupied a part of the same room it is true under the assumed appellation of the admirals secretary but the great navigator was so much engaged with duties necessary to be discharged previously to sailing that he could not be interrupted and the young man paced the narrow limits of the deck until near midnight thinking as usual of mercedes and of his return when seeking his mattress he found columbus already buried in a deep sleep  the following day was friday and it is worthy of remark that the greatest and most successful voyage that has ever occurred on this globe was commenced on a day of the week that seamen have long deemed to be so inauspicious to nautical enterprises that they have often deferred sailing in order to avoid the unknown but dreaded consequences luis was among the first who appeared again on deck and casting his eyes upward he perceived that the admiral was already afoot and in possession of the summit of the high poop or castle whose narrow limits indeed were deemed sacred to the uses of the privileged answering in this particular to the more extended promenade of the modern quarterdeck here it was that he who directed the movements of a squadron overlooked its evolutions threw out his signals made his astronomical observations and sought his recreation in the open air the whole space on board the santa maria might have been some fifteen feet in one direction and not quite as much in the other making a convenient lookout more from its exclusion and retirement than from its dimensions  as soon as the admiralor don christoval as he was now termed by the spaniards since his appointment to his present high rank which gave him the rights and condition of a nobleas soon as don christoval caught a glance of luis eye he made a sign for the young man to ascend and take a position at his side although the expedition was so insignificant in numbers and force not equalling in the latter particular the power of a single modern sloop of war the authority of the queen the gravity and mien of columbus himself and most of all its own mysterious and unwonted object had from the first thrown around it a dignity that was disproportioned to its visible means accustomed to control the passions of turbulent men and aware of the great importance of impressing his followers with a sense of his high station and influence with the court columbus had kept much aloof from familiar intercourse with his subordinates acting principally through the pinzons and the other commanders lest he might lose some portion of that respect which he foresaw would be necessary to his objects it needed not his long experience to warn him that men crowded together in so small a space could only be kept in their social and professional stations by the most rigid observance of forms and decorum and he had observed a due attention to these great requisites in prescribing the manner in which his own personal service should be attended to and his personal dignity supported this is one of the great secrets of the discipline of a ship for they who are incapable of reasoning can be made to feel and no man is apt to despise him who is well entrenched behind the usages of deference and reserve we see daily the influence of an appellation or a commission even the turbulent submitting to its authority when they might resist the same lawful commands issuing from an apparently less elevated source  thou wilt keep much near my person señor gutierrez said the admiral using the feigned name which luis affected to conceal under that of pedro de muños as he knew a ship was never safe from eavesdroppers and was willing that the young noble should pass as the gentleman of the kings bedchamber this is our station and here we must remain much of our time until god in his holy and wise providence shall have opened the way for us to cathay and brought us near the throne of the great khan here is our course and along this track of pathless ocean it is my intention to steer  as columbus spoke he pointed to a chart that lay spread before him on an armchest passing a finger calmly along the line he intended to pursue the coast of europe in its general outlines was laid down on this chart with as much accuracy as the geographical knowledge of the day would furnish and a range of land extended southward as far as guinea all beyond which region was terra incognita to the learned world at that time the canaries and the azores which had been discovered some generations earlier occupied their proper places while the western side of the atlantic was bounded by a fancied delineation of the eastern coast of india or of cathay buttressed by the island of cipango or japan and an archipelago that had been represented principally after the accounts of marco polo and his relatives by a fortunate misconception cipango had been placed in a longitude that corresponded very nearly with that of washington or some two thousand leagues east of the position in which it is actually to be found this error of columbus in relation to the extent of the circumference of the globe in the end most probably saved his hardy enterprise from becoming a failure  luis for the first time since he had been engaged in the expedition cast his eyes over this chart with some curiosity and he felt a noble desire to solve the great problem rising within him as he thus saw at a glance all the vast results as well as the interesting natural phenomena that were dependent on the issue  by san gennaro of napoli he exclaimedthe only affectation the young noble had was a habit of invoking the saints of the different countries he had visited and of using the little oaths and exclamations of distant lands a summary mode of both letting the world know how far he had journeyed as well as a portion of the improvement he had derived from his travelsby san gennaro señor don christoval but this voyage will be one of exceeding merit if we ever find our way across this great belt of water and greater still should we ever manage to return  the last difficulty is the one at this moment uppermost in the minds of most in this vessel answered columbus dost thou not perceive don luis the grave and dejected countenances of the mariners and hearest thou the wailings that are rising from the shore  this remark caused the young man to raise his eyes from the chart and to take a survey of the scene around him the niña a light felucca in fact was already under way and brushing past them under a latine foresail her sides thronged with boats filled with people no small portion of whom were females and children and most of whom were wringing their hands and raising piteous cries of despair the pinta was in the act of being cast and although the authority of martin alonzo pinzon had the effect to render their grief less clamorous her sides were surrounded by a similar crowd while numberless boats plied around the santa maria herself the authority and dignity of the admiral alone keeping them at a distance it was evident that most of those who remained fancied that they now saw their departing relations for the last time while no small portion of those who were on the eve of sailing believed they were on the point of quitting spain forever  hast looked for pepe this morning among our people demanded columbus the incident of the young sailor recurring to his thoughts for the first time that morning if he prove false to his word we may regard it as an evil omen and have an eye on all our followers while there is a chance of escape  if his absence would be an omen of evil señor almirante his presence ought to be received as an omen of good the noble fellow is on this yard above our heads loosening the sail  columbus turned his eyes upward and there indeed was the young mariner in question poised on the extreme and attenuated end of the latine yard that ships even then carried on their aftermasts swinging in the wind while he loosened the gasket that kept the canvas in its folds occasionally he looked beneath him anxious to discover if his return had been noted and once or twice his hands usually so nimble lingered in their employment as he cast glances over the stern of the vessel as if one also drew his attention in that quarter columbus made a sign of recognition to the gratified young mariner who instantly permitted the canvas to fall and then he walked to the taffrail accompanied by luis in order to ascertain if any boat was near the ship there indeed close to the vessel lay a skiff rowed by monica alone and which had been permitted to approach so near on account of the sex of its occupant the moment the wife of pepe observed the form of the admiral she arose from her seat and clasped her hands toward him desirous but afraid to speak perceiving that the woman was awed by the bustle the crowd of persons and the appearance of the ship which she was almost near enough to touch with her hand columbus addressed her he spoke mildly and his looks usually so grave and sometimes even stern were softened to an expression of gentleness that luis had never before witnessed  i see that thy husband hath been true to his promise good woman he said and i doubt not that thou hast told him it is wiser and better manfully to serve the queen than to live under the disgrace of a runaway  señor i have i give doña isabella my husband without a murmur if not cheerfully now i know that you go forth to serve god i see the wickedness of my repinings and shall pray that he may be foremost on all occasions until the ears of the infidel shall be opened to the words of the true faith  this is said like a spanish wife and a christian woman our lives are in the care of providence and doubt not of seeing pepe in health and safety after he hath visited cathay and done his share in its discovery  ah señorwhen exclaimed the wife unable in spite of her assumed fortitude and the strong feelings of religious duty to suppress the impulses of a woman  in gods time my goodhow art thou named  monica señor almirante and my husband is called pepe and the boy the poor fatherless child hath been christened juan we have no moorish blood but are pure spaniards and i pray your excellency to remember it on such occasions as may call for more dangerous duty than common  thou mayst depend on my care of the father of juan returned the admiral smiling though a tear glistened in his eye i too leave behind those that are dear to me as my own soul and among others a motherless son should aught serious befall our vessel diego would be an orphan whereas thy juan would at least enjoy the care and affection of her who brought him into the world  señor a thousand pardons said the woman much touched by the feeling that was betrayed by the admiral in his voice we are selfish and forget that others have sorrows when we feel our own too keenly go forth in gods name and do his holy willtake my husband with you i only wish that little juan was old enough to be his companion  monica could utter no more but dashing the tears from her eyes she resumed the oars and pulled the little skiff slowly as if the inanimate machine felt the reluctance of the hands that propelled it toward the land the short dialogue just related had been carried on in voices so loud as to be heard by all near the speakers and when columbus turned from the boat he saw that many of his crew had been hanging suspended in the rigging or on the yards eagerly listening to what had been said at this precise instant the anchor of the santa maria was raised from the bottom and the ships head began to incline from the direction of the wind at the next moment the flap of the large square foresail that crafts of her rig then carried was heard and in the course of the next five minutes the three vessels were standing slowly but steadily down the current of the odiel in one of the arms of which river they had been anchored holding their course toward a bar near its mouth the sun had not yet risen or rather it rose over the hills of spain a fiery ball just as the sails were set gilding with a melancholy glory a coast that not a few in the different vessels apprehended they were looking upon for the last time many of the boats clung to the two smaller craft until they reached the bar of saltes an hour or two later and some still persevered until they began to toss in the long waves of the breathing ocean when the wind being fresh at the west they reluctantly cast off one by one amid sighs and groans the liberated ships in the meanwhile moved steadily into the blue waters of the shoreless atlantic like human beings silently impelled by their destinies toward fates that they can neither foresee control nor avoid  the day was fine and the wind both brisk and fair thus far the omens were propitious but the unknown future threw a cloud over the feelings of a large portion of those who were thus quitting in gloomy uncertainty all that was most dear to them it was known that the admiral intended making the best of his way toward the canaries thence to enter on the unknown and hitherto untrodden paths of the desert ocean that lay beyond those who doubted therefore fixed upon those islands as the points where their real dangers were to commence and already looked forward to their appearance in the horizon with feelings akin to those with which the guilty regard the day of trial the condemned the morning of execution or the sinner the bed of death many however were superior to this weakness having steeled their nerves and prepared their minds for any hazards though the feelings of nearly all fluctuated there being hours when hope and anticipations of success seemed to cheer the entire crews and then moments would occur in which the disposition was to common doubts and a despondency that was nearly general  a voyage to the canaries or the azores in that age was most probably to be classed among the hardiest exploits of seamen the distance was not as great certainly as many of their more ordinary excursions for vessels frequently went even in the same direction as far as the cape de verdes but all the other european passages lay along the land and in the mediterranean the seaman felt that he was navigating within known limits and was apt to consider himself as embayed within the boundaries of human knowledge on the contrary while sailing on the broad atlantic he was in some respects placed in a situation resembling that of the æronaut who while floating in the higher currents of the atmosphere sees beneath him the earth as his only alighting place the blue void of untravelled space stretching in all other directions about him  the canary isles were known to the ancients juba the king of mauritania who was a contemporary of cæsar is said to have described them with tolerable accuracy under the general name of the fortunate isles the work itself has been lost but the fact is known through the evidence of other writers and by the same means it is known that they possessed even in that remote age a population that had made some respectable advances toward civilization but in the process of time and during the dark period that succeeded the brightness of the roman sway even the position of these islands was lost to the europeans nor was it again ascertained until the first half of the fourteenth century when they were discovered by certain fugitive spaniards who were hard pressed by the moors after this the portuguese then the most hardy navigators of the known world got possession of one or two of them and made them the starting points for their voyages of discovery along the coast of guinea as the spaniards reduced the power of the mussulmans and regained their ancient sway in the peninsula they once more turned their attention in this direction conquering the natives of several of the other islands the group belonging equally to those two christian nations at the time of our narrative  luis de bobadilla who had navigated extensively in the more northern seas and who had passed and repassed the mediterranean in various directions knew nothing of these islands except by report and as they stood on the poop columbus pointed out to him their position and explained their different characters relating his intentions in connection with them dwelling on the supplies they afforded and on their facilities as a point of departure  the portuguese have profited much by their use of these islands said columbus as a place for victualling and wooding and watering and i see no reason why castile may not now imitate their example and receive her share of the benefits thou seest how far south our neighbors have penetrated and what a trade and how much riches are flowing into lisbon through these noble enterprises which notwithstanding are but as a bucket of water in the ocean when compared with the wealth of cathay and all the mighty consequences that are to follow from this western voyage of ours  dost thou expect to reach the territories of the great khan don christoval demanded luis within a distance as small as that to which the portuguese hath gone southwardly  the navigator looked warily around to ascertain who might hear his words and finding that no one was within reach of the sound of his voice while he used a proper caution he lowered its tones and answered in a manner which greatly flattered his young companion as it proved that the admiral was disposed to treat him with the frankness and confidence of a friend  thou knowst don luis the navigator resumed the nature of the spirits with whom we have to deal i shall not even be certain of their services so long as we continue near the coast of europe for naught is easier than for one of yonder craft to abandon me in the night and to seek a haven on some known coast seeking his justification in some fancied necessity  martin alonzo is not a man to do that ignoble and unworthy act interrupted luis  he is not my young friend for a motive as base as fear returned columbus with a sort of thoughtful smile which showed how truly and early he had dived into the real characters of those with whom he was associated martin alonzo is a bold and intelligent navigator and we may look for good service at his hands in all that toucheth resolution and perseverance but the eyes of the pinzons cannot be always open and the knowledge of all the philosophers of the earth could make no resistance against the headlong impetuosity of a crew of alarmed mutineers i do not feel certain of our own people while there is a hope of easy return much less of men who are not directly under my own eye and command the question thou hast asked luis may not therefore be publicly answered since the distance we are about to sail over would frighten our easily alarmed mariners thou art a cavalier a knight of known courage and may be depended on and i may tell thee without fear of arousing any unworthy feeling that the voyage on which we are now fairly embarked hath never had a precedent on this earth for its length or for the loneliness of its way  and yet señor thou enterest on it with the confidence of a man certain of reaching his haven  luis thou hast well judged my feelings as to all those common dreads of descents and ascents of the difficulties of a return and of reaching the margin of the world whence we may glide off into space neither thou nor i shall be much subjected  by san iago señor don christoval i have no very settled notions about these things i have never known of any one who hath slidden off the earth into the air it is true nor do i much think that such a slide is likely to befall us and our good ships but on the other hand we have as yet only doctrine to prove that the earth is round and that it is possible to journey east by sailing west on these subjects then i hold myself neuter while at the same time thou mayst steer direct for the moon and luis de bobadilla will be found at thy side  thou makest thyself less expert in science madbrained young noble than is either true or necessary but we will say no more of this at present there will be sufficient leisure to make thee familiar with all my intricate reasons and familiar motives and is not this don luis a most heavenly sight here am i in the open ocean honored by the two sovereigns with the dignity of their viceroy and admiral with a fleet that is commissioned by their highnesses to carry the knowledge of their power and authority to the uttermost parts of the earth and most of all to raise the cross of our blessed redeemer before the eyes of infidels who have never yet even heard his name or if they have reverence it as little as a christian would reverence the idols of the heathens  this was said with the calm but deep enthusiasm that colored the entire character of the great navigator rendering him at times equally the subject of distrust and of profound respect on luis as indeed on most others who lived in sufficient familiarity with the man to enable them to appreciate his motives and to judge correctly of the uprightness of his views the effect however was always favorable and probably would have been so had mercedes never existed the young man himself was not entirely without a tinge of enthusiasm and as is ever the case with the singleminded and generous he best knew how to regard the impulses of those who were influenced by similar qualities this answer was consequently in accordance with the feelings of the admiral and they remained on the poop several hours discoursing of the future with the ardor of those who hoped for every thing but in a manner too discursive and general to render a record of the dialogue easy or necessary  it was eight oclock in the morning when the vessels passed the bar of saltes and the day had far advanced before the navigators had lost sight of the familiar eminences that lay around palos and the other wellknown landmarks of the coast the course was due south and as the vessels of that day were lightly sparred and spread comparatively very little canvas when considered in connection with the more dashing navigation of our own times the rate of sailing was slow and far from promising a speedy termination to a voyage that all knew must be long without a precedent and which so many feared could never have an end two marine leagues of three english miles an hour was good progress for a vessel at that day even with a fresh and favorable wind though there are a few memorable days works set down by columbus himself which approach to a hundred and sixty miles in the twentyfour hours and which are evidently noted as a speed of which a mariner might well be proud in these days of locomotion and travelling it is scarcely necessary to tell the intelligent reader this is but a little more than half the distance that is sailed over by a fast ship under similar circumstances and in our own time  thus the sun set upon the adventurers in this celebrated voyage when they had sailed with a strong breeze to use the words of columbus own record some eleven hours after quitting the bar by this time they had made good less than fifty miles in a due south course from the place of their departure the land in the neighborhood of palos had entirely sunk behind the watery margin of the ocean in that direction and the coast trending eastward it was only here and there that the misty summits of a few of the mountains of seville could just be discovered by the experienced eyes of the older mariners as the glowing ball of the sun sunk into the watery bed of the western horizon and disappeared from view at this precise moment columbus and luis were again on the poop watching with melancholy interest the last shadows cast by spanish land while two seamen were at work near them splicing a rope that had been chafed asunder the latter were seated on the deck and as out of respect to the admiral they had taken their places a little on one side their presence was not at first noted  there setteth the sun beneath the waves of the wide atlantic señor gutierrez observed the admiral who was ever cautious to use one or the other of luis feigned appellations whenever any person was near there the sun quitteth us pero and in his daily course i see a proof of the globular form of the earth and of the truth of a theory which teacheth us that cathay may be reached by the western voyage  i am ever ready to admit the wisdom of all your plans expectations and thoughts señor don christoval returned the young man punctiliously observant of respect both in speech and manner but i confess i cannot see what the daily course of the sun has to do with the position of cathay or with the road that leads to it we know that the great luminary travelleth the heavens without ceasing that it cometh up out of the sea in the morning and goeth down to its watery bed at night but this it doth on the coast of castile as well as on that of cathay and therefore to me it doth appear that no particular inference for or against our success is to be drawn from the circumstance  as this was said the two sailors ceased working looking curiously up into the face of the admiral anxious to hear his reply by this movement luis perceived that one was pepe to whom he gave a nod of recognition while the other was a stranger the last had every appearance of a thoroughbred seaman of that period or of being what would have been termed in english and the more northern languages of europe a regular seadog a term that expresses the idea of a man so completely identified with the ocean by habit as to have had his exterior his thoughts his language and even his morality colored by the association this sailor was approaching fifty was short square athletic and still active but there was a mixture of the animal with the intellectual creature about his coarse heavy features that is very usual in the countenances of men of native humor and strong sense whose habits have been coarse and sensual that he was a prime seaman columbus knew at a glance not only from his general appearance but from his occupation which was such as only fell to the lot of the most skilful men of every crew  i reason after this fashion señor answered the admiral as soon as his eye turned from the glance that he too had thrown upon the men the sun is not made to journey thus around the earth without a sufficient motive the providence of god being ruled by infinite wisdom it is not probable that a luminary so generous and useful should be intended to waste any of its benefits and we are certain already that day and night journey westward over this earth as far as it is known to us whence i infer that the system is harmonious and the benefits of the great orb are unceasingly bestowed on man reaching one spot on the earth as it quits another the sun that hath just left us is still visible in the azores and will be seen again at smyrna and among the grecian islands an hour or more before it again meets our eyes nature hath designed naught for uselessness and i believe that cathay will be enlightened by that ball which hath just left us while we shall be in the deepest hour of the night to return by its eastern path across the great continent of asia and to greet us again in the morning in a word friend pedro that which sol is now doing with such nimble speed in the heavens we are more humbly imitating in our own caravels give us sufficient time and we too might traverse the earth coming in from our journey by the land of the tartars and the persians  from all of which you infer that the world is round wherein we are to find the certainty of our success  this is so true señor de muños that i should be sorry to think any man who now saileth under my command did not admit it here are two seamen who have been listening to our discourse and we will question them that we may know the opinions of men accustomed to the ocean thou art the husband with whom i held discourse on the sands the past evening and thy name is pepe  señor almirante your excellencys memory doth me too much honor in not forgetting a face that is altogether unworthy of being noticed and remembered  it is an honest face friend and no doubt speaketh for a true heart i shall count on thee as a sure support let things go as they may  his excellency hath not only a right to command me as her highness admiral but he hath now the goodwill of monica and that is much the same as having gained her husband  i thank thee honest pepe and shall count on thee with certainty in future answered columbus turning toward the other seamanand thou shipmatethou hast the air of one that the sight of troubled water will not alarmthou hast a name  that i have noble admiral returned the fellow looking up with a freedom that denoted one used to have his say though it hath neither a don nor a señor to take it in tow my intimates commonly call out sancho when pressed for time and when civility gets the better of haste they add mundo making sancho mundo for the whole name of a very poor man  mundo is a large name for so small a person said the admiral smiling for he foresaw the expediency of having friends among his crew and knew men sufficiently to understand that while undue familiarity undermined respect a little unbending had a tendency to win hearts i wonder that thou shouldst venture to wear a sound so lofty  i tell my fellows your excellency that mundo is my title and not my name but that i am greater than kings even who are content to take their titles from a part of that of which i bear all  and were thy father and thy mother called mundo also or is this name taken in order to give thee an occasion to show thy smartness when questioned by thy officers  as for the good people you deign to mention señor don almirante i shall leave them to answer for themselves and that for the simple reason that i do not know how they were called or whether they had any names at all they tell me i was found when a few hours old under a wornout basket at the shipyard gate of old  never mind the precise spot friend sanchothou wert found with a basket for a cradle and that maketh a volume in thy history at once  nay excellency i would not leave the spot a place of dispute hereafterbut it shall be as you please they say no one here knoweth exactly where we are going and it will be more suitable that the like ignorance should rest over the places whence we came but having the world before me they that christened me gave me as much of it as was to be got by a name  thou hast been long a mariner sancho mundoif mundo thou wilt be  so long señor that it sickeneth me and taketh away the appetite to walk on solid ground being so near the gate it was no great matter to put me into the shipyard and i was launched one day in a caravel and got to sea in her no one knows how from that time i have submitted to fate and go out again as soon as possible after i come into port  and by what lucky chance have i obtained thy services good sancho in this great expedition  the authorities of moguer took me under the queens order your excellency thinking that this voyage would be more to my mind than another as it was likely never to have an end  art thou a compelled adventurer on this service  not i señor don almirante although they who sent me here fancy as much it is natural for a man to wish to see his estates once in his life and i am told that we are bound on a voyage to the other side of the world god forbid that i should hold aloof on such an occasion  thou art a christian sancho and hast a desire to aid in carrying the cross among the heathen  señor your excellency don almirante it matters little to sancho with what the barque is laden so that she do not need much pumping and that the garlic is good if i am not a very devout christian it is the fault of them that found me near the shipyard gate since the church and the font are both within call from that very spot i know that pepe here is a christian señor for i saw him in the arms of the priest and i doubt not that there are old men at moguer who can testify to as much in my behalf at all hazards noble admiral i will take on myself to say that i am neither jew nor mussulman  sancho thou hast that about thee that bespeakest a skilful and bold mariner  for both of these qualities señor don colon let others speak when the gale cometh your own eyes may judge of the first and when the caravel shall reach the edge of the earth whither some think it is bound there will be a good occasion to see who can and who cannot look off without trembling  it is enough i count both thee and pepe as among my truest followers as columbus said this he walked away resuming the dignified gravity that usually was seated in his countenance and which so much aided his authority by impressing the minds of others with respect in a few minutes he and luis descended to their cabin  i marvel sancho said pepe as soon as he and his messmate were left alone on the poop that thou wilt venture to use thy tongue so freely even in the presence of one that beareth about with him the queens authority dost thou not fear to offend the admiral  so much for having a wife and a child canst thou not make any difference between them that have had ancestors and who have descendants and one that hath no other tie in the world than his name the señor don almirante is either an exceeding great man and chosen by providence to open the way into the unknown seas of which he speaketh or he is but a hungry genoese that is leading us he knoweth not whither that he may eat and drink and sleep in honor while we are toiling at his heels like patient mules dragging the load that the horse despiseth in the one case he is too great and exalted to heed idle words and in the other what is there too bad for a castilian to tell him  ay thou art fond of calling thyself a castilian in spite of the shipyard and the basket and notwithstanding moguer is in seville  harkee pepe is not the queen of castile our mistress and are not subjectstrue and lawful subjects i mean like thee and meare not such subjects worthy of being the queens countrymen never disparage thyself good pepe for thou wilt ever find the world ready enough to do that favor for thee as to this genoese he shall be either friend or enemy to sancho if the first i expect much consolation from it if the last let him hunt for his cathay till doomsday he shall be never the wiser  well sancho if words can mar a voyage or make a voyage thou art a ready mariner none know how to discourse better than thou  here the men both rose having completed their work and they left the poop descending among the rest of the crew columbus had not miscalculated his aim his words and condescension having produced a most favorable effect on the mind of sancho mundo for so the man was actually called and in gaining one of as ready a wit and loose a tongue for a friend he obtained an ally who was not to be despised of such materials and with the support of such instruments as this is success too often composed it being possible for the discovery of a world even to depend on the good word of one less qualified to influence opinions than sancho mundo     chapter xv      while you here do snoring lie     openeyd conspiracy       his time doth take     if of life you keep a care     shake off slumber and beware       awake awake      ariel   the wind continuing fair the three vessels made good progress in the direction of the canaries sunday in particular proving a propitious day the expedition making more than one hundred and twenty miles in the course of the twentyfour hours the wind still continued favorable and on the morning of monday the 6th of august columbus was cheerfully conversing with luis and one or two other companions who were standing near him on the poop when the pinta was seen suddenly to take in her forward sails and to come up briskly not to say awkwardly to the wind this manoeuvre denoted some accident and the santa maria fortunately having the advantage of the wind immediately edged away to speak her consort  how now señor martin alonzo hailed the admiral as the two caravels came near enough together to speak each other for what reason hast thou so suddenly paused in thy course  fortune would have it so señor don christoval seeing that the rudder of the good caravel hath broken loose and we must fain secure it ere we may again trust ourselves to the breeze  a severe frown came over the grave countenance of the great navigator and after bidding martin alonzo do his best to repair the damage he paced the deck greatly disturbed for several minutes observing how much the admiral took this accident to heart the rest descended to the deck below leaving columbus alone with the pretended groom of the kings chamber  i trust señor this is no serious injury or one in any way likely to retard our advance said luis after manifesting that respect which all near him felt for the admiral by a pause i know honest martin alonzo to be a ready seaman and should think his expedients might easily serve to get us as far as the canaries where greater damages can meet with their remedies  thou sayst true luis and we will hope for the best i feel regret the sea is so high that we can offer no assistance to the pinta but martin alonzo is indeed an expert mariner and on his ingenuity we must rely my concern however hath another and a deeper source than the unloosing of this rudder serious as such an injury ever is to a vessel at sea thou knowst that the pinta hath been furnished to the service of the queen under the order claiming the forfeited duty from the delinquents of palos and sorely against the will of the caravels owners hath the vessel been taken now these persons gomez rascon and christoval quintero are on board her and i question not have designed this accident their artifices were practised long to our delay before quitting the haven and it would seem are to be continued to our prejudice here on the open ocean  by the allegiance i owe the doña isabella señor don christoval but i would find a speedy cure for such a treason if the office of punishment rested with me let me jump into the skiff and repair to the pinta where i will tell these masters rascon and quintero that should their rudder ever dare to break loose again or should any other similar and untoward accident chance to arrive the first shall be hanged at the yard of his own caravel and the last be cast into the sea to examine into the state of her bottom the rudder included  we may not practice such high authority without great occasion and perfect certainty of guilt i hold it to be wiser to seek another caravel at the canaries for by this accident i well see we shall not be rid of the artifices of the two owners until we are rid of their vessel it will be hazardous to launch the skiff in this sea or i would proceed to the pinta myself but as it is let us have confidence in martin alonzo and his skill  columbus thus encouraged the people of the pinta to exert themselves and in about an hour or two the three vessels were again making the best of their way toward the canaries notwithstanding the delay nearly ninety miles were made good in the course of the day and night but the following morning the rudder again broke loose and as the damage was more serious than in the former instance it was still more difficult to repair these repeated accidents gave the admiral great concern for he took them to be so many indications of the disaffection of his followers he fully determined in consequence to get rid of the pinta if it were possible to find another suitable vessel among the islands as the progress of the vessels was much retarded by the accident although the wind continued favorable the expedition only got some sixty miles this day nearer to its place of destination  on the following morning the three vessels came within hail of each other and a comparison of the nautical skill of the different navigators or pilots as it was then the custom to style them took place each offering his opinion as to the position of the vessels  it was not the least of the merits of columbus that he succeeded in his great experiment with the imperfect aid of the instruments then in use the mariners compass it is true had been in common service quite a century if not longer though its variationsa knowledge of which is scarcely less important in long voyages than a knowledge of the instrument itselfwere then unknown to seamen who seldom ventured far enough from the land to note these mysteries of nature and who as a class still relied almost as much on the ordinary position of the heavenly bodies to ascertain their routes as on the nicer results of calculation columbus however was a striking exception to this littleinstructed class having made himself thoroughly acquainted with all the learning of the period that could be applied in his profession or which might aid him in effecting the great purpose for which alone he now seemed to live  as might be expected the comparison resulted altogether in the admirals favor the pilots in general being soon convinced that he alone knew the true position of the vessels a fact that was soon unanswerably determined by the appearance of the summits of the canaries which hove up out of the ocean in a southeasterly direction resembling welldefined dark clouds clustering in the horizon as objects like these are seen at a great distance at sea more especially in a transparent atmosphere and the wind became light and variable the vessels notwithstanding were unable to reach grand canary until thursday the 8th of august or nearly a week after they had left palos there they all ran in and anchored in the usual haven columbus immediately set about making an inquiry for another caravel but proving unsuccessful he sailed for gomera where he believed it might be easier to obtain the craft he wanted while the admiral was thus employed with the santa maria and the niña martin alonzo remained in port being unable to keep company in the crippled condition of the pinta but no suitable vessel being found columbus reluctantly returned to grand canary and after repairing the pinta which vessel was badly caulked among the other devices that had been adopted to get her freed from the service he sailed again for gomera from which island he was to take his final departure  during these several changes a brooding discontent began to increase among most of the common mariners while some even of a higher class were not altogether free from the most melancholy apprehensions for the future while passing from grand canary to gomera with all his vessels columbus was again at his post with luis and his usual companions near him when the admirals attention was drawn to a conversation that took place between a group of the men who had collected near the mainmast it was night and there being little wind the voices of the excited disputants reached further than they themselves were aware  i tell thee pepe said the most vociferous and most earnest of the speakers that the night is not darker than the future of this crew look to the west and what dost see there who hath ever heard of land after he hath quitted the azores and who is so ignorant as not to know that providence hath placed water around all the continents with a few islands as stoppingplaces for mariners and spread the broad ocean beyond with an intention to rebuke an overeager curiosity to pry into matters that savor more of miracles than of common worldly things  this is well pero answered pepe but i know that monica thinks the admiral is sent of god and that we may look forward to great discoveries through his means and most especially to the spreading of religion among the heathens  ay thy monica should have been in doña isabellas seat so learned and positive is she in all matters whether touching her own womans duties or thine own she is thy queen pepe as all in moguer will swear and there are some who say she would gladly govern the port as she governeth thee  say naught against the mother of my child pero interrupted pepe angrily i can bear thy idle words against myself but he that speaketh ill of monica will have a dangerous enemy  thou art bold of speech pero when away a hundred leagues from thine own better ninetenths put in a voice that columbus and luis both knew on the instant to belong to sancho mundo and art bold enough to jeer pepe touching monica when we all well know who commandeth in a certain cabin where thou art as meek as a hooked dolphin whatever thou mayst be here but enough of thy folly about women let us reason upon our knowledge as mariners if thou wilt instead of asking questions of one like pepe who is too young to have had much experience i offer myself as thy catechist  what hast thou then to say about this unknown land that lieth beyond the great ocean where man hath never been or is at all likely to go with followers such as these  i have this to say silly and idletongued perothat the time was when even the canaries were unknown when mariners did not dare to pass the straits and when the portuguese knew nothing of their mines and guinea lands that i myself have visited and where the noble don christoval hath also been as i know on the testimony of mine own eyes  and what hath guinea or what have the mines of the portuguese to do with this western voyage all know that there is a country called africa and what is there surprising that mariners should reach a land that is known to exist but who knoweth that the ocean hath other continents any more than that the heavens have other earths  this is well pero observed an attentive bystander and sancho will have to drain his wits to answer it  it is well for those who wag their tongues like women without thought of what they say coolly returned sancho but will have little weight with doña isabella or don almirante harkee pero thou art like one that hath trodden the path between palos and moguer so often that thou fanciest there is no road to seville or granada there must be a beginning to all things and this voyage is out of doubt the beginning of voyages to cathay we go west instead of east because it is the shorter way and because moreover it is the only way for a caravel now answer me messmate is it possible for a craft let her size or rig be what it may to pass over the hills and valleys of a continenti mean under her canvas and by fair sailing  sancho waited for a reply and received a common and complete admission of the impossibility of the thing  then cast your eyes at the admirals chart in the morning as he keepeth it spread before him on the poop yonder and you will see that there is land from one pole to the other on each side of the atlantic thereby rendering navigation impossible in any other direction than this we are now taking the notion of pero therefore runs in the teeth of nature  this is so true pero exclaimed another the rest assenting that thy mouth ought to be shut  but pero had a mouth that was not very easily closed and it is probable that his answer would have been to the full as acute and irrefutable as that of sancho had not a common exclamation of alarm and horror burst from all around him the night was sufficiently clear to permit the gloomy outlines of the peak of teneriffe to be distinctly visible even at some distance and just at that moment flashes of flame shot upward from its pointed summit illuminating at instants the huge pile and then leaving it in shadowy darkness an object of mystery and terror many of the seamen dropped on their knees and began to tell their beads while all as it might be instinctively crossed themselves next arose a general murmur and in a few minutes the men who slept were awoke and appeared among their fellows awestruck and astounded spectators of the phenomenon it was soon settled that the attention of the admiral should be drawn to this strange event and pero was selected for the spokesman  all this time columbus and his companions remained on the poop and as might have been expected this unlookedfor change in the appearance of the peak had not escaped their attention too enlightened to be alarmed by it they were watching the workings of the mountain when pero accompanied by nearly every sailor in the vessel appeared on the quarterdeck silence having been obtained pero opened the subject of his mission with a zeal that was not a little stimulated by his fears  señor almirante he commenced we have come to pray your excellency to look at the summit of the island of teneriffe where we all think we see a solemn warning against persevering in sailing into the unknown atlantic it is truly time for men to remember their weakness and how much they owe to the goodness of god when even the mountains vomit flames and smoke  have any here ever navigated the mediterranean or visited the island of which don ferdinand the honored consort of our lady the queen is master demanded columbus calmly  señor don almirante hastily answered sancho i have done so unworthy as i may seem to have enjoyed that advantage and i have seen cyprus and alexandria and even stamboul the residence of the great turk  well then thou mayst have also seen Ætna another mountain which continueth to throw up those flames in the midst of a nature and a scene on which providence would seem to have smiled with unusual benignity instead of angrily frowning as ye seem to imagine  columbus then proceeded to give his people an explanation of the causes of volcanoes referring to the gentlemen around him to corroborate the fidelity of his statements he told them that he looked upon this little eruption as merely a natural occurrence or if he saw any omen at all in the event it was propitious rather than otherwise providence seeming disposed to light them on their way luis and the rest next descended among the crew where they used their reasoning powers in quieting an alarm that at first had threatened to be serious for the moment they were successful or perhaps it would be better to say that they succeeded completely so far as the phenomenon of the volcano was concerned and this less by the arguments of the more intelligent of the officers than by means of the testimony of sancho and one or two others of the common men who had seen similar scenes elsewhere with difficulties like these had the great navigator to contend even after he had passed years in solicitations to obtain the limited means which had been finally granted in order to effect one of the sublimest achievements that had yet crowned the enterprise of man  the vessels reached gomera on the 2d of september where they remained several days in order to complete their repairs and to finish taking in their supplies ere they finally left the civilized abodes of man and what might then be deemed the limits of the known earth the arrival of such an expedition in an age when the means of communication were so few that events were generally their own announcers had produced a strong sensation among the inhabitants of the different islands visited by the adventurers columbus was held in high honor among them not only on account of the commission he had received from the two sovereigns but on account of the magnitude and the romantic character of his undertaking  there existed a common belief among all the adjacent islands including madeira the azores and the canaries that land lay to the westward their inhabitants living under a singular delusion in this particular which the admiral had an occasion to detect during his second visit to gomera among the most distinguished persons who were then on the island was doña inez peraza the mother of the count of gomera she was attended by a crowd of persons not only belonging to her own but who had come from other islands to do her honor she entertained the admiral in a manner suited to his high rank admitting to her society such of the adventurers as columbus saw fit to point out as worthy of the honor of course the pretended pedro de muños or pero gutierrez as he was now indifferently termed was of the number as indeed were most of those who might be deemed any way suited to so high and polished a society  i rejoice don christopher said doña inez peraza on this occasion that their highnesses have at length yielded to your desire to solve this great problem not only on account of our holy church which as you say hath so deep an interest in your success and the honor of the two sovereigns and the welfare of spain and all the other great considerations that we have so freely touched upon in our discourse already but on account of the worthy inhabitants of the fortunate islands who have not only many traditions touching land in the west but most of whom believe that they have more than once seen it in that quarter in the course of their lives  i have heard of this noble lady and would be grateful to have the account from the mouths of eyewitnesses now we are here together conversing freely concerning that which is of so much interest to us all  then señor i will entreat this worthy cavalier who is every way capable of doing the subject justice to be spokesman for us and to let you know what we all believe in these islands and what so many of us fancy we have seen acquaint the admiral señor dama i pray thee of the singular yearly view that we get of unknown land lying afar off in the atlantic  most readily doña inez and all the more so at your gracious bidding returned the person addressed who disposed himself to tell the story with a readiness that the lovers of the wonderful are apt to betray when a fitting opportunity offers to indulge a favorite propensity the illustrious admiral hath probably heard of the island of st brandan that lieth some eighty or a hundred leagues to the westward of ferro and which hath been so often seen but which no navigator hath yet been able to reach in our days at least  i have often heard of this fabled spot señor the admiral gravely replied but pardon me if i say that the land never yet existed which a mariner hath seen and yet a mariner hath not reached  nay noble admiral interrupted a dozen eager voices among which that of the lady herself was very distinctly audible that it hath been seen most here know and that it hath never been reached is a fact to which more than one disappointed pilot can testify  that which we have seen we know and that which we know we can describe returned columbus steadily let any man tell me in what meridian or on what parallel this st brandan or st barandon lieth and a week shall make me also certain of its existence  i know little of meridians or parallels don christopher said the señor dama but i have some ideas of visible things this island have i often seen more or less plainly at different times and that too under the serenest skies and at occasions when it was not possible greatly to mistake either its form or its dimensions once i remember to have seen the sun set behind one of its heights  this is plain evidence and such as a navigator should respect and yet do i take what you imagine yourself to have seen señor to be some illusion of the atmosphere  impossibleimpossible was said or echoed by a dozen voices hundreds yearly witness the appearance of st brandan and its equally sudden and mysterious disappearance  therein noble lady and generous cavalier lieth the error into which ye have fallen ye see the peak the year round and he who will cruise a hundred miles north or south east or west of it will continue to see it the year round except on such days as the state of the atmosphere may forbid the land which god hath created stationary will be certain to remain stationary until disturbed by some great convulsion that cometh equally of his providence and his laws  all this may be true señor doubtless it is true but every rule hath its exceptions you will not deny that god ruleth the world mysteriously and that his ends are not always visible to human eyes else why hath the moor so long been permitted to rule in spain why hath the infidel at this moment possession of the holy sepulchre why have the sovereigns been so long deaf to your own wellgrounded wishes and entreaties to be permitted to carry their banners in company with the cross to cathay whither you are now bound who knoweth that these appearances of st brandan may not be given as signs to encourage one like yourself bent on still greater ends than even reaching its shores  columbus was an enthusiast but his was an enthusiasm that was seated in his reverence for the acknowledged mysteries of religion which sought no other support from things incomprehensible than might reasonably be thought to belong to the exercise of infallible wisdom and which manifested a proper reverence for a divine power like most of that period he believed in modern miracles and his dependence on the direct worldly efficacy of votive offerings penances and prayers was such as marked the age in general and his calling in particular still his masculine understanding rejected the belief of vulgar prodigies and while he implicitly thought himself set apart and selected for the great work before him he was not disposed to credit that an airy exhibition of an island was placed in the west to tempt mariners to follow its shadowy outline to the more distant regions of cathay  that i feel the assurance of the providence of god having selected me as the humble instrument of connecting europe with asia by means of a direct voyage by sea is certain returned the navigator gravely though his eye lighted with its latent enthusiasm but i am far from indulging in the weakness of thinking that direct miraculous agencies are to be used to guide me on my way it is more in conformity to the practice of divine wisdom and certainly more grateful to my own selflove that the means employed are such as a discreet pilot and the most experienced philosophers might feel proud in finding themselves selected to display my thoughts have first been turned to the contemplation of this subject then hath my reason been enlightened by a due course of study and reflection and science hath aided in producing the conviction necessary to impel myself to proceed and to enable me to induce others to join in this enterprise  and do all your followers noble admiral act under the same guidance demanded the doña inez glancing at luis whose manly graces and martial aspect had found favor in the eyes of most of the ladies of the island is the señor gutierrez equally enlightened in this manner and hath he too devoted his nights to study in order that the cross may be carried to the heathen and castile and cathay may be more closely united  the señor gutierrez is a willing adventurer señora but he must be the expounder of his own motives  then we will call on the cavalier himself for an answer these ladies feel a desire to know what may have impelled one who would be certain to succeed at the court of doña isabella and in the moorish wars to join in such an expedition  the moorish wars are ended señora replied luis smiling and doña isabella and all the ladies of her court most favor the youths who show a manly disposition to serve the interests and to advance the honor of castile i know very little of philosophy and have still smaller pretensions to the learning of churchmen but i think i see cathay before me shining like a brilliant star in the heavens and am willing to adventure body and soul in its search  many pretty exclamations of admiration broke from the circle of fair listeners it being most easy for spirit to gain applause when it is recommended by high personal advantages and comes from the young and favored that columbus a weatherworn veteran of the ocean should see fit to risk a life that was already drawing near its close in a rash attempt to pry into the mysteries of the atlantic seemed neither so commendable nor so daring but many discovered high qualities in the character of one who was just entering on his career and that under auspices apparently so flattering and who threw all his hopes on the uncertain chances of success in a scheme so unusual luis was human and he was in the full enjoyment of the admiration his enterprise had evidently awakened among so many sensitive young creatures when doña inez most inopportunely interposed to interrupt his happiness and to wound his selfesteem  this is having more honorable views than my letters from seville attribute to one youth who belongeth to the proudest of our castilian houses and whose titles alone should invite him to add new lustre to a name that hath so long been the spanish boast resumed the señora peraza the reports speak of his desire to rove but in a manner unworthy of his rank and that too in a way to serve neither the sovereigns his country nor himself  and who may this misguided youth be señora eagerly inquired luis too much elated by the admiration he had just excited to anticipate the answer a cavalier thus spoken of needeth to be warned of his reputation that he may be stimulated to attempt better things  his name is no secret since the court speaketh openly of his singular and illjudged career and it is said that even his love hath been thwarted in consequence i mean a cavalier of no less lineage and name than don luis de bobadilla the count of llera  it is said that listeners seldom hear good of themselves and luis was now fated to verify the truth of the axiom he felt the blood rushing to his face and it required a strong effort at selfcommand to prevent him from breaking out in exclamations that would probably have contained invocations of half the patron saints he had ever heard of had he not happily succeeded in controlling the sudden impulse gulping the words he had been on the point of uttering he looked round with an air of defiance as if seeking the countenance of some man who might dare even to smile at what had been said luckily at that moment columbus had drawn all of the males present around himself in warm discussion of the probable existence of the island of st brandan and luis nowhere met a smile with which he could conveniently quarrel that had a setting of beard to render it hostile fortunately the gentle impulses that are apt to influence a youthful female induced one of doña inezs fair companions to speak and that in a way greatly to relieve the feelings of our hero  true señora rejoined the pretty young advocate the first tones of whose voice had an effect to calm the tempest that was rising in the bosom of the young man true señora it is said that don luis is a wanderer and one of unsettled tastes and habits but it is also said he hath a most excellent heart is generous as the dews of heaven themselves and carrieth the very best lance of castile as he is also like to carry off the fairest maiden  it is vain señor de muños for churchmen to preach and parents to frown said doña inez smiling while the beautiful and young will prize courage and deeds in arms and an open hand before the more homely virtues commended by our holy religion and so zealously inculcated by its servants the unhorsing of a knight or two in the tourneys and the rallying a broken squadron under a charge of the infidel counteth far more than years of sobriety and weeks of penance and prayer  how know we that the cavalier you mention señora may not have his weeks of penance and his hours of prayer answered luis who had now found his voice should he be so fortunate as to enjoy a conscientious religious adviser he can scarce escape both prayer being so often ordered in the way of penance he seemeth indeed to be a miserable dog and i wonder not that his mistress holdeth him cheap is the name of the lady also given in your letter  it is she is the doña maria de las mercedes de valverde nearly allied to the guzmans and the other great houses and one of the fairest maidens of spain  that is she exclaimed luis and one of the most virtuous as well as fair and wise as virtuous  how now señor is it possible that you can have sufficient knowledge of one so situated as to speak thus positively of her qualities as well as of her appearance  her beauty i have seen and of her excellence one may speak by report but doth your correspondent señora say aught of what hath become of the graceless lover  it is rumored that he hath again quitted spain and as is supposed under the grave displeasure of the sovereigns since it hath been remarked that the queen now never nameth him none know the road he hath taken but there is little doubt that he is again roaming the seas as usual in quest of low adventures among the ports of the east  the conversation now changed and soon after the admiral and his attendants repaired to their different vessels  of a verity señor don christoval said luis as he walked alone with the great navigator toward the shore one little knoweth when he is acquiring fame and when not though but an indifferent mariner and no pilot i find my exploits on the ocean are well bruited abroad if your excellency but gain half the reputation i already enjoy by this present expedition you will have reason to believe that your name will not be forgotten by posterity  it is a tribute the great pay for their elevation luis returned the admiral that all their acts are commented on and that they can do little that may be concealed from observation or escape remarks  it would be as well señor almirante to throw into the scales at once calumnies and lies and uncharitableness for all these are to be added to the list is it not wonderful that a young man cannot visit a few foreign lands in order to increase his knowledge and improve his parts but all the gossips of castile should fill their letters to the gossips of the canaries with passages touching his movements and demerits by the martyrs of the east if i were queen of castile there should be a law against writing of others movements and i do not know but a law against womens writing letters at all  in which case señor de muños thou wouldst never possess the satisfaction of receiving a missive from the fairest hand in castile  i mean a womans writing to a woman don christopher as to letters from noble maidens intended to cheer the hearts and animate the deeds of cavaliers who adore them they are useful out of doubt and the saints be deaf to the miscreant who would forbid or intercept them no señor i trust that travelling hath at least made me liberal by raising me above the narrow prejudices of provinces and cities and i am far from wishing to put an end to letters from mistresses to their knights or from parents to their children or even from wives to their husbands but as for the letters of a gossip to a gossip by your leave señor almirante i detest them just as much as the father of sin detests this expedition of ours  an expedition certainly that he hath no great reason to love answered columbus smiling since it will be followed by the light of revelation and the triumph of the cross but what is thy will friend that thou seemest in waiting for me to disburden thyself of something thy name is sancho mundo if i remember thy countenance  señor don almirante your memory hath not mistaken returned the person addressed i am sancho mundo as your excellency saith sometimes called sancho of the shipyard gate i desire to say a few words concerning the fate of our voyage whenever it shall suit you noble señor to hear me where there are no ears present that you distrust  thou mayst speak freely now this cavalier being my confidant and secretary  it is not necessary that i should tell a great pilot like your excellency who is king of portugal or what the mariners of lisbon have been about these many years since you know all better than myself therefore i will just add that they are discovering all the unknown lands they can for themselves and preventing others as much as in them lies from doing the same thing  don john of portugal is an enlightened prince fellow and thou wouldst do well to respect his character and rank his highness is a liberal sovereign and hath sent many noble expeditions forth from his harbor  that he hath señor and this last is not the least in its designs and intentions answered sancho turning a look of irony toward the admiral that showed the fellow had more in reserve than he cared to divulge without some wheedling no one doubts don johns willingness to send forth expeditions  thou hast heard some intelligence sancho that it is proper i should know speak freely and rely on my repaying any service of this sort to the full extent of its deservings  if your excellency will have patience to hear me i will give the whole story with all minuteness and particularity and that in a way to leave no part untold and all parts to be as easily understood as heart can wish or a priest in the confessional could desire  speak no one will interrupt thee as thou art frank so will be thy reward  well then señor don almirante you must know that about eleven years since i made a voyage from palos to sicily in a caravel belonging to the pinzons here not to martin alonzo who commandeth the pinta under your excellencys order but to a kinsman of his late fathers who caused better craft to be constructed than we are apt to get in these days of hurry and rotten cordage and careless caulking to say nothing of the manner in which the canvas is  nay good sancho interrupted the impatient luis who was yet smarting under the remarks of doña inezs correspondentthou forgettest night is near and that the boat is waiting for the admiral  how should i forget that señor when i can see the sun just dipping into the water and i belong to the boat myself having left it in order to tell the noble admiral what i have to say  permit the man to relate his story in his own manner señor pedro i pray thee put in columbus naught is gained by putting a seamen out in his reckoning  no your excellency or in kicking with a mule and so as i was saying i went that voyage to sicily and had for a messmate one josé gordo a portuguese by birth but a man who liked the wines of spain better than the puckering liquors of his own country and so sailed much in spanish craft i never well knew notwithstanding whether josé was in heart most of a portuguese or a spaniard though he was certainly but an indifferent christian  it is to be hoped that his character hath improved said columbus calmly as i foresee that something is to follow on the testimony of this josé you will let me say that an indifferent christian is but an indifferent witness tell me at once therefore what he hath communicated that i may judge for myself of the value of his words  now he that doubteth your excellency will not discover cathay is a heretic seeing that you have discovered my secret without having heard it josé has just arrived in the felucca that is riding near the santa maria and hearing that we were an expedition that had one sancho mundo engaged in it he came speedily on board of us to see his old shipmate  all that is so plain that i wonder thou thinkest it worthy of relating sancho but now we have him safe on board the good ship we can come at once to the subject of his communication  that may we señor and so without any unnecessary delay i will state that the subject was touching don juan of portugal don ferdinand of aragon doña isabella of castile your excellency señor don almirante the señor de muños here and myself  this is a strange company exclaimed luis laughing while he slipped a piece of eight into the hand of the sailor perhaps that may aid thee in shortening the story of the singular conjunction  another señor would bring the tale to an end at once to own the truth josé is behind that wall and as he told me he thought his news worth a dobla he will be greatly displeased at finding i have received my half of it while his half still remaineth unpaid  this then will set his mind at rest said columbus placing an entire dobla in the hand of the cunning fellow for the admiral perceived by his manner that sancho had really something of importance to communicate thou canst summon josé to thy aid and deliver thyself at once of thy burden  sancho did as directed and in a minute josé had appeared had received the dobla weighed it deliberately on his finger pocketed it and commenced his tale unlike the artful sancho he told his story at once beginning at the right end and ceasing to speak as soon as he had no more to communicate the substance of the tale is soon related josé had come from ferro and had seen three armed caravels wearing the flag of portugal cruising among the islands under circumstances that left little doubt their object was to intercept the castilian expedition as the man referred to a passenger or two who had landed within the hour to corroborate his statement columbus and luis immediately sought the lodgings of these persons in order to hear their report of the matter the result proved the sailor had stated nothing but what was true  of all our difficulties and embarrassments luis resumed the admiral as the two finally proceeded to the shore this is much the most serious we may be detained altogether by these treacherous portuguese or we may be followed in our voyage and have our fair laurels seized upon by others and all the benefits so justly due for our toil and risk usurped or at least disputed by men who had not the enterprise and knowledge to accept the boon when fairly offered to them  don john of portugal must have sent far better knights than the moors of granada to do the feat answered luis who had a spaniards distaste for his peninsular neighbors he is a bold and learned prince they say but the commission and ensigns of the sovereign of castile are not to be disregarded and that too in the midst of her own islands here  we have no force fit to contend with that which hath most probably been sent against us the number and size of our vessels are known and the portuguese questionless have resorted to the means necessary to effect their purposes whatever those purposes may be alas luis my lot hath been hard though i humbly trust that the end will repay me for all years did i sue the portuguese to enter fairly into this voyage and to endeavor to do that in all honor which our gracious mistress doña isabella hath now so creditably commenced he listened to my reasons and entreaties with cold earsnay repelled them with ridicule and disdain and yet here am i scarce fairly embarked in the execution of schemes that they have so often derided than they endeavor to defeat me by violence and treachery  noble don christoval we will die to a castilian ere this shall come to pass  our only hope is in speedy departure thanks to the industry and zeal of martin alonzo the pinta is ready and we may quit gomera with the mornings sun i doubt if they will have the hardihood to follow us into the trackless and unknown atlantic without any other guides than their own feeble knowledge and we will depart with the return of the sun all now dependeth on quitting the canaries unseen  as this was said they reached the boat and were quickly pulled on board the santa maria by this time the peaks of the islands were towering like gloomy shadows in the atmosphere and soon after the caravels resembled dark shapeless specks on the unquiet element that washed their hulls  illustration     chapter xvi      they little thought how pure a light     with years should gather round that day     how love should keep their memories bright     how wide a realm their sons should sway      bryant   the night that succeeded was one of very varied feelings among the adventurers as soon as sancho secured the reward he had no further scruples about communicating all he knew to any who were disposed to listen and long ere columbus returned on board the vessel the intelligence had spread from mouth to mouth until all in the little squadron were apprised of the intentions of the portuguese many hoped that it was true and that their pursuers might be successful any fate being preferable in their eyes to that which the voyage promised but such is the effect of strife much the larger portion of the crew were impatient to lift the anchors and to make sail if it were only to get the mastery in the race columbus himself experienced the deepest concern for it really seemed as if a hard fortune was about to snatch the cup from his lips just as it had been raised there after all his cruel sufferings and delays he consequently passed a night of deep anxiety and was the first to rise in the morning  every one was on the alert with the dawn and as the preparations had been completed the previous night by the time the sun had risen the three vessels were under way the pinta leading as usual the wind was light and the squadron could barely gather steerage way but as every moment was deemed precious the vessels heads were kept to the westward when a short time out a caravel came flapping past them after having been several hours in sight and the admiral spoke her she proved to be from ferro the most southern and western island of the group and had come nearly on the route the expedition intended to steer until they quitted the known seas  dost thou bring any tidings from ferro inquired columbus as the strange ship drifted slowly past the santa maria the progress of each vessel being little more than a mile in the hour is there aught of interest in that quarter  did i know whether or not i am speaking to don christopher columbus the genoese that their highnesses have honored with so important a commission i should feel more warranty to answer what i have both heard and seen señor was the reply  i am don christopher himself their highnesses admiral and viceroy for all seas and lands that we may discover and as thou hast said a genoese in birth though a castilian by duty and in love to the queen  then noble admiral i may tell you that the portuguese are active three of their caravels being off ferro at this moment with the hope of intercepting your expedition  how is this known friend and what reason have i for supposing that the portuguese will dare to send forth caravels with orders to molest those who sail as the officers of isabella the catholic they must know that the holy father hath lately conferred this title on the two sovereigns in acknowledgment of their great services in expelling the moor from christendom  señor there hath been a rumor of that among the islands but little will the portuguese care for aught of that nature when he deemeth his gold in danger as i quitted ferro i spoke the caravels and have good reason to think that rumor doth them no injustice  did they seem warlike and made they any pretensions to a right to interrupt our voyage  to us they said naught of this sort except to inquire tauntingly if the illustrious don christoval colon the great viceroy of the east sailed on board us as for preparation señor they had many lombardas and a multitude of men in breastplates and casques i doubt if soldiers are as numerous at the azores as when they sailed  keep they close in with the island or stretch they off to seaward  mostly the latter señor standing far toward the west in the morning and beating up toward the land as the day closeth take the word of an old pilot don christopher the mongrels are there for no good  this was barely audible for by this time the caravels had drifted past each other and were soon altogether beyond the reach of the voice  do you believe that the castilian name standeth so low don christopher demanded luis that these dogs of portuguese dare do this wrong to the flag of the queen  i dread naught from force beyond detention and frauds certainly but these to me at this moment would be little less painful than death most do i apprehend that these caravels under the pretence of protecting the rights of don john are directed to follow us to cathay in which case we should have a disputed discovery and divided honors we must avoid the portuguese if possible to effect which purpose i intend to pass to the westward without nearing the island of ferro any closer than may be rendered absolutely indispensable  notwithstanding a burning impatience now beset the admiral and most with him the elements seemed opposed to his passage from among the canaries into the open ocean the wind gradually failed until it became so calm that the sails were hauled up and the three vessels lay now laying their sides with the brine and now rising to the summit of the groundswell resembling huge animals that were lazily reposing under the heats of summer in drowsy indolence  many was the secret pater or ave that was mumbled by the mariners and not a few vows of future prayers were made in the hope of obtaining a breeze occasionally it seemed as if providence listened to these petitions for the air would fan the cheek and the sails would fall in the vain expectation of getting ahead but disappointment as often followed until all on board felt that they were fated to linger under the visitations of a calm just at nightfall however a light air arose and for a few hours the wash of the parted waters was audible under the bows of the vessels though their way was barely sufficient to keep them under the command of their helms about midnight however even this scarcely perceptible motion was lost and the craft were again lazily wallowing in the groundswells that the gales had sent in from the vast expanse of the western ocean  when the light reappeared the admiral found himself between gomera and teneriffe the lofty peak of the latter casting its pointed shadow like that thrown by a planet far upon the water until its sharp apex was renewed in faint mimicry along the glassy surface of the ocean columbus was now fearful that the portuguese might employ their boats or impel some light felucca by her sweeps in order to find out his position and he wisely directed the sails to be furled in order to conceal his vessels as far as possible from any prying eyes the season had advanced to the 7th of september and such was the situation of this renowned expedition exactly five weeks after it had left spain for this inauspicious calm occurred on a friday or on that day of the week on which it had originally sailed  all practice shows that there is no refuge from a calm at sea except in patience columbus was much too experienced a navigator not to feel this truth and after using the precaution mentioned he and the pilots under him turned their attention to the arrangements required to render the future voyage safe and certain the few mathematical instruments known to the age were got up corrected and exhibited with the double intention of ascertaining their state and of making a display before the common men that would heighten their respect for their leaders by adding to their confidence in their skill the admiral himself had already obtained a high reputation as a navigator among his followers in consequence of his reckonings having proved so much more accurate than those of the pilots in approaching the canaries and as he now exhibited the instruments then used as a quadrant and examined his compasses every movement he made was watched by the seamen with either secret admiration or jealous vigilance some openly expressing their confidence in his ability to proceed wherever he wished to go and others covertly betraying just that degree of critical knowledge which ordinarily accompanies prejudice ignorance and malice  luis had never been able to comprehend the mysteries of navigation his noble head appearing to repudiate learning as a species of accomplishment but little in accordance with its wants or its tastes still he was intelligent and within the range of knowledge that it was usual for laymen of his rank to attain few of his age did themselves more credit in the circles of the court fortunately he had the most perfect reliance on the means of the admiral and being almost totally without personal apprehensions columbus had not a more submissive or blind follower than the young grandee under his command  man with all his boasted philosophy intelligence and reason exists the dupe of his own imagination and blindness as much as of the artifices and designs of others even while he fancies himself the most vigilant and cautious he is as often misled by appearances as governed by facts and judgment and perhaps half of those who were spectators of this calculated care in columbus believed that they felt in their renewed confidence the assurances of science and logical deductions when in truth their senses were impressed without in the slightest degree enlightening their understandings  thus passed the day of the 7th september the night arriving and still finding the little squadron or fleet as it was termed in the lofty language of the day floating helplessly between teneriffe and gomera nor did the ensuing morning bring a change for a burning sun beat unrelieved by a breath of air on the surface of a sea that was glittering like molten silver when the admiral was certain however by having sent men aloft to examine the horizon that the portuguese were not in sight he felt infinitely relieved little doubting that his pursuers still lay as inactive as himself to the westward of ferro  by the seamens hopes señor don christopher said luis as he reached the poop where columbus had kept an untiring watch for hours he himself having just risen from a siesta the fiends seem to be leagued against us here are we in the third day of our calm with the peak of teneriffe as stationary as if it were a milestone set to tell the porpoises and dolphins the rate at which they swim if one believed in omens he might fancy that the saints were unwilling to see us depart even though it be on their own errand  we may not believe in omens when they are no more than the fruits of natural laws gravely returned the admiral there will shortly be an end of this calm for a haze is gathering in the atmosphere that promises air from the east and the motion of the ship will tell thee that the winds have been busy far to the westward master pilot addressing the officer of that title who had charge of the deck at the moment thou wilt do well to unfurl thy canvas and prepare for a favoring breeze as we shall soon be overtaken by wind from the northeast  this prediction was verified about an hour later when all three of the vessels began again to part the waters with their sterns but the breeze if any thing proved more tantalizing to the impatient mariners than the calm itself had been for a strong head sea had got up and the air proving light the different craft struggled with difficulty toward the west  all this time a most anxious lookout was kept for the portuguese caravels the appearance of which however was less dreaded than it had been as they were now supposed to be a considerable distance to leeward columbus and his skilful assistants martin alonzo and vicente yañez or the brothers pinzon who commanded the pinta and the niña practised all the means that their experience could suggest to get ahead their progress however was not only slow but painful as every fresh impulse given by the breeze served to plunge the bows of the vessels into the sea with a violence that threatened injuries to the spars and rigging so trifling indeed was their rate of sailing that it required all the judgment of columbus to note the nearly imperceptible manner in which the tall conelike summit of the peak of teneriffe lowered as it might be inch by inch the superstitious feelings of the common men being more active than usual even some among them began to whisper that the elements were admonishing them against proceeding and that tardy as it might seem the admiral would do well to attend to omens and signs that nature seldom gave without sufficient reason these opinions however were cautiously utteredthe grave earnest manner of columbus having created so much respect as to suppress them in his presence and the mariners of the other vessels still followed the movements of their admiral with that species of blind dependence which marks the submission of the inferior to the superior under such circumstances  when columbus retired to his cabin for the night luis observed that his countenance was unusually grave as he ended his calculations of the days work  i trust all goes to your wishes don christopher the young man gaily observed we are now fairly on our journey and to my eyes cathay is already in sight  thou hast that within thee don luis returned the admiral which rendereth what thou wishest to see distinct and maketh all colors gay with me it is a duty to see things as they are and although cathay lieth plainly before the vision of my mindthou lord who hast implanted for thine own great ends the desire to reach that distant land only knowst how plainlyalthough cathay is thus plain to my moral view i am bound to heed the physical obstacles that may exist to our reaching it  and are these obstacles getting to be more serious than we could hope señor  my trust is still in godlook here young lord laying his finger on the chart at this point were we in the morning and to this point have we advanced by means of all the toil of the day down to this portion of the night thou seest that a line of paper marketh the whole of our progress and here again thou seest that we have to cross this vast desert of ocean ere we may even hope to draw near the end of our journey by my calculation with all our exertions and at this critical momentcritical not only as regardeth the portuguese but critical as regardeth our own peoplewe have made but nine leagues which are a small portion of the thousand that lie before us at this rate we may dread a failure of our provisions and water  i have all confidence in your resources don christopher and in your knowledge and experience  and i have all confidence in the protection of god trusting that he will not desert his servant in the moment that he most needeth his support  here columbus prepared himself to catch a few hours sleep though it was in his clothes the interest he felt in the position of his vessels forbidding him to undress this celebrated man lived in an age when a spurious philosophy and a pretending but insufficient exercise of reason placed few even in appearance above the frank admission of their constant reliance on a divine power we say in appearance as no man whatever may be the extent of his delusions on this subject really believes that he is altogether sufficient for his own protection this absolute selfreliance is forbidden by a law of nature each carrying in his own breast a monitor to teach him his real insignificance demonstrating daily hourly at each minute even that he is but a diminutive agent used by a superior power in carrying out its own great and mysterious ends for the sublime and beneficent purposes for which the world and all it contains has been created in compliance with the usage of the times columbus knelt and prayed fervently ere he slept nor did luis de bobadilla hesitate about imitating an example that few in that day thought beneath their intelligence or their manhood if religion had the taint of superstition in the fifteenth century and men confided too much in the efficacy of momentary and transient impulses it is certain that it also possessed an exterior of graceful meekness and submission to god in losing which it may be well questioned if the world has been the gainer  the first appearance of light brought the admiral and luis to the deck they both knelt again on the poop and repeated their paters and then yielding to the feelings natural to their situation they arose eager to watch for what might be revealed by the lifting of the curtain of day the approach of dawn and the rising of the sun at sea have been so often described that the repetition here might be superfluous but we shall state that luis watched the play of colors that adorned the eastern sky with a lovers refinement of feeling fancying that he traced a resemblance to the passage of emotions across the telltale countenance of mercedes in the soft and transient hues that are known to precede a fine morning in september more especially in a low latitude as for the admiral his more practical gaze was turned in the direction in which the island of ferro lay awaiting the increase of the light in order to ascertain what changes had been wrought during the hours he had slept several minutes passed in profound attention when the navigator beckoned luis to his side  seest thou that dark gloomy pile which is heaving up out of the darkness here at the south and west of us he saidit gaineth form and distinctness at each instant though distant some eight or ten leagues that is ferro and the portuguese are there without question anxiously expecting our appearance in this calm neither can approach the other and thus far we are safe it is now necessary to ascertain if the pursuing caravels are between us and the land or not after which should it prove otherwise we shall be reasonably safe if we approach no nearer to the island and we can maintain as yesterday the advantage of the wind seest thou any sail luis in that quarter of the ocean  none señor and the light is already of sufficient strength to expose the white canvas of a vessel were any there  columbus made an ejaculation of thankfulness and immediately ordered the lookout aloft to examine the entire horizon the report was favorable the dreaded portuguese caravels being nowhere visible as the sun arose however a breeze sprung up at the southward and westward bringing ferro and consequently any vessels that might be cruising in that quarter directly to windward of the fleet sail was made without the loss of a moment and the admiral stood to the northward and westward trusting that his pursuers were looking out for him on the south side of the island which was the ground where those who did not thoroughly understand his aim would be most likely to expect him by this time the westerly swell had in a great measure gone down and though the progress of the vessels was far from rapid it was steady and seemed likely to last the hours went slowly by and as the day advanced objects became less and less distinct on the sides of ferro its entire surface next took the hazy appearance of a dim and illdefined cloud and then it began slowly to sink into the water its summit was still visible as the admiral with the more privileged of his companions assembled on the poop to take a survey of the ocean and of the weather the most indifferent observer might now have noted the marked difference in the state of feeling which existed among the adventurers on board the santa maria on the poop all was cheerfulness and hope the present escape having induced even the distrustful momentarily to forget the uncertain future the pilots as usual were occupied and sustained by a species of marine stoicism while a melancholy had settled on the crew that was as apparent as if they were crowding around the dead nearly every man in the ship was in some one of the groups that had assembled on deck and every eye seemed riveted as it might be by enchantment on the fading and falling heights of ferro while things were in this state columbus approached luis and aroused him from a sort of trance by laying a finger lightly on his shoulder  it cannot be that the señor de muños is affected by the feelings of the common men observed the admiral with a slight mixture of surprise and reproach this too at a moment that all of an intelligence sufficient to foresee the glorious consequences are rejoicing that a heavensent breeze is carrying us to a safe distance from the pursuing and envious caravels why dost thou thus regard the people beneath with a steady eye and unwavering look is it that thou repentest embarking or dost thou merely muse on the charms of thy mistress  by san iago don christopher this time your sagacity is at fault i neither repent nor muse as you would imply but i gaze at yonder poor fellows with pity for their apprehensions  ignorance is a hard master señor pedro and one that is now exercising his power over the imaginations of the seamen with the ruthlessness of a tyrant they dread the worst merely because they have not the knowledge to foresee the best fear is a stronger passion than hope and is ever the near ally of ignorance in vulgar eyes that which hath not yet beennay which hath not in some measure become familiar by useis deemed impossible men reasoning in a circle that is abridged by their information those fellows are gazing at the island as it disappears like men taking a last look at the things of life indeed this concern exceedeth even what i could have anticipated  it lieth deep señor and yet it riseth to the eyes for i have seen tears on cheeks that i could never have supposed wetted in any manner but by the spray of the ocean  there are our two acquaintances sancho and pepe neither of whom seemeth particularly distressed though the last hath a cast of melancholy in his face as for the first the knave showeth the indifference of a true marinerone who is never so happy as when furthest from the dangers of rocks and shoals to such a man the disappearance of one island and the appearance of another are alike matters of indifference he seeth but the visible horizon around him and considereth the rest of the world temporarily as a blank i look for loyal service in that sancho in despite of his knavery and count upon him as one of the truest of my followers  here the admiral was interrupted by a cry from the deck beneath him and looking round his practised and quick eye was not slow in discovering that the horizon to the southward presented the usual watery blank of the open ocean ferro had in fact altogether disappeared some of the most sanguine of the seamen having fancied that they beheld it even after it had finally sunk behind the barrier of waves as the circumstance became more and more certain the lamentations among the people grew less and less equivocal and louder tears flowed without shame or concealment hands were wrung in a sort of a senseless despair and a scene of such clamor ensued as threatened some serious danger to the expedition from this new quarter under such circumstances columbus had all the people collected beneath the break of the poop and standing on the latter where he could examine every countenance for himself he addressed them on the subject of their grief on this occasion the manner of the great navigator was earnest and sincere leaving no doubt that he fully believed in the truth of his own arguments and that he uttered nothing with the hope to delude or to mislead  when don ferdinand and doña isabella our respected and beloved sovereigns honored me with the commission of admiral and viceroy in those secret seas toward which we are now steering he said i considered it as the most glorious and joyful event of my life as i now consider this moment that seemeth to some among you so painful as second to it in hope and cause for felicitation in the disappearance of ferro i see also the disappearance of the portuguese for now that we are in the open ocean without the limits of any known land i trust that providence hath placed us beyond the reach and machinations of all our enemies while we prove true to ourselves and to the great objects that are before us there is no longer cause for fear if any person among you hath a mind to disburden himself in this matter let him speak freely we being much too strong in argument to wish to silence doubts by authority  then señor don almirante put in sancho whose tongue was ever ready to wag as occasion offered it is just that which maketh your excellency so joyful that maketh these honest people so sad could they always keep the island of ferro in sight or any other known land they would follow you to cathay with as gentle a pull as the launch followeth the caravel in a light breeze and smooth water but it is this leaving all behind as it might be earth as well as wives and children that saddens their hearts and uncorks their tears  and thou sancho an old mariner that wast born at sea  nay your excellency illustrious señor don almirante interrupted sancho looking up with pretended simplicity not exactly at sea though within the scent of its odor since having been found at the shipwrights gate it is not probable they would have made a haven just to land so small a part of the freight  well born near the sea if thou wiltbut from thee i expect better things than unmanly lamentations because an island hath sunk below the horizon  excellency you may it mattereth little to sancho if half the islands in the sea were sunk a good deal lower there are the cape de verdes now which i never wish to look upon again and lampidosa besides stromboli and others in that quarter would be better out of the way than where they are as for any good they do us seamen but if your excellency will condescend to tell these honest people whither it is that we are bound and what you expect to find in port and more especially when we are to come back it would comfort them in an unspeakable degree  as i hold it to be the proper office of men in authority to let their motives be known when no evil followeth the disclosure this will i most cheerfully do requiring the attention of all near me and chiefly of those who are most uneasy concerning our present position and future movements the end of our voyage is cathay a country that is known to lie in the uttermost eastern extremity of asia whither it hath been more than once reached by christian travellers and its difference from all other voyages or journeys that may have been attempted in order to reach the same country is in the circumstance that we go west while former travellers have proceeded east but this is effecting our purposes by means that belong only to stouthearted mariners since none but those who are familiar with the ocean skilful pilots and obedient and ready seamen can traverse the waters without better guides than the knowledge of the stars currents winds and other phenomena of the atlantic and such aids as may be gleaned from science the reason on which i act is a conviction that the earth is round whence it followeth that the atlantic which we know to possess an eastern boundary of land must also have a western and from certain calculations that leave it almost certain that this continent which i hold will prove to be india cannot lie more than some twentyfive or thirty days sailing if as many from our own europe having thus told when and where i expect to find the country we seek i will now touch a little on the advantages that we may all expect to derive from the discovery according to the accounts of a certain marco polo and his relatives gentlemen of venice and men of fair credit and good reputations the kingdom of cathay is not only one of the most extensive known but one that most aboundeth in gold and silver together with the other metals of value and precious stones of the advantages of the discovery of such a land to yourselves ye may judge by its advantages to me their highnesses have dignified me with the rank of admiral and viceroy in anticipation of our success and persevering to a successful termination of your efforts the humblest man among ye may look with confidence to some signal mark of their favor rewards will doubtless be rendered in proportion to your merits he that deserveth much receiving more than he who hath deserved less still will there be sufficient for all marco polo and his relatives dwelt seventeen years in the court of the great khan and were every way qualified to give a true account of the riches and resources of those regions and well were theysimple venetian gentlemen without any other means than could be transported on the backs of beasts of burdenrewarded for their toils and courage the jewels alone with which they returned served long to enrich their race renovating a decayed but honorable family while they did their enterprise and veracity credit in the eyes of men  as the ocean for a long distance this side of the continent of asia and the kingdom of cathay is known to abound with islands we may expect first to meet with them where it would be doing nature herself injustice did we not anticipate fragrant freights of balmy spices and other valuable commodities with which that favored quarter of the earth it is certain is enriched indeed it is scarce possible for the imagination to conceive of the magnitude of the results that await our success while naught but ridicule and contempt could attend a hasty and inconsiderate return going not as invaders but as christians and friends we have no reason to expect other than the most friendly reception and no doubt the presents and gifts alone that will naturally be offered to strangers who have come so far and by a road that hath hitherto been untravelled will fortyfold repay you for all your toils and troubles  i say nothing of the honor of being among those who have first carried the cross to the heathen world continued the admiral uncovering himself and looking around him with solemn gravity though our fathers believed it to be no little distinction to have been one in the armies that contended for the possession of the sepulchre but neither the church nor its great master forgetteth the servitor that advanceth its interests and we may all look for blessings both here and hereafter  as he concluded columbus devoutly crossed himself and withdrew from the sight of his people among those who were on the poop the effect of this address was for the moment very salutary and the men saw the clouds that hung over the land disappear like the land itself with less feeling than they had previously manifested nevertheless they remained distrustful and sad some dreaming that night of the pictures that columbus had drawn of the glories of the east and others fancying in their sleep that demons were luring them into unknown seas where they were doomed to wander forever as a punishment for their sins conscience asserting its power in all situations and most vividly in those of distrust and uncertainty  shortly before sunset the admiral caused the three vessels to heaveto and the two pinzons to repair on board his own ship here he laid before these persons his orders and plans for their government in the event of a separation  thus you will understand me señores he concluded after having explained at length his views your first and gravest duty will be to keep near the admiral in all weather and under every circumstance so long as it may be possible but failing of the possibility you will make your way due westward on this parallel of latitude until you have gone seven hundred leagues from the canaries after which you are to lieto at night as by that time it is probable you will be among the islands of asia and it will be both prudent and necessary to our objects to be more on the alert for discoveries from that moment still you will proceed westward relying on seeing me at the court of the great khan should providence deny us an earlier meeting  this is well señor almirante returned martin alonzo raising his eyes which had long been riveted on the chart but it will be far better for all to keep together and chiefly so to us who are little used to the habits of princes if we wait for your excellencys protection before we rush unheedingly into the presence of a sovereign as potent as the grand khan  thou showest thy usual prudence good martin alonzo and i much commend thee for it it were indeed better that thou shouldst wait my arrival since that eastern potentate may conceive himself better treated by receiving the first visit from the viceroy of the sovereigns who is the bearer of letters directly from his own royal master and mistress than by receiving it from one of inferior rank look thou well to the islands and their products señor pinzon shouldst thou first gain those seas and await my appearance before thou proceedest to aught else how stand thy people affected on taking leave of the land  ill enough señor so much so indeed as to put me in fear of a mutiny there are those in the pinta who need to stand in wholesome dread of the anger of their highnesses to prevent their making a sudden and violent return to palos  thou wouldst do well to look sharply to this spirit that it may be kept under deal kindly and gently with these disaffected spirits as long as may be encouraging them by all fair and reasonable promises but beware that the distemper get not the mastery of thy authority and now señores as the night approacheth take boat and return to your vessels that we may profit by the breeze  when columbus was again alone with luis he sat in his little cabin with a hand supporting his head musing like one lost in reflection  thou hast long known this martin alonzo don luis de bobadilla he at length asked betraying the current of his thoughts by the nature of the question  long señor as youths count time though it would seem but a day in the calculations of aged men  much dependeth on him i hope he may prove honest as yet he hath shown himself liberal enterprising and manly  he is human don christopher and therefore liable to err yet as men go i esteem martin alonzo far from being among the worst of his race he hath not embarked in this enterprise under knightly vows nor with any churchmans zeal but give him the chance of a fair return for his risks and you will find him as true as interest ever leaveth a man when there is any occasion to try his selfishness  then thou only will i trust with my secret look at this paper luis here thou seest that i have been calculating our progress since morning and i find that we have come full nineteen leagues though it be not in a direct westerly line should i let the people know how far we may have truly come at the end of some great distance there being no land visible fear will get the mastery over them and no man can foresee the consequences i shall write down publicly therefore but fifteen leagues keeping the true reckoning sacred for thine eye and mine god will forgive me this deception in consideration that it is practised in the interest of his own church by making these small deductions daily it will enable us to advance a thousand leagues without awakening alarm sufficient for more than seven or eight hundred  this is reducing courage to a scale i little dreamt of señor returned luis laughing by san luis my true patron we should think ill of the knight who found it necessary to uphold his heart by a measurement of leagues  all unknown evils are dreaded evils distance hath its terrors for the ignorant and it may justly have its terrors for the wise young noble when it is measured on a trackless ocean and there ariseth another question touching those great staples of life food and water  with this slight reproof of the levity of his young friend the admiral prepared himself for his hammock by kneeling and repeating the prayers of the hour     chapter xvii      whither midst falling dew       while glow the heavens with the last steps of day     far through their rosy depths dost thou pursue       thy solitary way      bryant   the slumbers of columbus were of short duration while his sleep lasted it was profound like that of a man who has so much control over his will as to have reduced the animal functions to its domination for he awoke regularly at short intervals in order that his watchful eye might take a survey of the state of the weather and of the condition of his vessels on this occasion the admiral was on deck again a little after one where he found all things seemingly in that quiet and inspiring calm that ordinarily marks in fine weather a middle watch at sea the men on deck mostly slumbered the drowsy pilot and the steersman with a lookout or two alone remaining erect and awake the wind had freshened and the caravel was ploughing her way ahead with an untiring industry leaving ferro and its dangers at each instant more and more remote the only noises that were audible were the gentle sighing of the wind among the cordage the wash of the water and the occasional creaking of a yard as the breeze forced it with a firmer pressure to distend its tackle and to strain its fittings  the night was dark and it required a moment to accustom the eye to objects by a light so feeble when this was done however the admiral discovered that the ship was not close by the wind as he had ordered that she should be kept walking to the helm he perceived that it was so far borne up as to cause her head to fall off toward the northeast which was in fact in the direction to spain  art thou a seaman and disregardest thy course in this heedless manner sternly demanded the admiral or art thou only a muleteer who fancieth he is merely winding his way along a path of the mountains thy heart is in spain and thou thinkest that a vain wish to return may meet with some relief in this idle artifice  alas señor almirante your excellency hath judged rightly in believing that my heart is in spain where it ought to be moreover as i have left behind me at moguer seven motherless children  dost thou not know fellow that i too am a father and that the dearest objects of a fathers hopes are left behind me also in what then dost thou differ from me my son being also without a mothers care  excellency he hath an admiral for a father while my boys have only a helmsman  and what will it matter to don diegocolumbus was fond of dwelling on the honors he had received from the sovereigns even though it were a little irregularlywhat will it matter to don diego my son that his parent perished an admiral if he perish at all and in what will he profit more than your children when he findeth himself altogether without a parent  señor it will profit him to be cherished by the king and queen to be honored as your child and to be fostered and fed as the offspring of a viceroy instead of being cast aside as the issue of a nameless mariner  friend thou hast some reason in this and insomuch i respect thy feelings answered columbus who like our own washington appears to have always submitted to a lofty and pure sense of justice but thou wouldst do well to remember the influence that thy manly and successful perseverance in this voyage may produce on the welfare of thy children instead of thus dwelling on weak forebodings of ills that are little likely to come to pass neither of us hath much to expect should we fail of our discoveries while both may hope every thing should we succeed can i trust thee now to keep the ship on her course or must i send for another mariner to relieve the helm  it may be better noble admiral to do the last i will bethink me of thy counsel and strive with my longings for home but it would be safer to seek another for this day while we are so near to spain  dost thou know one sancho mundo a common seaman of this crew  señor we all know him he hath the name of the most skilful of our craft of all in moguer  is he of thy watch or sleepeth he with his fellows of the relief below  señor he is of our watch and sleepeth not with his fellows below for the reason that he sleepeth on deck no care or danger can unsettle the confidence of sancho to him the sight of land is so far an evil that i doubt if he rejoice should we ever reach those distant countries that your excellency seemeth to expect we may  go find this sancho and bid him come hither i will discharge thy office the while  columbus now took the helm with his own hands and with a light play of the tiller brought the ship immediately up as near the wind as she would lie the effect was felt in more quick and sudden plunges into the sea a deeper heel to leeward and a fresh creaking aloft that denoted a renewed and increased strain on all the spars and their tackle in the course of a few minutes however sancho appeared rubbing his eyes and yawning  take thou this duty said the admiral as soon as the man was near him and discharge it faithfully those who have been here already have proved unfaithful suffering the vessel to fall off in the direction of spain i expect better things of thee i think friend sancho i may count on thee as a true and faithful follower even in extremity  señor don almirante said sancho who took the helm giving it a little play to feel his command of it as a skilful coachman brings his team in subjection on first assuming the reins i am a servant of the crowns and your inferior and subordinate such duty as becometh me i am ready to discharge  thou hast no fear of this voyageno childish forebodings of becoming an endless wanderer in an unknown sea without hope of ever seeing wife or child again  señor you seem to know our hearts as well as if your excellency had made them with your own hands and then put them into our miserable bodies  thou hast then none of these unsuitable and unseamanlike apprehensions  not as much excellency as would raise an ave in a parish priest or a sigh in an old woman i may have my misgivings for we all have weaknesses but none of them incline to any dread of sailing about the ocean since that is my happiness nor to any concern about wife and children not having the first and wishing not to think i have the last  if thou hast misgivings name them i could wish to make one firm as thou wholly my friend  i doubt not señor that we shall reach cathay or whatever country your excellency may choose to seek i make no question of your ability to beard the great khan and at need to strip the very jewels from his turbanas turban he must have being an infidel nor do i feel any misgivings about the magnitude and richness of our discoveries and freights since i believe señor don almirante you are skilful enough to take the caravels in at one end of the earth and out at the other or even to load them with carbuncles should diamonds be wanting  if thou hast this faith in thy leader what other distrust can give thee concern  i distrust the value of the share whether of honor or of jewels that will fall to the lot of one sancho mundo a poor unknown almost shirtless mariner that hath more need of both than hath ever crossed the mind of our gracious lady doña isabella or of her royal consort  sancho thou art a proof that no man is without his failings and i fear thou art mercenary they say all men have their prices thou seemest clearly to have thine  your excellency hath not been sailing about the world for nothing or you could not tell every man his inclinations so easily i have ever suspected i was mercenary and so have accepted all sorts of presents to keep the feeling down nothing appeases a mercenary longing like gifts and rewards and as for price i strive hard to keep mine as high as possible lest it should bring me into discredit for a mean and grovelling spirit give me a high price and plenty of gifts and i can be as disinterested as a mendicant friar  i understand thee sancho thou art to be bought but not to be frightened in thy opinion a single dobla is too little to be divided between thee and thy friend the portuguese i will make a league with thee on thine own terms here is another piece of gold see that thou remainest true to me throughout the voyage  count on me without scruple señor don almirante and with scruples too should they interfere your excellency hath not a more disinterested friend in the fleet i only hope that when the sharelist shall be written out the name of sancho mundo may have an honorable place as will become his fidelity and now your excellency go sleep in peace the santa maria shall lie as near to the route to cathay as this southwesterly breeze will suffer  columbus complied though he rose once or twice more during the night to ascertain the state of the weather and that the men did their duties so long as sancho remained at the helm he continued faithful to his compact but as he went below with his watch at the usual hour successors were put in his place who betrayed the original treachery of the other helmsman when luis left his hammock columbus was already at work ascertaining the distance that had been run in the course of the night catching the inquiring glance of the young man the admiral observed gravely and not altogether without melancholy in his manner  we have had a good run though it hath been more northerly than i could have desired i find that the vessels are thirty leagues further from ferro than when the sun set and thou seest here that i have written fourandtwenty in the reckoning that is intended for the eyes of the people but there hath been great weakness at work this night among the steersmen if not treachery they have kept the ship away in a manner to cause her to run a part of the time in a direction nearly parallel to the coast of europe so that they have been endeavoring to deceive me on the deck while i have thought it necessary to attempt deceiving them in the cabin it is painful don luis to find such deceptions resorted to or such deceptions necessary when one is engaged in an enterprise that surpasseth all others ever yet attempted by man and that too with a view to the glory of god the advantage of the human race and the especial interests of spain  the holy churchmen themselves don christopher are obliged to submit to this evil answered the careless luis and it does not become us laymen to repine at what they endure i am told that half the miracles they perform are in truth miracles of but a very indifferent quality the doubts and want of faith of us hardened sinners rendering such little inventions necessary for the good of our souls  that there are falseminded and treacherous churchmen as well as falseminded and treacherous laymen luis i little doubt answered the admiral but this cometh of the fall of man and of his evil nature there are also righteous and true miracles that come of the power of god and which are intended to uphold the faith and to encourage those who love and honor his holy name i do not esteem any thing that hath yet befallen us to belong very distinctly to this class nor do i venture to hope that we are to be favored in this manner by an especial intervention in our behalf but it exceedeth all the machinations of the devils to persuade me that we shall be deserted while bent on so glorious a design or that we are not indirectly and secretly led in our voyage by a spirit and knowledge that both come of divine grace and infinite wisdom  this may be so don christopher so far as you are concerned though for myself i claim no higher a guide than an angel an angels purity and i hope i may add an angels love lead me in my blind path across the ocean  so it seemeth to thee luis but thou canst not know that a higher power doth not use the doña mercedes as an instrument in this matter although no miracle rendereth it apparent to the vulgar a spirit is placed in my breast in conducting this enterprise that i should deem it blasphemy to resist god be praised my boy we are at last quit of the portuguese and are fairly on our road at present all our obstacles must arise from the elements or from our own fears it gladdeneth my heart to find that the two pinzons remain true and that they keep their caravels close to the santa maria like men bent on maintaining their faith and seeing an end of the adventure  as luis was now ready he and the admiral left the cabin together the sun had risen and the broad expanse of the ocean was glittering with his rays the wind had freshened and was gradually getting further to the south so that the vessels headed up nearly to their course and there being but little sea the progress of the fleet was in proportion considerable every thing appeared propitious and the first burst of grief on losing sight of known land having subsided the crews were more tranquil though dread of the future was smothered like the latent fires of a volcano rather than extinguished the aspect of the sea was favorable offering nothing to view that was unusual to mariners and as there is always something grateful in a lively breeze when unaccompanied with danger the men were probably encouraged by a state of things to which they were accustomed and which brought with it cheerfulness and hope in the course of the day and night the vessels ran a hundred and eighty miles still further into the trackless waste of the ocean without awakening half the apprehensions in the bosoms of the mariners that they had experienced on losing sight of land columbus however acting on the cautious principle he had adopted when he laid before his people the result of the twentyfour hours work reduced the distance to about one hundred and fifty  tuesday the 10th of september brought a still more favorable change of wind this day for the first time since quitting the canaries the heads of the vessels were laid fairly to the west and with the old world directly behind them and the unknown ocean in their front the adventurers proceeded onward with a breeze at southeast the rate of sailing was about five miles in the hour compensating for the want of speed by the steadiness of their progress and by the directness of their course  the observations that are usually made at sea when the sun is in the zenith were over and columbus had just announced to his anxious companions that the vessels were gradually setting south owing to the drift of some invisible current when a cry from the masthead announced the proximity of a whale as the appearance of one of these monsters of the deep breaks the monotony of a sea life every one was instantly on the lookout some leaping into the rigging and others upon the rails in order to catch a glimpse of his gambols  dost thou see him sancho demanded the admiral of mundo the latter being near him at the moment to me the water hath no appearance of any such animals being at hand  your excellencys eye señor don almirante is far truer than that of the babblers aloft sure as this is the atlantic and yonder is the foam of the crests of the waves there is no whale  the flukesthe flukes shouted a dozen voices at once pointing to a spot where a dark object arose above the froth of the sea showing a pointed summit with short arms extended on each side he playeth with his head beneath the water and the tail uppermost  alasalas exclaimed the practised sancho with the melancholy of a true seaman what these inexperienced and hasty brawlers call the fluke of a whale is naught but the mast of some unhappy ship that hath left her bones with her freight and her people in the depths of the ocean  thou art right sancho returned the admiral i now see that thou meanest it is truly a spar and doubtless betokeneth a shipwreck  this fact passed swiftly from mouth to mouth and the sadness that ever accompanies the evidences of such a disaster settled on the faces of all the beholders the pilots alone showed indifference and they consulted on the expediency of endeavoring to secure the spar as a resource in time of need but they abandoned the attempt on acccount of the agitation of the water and of the fairness of the wind the latter being an advantage a true mariner seldom likes to lose  there is a warning to us exclaimed one of the disaffected as the santa maria sailed past the waving summit of the spar god hath sent this sign to warn us not to venture where he never intended navigators to go  say rather put in sancho who having taken the fee had ever since proved a willing advocate it is an omen of encouragement sent from heaven dost thou not see that the part of the mast that is visible resembleth a cross which holy sign is intended to lead us on filled with hopes of success  this is true sancho interrupted columbus a cross hath been reared for our edification as it might be in the midst of the ocean and we are to regard it as a proof that providence is with us in our attempt to carry its blessings to the aid and consolation of the heathen of asia  as the resemblance to the holy symbol was far from fanciful this happy hit of sanchos was not without its effect the reader will understand the likeness all the better when he is told that the upper end of a mast has much the appearance of a cross by means of the trusseltrees and as often happens this particular spar was floating nearly perpendicular owing to some heavy object being fast to its heel leaving the summit raised some fifteen or twenty feet above the surface of the sea in a quarter of an hour this last relic of europe and of civilization disappeared in the wake of the vessels gradually diminishing in size and settling toward the water until its faint outlines vanished in threads still wearing the wellknown shape of the revered symbol of christianity  after this little incident the progress of the vessels was uninterrupted by any event worthy of notice for two days and nights all this time the wind was favorable and the adventurers proceeded due west by compass which was in fact however going a little north of the real pointa truth that the knowledge of the period had not yet mastered between the morning of the 10th september and the evening of the 13th the fleet had passed over near ninety leagues of ocean holding its way in a line but a little deviating from a direct one athwart the great waste of water and having consequently reached a point as far if not further west than the position of the azores then the most westerly land known to european navigators on the 13th the currents proved to be adverse and having a southeasterly set they had a tendency to cause the ships to sheer southwardly bringing them each hour nearer to the northern margin of the trades  the admiral and luis were at their customary post on the evening of the 13ththe day last mentionedas sancho left the helm his tour of duty having just ended instead of going forward as usual among the people the fellow hesitated surveyed the poop with a longing eye and finding it occupied only by the admiral and his constant companion he ascended the ladder as if desirous of making some communication  wouldst thou aught with me sancho demanded the admiral waiting for the man to make certain that no one else was on the narrow deck speak freely thou hast my confidence  señor don almirante your excellency well knoweth that i am no freshwater fish to be frightened at the sight of a shark or a whale or one that is terrified because a ship headeth west instead of east and yet i do come to say that this voyage is not altogether without certain signs and marvels that it may be well for a mariner to respect as unusual if not ominous  as thou sayest sancho thou art no driveller to be terrified by the flight of a bird or at the presage of a drifting spar and thou awakenest my curiosity to know more the señor de muños is my confidential secretary and nothing need be hid from him speak freely then and without further delay if gold is thy aim be certain thou shalt have it  no señor my news is not worth a maravedi or it is far beyond the price of gold such as it is your excellency can take it and think no more of my reward you know señor that we old mariners will have our thoughts as we stand at the helm sometimes fancying the smiles and good looks of some hussy ashore sometimes remembering the flavor of rich fruits and wellsavored mutton and then again for a wonder bethinking us of our sins  fellow all this i well know but it is not matter for an admirals ear  i know not that señor i have known admirals who have relished mutton after a long cruise ay and who have bethought them too of smiling faces and bright eyes and who if they did not at times bethink them of their sins have done what was much worse help to add to the great account that was heaping up against them now there was  let me toss this vagabond into the sea at once don christopher interrupted the impatient luis making a forward movement as if to execute the threat an act which the hand of columbus arrested we shall never hear a tale the right end first as long as he remaineth in the ship  i thank you my young lord of llera answered sancho with an ironical smile if you are as ready at drowning seamen as you are at unhorsing christian knights in the tourney and infidels in the fray i would rather that another should be master of my baths  thou knowst me knave thou hast seen me on some earlier voyage  a cat may look at a king señor conde and why not a mariner on his passenger but spare your threats and your secret is in safe hands if we reach cathay no one will be ashamed of having made the voyage and if we miss it it is little likely that any will go back to relate the precise manner in which your excellency was drowned or starved to death or in what other manner you became a saint in abrahams bosom  enough of this said columbus sternly relate what thou hast to say and see that thou art discreet touching this young noble  señor your word is law well don christopher it is one of the tricks of us mariners at night to be watching an old and constant friend the north star and while thus occupied an hour since i noted that this faithful guide and the compass by which i was steering told different tales  art certain of this demanded the admiral with a quickness and emphasis that betrayed the interest he felt in the communication  as certain señor as fifty years looking at the star and forty years watching of the compass can make a man but there is no occasion your excellency to depend on my ignorance since the star is still where god placed it and there is your private compass at your elbowone may be compared with the other  columbus had already bethought him of making this comparison and by the time sancho ceased speaking he and luis were examining the instrument with eager curiosity the first and the most natural impression was a belief that the needle of the instrument below was defective or at least influenced by some foreign cause but an attentive observation soon convinced the navigator that the remark of sancho was true he was both astonished and concerned to find that the habitual care and professional eye of the fellow had been active and quick to note a change as unusual as this it was indeed so common with mariners to compare their compasses with the north stara luminary that was supposed never to vary its position in the heavens as that position related to manthat no experienced seaman who happened to be at the helm at nightfall could well overlook the phenomenon  after repeated observations with his own compasses of which he kept twoone on the poop and another in the cabin and having recourse also to the two instruments in the binnacle columbus was compelled to admit to himself that all four varied alike from their usual direction nearly six degrees instead of pointing due north or at least in a direct line toward a point on the horizon immediately beneath the star they pointed some five or six degrees to the westward of it this was both a novel and an astounding departure from the laws of nature as they were then understood and threatened to render the desired results of the voyage so much the more difficult of attainment as it at once deprived the adventurers of a sure reliance on the mariners principal guide and would render it difficult to sail with any feeling of certainty as to the course in cloudy weather or dark nights the first thought of the admiral on this occasion however was to prevent the effect which such a discovery would be likely to produce on men already disposed to anticipate the worst  thou wilt say nothing of this sancho he observed to the man here is another dobla to add to thy store  excellency pardon a humble seamans disobedience if my hand refuse to open to your gift this matter toucheth of supernatural means and as the devil may have an agency in the miracle in order to prevent our converting them heathen of whom you so often speak i prefer to keep my soul as pure as may be in the matter since no one knoweth what weapons we may be driven to use should we come to real blows with the father of sin  thou wilt at least prove discreet  trust me for that señor don almirante not a word shall pass my lips about this matter until i have your excellencys permission to speak  columbus dismissed the man and then he turned toward luis who had been a silent but attentive listener to what had passed  you seem disturbed at this departure from the usual laws of the compass don christopher observed the young man gaily to me it would seem better to rely altogether on providence which would scarcely lead us out here into the wide atlantic on its own errand and desert us when we most need its aid  god implants in the bosom of his servants a desire to advance his ends but human agents are compelled to employ natural means and in order to use such means advantageously it is necessary to understand them i look upon this phenomenon as a proof that our voyage is to result in discoveries of unknown magnitude among which perhaps are to be numbered some clue to the mysteries of the needle the mineral riches of spain differ in certain particulars from the mineral riches of france for though some things are common to all lands others are peculiar to particular countries we may find regions where the loadstone abounds or may even now be in the neighborhood of some island that hath an influence on our compasses that we cannot explain  is it known that islands have ever produced this effect on the needle  it is notnor do i deem such a circumstance very probable though all things are possible we will wait patiently for further proofs that this phenomenon is real and permanent ere we reason further on a matter that is so difficult to be understood  the subject was now dropped though the unusual incident gave the great navigator an uneasy and thoughtful night he slept little and often was his eye fastened on the compass that was suspended in his cabin as a telltale for so seamen term the instrument by which the officer overlooks the course that is steered by the helmsman even when the latter least suspects his supervision columbus arose sufficiently early to get a view of the star before its brightness was dimmed by the return of light and made another deliberate comparison of the position of this familiar heavenly body with the direction of the needles the examination proved a slight increase of the variation and tended to corroborate the observations of the previous night the result of the reckoning showed that the vessels had run nearly a hundred miles in the course of the last twentyfour hours and columbus now believed himself to be about six times that distance west of ferro though even the pilots fancied themselves by no means as far  as sancho kept his secret and no other eye among the helmsmen was as vigilant the important circumstance as yet escaped general attention it was only at night indeed that the variation could be observed by means of the polar star and it was yet so slight that no one but a very experienced and quickeyed mariner would be apt to note it the whole of the day and night of the 14th consequently passed without the crews taking the alarm and this so much the more as the wind had fallen and the vessels were only some sixty miles further west than when they commenced still columbus noted the difference slight as was the change ascertaining with the precision of an experienced and able navigator that the needle was gradually varying more and more to the westward though it was by steps that were nearly imperceptible     chapter xviii          on thy unaltering blaze       the halfwrecked mariner his compass lost         fixes his steady gaze       and steers undoubting to the friendly coast     and they who stray in perilous wastes by night     are glad when thou dost shine to guide their footsteps right      hymn to the north star   the following day was saturday the 15th when the little fleet was ten days from gomera or it was the sixth morning since the adventurers had lost sight of the land the last week had been one of melancholy forebodings though habit was beginning to assert its influence and the men manifested openly less uneasiness than they had done in the three or four previous days their apprehensions were getting to be dormant for want of any exciting and apparent stimulus though they existed as latent impulses in readiness to be roused at the occurrence of any untoward event the wind continued fair though lightthe whole twentyfour hours work showing considerably less than a hundred miles as the true progress west all this time columbus kept his attention fastened on the needles and he perceived that as the vessels slowly made their westing the magnets pointed more and more though by scarcely palpable changes in the same direction  the admiral and luis by this time had fallen into such habits of close communication that they usually rose and slept at the same time though far too ignorant of the hazards he ran to feel uneasiness and constitutionally as well as morally superior to idle alarms the young man had got to feel a sort of sportsmans excitement in the result and by this time had not mercedes existed he would have been as reluctant to return without seeing cathay as columbus himself they conversed together of their progress and their hopes without ceasing and luis took so much interest in his situation as to begin to learn how to discriminate in matters that might be supposed to affect its duration and ends  on the night of the saturday just mentioned columbus and his reputed secretary were alone on the poop conversing as usual on the signs of the times and of the events of the day  the niña had something to say to you last evening don christopher observed the young man i was occupied in the cabin with my journal and had no opportunity of knowing what passed  her people had seen a bird or two that are thought never to go far from the land it is possible that islands are at no great distance for man hath nowhere passed over any very great extent of sea without meeting with them we cannot however waste the time necessary for a search since the glory and profit of ascertaining the situation of a group of islands would be but a poor compensation for the loss of a continent  do you still remark those unaccountable changes in the needles señor  in this respect there is no change except that which goeth to corroborate the phenomenon my chief apprehension is of the effect on the people when the circumstance shall be known  are there no means to persuade them that the needle pointeth thus west as a sign providence willeth they should pursue that course by persevering in the voyage  this might do luis answered the admiral smiling had not fear so sharpened their wits that their first question would be an inquiry why providence should deprive us of the means of knowing whither we are travelling when it so much wisheth us to go in any particular direction  a cry from the watch on deck arrested the discourse while a sudden brightness broke on the night illuminating the vessels and the ocean as if a thousand lamps were shedding their brilliancy upon the surrounding portion of the sphere a ball of fire was glancing athwart the heavens and seemed to fall into the sea at the distance of a few leagues or at the limits of the visible horizon its disappearance was followed by a gloom as profound as the extraordinary and fleeting light had been brilliant this was only the passage of a meteor but it was such a meteor as men do not see more than once in their livesif it is seen as often and the superstitious mariners did not fail to note the incident among the extraordinary omens that accompanied the voyage some auguring good and others evil from the event  by st iago exclaimed luis as soon as the light had vanished señor don christopher this voyage of ours doth not seem fated to pass away unheeded by the elements and other notable powers whether these portents speak in our favor or not they speak us any thing but men engaged in an everyday occupation  thus it is with the human mind returned columbus let but its owner pass beyond the limits of his ordinary habits and duties and he sees marvels in the most simple changes of the weatherin a flash of lightninga blast of airor the passage of a meteor little heeding that these miracles exist in his own consciousness and have no connection with the everyday laws of nature these sights are by no means uncommon especially in low latitudes and they augur neither for nor against our enterprise  except señor almirante as they may beset the spirits and haunt the imaginations of the men sancho telleth me that a brooding discontent is growing among them and that while they seem so tranquil their disrelish of the voyage is hourly getting to be more and more decided  notwithstanding this opinion of the admiral and some pains that he afterward took to explain the phenomenon to the people on deck the passage of the meteor had indeed not only produced a deep impression on them but its history went from watch to watch and was the subject of earnest discourse throughout the night but the incident produced no open manifestation of discontent a few deeming it a propitious omen though most secretly considered it an admonition from heaven against any impious attempts to pry into those mysteries of nature that according to their notions god in his providence had not seen fit to reveal to man  all this time the vessels were making a steady progress toward the west the wind had often varied both in force and direction but never in a manner to compel the ships to shorten sail or to deviate from what the admiral believed to be the proper course they supposed themselves to be steering due west but owing to the variation were in fact now holding a westandbysouth course and were gradually getting nearer to the trades a movement in which they had also been materially aided by the force of the currents in the course of the 15th and 16th of the month the fleet had got about two hundred miles further from europe columbus taking the usual precaution to lessen the distance in the public reckoning the latter day was a sunday and the religious offices which were then seldom neglected in a christian ship produced a deep and sublime effect on the feelings of the adventurers hitherto the weather had partaken of the usual character of the season and a few clouds with a slight drizzling rain had relieved the heat but these soon passed away and were succeeded by a soft southeast wind that seemed to come charged with the fragrance of the land the men united in the evening chants under these propitious circumstances the vessels drawing near each other as if it might be to form one temple in honor of god amid the vast solitudes of an ocean that had seldom if ever been whitened by a sail cheerfulness and hope succeeded to this act of devotion and both were speedily heightened by a cry from the lookout aloft who pointed ahead and to leeward as if he beheld some object of peculiar interest in that quarter the helms were varied a little and in a few minutes the vessels entered into a field of seaweed that covered the ocean for miles this sign of the vicinity of land was received by the mariners with a shout and the very beings who had so shortly before been balancing on the verge of despair now became elate with joy  these weeds were indeed of a character to awaken hope in the bosom of the most experienced mariner although some had lost their freshness a great proportion of them were still green and had the appearance of having been quite recently separated from their parent rocks or the earth that had nourished them no doubt was now entertained even by the pilots of the vicinity of land tunnyfish were also seen in numbers and the people of the niña were sufficiently fortunate to strike one the seamen embraced each other with tears in their eyes and many a hand was squeezed in friendly congratulation that the previous day would have been withheld in surly misanthropy  and do you partake of all this hope don christopher demanded luis are we really to expect the indies as a consequence of these marine plants or is the expectation idle  the people deceive themselves in supposing our voyage near an end cathay must yet be very distant from us we have come but three hundred and sixty leagues since losing sight of ferro which according to my computations cannot be much more than a third of our journey aristotle mentioned that certain vessels of cadiz were forced westward by heavy gales until they reached a sea covered with weeds a spot where the tunnyfish abounded this is the fish thou must know luis that the ancients fancied could see better with the right eye than with the left because it hath been noted that in passing the bosphorus they ever take the right shore in proceeding toward the euxine and the left in returning  by st francis there can be no wonder if creatures so onesided in their vision should have strayed thus far from home interrupted the lighthearted luis laughing doth aristotle or the other ancients tell us how they regarded beauty or whether their notions of justice were like those of the magistrate who hath been fed by both parties  aristotle speaketh only of the presence of the fish in the weedy ocean as we see them before us the mariners of cadiz fancied themselves in the neighborhood of sunken islands and the wind permitting made the best of their way back to their own shores thia place in my judgment we have now reached but i expect to meet with no land unless indeed we may happen to fall in with some island that lieth off here in the ocean as a sort of beacon between the shore of europe and that of asia doubtless land is not distant whence these weeds have drifted but i attach little importance to its sight or discovery cathay is my aim don luis and i am a searcher for continents not islands  it is now known that while columbus was right in his expectations of not finding a continent so early he was mistaken in supposing land to lie any where in that vicinity whether these weeds are collected by the course of the currents or whether they rise from the bottom torn from their beds by the action of the water is not yet absolutely ascertained though the latter is the most common opinion extensive shoals existing in this quarter of the ocean under the latter supposition the mariners of cadiz were nearer the truth than is first apparent a sunken island having all the characteristics of a shoal but those which may be supposed to be connected with the mode of formation  no land was seen the vessels continued their progress at a rate but little varying from five miles the hour shoving aside the weeds which at times accumulated in masses under their bows but which could offer no serious obstacle to their progress as for the admiral so lofty were his views so steady his opinions concerning the great geographical problem he was about to solve and so determined his resolution to persevere to the end that he rather hoped to miss than to fall in with the islands that he fancied could be at no great distance the day and night carried the vessels rather more than one hundred miles to the westward placing the fleet not far from midway between the meridians that bounded the extreme western and eastern margins of the two continents though still much nearer to africa than to america following the parallel of latitude on which it was sailing as the wind continued steady and the sea was as smooth as a river the three vessels kept close together the pinta the swiftest craft reducing her canvas for that purpose during the afternoons watch of the day that succeeded that of the meeting with the weeds which was monday the 17th september or the eighth day after losing sight of ferro martin alonzo pinzon hailed the santa maria and acquainted the pilot on deck of his intention to get the amplitude of the sun as soon as the luminary should be low enough with a view to ascertain how far his needles retained their virtue this observation one of no unusual occurrence among mariners it was thought had better be made in all the caravels simultaneously that any error of one might be corrected by the greater accuracy of the rest  columbus and luis were in a profound sleep in their cots taking their siestas when the former was awakened by such a shake of the shoulder as seamen are wont to give and are content to receive it never required more than a minute to arouse the great navigator from his deepest slumbers to the fullest possession of his faculties and he was awake in an instant  señor don almirante said sancho who was the intruder it is time to be stirring all the pilots are on deck in readiness to measure the amplitude of the sun as soon as the heavenly bodies are in their right places the west is already beginning to look like a dying dolphin and ere many minutes it will be gilded like the helmet of a moorish sultan  an amplitude measured exclaimed columbus quitting his cot on the instant this is news indeed now we may look for such a stir among the people as hath not been witnessed since we left cadiz  so it hath appeared to me your excellency for the mariner hath some such faith in the needle as the churchman bestoweth on the goodness of the son of god the people are in a happy humor at this moment but the saints only know what is to come  the admiral awoke luis and in five minutes both were at their customary station on the poop columbus had gained so high a reputation for skill in navigation his judgment invariably proving right even when opposed to those of all the pilots in the fleet that the latter were not sorry to perceive he had no intention to take an instrument in hand but seemed disposed to leave the issue to their own skill and practice the sun slowly settled the proper time was watched and then these rude mariners set about their task in the mode that was practised in their time martin alonzo pinzon the most ready and best taught of them all was soonest through with his task from his lofty stand the admiral could overlook the deck of the pinta which vessel was sailing but a few hundred yards from the santa maria and it was not long before he observed her commander moving from one compass to another in the manner of a man who was disturbed another minute or two elapsed when the skiff of the caravel was launched a sign was made for the admirals vessel to shorten sail and martin alonzo was soon forcing his way through the weeds that still covered the surface of the ocean toward the santa maria as he gained the deck of the latter ship on one of her sides his kinsman vicente yañez the commander of the niña did the same thing on the other in the next instant both were at the side of the great navigator on the poop whither they had been followed by sancho ruiz and bartolemeo roldan the two pilots of the admiral  what meaneth this haste good martin alonzo calmly asked columbus thou and thy brother vicente yañez and these honest pilots hurry toward me as if ye had cheering tidings from cathay  god only knoweth señor almirante if any of us are ever to be permitted to see that distant land or any shore that is only to be reached by mariners through the aid of a needle answered the elder pinzon with a haste that almost rendered him breathless here have we all been at the comparison of the instruments and we find them without a single exception varying from the true north by at least a full point  that would be a marvel truly ye have made some oversight in your observations or have been heedless in the estimates  not so noble admiral put in vicente yañez to sustain his brother even the magnets are becoming false to us and as i mentioned the circumstance to the oldest steersman of my craft he assures me that the north star did not tally with his instrument throughout the night  others say the same here added ruiznay some are ready to swear that the wonder hath been noted ever since we entered the sea of weeds  this may be so señores answered columbus with an undisturbed mien and yet no evil follow we all know that the heavenly bodies have their revolutions some of which no doubt are irregular while others are more in conformity with certain settled rules thus it is with the sun himself which passeth once around the earth in the short space of twentyfour hours while no doubt he hath other and more subtile movements that are unknown to us on account of the exceeding distance at which he is placed in the heavens many astronomers have thought that they have been able to detect these variations spots having been seen on the disc of the orb at times which have disappeared as if hid behind the body of the luminary i think it will be found that the north star hath made some slight deviation in its position and that it will continue thus to move for some short period after which no doubt it will be found returning to its customary position when it will be seen that its temporary eccentricity hath in no manner disturbed its usual harmony with the needles note the star well throughout the night and in the morning let the amplitude be again taken when i think the truth of my conjecture will be proved by the regularity of the movement of the heavenly body so far from being discouraged by this sign we ought rather to rejoice that we have made a discovery which of itself will entitle the expedition to the credit of having added materially to the stores of science  the pilots were fain to be satisfied with this solution of their doubts in the absence of any other means of accounting for them they remained long on the poop discoursing of the strange occurrence and as men even in their blindest moods usually reason themselves into either tranquillity or apprehension they fortunately succeeded in doing the first on this occasion with the men there was more difficulty for when it became known to the crews of the three vessels that the needles had begun to deviate from their usual direction a feeling akin to despair seized on them almost without exception here sancho was of material service when the panic was at its height and the people were on the point of presenting themselves to the admiral with a demand that the heads of the caravels should be immediately turned toward the northeast he interposed with his knowledge and influence to calm the tumult the first means this trusty follower had recourse to in order to bring his shipmates back to reason was to swear without reservation that he had frequently known the needle and the north star to vary having witnessed the fact with his own eyes on twenty previous occasions and no harm to come of it he invited the elder and more experienced seamen to make an accurate observation of the difference which already existed which was quite a point of the compass and then to see in the morning if this difference had not increased in the same direction  this he continued will be a certain sign my friends that the star is in motion since we can all see that the compasses are just where they have been ever since we left palos de moguer when one of two things is in motion and it is certain which stands still there can be no great difficulty in saying which is the uneasy one now look thou here martin martinez who was one of the most factious of the disaffected words are of little use when men can prove their meaning by experiments like this thou seest two balls of spunyarn on this windlass well it is wanted to be known which of them remains there and which is taken away i remove the smallest ball thou perceivest and the largest remains from which it followeth as only one can remain and that one is the larger ball why the smaller must be taken away i hold no man fit to steer a caravel by needle or by star who will deny a thing that is proven as plainly and as simply as this  martin martinez though a singularly disaffected man was no logician and sanchos oaths backing his demonstrations to the letter his party soon became the most numerous as there is nothing so encouraging to the dullminded and discontented mutineer as to perceive that he is of the strongest side so is there nothing so discouraging as to find himself in the minority and sancho so far prevailed as to bring most of his fellows round to a belief in the expediency of waiting to ascertain the state of things in the morning before they committed themselves by any act of rashness  thou hast done well sancho said columbus an hour later when the mariner came secretly to make his nightly report of the state of feeling among the people thou hast done well in all but these oaths taken to prove that thou hast witnessed this phenomenon before much as i have navigated the earth and careful as have been my observations and ample as have been my means never before have i known the needle to vary from its direction toward the north star and i think that which hath escaped my notice would not be apt to attract thine  you do me injustice señor don almirante and have inflicted a wound touching my honesty that a dobla only can cure  thou knowest sancho that no one felt more alarm when the deviation of the needle was first noted than thyself so great in sooth was thy apprehension that thou even refused to receive gold a weakness of which thou art usually exceedingly innocent  when the deviation was first noted your excellency this was true enough for not to attempt to mislead one who hath more penetration than befalleth ordinary men i did fancy that our hopes of ever seeing spain or st clara de moguer again were so trifling as to make it of no great consequence who was admiral and who a simple helmsman  and yet thou wouldst now brazen it out and deny thy terror didst thou not swear to thy fellows that thou hadst often seen this deviation before ay even on as many as twenty occasions  well excellency this is a proof that a cavalier may make a very capital viceroy and admiral and know all about cathay without having the clearest notions of history i told my shipmates don christopher that i had noted these changes before this night and if tied to the stake to be burnt as a martyr as i sometimes think will one day be the fate of all of us superfluously honest men i would call on yourself señor almirante as the witness of the truth of what i had sworn to  thou wouldst then summon a most unfortunate witness sancho since i neither practise false oaths myself nor encourage their use in others  don luis de bobadilla y pedro de muños here would then be my reliance said the imperturbable sancho for proof a man hath a right to when wrongfully accused and proof i will have your excellency will please to remember that it was on the night of saturday the 15th that i first notified your worship of this very change and that we are now at the night of monday the 17th i swore to twenty times noting this phenomenon as it is called in those eightandforty hours when it would have been nearer the truth had i said two hundred times santa maria i did nothing but note it for the first few hours  go to sancho thy conscience hath its latitude as well as its longitude but thou hast thy uses now that thou understandest the reason of the variation however thou wilt encourage thy fellows as well as keep up thy spirits  i make no question that it is all as your excellency sayeth about the stars travelling returned sancho and it hath crossed my mind that it is possible we are nearer cathay than we have thought this movement being made by some evildisposed spirits on purpose to make us lose the way  go to thy hammock knave and bethink thee of thy sins leaving the reasons of these mysteries to those who are better taught there is thy dobla and see that thou art discreet  in the morning every being in the three caravels waited impatiently for the results of the new observations as the wind continued favorable though far from fresh and a current was found setting to the westward the vessels had made in the course of twentyfour hours more than a hundred and fifty miles which rendered the increase in the variation perceptible thus corroborating a prophecy of columbus that had been ventured on previous observation so easily are the ignorant the dupes of the plausible that this solution temporarily satisfied all doubts and it was generally believed that the star had moved while the needle remained true  how far columbus was misled by his own logic in this affair is still a matter of doubt that he resorted to deceptions which might be considered innocent in order to keep up the courage of his companions is seen in the fact of the false or public reckoning but there is no proof that this was one of the instances in which he had recourse to such means no person of any science believed even when the variation of the compass was unknown that the needle pointed necessarily to the polar star the coincidence in the direction of the magnetic needle and the position of the heavenly body being thought accidental and there is nothing extravagant in supposing that the admiralwho had the instrument in his possession and was able to ascertain that none of its virtue was visibly lost while he could only reason from supposed analogy concerning the evolutions of the starshould imagine that a friend he had ever found so faithful had now deserted him leaving him disposed to throw the whole mystery of the phenomenon on the more distant dwellers in space two opinions have been ventured concerning the belief of the celebrated navigator in the theory he advanced on this occasion the one affirming and the other denying his good faith in urging the doctrine he had laid down those who assert the latter however would seem to reason a little loosely themselves their argument mainly resting on the improbability of a man like columbus uttering so gross a scientific error at a time when science itself knew no more of the existence of the phenomenon than is known today of its cause still it is possible that the admiral may not have had any settled notions on the subject even while he was half inclined to hope his explanation was correct for it is certain that in the midst of the astronomical and geographical ignorance of his age this extraordinary man had many accurate and sublime glimpses of truths that were still in embryo as respected their development and demonstration by the lights of precise and inductive reasoning  fortunately if the light brought with it the means of ascertaining with certainty the variation of the needle it also brought the means of perceiving that the sea was still covered with weeds and other signs that were thought to be encouraging as connected with the vicinity of land the current being now in the same direction as the wind the surface of the ocean was literally as smooth as that of an inland sheet of water and the vessels were enabled to sail without danger within a few fathoms of each other  this weed señor almirante called out the elder pinzon hath the appearance of that which groweth on the banks of streams and i doubt that we are near to the mouth of some exceeding great river  this may be so returned columbus than which there can be no more certain sign than may be found in the taste of the water let a bucket be drawn that we may know  while pepe was busied in executing this order waiting until the vessel had passed through a large body of weeds for that purpose the quick eye of the admiral detected a crab struggling on the surface of the freshlooking plants and he called to the helmsman in sufficient season to enable him so far to vary his course as to allow the animal to be taken  here is a most precious prize good martin alonzo said columbus holding the crab between a finger and thumb that the other might see it these animals are never known to go further than some eighty leagues from the land and see señor yonder is one of the white tropic birds which it is said never sleep on the water truly god favoreth us and what rendereth all these tokens more grateful is the circumstance of their coming from the westthe hidden unknown mysterious west  a common shout burst from the crews at the appearance of these signs and again the beings who lately had been on the verge of despair were buoyed up with hope and ready to see propitious omens in even the most common occurrences of the ocean all the vessels had hauled up buckets of water and fifty mouths were immediately wet with the brine and so general was the infatuation that every man declared the sea far less salt than usual so complete indeed was the delusion created by these cheerful expectations and so thoroughly had all concern in connection with the moving star been removed by the sophism of sancho that even columbus habitually so wary so reasoning so calm amid his loftiest views yielded to his native enthusiasm and fancied that he was about to discover some vast island placed midway between asia and europe an honor not to be despised though it fell so far short of his higher expectations  truly friend martin alonzo he said this water seemeth to have less of the savor of the sea than is customary at a distance from the outlet of large rivers  my palate telleth the same tale señor almirante as a further sign the niña hath struck another tunny and her people are at this moment hoisting it in  shout succeeded shout as each new encouraging proof appeared and the admiral yielding to the ardor of the crews ordered sail to be pressed on all the vessels that each might endeavor to outstrip the others in the hope of being the first to discover the expected island this strife soon separated the caravels the pinta easily outsailing the other two while the santa maria and the niña came on more slowly in her rear all was gaiety and mirth the livelong day on board those isolated vessels that unknown to those they held were navigating the middle of the atlantic with horizon extending beyond horizon without change in the watery boundary as circle would form without circle on the same element were a vast mass of solid matter suddenly dropped into the sea  illustration     chapter xix        the sails were filled and fair the light winds blew       as glad to waft him from his native home       and fast the white rocks faded from his view       and soon were lost in circumambient foam       and then it may be of his wish to roam       repented he but in his bosom slept       the silent thought nor from his lips did come       one word of wail whilst others sate and wept     and to the reckless gales unmanly moaning kept      childe harolds pilgrimage   as night drew near the pinta shortened sail permitting her consorts to close all eyes now turned anxiously to the west where it was hoped that land might at any moment appear the last tint however vanished from the horizon and darkness enveloped the ocean without bringing any material change the wind still blew a pleasant breeze from the southeast and the surface of the ocean offered little more inequality than is usually met on the bosoms of large rivers the compasses showed a slightly increasing deviation from their old coincidence with the polar star and no one doubted any longer that the fault was in the heavenly body all this time the vessels were getting to the southward steering in fact west and by south when they thought they were steering westa circumstance that alone prevented columbus from first reaching the coast of georgia or that of the carolinas since had he missed the bermudas the current of the gulf stream meeting him on his weather bow he would have infallibly been set well to the northward as he neared the continent  the night passed as usual and at noon of the 17th or at the termination of the nautical day the fleet had left another long track of ocean between it and the old world the weeds were disappearing and with them the tunny fish which were in truth feeding on the products of shoals that mounted several thousands of feet nearer to the surface of the water than was the case with the general bed of the atlantic the vessels usually kept near each other at noon in order to compare their observations but the pinta which like a swift steed was with difficulty restrained shot ahead until the middle of the afternoon when as usual she layby for the admiral to close as the santa maria came sweeping on the elder pinzon stood cap in hand ready to speak her waiting only for her to come within sound of his voice  god increaseth the signs of land and the motives of encouragement señor don christopher he called out cheerfully while the pinta filled her sails in order to keep way with the admiral we have seen large flights of birds ahead and the clouds at the north look heavy and dense as if hovering over some island or continent in that quarter  thou art a welcome messenger worthy martin alonzo though i wish thee to remember that the most i expect to meet with in this longitude is some cluster of pleasant islands asia being yet several days sail more distant as the night approacheth thou wilt see thy clouds take still more of the form of the land and i doubt that groups may be found on each side of us but our high destination is cathay and men with such an object before them may not turn aside for any lesser errand  have i your leave noble admiral to push ahead in the pinta that our eyes may first be greeted with the grateful sight of asia i nothing doubt of seeing it ere morning  go of gods sake good pilot if thou thinkest this though i warn thee that no continent can yet meet thine eyes nevertheless as any land in these distant and unknown seas must be a discovery and bring credit on castile as well as on ourselves he who first perceiveth it will merit the reward thou or any one else hath my full permission to discover islands or continents in thousands  the people laughed at this sally for the lighthearted are easily excited to mirth and then the pinta shot ahead as the sun set she was seen again lyingto for her companionsa dark speck on the rainbow colors of the glorious sky the horizon at the north presented masses of clouds in which it was not difficult to fancy the summits of ragged mountains receding valleys with headlands and promontories foreshortened by distance  the following day the wind baffled for the first time since encountering the trades and the clouds collected overhead dispersing drizzling showers on the navigators the vessels now lay near each other and conversation flew from one to the otherboats passing and repassing constantly  i have come señor almirante said the elder pinzon as he reached the deck of the santa maria at the united request of my people to beg that we may steer to the north in quest of land islands and continent that no doubt lie there and thus crown this great enterprise with the glory that is due to our illustrious sovereigns and your own forethought  the wish is just good martin alonzo and fairly expressed but it may not be granted that we should make creditable discoveries by thus steering is highly probable but in so doing we should fall far short of our aim cathay and the great khan still lie west and we are here not to add another group like the canaries or the azores to the knowledge of man but to complete the circle of the earth and to open the way for the setting up of the cross in the regions that have so long been the property of infidels  hast thou nothing to say señor de muños in support of our petition thou hast favor with his excellency and may prevail on him to grant us this small behest  to tell thee the truth good martin alonzo answered luis with more of the indifference of manner that might have been expected from the grandee to the pilot than the respect that would become the secretary to the second person of the expeditionto tell thee the truth good martin alonzo my heart is so set on the conversion of the great khan that i wish not to turn either to the right or left until that glorious achievement be sufficiently secure i have observed that satan effecteth little against those who keep in the direct path while his success with those who turn aside is so material as to people his dominions with errants  is there no hope noble admiral and must we quit all these cheering signs without endeavoring to trace them to some advantageous conclusion  i see no better course worthy friend this rain indicateth land also this calm and here is a visitor that denoteth more than eitheryonder in the direction of thy pinta where it seemeth disposed to rest its wings  pinzon and all near him turned and to their common delight and astonishment they saw a pelican with extended wings that spread for ten feet sailing a few fathoms above the sea and apparently aiming at the vessel named the adventurous bird however as if disdaining to visit one of inferior rank passed the pinta and sweeping up grandly toward the admiral alighted on a yard of the santa maria  if this be not a certain sign of the vicinity of land said columbus gravely it is what is far better a sure omen that god is with us he is sending these encouraging calls to confirm us in our intention to serve him and to persevere to the end never before martin alonzo have i seen a bird of this species a days sail from the shore  such is my experience too noble admiral and with you i look upon this visit as a most propitious omen may it not be a hint to turn aside and to look further in this quarter  i accept it not as such but rather as a motive to proceed at our return from the indies we may examine this part of the ocean with greater security though i shall think naught accomplished until india be fairly reached and india is still hundreds of leagues distant as the time is favorable however we will call together our pilots and see how each man placeth his vessel on the chart  at this suggestion all the navigators assembled on board the santa maria and each man made his calculations sticking a pin in the rude chartrude as to accuracy but beautiful as to executionthat the admiral with the lights he then possessed had made of the atlantic ocean vicente yañez and his companions of the niña placed their pin most in advance after measuring off four hundred and forty marine leagues from gomera martin alonzo varied a little from this setting his pin some twenty leagues farther east when it was the turn of columbus he stuck a pin twenty leagues still short of that of martin alonzo his companions having to all appearance like less skilful calculators thus much advanced ahead of their true distance it was then determined what was to be stated to the crews and the pilots returned to their respective vessels  it would seem that columbus really believed he was then passing between islands and his historian las casas affirms that he was actually right in his conjecture but if islands ever existed in that part of the ocean they have long since disappeared a phenomenon which while it is not impossible can scarcely be deemed probable it is said that breakers have been seen even within the present century in this vicinity and it is not unlikely that extensive banks do exist though columbus found no bottom with two hundred fathoms of line the great collection of weeds is a fact authenticated by some of the oldest records of human investigations and is most probably owing to some effect of the currents which has a tendency to bring about such an end while the birds must be considered as stragglers lured from their usual haunts by the food that would be apt to be collected by the union of weeds and fish aquatic birds can always rest on the water and the animal that can wing its way through the air at the rate of thirty or even fifty miles the hour needs only sufficient strength to cross the entire atlantic in four days and nights  notwithstanding all these cheering signs the different crews soon began to feel again the weight of a renewed despondency sancho who was in constant but secret communication with the admiral kept the latter properly advised of the state of the people and reported that more murmurs than usual prevailed the men having passed again by the suddenness of the reaction from the most elastic hope nearly to the verge of despair this fact was told columbus just at sunset on the evening of the 20th or on that of the eleventh day after the fleet lost sight of land and while the seaman was affecting to be busy on the poop where he made most of his communications  they complain your excellency continued sancho of the smoothness of the water and they say that when the winds blow at all in these seas they come only from the eastward having no power to blow from any other quarter the calms they think prove that we are getting into a part of the ocean where there is no wind and the east winds they fancy are sent by providence to drive those there who have displeased heaven by a curiosity that it was never intended that any who wear beards should possess  do thou encourage them sancho by reminding the poor fellows that calms prevail at times in all seas and as for the east winds is it not well known that they blow from off the african shores in low latitudes at all seasons of the year following the sun in his daily track around the earth i trust thou hast none of this silly apprehension  i endeavor to keep a stout heart señor don almirante having no one before me to disgrace and leaving no one behind me to mourn over my loss still i should like to hear a little about the riches of those distant lands as i find the thoughts of their gold and precious stones have a sort of religious charm over my weakness when i begin to muse upon moguer and its good cheer  go to knave thy appetite for money is insatiable take yet another dobla and as thou gazest on it thou mayst fancy what thou wilt of the coin of the great khan resting certain that so great a monarch is not without gold any more than he is probably without the disposition to part with it when there is occasion  sancho received his fee and left the poop to columbus and our hero  these ups and downs among the knaves said luis impatiently were best quelled señor by an application of the flat of the sword or at need of its edge  this may not be my young friend without at least far more occasion than yet existeth for the severity think not that i have passed so many years of my life in soliciting the means to effect so great a purpose and have got thus far on my way in unknown seas with a disposition to be easily turned aside from my purpose but god hath not created all alike neither hath he afforded equal chances for knowledge to the peasant and the noble i have vexed my spirit too often with arguments on this very subject with the great and learned not to bear a little with the ignorance of the vulgar fancy how much fear would have quickened the wits of the sages of salamanca had our discussion been held in the middle of the atlantic where man never had been and whence no eyes but those of logic and science could discover a safe passage  this is most true señor almirante and yet methinks the knights that were of your antagonists should not have been wholly unmanned by fear what danger have we here this is the wide ocean it is true and we are no doubt distant some hundreds of leagues from the known islands but we are not the less safe by san pedro i have seen more lives lost in a single onset of the moors than these caravels could hold in bodies and blood enough spilt to float them  the dangers our people dread may be less turbulent than those of a moorish fray don luis but they are not the less terrible where is the spring that is to furnish water to the parched lip when our stores shall fail and where the field to give us its bread and nourishment it is a fearful thing to be brought down to the dregs of life by the failure of food and water on the surface of the wide ocean dying by inches often without the consolations of the church and ever without christian sepulture these are the fancies of the seaman and he is only to be driven from them violently when duty demands extreme remedies for his disease  to me it seemeth don christopher that it will be time to reason thus when our casks are drained and the last biscuit is broken until then i ask leave of your excellency to apply the necessary logic to the outside of the heads of these varlets instead of their insides of which i much question the capacity to hold any good  columbus too well understood the hot nature of the young noble to make a serious reply and they both stood some time leaning against the mizenmast watching the scene before them and musing on the chances of their situation it was night and the figures of the watch on the deck beneath were visible only by a light that rendered it difficult to distinguish countenances the men were grouped and it was evident by the low but eager tones in which they conversed that they discussed matters connected with the calm and the risks they ran the outlines of the pinta and niña were visible beneath a firmament that was studded with brilliants their lazy sails hanging in festoons like the drapery of curtains and their black hulls were as stationary as if they both lay moored in one of the rivers of spain it was a bland and gentle night but the immensity of the solitude the deep calm of the slumbering ocean and even the occasional creaking of a spar by recalling to the mind the actual presence of vessels so situated rendered the scene solemn almost to sublimity  dost thou detect aught fluttering in the rigging luis the admiral cautiously inquired my ear deceiveth me or i hear something on the wing the sounds moreover are quick and slight like those produced by birds of indifferent size  don christopher you are right there are little creatures perched on the upper yards and that of a size like the smaller songsters of the land  hark interrupted the admiral that is a joyous note and of such a melody as might be met in one of the orange groves of seville itself god be praised for this sign of the extent and unity of his kingdom since land cannot well be distant when creatures gentle and frail as these have so lately taken their flight from it  the presence of these birds soon became known to all on deck and their songs brought more comfort than the most able mathematical demonstration even though founded on modern learning could have produced on the sensitive feelings of the common men  i told thee land was near cried sancho turning with exultation to martin martinez his constant disputant here thou hast the proof of it in a manner that none but the traitor will deny thou hearest the songs of orchard birdsnotes that would never come from the throats of the tired and which sound as gaily as if the dear little feathered rogues were pecking at a fig or a grape in a field of spain  sancho is right exclaimed the seamen the air savors of land too and the sea hath a look of the land and god is with usblessed be his holy nameand honor to our lord the king and to our gracious mistress doña isabella  from this moment concern seemed to leave the vessel again it was thought even by the admiral himself that the presence of birds so small and which were judged to be so feeble of wing was an unerring evidence that land was nigh and land too of generous productions and a mild gentle climate for these warblers like the softer sex of the human family best love scenes that most favor their gentle propensities and delicate habits  investigation has since proved that in this particular however plausible the grounds of error columbus was deceived men often mistake the powers of the inferior animals of creation and at other times they overrate the extent of their instinct in point of fact a bird of light weight would be less liable to perish on the ocean and in that low latitude than a bird of more size neither being aquatic the seaweed itself would furnish restingplaces without number for the smaller animals and in some instances it would probably furnish food that birds purely of the land should take long flights at sea is certainly improbable but apart from the consequence of gales which often force even that heavywinged animal the owl hundreds of miles from the land instinct is not infallible whales being frequently found embayed in shallow waters and birds sailing beyond the just limits of their habits whatever may have been the cause of the opportune appearance of these little inhabitants of the orchard on the spars of the santa maria the effect was of the most auspicious kind on the spirits of the men as long as they sang no amateurs ever listened to the most brilliant passages from the orchestra with greater delight than those rude seamen listened to their warbling and while they slept it was with a security that had its existence in veneration and gratitude the songs were renewed with the dawn shortly after which the whole went off in a body taking their flight toward the southwest the next day brought a calm and then an air so light that the vessels could with difficulty make their way through the dense masses of weeds that actually gave the ocean the appearance of vast inundated meadows the current was now found to be from the west and shortly after daylight a new source of alarm was reported by sancho  the people have got a notion in their heads señor almirante which partaketh so much of the marvellous that it findeth exceeding favor with such as love miracles more than they love god martin martinez who is a philosopher in the way of terror maintaineth that this sea into which we seem to be entering deeper and deeper lieth over sunken islands and that the weeds which it would be idle to deny grow more abundant as we proceed will shortly get to be so plentiful on the surface of the water that the caravels will become unable to advance or to retreat  doth martin find any to believe this silly notion  señor don almirante he doth and for the plain reason that it is easier to find those who are ready to believe an absurdity than to find those who will only believe truth but the man is backed by some unlucky chances that must come of the powers of darkness more particularly as they can have no great wish to see your excellency reach cathay with the intention of making a christian of the great khan and of planting the tree of the cross in his dominions this calm sorely troubleth many moreover and the birds are beginning to be looked upon as creatures sent by satan himself to lead us whither we can never return some even believe we shall tread on shoals and lie forever stranded wrecks in the midst of the wide ocean  go bid the men prepare to sound i will show them the folly of this idea at least and see that all are summoned to witness the experiment  columbus now repeated this order to the pilots and the deepsea was let go in the usual manner fathom after fathom of the line glided over the rail the lead taking its unerring way toward the bottom until so little was left as to compel the downward course to be arrested  ye see my friends that we are yet full two hundred fathoms from the shoals ye so much dread and as much more as the sea is deeper than our measurement lo yonder too is a whale spouting the water before hima creature never seen except on the coasts of large islands or continents  this appeal of columbus which was in conformity with the notions of the day had its weighthis crew being naturally most under the influence of notions that were popular it is now known however that whales frequent those parts of the ocean where their food is most abundant and one of the best grounds for taking them of late years has been what is called the false brazil banks which lie near the centre of the ocean in a word all those signs that were connected with the movements of birds and fishes and which appear to have had so much effect not only on the common men of this great enterprise but on columbus himself were of far less real importance than was then believed navigators being so little accustomed to venture far from the land themselves that they were not duly acquainted with the mysteries of the open ocean  notwithstanding the moments of cheerfulness and hope that intervened distrust and apprehension were fast getting to be again the prevailing feelings among the mariners those who had been most disaffected from the first seized every occasion to increase these apprehensions and when the sun rose saturday september 22d on a calm sea there were not a few in the vessels who were disposed to unite in making another demand on the admiral to turn the heads of the caravels toward the east  we have come some hundreds of leagues before a fair wind into a sea that is entirely unknown to man until we have reached a part of the ocean where the wind seems altogether to fail us and where there is danger of our being bound up in immovable weeds or stranded on sunken islands without the means of procuring food or water  arguments like these were suited to an age in which even the most learned were obliged to grope their way to accurate knowledge through the mists of superstition and ignorance and in which it was a prevailing weakness to put faith on the one hand in visible proofs of the miraculous power of god and on the other in substantial evidences of the ascendency of evil spirits as they were permitted to affect the temporal affairs of those they persecuted  it was therefore most fortunate for the success of the expedition that a light breeze sprang up from southward and westward in the early part of the day just mentioned enabling the vessels to gather way and to move beyond the vast fields of weeds that equally obstructed the progress of the caravels and awakened the fears of their people as it was an object to get clear of the floating obstacles that surrounded the vessels the first large opening that offered was entered and then the fleet was brought close upon a wind heading as near as possible to the desired course columbus now believed himself to be steering westnorthwest when in fact he was sailing in a direction far nearer to his true course than when his ships headed west by compass the departure from the desired line of sailing being owing to the variation in the needle this circumstance alone would seem to establish the fact that columbus believed in his own theory of the moving star since he would hardly have steered westandbysouthhalfsouth with a fair wind for many days in succession as he is known to have done when it was his strongest wish to proceed directly west he was now heading up within half a point of the latter course though he and all with him fancied they were running off nearly two points to leeward of the so much desired direction  but these little variations were trifles as compared with the advantage that the admiral obtained over the fears of his followers by the shift of the wind and the liberation from the weeds by the first the men saw a proof that the breezes did not always blow from the same quarter and by the last they ascertained that they had not actually reached a point where the ocean had become impassable although the wind was now favorable to return to the canaries no one any longer demanded that such a course should be adopted so apt are we all to desire that which appears to be denied to us and so ready to despise that which lies perfectly at our disposal  this indeed was a moment when the feelings of the people appeared to be as variable as the light and baffling winds themselves the saturday passed away in the manner just mentioned the vessels once more entering into large fields of weeds just as the sun set when the light returned the airs headed them off to northwest and northwestbynorth by compass which was in truth steering northwestbywesthalfwest and northwesthalfwest birds abounded again among which was a turtledove and many living crabs were seen crawling among the weeds all these signs would have encouraged the common men had they not already so often proved deceptive  señor said martin martinez to the admiral when columbus went among the crew to raise their drooping spirits we know not what to think for days did the wind blow in the same direction leading us on as it might be to our ruin and then it hath deserted us in such a sea as mariners in the santa maria never before saw a sea looking like meadows on a river side and which wanteth only kine and cowherds to be mistaken for fields a little overflowed by a rise of the water is a fearful thing  thy meadows are the weeds of the ocean and prove the richness of the nature that hath produced them while thy breezes from the east are what all who have ever made the guinea voyage well know to exist in latitudes so low i see naught in either to alarm a bold seaman and as for the bottom we all know it hath not yet been found by many a long and weary fathom of line pepe thou hast none of these weaknesses but hast set thy heart on cathay and a sight of the great khan  señor almirante as i swore to monica so do i swear to your excellency and that is to be true and obedient if the cross is to be raised among the infidels my hand shall not be backward in doing its share toward the holy act still señor none of us like this long unnatural calm here is an ocean that hath no waves but a surface so smooth that we much distrust whether the waters obey the same laws as they are known to do near spain for never before have i beheld a sea that hath so much the air of the dead may it not be señor that god hath placed a belt of this calm and stagnant water around the outer edges of the earth in order to prevent the unheedy from looking into some of his sacred secrets  thy reasoning hath at least a savor of religion and though faulty can scarce be condemned god hath placed man on this earth pepe to be its master and to serve him by extending the dominion of his church as well as by turning to the best account all the numberless blessings that accompany the great gift as to the limits of which thou speakest they exist only in idea the earth being a sphere or a ball to which there are no other edges than those thou seest everywhere on its surface  and as for what martin saith put in sancho who was never at fault for a fact or for a reason concerning the winds and the weeds and the calms i can only wonder where a seaman of his years hath been navigating so long that these things should be novelties to me all this is as common as dishwater at moguer and so much a matter of course that i should not have remarked it but for the whinings of martin and his fellows when the santa catalina made the voyage to that faroff region ireland we landed on the seaweed a distance of half a league or so from the coast and as for the wind it blew regularly four weeks from one quarter and four weeks from the other after which the people of the country said it would blow four weeks each way transversely but we did not remain long enough in those seas to enable me to swear to the two last facts  hast thou not heard of shoals so wide that a caravel could never find its way out of them if it once entered demanded martinez fiercely for much addicted to gross exaggerations himself he little liked to be outdone and do not these weeds bespeak our near approach to such a danger when the weeds themselves often are so closely packed as to come near to stop the ship  enough of this said the admiral at times we have weeds and then we are altogether free from them these changes are owing to the currents no doubt as soon as we have passed this meridian we shall come to clear water again  but the calm señor almirante exclaimed a dozen voices this unnatural smoothness of the ocean frighteneth us never before did we see water so stagnant and immovable  call ye this stagnant and immovable exclaimed the admiral nature herself arises to reproach your senseless fears and to contradict your mistaken reasoning by her own signs and portents  this was said as the santa marias bows rose on a long low swell every spar creaking at the motion and the whole hull heaving and setting as the billow passed beneath it washing the sides of the ship from the water line to its channels at this moment there was not even a breath of air and the seamen gazed about them with an astonishment that was increased and rendered extreme by dread the ship had scarcely settled heavily into the long trough when a second wave lifted her again forward and billow succeeded billow each successive wave increasing in height until the entire ocean was undulating though only marked at distant intervals and that slightly by the foam of crests or combing seas it took half an hour to bring this phenomenon up to its height when all three vessels were wallowing in the seas as mariners term it their hulls falling off helplessly into the troughs until the water fairly spouted from their low scuppers as each rose by her buoyancy from some roll deeper than common fancying that this occurrence promised to be either a source of new alarm or a means of appeasing the old one columbus took early measures to turn it to account in the latter mode causing all the crew to assemble at the break of the poop he addressed them briefly in the following words  ye see men that your late fears about the stagnant ocean are rebuked in this sudden manner as it might be by the hand of god himself proving beyond dispute that no danger is to be apprehended from that source i might impose on your ignorance and insist that this sudden rising of the sea is a miracle wrought to sustain me against your rebellious repinings and unthinking alarms but the cause in which i am engaged needs no support of this nature that doth not truly come from heaven the calms and the smoothness of the water and even the weeds of which ye complain come from the vicinity of some great body of land i think not a continent as that must lie still further west but of islands either so large or so numerous as to make a farextended lee while these swells are probably the evidence of wind at a distance which hath driven up the ocean into mountainous waves such as we often see them and which send out their dying efforts even beyond the limits of the gale i do not say that this intervention to appease your fears doth not come of god in whose hands i am for this last do i fully believe and for it am i fully grateful but it cometh through the agencies of nature and can in no sense be deemed providential except as it demonstrateth the continuance of the divine care as well as its surpassing goodness go then and be tranquil remember if spain be far behind ye that cathay now lieth at no great distance before ye that each hour shorteneth that distance as well as the time necessary to reach our goal he that remaineth true and faithful shall not repent his confidence while he who unnecessarily disturbeth either himself or others with silly doubts may look forward to an exercise of authority that shall maintain the rights of their highnesses to the duty of all their servants  we record this speech of the great navigator with so much the more pleasure as it goes fully to establish the fact that he did not believe the sudden rising of the seas on this occasion was owing to a direct miracle as some of the historians and biographers seem inclined to believe but rather to a providential interference of divine power through natural means in order to protect him against the consequences of the blind apprehensions of his followers it is not easy indeed to suppose that a seaman as experienced as columbus could be ignorant of the natural cause of a circumstance so very common on the ocean that those who dwell on its coast have frequent occasion to witness its occurrence     chapter xx      ora pro nobis materwhat a spell     was in those notes with days last glory dying     on the flushd watersseemed they not to swell     from the far dust wherein my sires were lying     with crucifix and swordoh yet how clear     comes their reproachful sweetness to my ear     orawith all the purple waves replying     all my youths visions rising in the strain     and i had thought it much to bear the rack and chain      the forest sanctuary   it may now be well to recapitulate and to let the reader distinctly know how far the adventurers had actually advanced into the unknown waters of the atlantic what was their real and what their supposed position as has been seen from the time of quitting gomera the admiral kept two reckonings one intended for his own government which came as near the truth as the imperfect means of the science of navigation that were then in use would allow and another that was freely exhibited to the crew and was purposely miscalculated in order to prevent alarm on account of the distance that had been passed as columbus believed himself to be employed in the service of god this act of deception would be thought a species of pious fraud in that devout age and it is by no means probable that it gave the conscience of the navigator any trouble since churchmen even did not hesitate always about buttressing the walls of faith by means still less justifiable  the long calms and light headwinds had prevented the vessels from making much progress for the few last days and by estimating the distance that was subsequently run in a course but a little south of west it appears notwithstanding all the encouraging signs of birds fishes calms and smooth water that on the morning of monday september 24th or that of the fifteenth day after losing sight of ferro the expedition was about halfway across the atlantic counting from continent to continent on the parallel of about 31 or 32 degrees of north latitude the circumstance of the vessels being so far north of the canaries when it is known that they had been running most of the time west a little southerly must be imputed to the course steered in the scant winds and perhaps to the general set of the currents with this brief explanation we return to the daily progress of the ships  the influence of the trades was once more felt though in a very slight degree in the course of the twentyfour hours that succeeded the day of the miraculous seas and the vessels again headed west by compass birds were seen as usual among which was a pelican the whole progress of the vessels was less than fifty miles a distance that was lessened as usual in the public reckoning  the morning of the 25th was calm but the wind returned a steady gentle breeze from the southeast when the day was far advanced the caravels passing most of the hours of light floating near each other in a lazy indolence or barely stirring the water with their stems at a rate little if any exceeding that of a mile an hour  the pinta kept near the santa maria and the officers and crews of the two vessels conversed freely with each other concerning their hopes and situation columbus listened to these dialogues for a long time endeavoring to collect the predominant feeling from the more guarded expressions that were thus publicly delivered and watching each turn of the expressions with jealous vigilance at length it struck him that the occasion was favorable to producing a good effect on the spirits of his followers  what hast thou thought of the chart i sent thee three days since good martin alonzo called out the admiral dost thou see in it aught to satisfy thee that we are approaching the indies and that our time of trial draweth rapidly to an end  at the first sound of the admirals voice every syllable was hushed among the people for in spite of their discontent and their disposition even to rise against him in their extremity columbus had succeeded in creating a profound respect for his judgment and his person among all his followers  tis a rare and welldesigned chart señor don christopher answered the master of the pinta and doth a fair credit to him who hath copied and enlarged as well as to him who first projected it i doubt that it is the work of some learned scholar that hath united the opinions of all the greater navigators in his map  the original came from one paul toscanelli a learned tuscan who dwelleth at firenze in that country a man of exceeding knowledge and of an industry in investigation that putteth idleness to shame accompanying the chart he sent a missive that hath much profound and learned matter on the subject of the indies and touching those islands that thou seest laid down with so much particularity in that letter he speaketh of divers places as being so many wonderful exemplars of the power of man more especially of the port of zaiton which sendeth forth no less than a hundred ships yearly loaded with the single product of the peppertree he saith moreover that an ambassador came to the holy father in the time of eugenius iv of blessed memory to express the desire of the great khan which meaneth king of kings in the dialect of those regions to be on friendly terms with the christians of the west as we were then termed but of the east as will shortly be our designation in that part of the world  this is surprising señor exclaimed pinzon how is it known or is it known at all of a certainty  beyond a question since paul stateth in his missive that he saw much of this same ambassador living greatly in his society eugenius deceasing as lately as 1477 from the ambassador no doubt a wise and grave personage since no other would have been sent so far on a mission to the head of the church from this discreet person then did toscanelli gain much pleasant information concerning the populousness and vast extent of those distant countries the gorgeousness of the palaces and the glorious beauty of the cities he spoke of one town in particular that surpasseth all others of the known world and of a single river that hath two hundred noble cities on its own banks with marble bridges spanning the stream the chart before thee martin alonzo showeth that the exact distance from lisbon to the city of quisay is just three thousand nine hundred miles of italy or about a thousand leagues steering always in a duewest direction2  footnote 2 noteit is worthy of remark that the city of philadelphia stands as near as may be in the position that the honest paul toscanelli supposed to have been occupied by the famous city of quisay  and doth the learned tuscan say aught of the riches of those countries demanded master alonzoa question that caused all within hearing to prick up their ears afresh  that doth he and in these precise and impressive wordsthis is a noble country observed the learned paul in his missive and ought to be explored by us on account of its great riches and the quantity of gold silver and precious stones which might be obtained there he moreover described quisay as being fiveandthirty leagues in circuit and addeth that its name in the castilian is the city of heaven  in which case muttered sancho though in a tone so low that no one but pepe heard him there is little need of our bearing thither the cross which was intended for the benefit of man and not of paradise  i see here two large islands señor almirante continued pinzon keeping his eyes on the chart one of which is called antilla and the other is the cipango of which your excellency so often speaketh  even so good martin alonzo and thou also seest that they are laid down with a precision that must prevent any experienced navigator from missing his way when in pursuit of them these islands lie just two hundred and twentyfive leagues asunder  according to our reckoning here in the pinta noble admiral we cannot then be far from cipango at this very moment  it would so seem by the reckonings though i somewhat doubt their justness it is a common error of pilots to run ahead of their reckonings but in this instance apprehension hath brought ye behind them cipango lieth many days sail from the continent of asia and cannot therefore be far from this spot still the currents have been adverse and i doubt that it will be found that we are as near this island good martin alonzo as thou and thy companions imagine let the chart be returned and i will trace our actual position on it that all may see what reason there is to despond and what reason to rejoice  pinzon now took the chart rolled it together carefully attached a light weight and securing the whole with the end of a logline he hove it on board the santa maria as a seaman makes a cast with the lead so near were the vessels at the moment that this communication was made without any difficulty after which the pinta letting fall an additional sail or two flapped slowly ahead her superiority particularly in light winds being at all times apparent  columbus now caused the chart to be spread over a table on the poop and invited all who chose to draw near in order that they might with their own eyes see the precise spot on the ocean where the admiral supposed the vessels to be as each days work was accurately laid down and measured on the chart by one as expert as the great navigator himself there is little question that he succeeded in showing his people as near as might be and subject to the deduction in distance that was intentionally made the longitude and latitude to which the expedition had then reached and as this brought them quite near those islands which were believed to lie east of the continent of asia this tangible proof of their progress had far more effect than any demonstration that depended on abstract reasoning even when grounded on premises that were true most men submitting sooner to the authority of the senses than to the influence of the mere mind the seamen did not stop to inquire how it was settled that cipango lay in the precise place where it had been projected on this famous chart but seeing it there in black and white they were disposed to believe it was really in the spot it appeared to be and as columbus reputation for keeping a ships reckoning far surpassed that of any other navigator in the fleet the facts were held to be established great was the joy in consequence and the minds of the people again passed from the verge of despair to an excess and illusion of hope that was raised only to be disappointed  that columbus was sincere in all that related to this new delusion with the exception of the calculated reduction of the true distance is beyond a doubt in common with the cosmographers of the age he believed the circumference of the earth much less than actual measurement has since shown it to be striking out of the calculation at once nearly the whole breadth of the pacific ocean that this conclusion was very natural will be seen by glancing at the geographical facts that the learned then possessed as data for their theories  it was known that the continent of asia was bounded on the east by a vast ocean and that a similar body of water bounded europe on the west leaving the plausible inference on the supposition that the earth was a sphere that nothing but islands existed between these two great boundaries of land less than half of the real circumference of the globe is to be found between the western and eastern verges of the old continent as they were then known but it was too bold an effort of the mind to conceive that startling fact in the condition of human knowledge at the close of the fifteenth century the theories were consequently content with drawing the limits of the east and the west into a much narrower circle finding no data for any freer speculation and believing it a sufficient act of boldness to maintain the spherical formation of the earth at all it is true that the latter theory was as old as ptolemy and quite probably much older but even the antiquity of a system begins to be an argument against it in the minds of the vulgar when centuries elapse and it receives no confirmation from actual experiment columbus supposed his island of cipango or japan to lie about one hundred and forty degrees of longitude east of its actual position and as a degree of longitude in the latitude of japan or 35° north supposing the surface of the earth to be perfectly spherical is about fiftysix statute miles it follows that columbus had advanced this island on his chart more than seven thousand english miles toward the eastward or a distance materially exceeding two thousand marine leagues  all this however was not only hidden in mystery as regards the common men of the expedition but it far outstripped the boldest conceptions of the great navigator himself facts of this nature notwithstanding are far from detracting from the glory of the vast discoveries that were subsequently made since they prove under what moral disadvantages the expedition was conceived and under what a limited degree of knowledge it finally triumphed  while columbus was thus employed with the chart it was a curious thing to witness the manner in which the seamen watched his smallest movement studied the expression of his grave and composed countenance and sought to read their fate in the contraction or dilation of his eyes the gentlemen of the santa maria and the pilots stood at his elbow and here and there some old mariner ventured to take his post at hand where he could follow the slow progress of the pen or note the explanation of a figure among these was sancho who was generally admitted to be one of the most expert seamen in the little fleetin all things at least that did not require the knowledge of the schools columbus even turned to these men and spoke to them kindly endeavoring to make them comprehend a part of their calling which they saw practised daily without ever succeeding in acquiring a practical acquaintance with it pointing out particularly the distance come and that which yet remained before them others again the less experienced but not the less interested among the crew hung about the rigging whence they could overlook the scene and fancy they beheld demonstrations that came of theories which it as much exceeded their reasoning powers to understand as it exceeded their physical vision to behold the desired indies themselves as men become intellectual they entertain abstractions leaving the dominion of the senses to take refuge in that of thought until this change arrives however we are all singularly influenced by a parade of positive things words spoken seldom produce the effect of words written and the praise or censure that would enter lightly and unheeded into the ear might even change our estimates of character when received into the mind through the medium of the eye thus the very seamen who could not comprehend the reasoning of columbus fancied they understood his chart and willingly enough believed that islands and continents must exist in the precise places where they saw them so plainly delineated  after this exhibition cheerfulness resumed its sway over the crew of the santa maria and sancho who was generally considered as of the party of the admiral was eagerly appealed to by his fellows for many of the little circumstances that were thought to explain the features of the chart  dost think sancho that cipango is as large as the admiral hath got the island on the chart asked one who had passed from the verge of despair to the other extreme that it lieth fairly any eye may see since its look is as natural as that of ferro or madeira  that hath he answered sancho positively as one may see by its shape didst not notice the capes and bays and headlands all laid down as plainly as on any other wellknown coast ah these genoese are skilful navigators and señor colon our noble admiral hath not come all this distance without having some notion in what roadstead he is to anchor  in such conclusive arguments the dullest minds of the crew found exceeding consolation while among all the common people of the ship there was not one who did not feel more confidence in the happy termination of the voyage since he had this seeming ocular proof of the existence of land in the part of the ocean they were in  when the discourse between the admiral and pinzon ceased the latter made sail on the pinta which vessel had slowly passed the santa maria and was now a hundred yards or more ahead of her neither going through the water at a rate exceeding a knot an hour at the moment just mentioned or while the men were conversing of their newly awakened hopes a shout drew all eyes toward their consort where pinzon was seen on the poop waving his cap in exultation and giving the usual proofs of extravagant delight  landland señor he shouted i claim my reward land land  in what direction good martin alonzo asked columbus so eagerly that his voice fairly trembled in which quarter dost thou perceive this welcome neighbor  here to the southwest pointing in that directiona range of dim but noble mountains and such as promise to satisfy the pious longings of the holy father himself  every eye turned toward the southwest and there indeed they fancied they beheld the longsought proofs of their success a faint hazy mass was visible in the horizon broken in outline more distinctly marked than clouds usually are and yet so obscure as to require a practised eye to draw it out of the obscurity of the void this is the manner in which land often appears to seamen in peculiar conditions of the atmosphere others under such circumstances being seldom able to distinguish it at all columbus was so practised in all the phenomena of the ocean that the face of every man in the santa maria was turned toward his in breathless expectation of the result as soon as the first glance had been given toward the point of the compass mentioned it was impossible to mistake the expression of the admirals countenance which immediately became radiant with delight and pious exultation uncovering himself he cast a look upward in unbounded gratitude and then fell on his knees to return open thanks to god this was the signal of triumph and yet in their desolate situation exultation was not the prevalent feeling of the moment like columbus the men felt their absolute dependence on god and a sense of humble and rebuked gratitude came over every spirit as it might be simultaneously kneeling the entire crews of the three vessels simultaneously commenced the chant of gloria in excelsis deo lifting the voice of praise for the first time since the foundations of the earth were laid in that deep solitude of the ocean matins and vespers it is true were then habitually repeated in most christian ships but this sublime chant was now uttered to waves that had been praising their maker in their might and in their calm for so many thousand years for the first time in the voice of man  glory be to god on high sang these rude mariners with hearts softened by their escapes dangers and success speaking as one man though modulating their tones to the solemn harmony of a religious riteand on earth peace good will toward men we praise thee we bless thee we worship thee we glorify thee we give thanks to thee for thy great glory o lord god heavenly king god the father almighty c c  in this noble chant which would seem to approach as near to the praises of angels as human powers can ever hope to rise the voice of the admiral was distinct and deep but trembling with emotion  when this act of pious gratitude was performed the men ascended the rigging to make more certain of their success all agreed in pronouncing the faintly delineated mass to be land and the first sudden transport of unexpected joy was succeeded by the more regulated feelings of confirmed security the sun set a little north of the dim mountains and night closed around the scene shadowing the ocean with as much gloom as is ever to be found beneath a tropical and cloudless sky as the first watch was set columbus who whenever the winds would allow had persevered in steering what he fancied to be a duewest course to satisfy the longings of his people ordered the vessels to haul up to southwest by compass which was in fact heading southwestbysouthsoutherly the wind increased and as the admiral had supposed the land to be distant about twentyfive leagues when last seen all in the little fleet confidently relied on obtaining a full and complete view of it in the morning columbus himself entertained this hope though he varied his course reluctantly feeling certain that the continent would be met by sailing west or what he thought to be west though he could have no similar confidence as to making any island  few slept soundly that nightvisions of oriental riches and of the wonders of the east crowding on the minds of even the least imaginative converting their slumbers into dreams rendered uneasy by longings for gold and anticipations of the wonders of the unknown east the men left their hammocks from hour to hour to stand in the rigging watching for some new proofs of their proximity to the muchdesired islands and straining their eyes in vain in the hope of looking deeper into the obscurity in quest of objects that fancy had already begun to invest with forms in the course of the night the vessels ran in a direct line toward the southwest seventeen of the twentyfive leagues that columbus had supposed alone separated him from this new discovery and just before the light dawned every soul in the three vessels was stirring in the eager hope of having the panorama of day open on such a sight as they felt it to be but a slight grievance to have come so far and to have risked so much to behold  yonder is a streak of light glimmering in the east cried luis in a cheerful voice and now señor almirante we may unite in terming you the honored of the earth  all rests with god my young friend returned columbus whether land is near us or not it boundeth the western ocean and to that boundary we must proceed thou art right truly friend gutierrez the light is beginning to shed itself along the eastern margin of the sea and even to rise in an arch into the vault above it  would that the sun rose for this one day in the west that we might catch the first glimpse of our new possessions in that radiant field of heaven which his coming rays are so gloriously illuminating above the track we have just passed  that will not happen master pedro since sol hath journeyed daily round this planet of ours from east to west since time began and will so continue to journey until time shall cease this is a fact on which our senses may be trusted though they mislead us in so many other things  so reasoned columbus a man whose mind had outstripped the age in his favorite study and who was usually so calm and philosophical simply because he reasoned in the fetters of habit and prejudice the celebrated system of ptolemy that strange compound of truth and error was the favorite astronomical law of the day copernicus who was then but a mere youth did not reduce the just conception of pythagorasjust in outline though fanciful in its connection with both cause and effectto the precision of science for many years after the discovery of america and it is a strong proof of the dangers which attended the advancement of thought that he was rewarded for this vast effort of human reason by excommunication from the church the maledictions of which actually rested on his soul if not on his body until within a few years of the present moment this single circumstance will show the reader how much our navigator had to overcome in achieving the great office he had assumed  but all this time the day is dawning and the light is beginning to diffuse itself over the entire panorama of ocean and sky as means were afforded each look eagerly took in the whole range of the western horizon and a chill of disappointment settled on every heart as suspicion gradually became confirmation that no land was visible the vessels had passed in the night those bounds of the visible horizon where masses of clouds had settled and no one could any longer doubt that his senses had been deceived by some accidental peculiarity in the atmosphere all eyes now turned again to the admiral who while he felt the disappointment in his inmost heart maintained a dignified calm that it was not easy to disturb  these signs are not infrequent at sea señor he said to those near him speaking loud enough nevertheless to be heard by most of the crew though seldom as treacherous as they have now proved to be all accustomed to the ocean have doubtless seen them often and as physical facts they must be taken as counting neither for nor against us as omens each person will consider them as he putteth his trust in god whose grace and mercy to us all is yet by a million of times unrequited and still would be were we to sing glory in excelsis from morn till night as long as breath lasted for the sacred office  still our hope was so very strong don christopher observed one of the gentlemen that we find the disappointment hard to be borne you speak of omens señor are there any physical signs of our being near the land of cathay  omens come of god if they come at all they are a species of miracles preceding natural events as real miracles surpass them i think this expedition cometh of god and i see no irreverence in supposing that this late appearance of land may have been heaped along the horizon for an encouraging sign to persevere and as a proof that our labors will be rewarded in the end i cannot say nevertheless that any but natural means were used for these deceptions are familiar to us mariners  i shall endeavor so to consider it señor almirante gravely returned the other and the conversation dropped  the nonappearance of the land which had been so confidently hoped for produced a deep gloom in the vessels notwithstanding again changing the joy of their people into despondency columbus continued to steer due west by compass or westbysouthsoutherly in reality until meridian when yielding to the burning wishes of those around him he again altered his course to the southwest this course was followed until the ships had gone far enough in that direction to leave no doubt that the people had been misled by clouds the preceding evening at night when not the faintest hope remained the vessels kept away due west again running in the course of the twentyfour hours quite thirtyone leagues which were recorded before the crew as twentyfour  for several succeeding days no material changes occurred the wind continued favorable though frequently so light as to urge the vessels very slowly ahead reducing the days progress sometimes to little more than fifty of our english miles the sea was calm and weeds were again met though in much smaller quantities than before september 29th or the fourth day after pinzon had called out land another frigatebird was seen and as it was the prevalent notion among seamen that this bird never flew far from the shore some faint hopes were momentarily revived by his passage two pelicans also appeared and the air was so soft and balmy that columbus declared nothing but nightingales were wanting to render the nights as delicious as those of andalusia  in this manner did birds come and go exciting hopes that were doomed to be disappointed sometimes flying in numbers that would seem to forbid the idea that they could be straying on the waste of waters without the certainty of their position again too the attention of the admiral and of the people was drawn to the variation of the needle all uniting in the opinion that the phenomenon was only to be explained by the movements of the star at length the first day of october arrived and the pilots of the admirals vessel seriously set to work to ascertain the distance they had come they had been misled as well as the rest by the management of columbus and they now approached the latter as he stood at his usual post on the poop in order to give the result of their calculations with countenances that were faithful indexes of the concern they felt  we are not less than five hundred and seventyeight leagues west of ferro señor almirante commenced one of the two a fearful distance to venture into the bosom of an unknown ocean  thou sayst true honest bartolemeo returned columbus calmly though the further we venture the greater will be the honor thy reckoning is even short of the truth since this of mine which is no secret from our people giveth even five hundred and eightyfour leagues fully six more than thine but after all this scarce equalleth a voyage from lisbon to guinea and we are not men to be outdone by the seamen of don john  ah señor almirante the portuguese have their islands by the way and the old world at their elbows while we should this earth prove not to be really a sphere are hourly sailing toward its verge and are running into untried dangers  go to bartolemeo thou talkest like a riverman who hath been blown outside his bar by a strong breeze from the land and who fancieth his risks greater than man ever yet endured because the water that wetteth his tongue is salt let the men see this reckoning fearlessly and strive to be of cheer lest we remember thy misgivings beneath the groves of cathay  the man is sorely beset with dread coolly observed luis as the pilots descended from the poop with a lingering step and a heavy heart even your six short leagues added to the weight on his spirit five hundred and seventyeight were frightful but five hundred and eightyfour became burdensome to his soul  what would he then have thought had he known the truth of which young count even thou art ignorant  i hope you do not distrust my nerves don christopher that this matter is kept a secret from me  i ought not i do believe señor de llera and yet one gets to be distrustful even of himself when weighty concerns hang by a thread hast thou any real idea of the length of the road we have come  not i by st iago señor it is enough for me that we are far from the doña mercedes and a league more or less counts but little should your theory be true and the earth prove to be round i have the consolation of knowing that we shall get back to spain in time even by chasing the sun  still thou hast some general notion of our true distance from ferro knowing that each day it is lessened before the people  to tell you the truth don christopher arithmetic and i have little feeling for each other for the life of me i never could tell the exact amount of my own revenues in figures though it might not be so difficult to come at their results in another sense if truth were said however i should think your five hundred and eighty leagues might fairly be set down at some six hundred and ten or twenty  add yet another hundred and thou wilt not be far from the fact we are at this moment seven hundred and seven leagues from ferro and fast drawing near to the meridian of cipango in another glorious week or ten days at most i shall begin seriously to expect to see the continent of asia  this is travelling faster than i had thought señor answered luis carelessly but journey on one of your followers will not complain though we circle the earth itself     chapter xxi      pronounce what sea what shore is this     the gulf the rock of salamis      byron   the adventurers had now been twentythree days out of sight of land all of which time with the exception of a few very immaterial changes in the wind and a day or two of calms they had been steadily advancing toward the west with a southern variation that ranged between a fourth of a point and a point and a quarter though the latter fact was unknown to them their hopes had been so often raised to be disappointed that a sort of settled gloom now began to prevail among the common men which was only relieved by irregular and uncertain cries of land as the clouds produced their usual deceptions in the horizon still their feelings were in that feverish state which admits of any sudden change and as the sea continued smooth as a river the air balmy and the skies most genial they were prevented from falling into despair sancho reasoned as usual among his fellows resisting ignorance and folly with impudence and dogmatism while luis unconsciously produced an effect on the spirits of his associates by his cheerfulness and confidence columbus himself remained calm dignified and reserved relying on the justice of his theories and continuing resolute to attain his object the wind remained fair as before and in the course of the night and day of the 2d of october the vessels sailed more than a hundred miles still further into that unknown and mysterious sea the weeds now drifted westerly which was a material change the currents previously setting in the main in an opposite direction the 3d proved even a still more favorable day the distance made reaching to fortyseven leagues the admiral now began to think seriously that he had passed the islands laid down in his chart and with the high resolution of one sustained by grand conceptions he decided to stand on west with the intention of reaching the shores of the indies at once the 4th was a better day than either the little fleet passing steadily ahead without deviating from its course until it had fairly made one hundred and eightynine miles much the greatest days work it had yet achieved this distance so formidable to men who began to count each hour and each league with uneasiness was reckoned to all on board but luis as only one hundred and thirtyeight miles  friday october 5th commenced even more favorably columbus finding his ship gliding though the waterthere being no sea to cause her to reel and staggerat the rate of about eight miles the hour which was almost as fast as she had ever been known to go and which would have caused this days work to exceed the last had not the wind failed in the night as it was however fiftyseven more leagues were placed between ferro and the position of the vessel a distance that was reduced to fortyfive with the crew the following day brought no material change providence appearing to urge them on at a speed that must soon solve the great problem which the admiral had been so long discussing with the learned it was already dark when the pinta came sheering down upon the quarter of the santa maria until she had got so near that her commander hailed without the aid of a trumpet  is señor don christopher at his post as usual hurriedly demanded pinzon speaking like one who felt he had matter of weight upon his mind i see persons on the poop but know not if his excellency be among them  what wouldst thou good martin alonzo answered the admiral i am here watching for the shores of cipango or cathay whichever god in his goodness may be pleased first to give us  i see so many reasons noble admiral for changing our course more to the south that i could not resist the desire to come down and say as much most of the late discoveries have been made in the southern latitudes and we might do well to get more southing  have we gained aught by changing our course in this direction thy heart seemeth bent on more southern climes worthy friend while to my feelings we are now in the very paradise of sweets land only excepted islands may lie south or even north of us but a continent must lie west why abandon a certainty for an uncertainty the greater for the less cipango or cathay for some pleasant spot fragrant with spices no doubt but without a name and which can never equal the glories of asia either as a discovery or as a conquest  i would señor i might prevail on you to steer more to the south  go to martin alonzo and forget thy cravings my heart is in the west and thither reason teacheth me to follow it first hear my orders and then go seek the niña that thy brother the worthy vicente yañez may obey them also should aught separate us in the night it shall be the duty of all to stand manfully toward the west striving to find our company for it would be a sad as well as a useless thing to be wandering alone in this unknown ocean  pinzon though evidently much displeased was fain to obey and after a short but a sharp and loud altercation with the admiral the commander of the pinta caused her to sheer toward the felucca to execute the order  martin alonzo beginneth to waver columbus observed to luis he is a bold and exceeding skilful mariner but steadiness of object is not his greatest quality he must be restrained from following the impulses of his weakness by the higher hand of authority cathaycathay is my aim  after midnight the wind increased and for two hours the caravels glanced through the smooth ocean at their greatest speed which equalled nine english miles the hour few now undressed except to change their clothes and columbus slumbered on the poop that night using an old sail for his couch luis was his companion and both were up and on the deck with the first appearance of dawn a common feeling seemed to exist among all that land was near and that a great discovery was about to be made an annuity of ten thousand maravedis had been promised by the sovereigns to him who should first descry land and every eye was on the gaze whenever opportunity permitted to gain the prize  as the light diffused itself downward toward the margin of the ocean in the western horizon all thought there was the appearance of land and sail was eagerly crowded on the different vessels in order to press forward as fast as possible that their respective crews might enjoy the earliest and the best chances of obtaining the first view in this respect circumstances singularly balanced the advantages and disadvantages between the competitors the niña was the fastest vessel in light airs and smooth water but she was also the smallest the pinta came next in general speed holding a middle place in size and beating her consorts with a fresh breeze while the santa maria the last in point of sailing had the highest masts and consequently swept the widest range of horizon  there is a good feeling uppermost today señor don christopher said luis as he stood at the admirals side watching the advance of the light and if eyes can do it we may hope for the discovery of land the late run hath awakened all our hopes and land we must have even if we raise it from the bottom of the ocean  yonder is pepe the dutiful husband of monica perched on our highest yard straining his eyes toward the west in the hope of gaining the reward said columbus smiling ten thousand maravedis yearly would in sooth be some atonement to carry back to the grieved mother and the deserted boy  martin alonzo is in earnest also señor see how he presseth forward in the pinta but vicente yañez hath the heels of him and is determined to make his salutations first to the great khan neglectful of the elder brothers rights  señorseñores shouted sancho from the spar on which he was seated as composedly as a modern lady would recline on her ottomanthe felucca is speaking in signals  this is true cried columbusvicente yañez showeth the colors of the queen and there goeth a lombarda to announce some great event  as these were the signals directed in the event that either vessel should discover land before her consorts little doubt was entertained that the leading caravel had at last really announced the final success of the expedition still the recent and grave disappointment was remembered and though all devoutly poured out their gratitude in mental offerings their lips were sealed until the result should show the truth every rag of canvas was set however and the vessels seemed to hasten their speed toward the west like birds tired with an unusual flight which make new efforts with their wearied wings as the prospect of alighting suddenly breaks on their keen vision and active instincts  hour passed after hour however and brought no confirmation of the blessed tidings the western horizon looked heavy and clouded throughout the morning it is true often deceiving even the most practised eyes but as the day advanced and the vessels had passed more than fifty miles further toward the west it became impossible to ascribe the hopes of the morning to another optical illusion the depression of spirits that succeeded this new disappointment was greater than any that had before existed and the murmurs that arose were neither equivocal nor suppressed it was urged that some malign influence was leading the adventurers on finally to abandon them to despair and destruction in a wilderness of waters this is the moment when it has been said columbus was compelled to make conditions with his followers stipulating to abandon the enterprise altogether should it fail of success in a given number of days but this weakness has been falsely ascribed to the great navigator who never lost the fullest exercise of his authority even in the darkest moments of doubt maintaining his purpose and asserting his power with the same steadiness and calmness in what some thought this distant verge of the earth as he had done in the rivers of spain prudence and policy at last dictated a change of course however which he was neither too obstinate nor too proud to submit to and he accordingly adopted it of his own accord  we are now quite a thousand leagues from ferro by my private reckoning friend luis said columbus to his young companion in one of their private conferences which took place after nightfall and it is really time to expect the continent of asia hitherto i have looked for naught but islands and not with much expectation of seeing even them though martin alonzo and the pilots have been so sanguine in their hopes the large flocks of birds however that have appeared today would seem to invite us to follow their flightsland out of doubt being their aim i shall accordingly change our course more to the south though not as far as pinzon desireth cathay being still my goal  columbus gave the necessary orders and the two other caravels were brought within hail of the santa maria when their commanders were directed to steer westsouthwest the reason for this change was the fact that so many birds had been seen flying in that direction the intention of the admiral was to pursue this course for two days notwithstanding this alteration no land was visible in the morning but as the wind was light and the vessels had only made five leagues since the course was changed the disappointment produced less despondency than usual in spite of their uncertainty all in the vessels now rioted in the balmy softness of the atmosphere which was found so fragrant that it was delicious to breathe it the weeds too became more plenty and many of them were as fresh as if torn from their native rocks only a day or two previously birds that unequivocally belonged to the land were also seen in considerable numbers one of which was actually taken while ducks abounded and another pelican was met thus passed the 8th of october the adventurers filled with hope though the vessels only increased their distance from europe some forty miles in the course of the twentyfour hours the succeeding day brought no other material change than a shift of wind which compelled the admiral to alter his course to westbynorth for a few hours this caused him some uneasiness for it was his wish to proceed due west or westsoutherly though it afforded considerable relief to many among his people who had been terrified by the prevalence of the winds in one direction had the variation still existed this would have been in fact steering the very course the admiral desired to go but by this time the vessels were in a latitude and longitude where the needle resumed its powers and became faithful to its direction in the course of the night the trades also resumed their influence and early on the morning of the 10th the vessels again headed toward the westsouthwest by compass which was in truth the real course or as near to it as might be  such was the state of things when the sun rose on the morning of the 10th october 1492 the wind had freshened and all three of the vessels were running free the whole day at a rate varying from five knots to nine the signs of the proximity of land had been so very numerous of late that at every league of ocean they passed over the adventurers had the strongest expectations of discovering it and nearly every eye in all three of the ships was kept constantly bent on the western horizon in the hope of its owners being the first to make the joyful announcement of its appearance the cry of land had been so frequent of late however that columbus caused it to be made known that he who again uttered it causelessly should lose the reward promised by the sovereigns even should he happen to be successful in the end this information induced more caution and not a tongue betrayed its masters eagerness on this allengrossing subject throughout the anxious and exciting days of the 8th 9th and 10th october but their progress in the course of the 10th exceeding that made in the course of both the other days the evening sky was watched with a vigilance even surpassing that which had attended any previous sunset this was the moment most favorable for examining the western horizon the receding light illuminating the whole watery expanse in that direction in a way to give up all its secrets to the eye  is that a hummock of land asked pepe of sancho in a low voice as they lay together on a yard watching the upper limb of the sun as it settled like a glimmering star beneath the margin of the ocean or is it some of this misguiding vapor that hath so often misled us of late  tis neither pepe returned the more cool and experienced sancho but a rise of the sea which is ever thus tossing itself upward on the margin of the ocean didst ever see a calm so profound that the water left a straight circle on the horizon nonothere is no land to be seen in the west tonight the ocean in that quarter looking as blank as if we stood on the western shore of ferro and gazed outward into the broad fields of the atlantic our noble admiral may have the truth of his side pepe but as yet he hath no other evidence of it than is to be found in his reasons  and dost thou too take sides against him sancho and say that he is a madman who is willing to lead others to destruction as well as himself so that he die an admiral in fact and a viceroy in fancy  i take sides against no man whose doblas take sides with me pepe for that would be quarrelling with the best friend that both the rich and poor can make which is gold don christopher is doubtless very learned and one thing hath he settled to my satisfaction even though neither he nor any of us ever see a single jewel of cathay or pluck a hair from the beard of the great khan and that is that this world is round had it been a plain all this water would not be placed at the outer side since it would clearly run off unless dammed up by land thou canst conceive that pepe  that do i it is reasonable and according to every mans experience monica thinketh the genoese a saint  harkee pepe thy monica is no doubt an uncommonly sensible woman else would she never have taken thee for a husband when she might have chosen among a dozen of thy fellows i once thought of the girl myself and might have told her so had she seen fit to call me a saint too which she did not seeing that she used a very different epithet but admitting the señor colon to be a saint he would be none the better admired for it inasmuch as i never yet met with a saint or even with a virgin that could understand the bearings and distances of a run as short as that from cadiz to barcelona  thou speakest irreverently sancho of virgins and saints seeing that they know every thing  ay every thing but that our lady of rabida does not know southeastandbysouthehalfsouthe from northwestandbynoathehalfnoathe i have tried her in this matter and i tell thee she is as ignorant of it as thy monica is ignorant of the manner in which the duchess of medina sidonia saluteth the noble duke her husband when he returneth from hawking  i dare say the duchess would not know either what to say were she in monicas place and were she called on to receive me as monica will be when we return from this great expedition if i have never hawked neither hath the duke ever sailed for twoandthirty days in a west course from ferro and this too without once seeing land  thou sayst true pepe nor hast thou ever yet done this and returned to palos but what meaneth all this movement on deck our people seem to be much moved by some feeling while i can swear it is not from having discovered cathay or from having seen the great khan shining like a carbuncle on his throne of diamonds  it is rather that they do not see him thus that the men are moved dost not hear angry and threatening words from the mouths of the troublesome ones  by san iago were i don christopher but i would deduct a dobla from the wages of each of the rascals and give the gold to such peaceable men as you and me pepe who are willing to starve to death ere we will go back without a sight of asia  tis something of this sort of a truth sancho let us descend that his excellency may see that he hath some friends among the crew  as sancho assented to this proposition he and pepe stood on the deck in the next minute here indeed the people were found in a more mutinous state than they had been since the fleet left spain the long continuation of fair winds and pleasant weather had given them so much reason to expect a speedy termination of their voyage that nearly the whole crew were now of opinion it was due to themselves to insist on the abandonment of an expedition that seemed destined to lead to nothing but destruction the discussion was loud and angry even one or two of the pilots inclining to think with their inferiors that further perseverance would certainly be useless and might be fatal when sancho and pepe joined the crowd it had just been determined to go in a body to columbus and to demand in terms that could not be misconceived the immediate return of the ships to spain in order that this might be done with method pedro alonzo niño one of the pilots and an aged seaman called juan martin were selected as spokesmen at this critical moment too the admiral and luis were seen descending from the poop with an intent to retire to their cabin when a rush was made aft by all on deck and twenty voices were heard simultaneously crying  señordon christopheryour excellencyseñor almirante  columbus stopped and faced the people with a calmness and dignity that caused the heart of niño to leap toward his mouth and which materially checked the ardor of most of his followers  what would ye demanded the admiral sternly speak ye address a friend  we come to ask our precious lives señor answered juan martin who thought his insignificance might prove a shieldnay what is more the means of putting bread into the mouths of our wives and children all here are weary of this profitless voyage and most think if it last any longer than shall be necessary to return it will be the means of our perishing of want  know ye the distance that lieth between us and ferro that ye come to me with this blind and foolish request speak niño i see that thou art also of their number notwithstanding thy hesitation  señor returned the pilot we are all of a mind to go further into this blank and unknown ocean is tempting god to destroy us for our wilfulness it is vain to suppose that this broad belt of water hath been placed by providence around the habitable earth for any other purpose than to rebuke those who audaciously seek to be admitted to mysteries beyond their understanding do not all the churchmen señorthe pious prior of santa maria de rabida your own particular friend includedtell us constantly of the necessity of submitting to a knowledge we can never equal and to believe without striving to lift a veil that covers incomprehensible things  i might retort on thee honest niño with thine own words answered columbus and bid thee confide in those whose knowledge thou canst never equal and to follow submissively where thou art totally unfitted to lead go to withdraw with thy fellows and let me hear no more of this  nay señor cried two or three in a breath we cannot perish without making our complaints heard we have followed too far already and even now may have gone beyond the means of a safe return let us then turn the heads of the caravels toward spain this night lest we never live to see that blessed country again  this toucheth on revolt who among ye dare use language so bold to your admiral  all of us señor answered twenty voices together men need be bold when their lives would be forfeited by silence  sancho art thou too of the party of these mutineers dost thou confess thy heart to be spainsick and thy unmanly fears to be stronger than thy hopes of imperishable glory and thy longings for the riches and pleasures of cathay  if i do señor don almirante set me to greasing masts and take me from the helm forever as one unfit to watch the whirlings of the north star sail with the caravels into the hall of the great khan and make fast to his throne and you will find sancho at his post whether it be at the helm or at the lead he was born in a shipyard and hath a natural desire to know what a ship can do  and thou pepe hast thou so forgotten thy duty as to come with this language to thy commander to the admiral and viceroy of thy sovereign the doña isabella  viceroy over what exclaimed a voice from the crowd without permitting pepe to answer a viceroy over seaweed and one that hath tunnyfish and whales and pelicans for subjects we tell you señor colon that this is no treatment for castilians who require more substantial discoveries than fields of weeds and islands of clouds  homehomespainspainpalospalos cried nearly all together sancho and pepe having quitted the throng and ranged themselves at the side of columbus we will no further west which is tempting god but demand to be carried back whence we came if indeed it be not already too late for so happy a deliverance  to whom speak ye in this shameless manner graceless knaves exclaimed luis unconsciously laying a hand where it had been his practice to carry a rapier get ye gone or  be tranquil friend pedro and leave this matter with me interrupted the admiral whose composure had scarce been deranged by the violent conduct of his subordinates listen to what i have to say ye rude and rebellious men and let it be received as my final answer to any and all such demands as ye have just dared to make this expedition hath been sent forth by the two sovereigns your royal master and mistress with the express design of crossing the entire breadth of the vast atlantic until it might reach the shores of india now let what will happen these high expectations shall not be disappointed but westward we sail until stopped by the land for this determination my life shall answer look to it that none of yours be endangered by resistance to the royal orders or by disrespect and disobedience to their appointed substitute for another murmur and i mark the man that uttereth it for signal punishment in this ye have my full determination and beware of encountering the anger of those whose displeasure may prove more fatal than these fancied dangers of the ocean  look at what ye have before you in the way of fear and then at what ye have before ye in the way of hope in the first case ye have every thing to dread from the sovereigns anger should ye proceed to a violent resistance of their authority or what is as bad something like a certainty of your being unable to reach spain for want of food and water should ye revolt against your lawful leaders and endeavor to return for this it is now too late the voyage east must as regards time be double that we have just made and the caravels are beginning to be lightened in their casks land and land in this region hath become necessary to us now look at the other side of the picture before ye lieth cathay with all its riches its novelties and its glories a region more wonderful than any that hath yet been inhabited by man and occupied by a race as gentle as they are hospitable and just to this must be added the approbation of the sovereigns and the credit that will belong to the meanest mariner that hath manfully stood by his commander in achieving so great an end  if we will obey three days longer señor will you then turn toward spain should no land be seen cried a voice from the crowd  never returned columbus firmly to india am i bound and for india will i steer though another month be needed to complete the journey go then to your posts or your hammocks and let me hear no more of this  there was so much natural dignity in the manner of columbus and when he spoke in anger his voice carried so much of rebuke with it that it exceeded the daring of ordinary men to presume to answer when he commanded silence the people sullenly dispersed therefore though the disaffection was by no means appeased had there been only a single vessel in the expedition it is quite probable that they would have proceeded to some act of violence but uncertain of the state of feeling in the pinta and the niña and holding martin alonzo pinzon in as much habitual respect as they stood in awe of columbus the boldest among them were for the present fain to give vent to their dissatisfaction in murmurs though they secretly meditated decided measures as soon as an opportunity for consultation and concert with the crews of the other vessels might offer  this looketh serious señor said luis as soon as he and the admiral were alone again in their little cabin and by st luke it might cool the ardor of these knaves did your excellency suffer me to cast two or three of the most insolent of the vagabonds into the sea  which is a favor that some among them have actually contemplated conferring upon thee and me answered columbus  sancho keepeth me well informed of the feeling among the people and it is now many days since he hath let me know this fact we will proceed peaceably if possible señor gutierrez or de muños whichever name thou most affectest as long as we can but should there truly arise an occasion to resort to force thou wilt find that christofero colombo knoweth how to wield a sword as well as he knoweth how to use his instruments of science  how far do you really think us from land señor almirante i ask from curiosity and not from dread for though the ship floated on the very verge of the earth ready to fall off into vacuum you should hear no murmur from me  i am well assured of this young noble returned columbus affectionately squeezing the hand of luis else wouldst thou not be here i make our distance from ferro exceed a thousand marine leagues this is about the same as that at which i have supposed cathay to lie from europe and it is out of question sufficiently far to meet with many of the islands that are known to abound in the seas of asia the public reckoning maketh the distance a little more than eight hundred leagues but in consequence of the favorable currents of which we have lately had so much i doubt if we are not fully eleven hundred from the canaries at this moment if not even further we are doubtless a trifle nearer to the azores which are situated further west though in a higher latitude  then you think señor that we may really expect land ere many days  so certain do i feel of this luis that i should have little apprehension of complying with the terms of these audacious men but for the humiliation ptolemy divided the earth into twentyfour hours of fifteen degrees each and i place but some five or six of these hours in the atlantic thirteen hundred leagues i feel persuaded will bring us to the shores of asia and eleven of these thirteen hundred leagues do i believe we have come  tomorrow may then prove an eventful day señor almirante and now to our cots where i shall dream of a fairer land than christian eye ever yet looked upon with the fairest maiden of spainnay by san pedro of europebeckoning me on  columbus and luis now sought their rest in the morning it was evident by the surly looks of the people that feelings like a suppressed volcano were burning in their bosoms and that any untoward accident might produce an eruption fortunately however signs of a nature so novel soon appeared as to draw off the attention of the most disaffected from their melancholy broodings the wind was fresh as usual fair and what was really a novelty since quitting ferro the sea had got up and the vessels were riding over waves which removed that appearance of an unnatural calm that had hitherto alarmed the men with its long continuance columbus had not been on deck five minutes when a joyful cry from pepe drew all eyes toward the yard on which he was at work the seaman was pointing eagerly at some object in the water and rushing to the side of the vessel all saw the welcome sign that had caught his gaze as the ship lifted on a sea and shot ahead a rush of a bright fresh green was passed and the men gave a loud shout for all well knew that this plant certainly came from some shore and that it could not have been long torn from the spot of its growth  this is truly a blessed omen said columbus rushes cannot grow without the light of heaven whatever may be the case with weeds  this little occurrence changed or at least checked the feelings of the disaffected hope once more resumed its sway and all who could ascended the rigging to watch the western horizon the rapid motion of the vessels too added to this buoyancy of feeling the pinta and niña passing and repassing the admiral as it might be in pure wantonness a few hours later fresh weeds were met and about noon sancho announced confidently that he had seen a fish which is known to live in the vicinity of rocks an hour later the niña came sheering up toward the admiral with her commander in the rigging evidently desirous of communicating some tidings of moment  what now good vicente yañez called out columbus thou seemest the messenger of welcome news  i think myself such don christopher answered the other we have just passed a bush bearing roseberries quite newly torn from the tree this is a sign that cannot deceive us  thou sayst true my friend to the westto the west happy will he be whose eyes first behold the wonders of the indies  it would not be easy to describe the degree of hope and exultation that now began to show itself among the people goodnatured jests flew about the decks and the laugh was easily raised where so lately all had been despondency and gloom the minutes flew swiftly by and every man had ceased to think of spain bending his thoughts again on the as yet unseen west  a little later a cry of exultation was heard from the pinta which was a short distance to windward and ahead of the admiral as this vessel shortened sail and hoveto lowering a boat and then immediately kept away the santa maria soon came foaming up under her quarter and spoke her  what now martin alonzo asked columbus suppressing his anxiety in an appearance of calmness and dignity thou and thy people seem in an ecstasy  well may we be so about an hour since we passed a piece of the caneplant of the sort of which sugar is made in the east as travellers say and such as we often see in our own ports but this is a trifling symptom of land compared to the trunk of a tree that we have also passed as if providence had not yet dealt with us with sufficient kindness all these articles were met floating near each other and we have thought them of sufficient value to lower a boat that we might possess them  lay thy sails to the mast good martin alonzo and send thy prizes hither that i may judge of their value  pinzon complied and the santa maria being hoveto at the same time the boat soon touched her side martin alonzo made but one bound from the thwart to the gunwale of the ship and was soon on the deck of the admiral here he eagerly displayed the different articles that his men tossed after him all of which had been taken out of the sea not an hour before  see noble señores said martin alonzo almost breathless with haste to display his treasuresthis is a sort of board though of unknown wood and fashioned with exceeding care here is also another piece of cane this is a plant that surely cometh from the land and most of all this is a walkingstick fashioned by the hand of man and that too with exceeding care  all this is true said columbus examining the different articles one by one god in his might and power be praised for these comfortable evidences of our near approach to a new world none but a malignant infidel can now doubt of our final success  these things have questionless come from some boat that hath been upset which will account for their being so near each other in the water said martin alonzo willing to sustain his physical proofs by a plausible theory it would not be wonderful were drowned bodies near  let us hope not martin alonzo answered the admiral let us fancy naught so melancholy a thousand accidents may have thrown these articles together into the sea and once there they would float in company for a twelvemonth unless violently separated but come they whence they may to us they are infallible proofs that not only land is near but land which is the abidingplace of men  it is not easy to describe the enthusiasm that now prevailed in all the vessels hitherto they had met with only birds and fishes and weeds signs that are often precarious but here was such proof of their being in the neighborhood of their fellowcreatures as it was not easy to withstand it was true articles of this nature might drift in time even across the vast distance they had come but it was not probable that they would drift so far in company then the berries were fresh the board was of an unknown wood and the walkingstick in particular if such indeed was its use was carved in a manner that was never practised in europe the different articles passed from hand to hand until all in the ship had examined them and every thing like doubt vanished before this unlookedfor confirmation of the admirals predictions pinzon returned to his vessel sail was again made and the fleet continued to steer to the westsouthwest until the hour of sunset  something like a chill of disappointment again came over the more fainthearted of the people however as they once more or for the thirtyfourth time since quitting gomera saw the sun sink behind a watery horizon more than a hundred vigilant eyes watched the glowing margin of the ocean at this interesting moment and though the heavens were cloudless naught was visible but the gloriously tinted vault and the outline of water broken into the usual ragged forms of the unquiet element  the wind freshened as evening closed and columbus having called his vessels together as was usual with him at that hour he issued new orders concerning the course for the last two or three days they had been steering materially to the southward of west and columbus who felt persuaded that his most certain and his nearest direction from land to land was to traverse the ocean if possible on a single parallel of latitude was anxious to resume his favorite course which was what he fancied to be due west just as night drew around the mariners accordingly the ships edged away to the required course and ran off at the rate of nine miles the hour following the orb of day as if resolute to penetrate into the mysteries of his nightly retreat until some great discovery should reward the effort  immediately after this change in the course the people sang the vesper hymn as usual which in that mild sea they often deferred until the hour when the watch below sought their hammocks that night however none felt disposed to sleep and it was late when the chant of the seamen commenced with the words of salve fac regina it was a solemn thing to hear the songs of religious praise mingling with the sighings of the breeze and the wash of the waters in that ocean solitude and the solemnity was increased by the expectations of the adventurers and the mysteries that lay behind the curtain they believed themselves about to raise never before had this hymn sounded so sweetly in the ears of columbus and luis found his eyes suffusing with tears as he recalled the soft thrilling notes of mercedes voice in her holy breathings of praise at this hour when the office ended the admiral called the crew to the quarterdeck and addressed them earnestly from his station on the poop  i rejoice my friends he said that you have had the grace to chant the vesper hymn in so devout a spirit at a moment when there is so much reason to be grateful to god for his goodness to us throughout this voyage look back at the past and see if one of you the oldest sailor of your number can recall any passage at sea i will not say of equal length for that no one here hath ever before made but any equal number of days at sea in which the winds have been as fair the weather as propitious or the ocean as calm as on this occasion then what cheering signs have encouraged us to persevere god is in the midst of the ocean my friends as well as in his sanctuaries of the land step by step as it were hath he led us on now filling the air with birds now causing the sea to abound with unusual fishes and then spreading before us fields of plants such as are seldom met far from the rocks where they grew the last and best of his signs hath he given us this day my own calculations are in unison with these proofs and i deem it probable that we reach the land this very night in a few hours or when we shall have run the distance commanded by the eye as the light left us i shall deem it prudent to shorten sail and i call on all of you to be watchful lest we unwittingly throw ourselves on the strange shores ye know that the sovereigns have graciously promised ten thousand maravedis yearly and for life to him who shall first discover land to this rich reward i will add a doublet of velvet such as it would befit a grandee to wear sleep not then but at the turn of the night be all vigilance and watchfulness i am now most serious with ye and look for land this very blessed night  these encouraging words produced their full effect the men scattering themselves in the ship each taking the best position he could to earn the coveted prizes deep expectation is always a quiet feeling the jealous senses seeming to require silence and intensity of concentration in order to give them their full exercise columbus remained on the poop while luis less interested threw himself on a sail and passed the time in musing on mercedes and in picturing to himself the joyful moment when he might meet her again a triumphant and successful adventurer  the deathlike silence that prevailed in the ship added to the absorbing interest of that important night at the distance of a mile was the little niña gliding on her course with a full sail while half a league still further in advance was to be seen the shadowy outline of the pinta which preceded her consorts as the swiftest sailer with a fresh breeze sancho had been round to every sheet and brace in person and never before had the admirals ship held as good way with her consorts as on that night all three of the vessels appearing to have caught the eager spirit of those they contained and to be anxious to outdo themselves at moments the men started while the wind murmured through the cordage as if they heard unknown and strange voices from a mysterious world and fifty times when the waves combed upon the sides of the ship did they turn their heads expecting to see a crowd of unknown beings fresh from the eastern world pouring in upon their decks  as for columbus he sighed often for minutes at a time would he stand looking intently toward the west like one who strove to penetrate the gloom of night with organs exceeding human powers at length he bent his body forward gazed intently over the weather railing of the ship and then lifting his cap he seemed to be offering up his spirit in thanksgiving or prayer all this luis witnessed where he lay at the next instant he heard himself called  pero gutierrezpedro de muñosluiswhatever thou art termed said columbus his fine masculine voice trembling with eagernesscome hither son tell me if thine eyes accord with mine look in this directionhere more on the vessels beam seest thou aught uncommon  i saw a light señor one that resembled a candle being neither larger nor more brilliant and to me it appeared to move as if carried in the hand or tossed by waves  thy eyes did not deceive thee thou seest it doth not come of either of our consorts both of which are here on the bow  what do you then take this light to signify don christopher  land it is either on the land itself rendered small by distance or it cometh of some vessel that is a stranger to us and which belongeth to the indies there is rodrigo sanchez of segovia the comptroller of the fleet beneath us descend and bid him come hither  luis did as required and presently the comptroller was also at the admirals side half an hour passed and the light was not seen again then it gleamed upward once or twice like a torch and finally disappeared this circumstance was soon known to all in the ship though few attached the same importance to it as columbus himself  this is land quietly observed the admiral to those near his person ere many hours we may expect to behold it now ye may pour out your souls in gratitude and confidence for in such a sign there can be no deception no phenomenon of the ocean resembleth that light and my reckoning placeth us in a quarter of the world where land must exist else is the earth no sphere  notwithstanding this great confidence on the part of the admiral most of those in the ship did not yet feel the same certainty in the result although all felt the strongest hopes of falling in with land next day columbus saying no more on the subject the former silence was soon resumed and in a few minutes every eye was again turned toward the west in anxious watchfulness in this manner the time passed away the ships driving ahead with a speed much exceeding that of their ordinary rate of sailing until the night had turned when its darkness was suddenly illuminated by a blaze of light and the report of a gun from the pinta came struggling up against the fresh breeze of the trades  there speaketh martin alonzo exclaimed the admiral and we may be certain that he hath not given the signal idly who sitteth on the topgallant yard there on watch for wonders ahead  señor don almirante it is i answered sancho i have been here since we sang the vesper hymn  seest thou aught unusual westward look vigilantly for we touch on mighty things  naught señor unless it be that the pinta is lessening her canvas and the niña is already closing with our fleet consortnay i now see the latter shortening sail also  for these great tidings all honor and praise be to god these are proofs that no false cry hath this time misled their judgments we will join our consorts good bartolemeo ere we take in a single inch of canvas  every thing was now in motion on board the santa maria which went dashing ahead for another half hour when she came up with the two other caravels both of which had hauled by the wind under short canvas and were forging slowly through the water on different tacks like coursers cooling themselves after having terminated a severe struggle by reaching the goal  come hither luis said columbus and feast thine eyes with a sight that doth not often meet the gaze of the best of christians  the night was far from dark a tropical sky glittering with a thousand stars and even the ocean itself appearing to emit a sombre melancholy light by the aid of such assistants it was possible to see several miles and more especially to note objects on the margin of the ocean when the young man cast his eyes to leeward as directed by columbus he very plainly perceived a point where the blue of the sky ceased and a dark mound rose from the water stretching for a few leagues southward and then terminated as it had commenced by a union between the watery margin of the ocean and the void of heaven the intermediate space had the defined outline the density and the hue of land as seen at midnight  behold the indies said columbus the mighty problem is solved this is doubtless an island but a continent is near laud be to god     chapter xxii      there is a power whose care       teaches thy way along that pathless coast     the desert and illimitable air       lone wandering but not lost      bryant   the two or three hours that succeeded were hours of an extraordinary and intense interest the three vessels stood hovering off the dusky shore barely keeping at a safe distance stripped of most of their canvas resembling craft that cruised leisurely at a given point indifferent to haste or speed as they occasionally and slowly passed each other words of heartfelt congratulation were exchanged but no noisy or intemperate exultation was heard on that allimportant night the sensations excited in the adventurers by their success were too deep and solemn for any such vulgar exhibition of joy and perhaps there was not one among them all who did not at that moment inwardly confess his profound submission to and absolute dependence on a divine providence  columbus was silent emotions like his seldom find vent in words but his heart was overflowing with gratitude and love he believed himself to be in the further east and to have reached that part of the world by sailing west and it is natural to suppose that he expected the curtain of day would rise on some of those scenes of oriental magnificence which had been so eloquently described by the polos and other travellers in those remote and littleknown regions that this or other islands were inhabited the little he had seen sufficiently proved but as yet all the rest was conjecture of the wildest and most uncertain character the fragrance of the land however was very perceptible in the vessels thus affording an opportunity to two of the senses to unite in establishing their success  at length the long wishedfor day approached and the eastern sky began to assume the tints that precede the appearance of the sun as the light diffused itself athwart the dark blue ocean and reached the island the outlines of the latter became more and more distinct then objects became visible on its surface trees glades rocks and irregularities starting out of the gloom until the whole picture was drawn in the gray solemn colors of morning presently the direct rays of the sun touched it gilding its prominent points and throwing others into shadow it then became apparent that the discovery was that of an island of no great extent well wooded and of a verdant and pleasant aspect the land was low but possessed an outline sufficiently graceful to cause it to seem a paradise in the eyes of men who had seriously doubted whether they were ever to look on solid ground again the view of his mother earth is always pleasant to the mariner who has long gazed on nothing but water and sky but thrice beautiful did it now seem to men who not only saw in it their despair cured but their most brilliant hopes revived from the position of the land near him columbus did not doubt that he had passed another island on which the light had been seen and from his known course this conjecture has since been rendered almost certain  the sun had scarcely risen when living beings were seen rushing out of the woods to gaze in astonishment at the sudden appearance of machines that were at first mistaken by the untutored islanders for messengers from heaven shortly after columbus anchored his little fleet and landed to take possession in the name of the two sovereigns  as much state was observed on this occasion as the limited means of the adventurers would allow each vessel sent a boat with her commander the admiral attired in scarlet and carrying the royal standard proceeded in advance while martin alonzo and vicente yañez pinzon followed holding banners bearing crosses the symbol of the expedition with letters representing the initials of the two sovereigns or f and y for fernando and ysabel  the forms usual to such occasions were observed on reaching the shore columbus took possession rendered thanks to god for the success of the expedition and then began to look about him in order to form some estimate of the value of his discovery3  footnote 3 it is a singular fact that the position and name of the precise island that was first fallen in with on this celebrated voyage remain to this day if not a matter of doubt at least a matter of discussion by most persons some of the best authorities included it is believed that the adventurers made cat island as the place is now called though the admiral gave it the appellation of san salvador while others contend for what is now termed turks island the reason given for the latter opinion is the position of the island and the course subsequently steered in order to reach cuba muñoz is of opinion that it was watlings island which lies due east of cat island at the distance of a degree of longitude or a few hours run as respects turks island the facts do not sustain the theory the course steered after quitting the island was not west but southwest and we find columbus anxious to get south to reach the island of cuba which was described to him by the natives and which he believed to be cipango no reason is given by muñoz for his opinion but watlings island does not answer the description of the great navigator while it is so placed as to have lain quite near his course and was doubtless passed unseen in the darkness it is thought the light so often observed by columbus was on this island  no sooner were the ceremonies observed than the people crowded round the admiral and began to pour out their congratulations for his success with their contrition for their own distrust and disaffection the scene has often been described as a proof of the waywardness and inconstancy of human judgments the being who had so lately been scowled on as a reckless and selfish adventurer being now regarded as little less than a god the admiral was no more elated by this adulation than he had been intimidated by the previous dissatisfaction maintaining his calmness of exterior and gravity of demeanor with those who pressed around him though a close observer might have detected the gleaming of triumph in his eye and the glow of inward rapture on his cheek  these honest people are as inconstant in their apprehensions as they are extreme in their rejoicings said columbus to luis when liberated a little from the throng yesterday they would have cast me into the sea and today they are much disposed to forget god himself in his unworthy creature dost not see that the men who gave us most concern on account of their discontent are now the loudest in their applause  this is but nature señor fear flying from panic to exultation these knaves fancy they are praising you when they are in truth rejoicing in their own escape from some unknown but dreaded evil our friends sancho and pepe seem not to be thus overwhelmed for while the last is gathering flowers from this shore of india the first seems to be looking about him with commendable coolness as if he might be calculating the latitude and longitude of the great khans doblas  columbus smiled and accompanied by luis he drew nearer to the two men mentioned who were a little apart from the rest of the group sancho was standing with his hands thrust into the bosom of his doublet regarding the scene with the coolness of a philosopher and toward him the admiral first directed his steps  how is this sancho of the shipyardgate said the great navigator thou lookest on this glorious scene as coolly as thou wouldst regard a street in moguer or a field in andalusia  señor don almirante the same hand made both this is not the first island on which i have landed nor are yonder naked savages the first men i have seen who were not dressed in scarlet doublets  but hast thou no feeling for successno gratitude to god for this vast discovery reflect my friend we are on the confines of asia and yet have we come here by holding a western course  that the last is true señor i will swear myself having held the tiller in mine own hands no small part of the way do you think señor don almirante that we have come far enough in this direction to have got to the back side of the earth or to stand as it might be under the very feet of spain  by no means the realms of the great khan will scarcely occupy the position you mean  then señor what will there be to prevent the doblas of that country from falling off into the air leaving us our journey for our pains  the same power that will prevent our caravels from dropping out of the sea and the water itself from following these things depend on natural laws my friend and nature is a legislator that will be respected  it is all moorish to me returned sancho rubbing his eyebrows here we are of a verity if not actually beneath the feet of spain standing as it might be on the side of the house and yet i find no more difficulty in keeping on an even keel than i did in moguerby santa clara less in some particulars good solid xeres wine being far less plenty here than there  thou art no moor sancho although thy fathers name be a secret and thou pepe what dost thou find in those flowers to draw thy attention so early from all these wonders  señor i gather them for monica a female hath a more delicate feeling than a man and she will be glad to see with what sort of ornaments god hath adorned the indies  dost thou fancy pepe that thy love can keep those flowers in bloom until the good caravel shall recross the atlantic demanded luis laughing  who knoweth señor gutierrez a warm heart maketh a thriving nursery you would do well too if you prefer any castilian lady to all others to bethink you of her beauty and gather some of these rare plants to deck her hair  columbus now turned away the natives seeming disposed to approach the strangers while luis remained near the young sailor who still continued to collect the plants of the tropics in a minute our hero was similarly employed and long ere the admiral and the wondering islanders had commenced their first parley he had arranged a gorgeous bouquet which he already fancied in the glossy dark hair of mercedes  the events of a public nature that followed are too familiar to every intelligent reader to need repetition here after passing a short time at san salvador columbus proceeded to other islands led on by curiosity and guided by real or fancied reports of the natives until the 28th when he reached that of cuba here he imagined for a time that he had found the continent and he continued coasting it first in a northwesterly and then in a southeasterly direction for near a month familiarity with the novel scenes that offered soon lessened their influence and the inbred feelings of avarice and ambition began to resume their sway in the bosoms of several of those who had been foremost in manifesting their submission to the admiral when the discovery of land so triumphantly proved the justice of his theories and the weakness of their own misgivings among others who thus came under the influence of their nature was martin alonzo pinzon who finding himself almost entirely excluded from the society of the young count of llera in whose eyes he perceived he filled but a very subordinate place fell back on his own local importance and began to envy columbus a glory that he now fancied he might have secured for himself hot words had passed between the admiral and himself on more than one occasion before the land was made and every day something new occurred to increase the coldness between them  it forms no part of this work to dwell on the events that followed as the adventurers proceeded from island to island port to port and river to river it was soon apparent that very important discoveries had been made and the adventurers were led on day by day pursuing their investigations and following directions that were ill comprehended but which it was fancied pointed to mines of gold everywhere they met with a gorgeous and bountiful nature scenery that fascinated the eye and a climate that soothed the senses but as yet man was found living in the simplest condition of the savage state the delusion of being in the indies was general and every intimation that fell from those untutored beings whether by word or sign was supposed to have some reference to the riches of the east all believed that if not absolutely within the kingdom of the great khan they were at least on its confines under such circumstances when each day actually produced new scenes promising still greater novelties few bethought them of spain unless it were in connection with the glory of returning to her successful and triumphant even luis dwelt less intently in his thoughts on mercedes suffering her image beautiful as it was to be momentarily supplanted by the unusual spectacles that arose before his physical sight in such constant and unwearied succession little substantial beyond the fertile soil and genial climate offered it is true in the way of realizing all the bright expectations of the adventurers in connection with pecuniary advantages but each moment was fraught with hope and no one knew what a day would bring forth  two agents were at length sent into the interior to make discoveries and columbus profited by the occasion to careen his vessels about the time this mission was expected to return luis sallied forth with a party of armed men to meet it sancho making one of his escort the ambassadors were met on their way back at a short days march from the vessels accompanied by a few of the natives who were following with intense curiosity expecting at each moment to see their unknown visitors take their flight toward heaven a short halt was made for the purpose of refreshing themselves after the two parties had joined and sancho as reckless of danger on the land as on the ocean stalked into a village that lay near the halting place here he endeavored to make himself as agreeable to the inhabitants as one of his appearance very well could by means of signs sancho figured in this little hamlet under some such advantages as those that are enjoyed in the country by a great man from town the spectators not being as yet sufficiently sophisticated to distinguish between the cut of a doublet and the manner of wearing it as between a clown and a noble he had not been many minutes playing the grandee among these simple beings when they seemed desirous of offering to him some mark of particular distinction presently a man appeared holding certain darklooking and dried leaves which he held out to the hero of the moment in a deferential manner as a turk would offer his dried sweetmeats or an american his cake sancho was about to accept the present though he would greatly have preferred a dobla of which he had not seen any since the last received from the admiral when a forward movement was made by most of the cubans who humbly and with emphasis uttered the word tobaccotobacco on this hint the person who held forth the offering drew back repeated the same word in an apologizing manner and set about making what it was now plain was termed a tobacco in the language of that country this was soon effected by rolling up the leaves in the form of a rude segar when a tobacco duly manufactured was offered to the seaman sancho took the present nodded his head condescendingly repeated the words himself in the best manner he could and thrust the tobacco into his pocket this movement evidently excited some surprise among the spectators but after a little consultation one of them lighted an end of a roll applied the other to his mouth and began to puff forth volumes of a fragrant light smoke not only to his own infinite satisfaction but seemingly to that of all around him sancho attempted an imitation which resulted as is common with the tyro in this accomplishment in his reeling back to his party with the pallid countenance of an opiumchewer and a nausea that he had not experienced since the day he first ventured beyond the bar of saltes to issue on the troubled surface of the atlantic  this little scene might be termed the introduction of the wellknown american weed into civilized society the misapprehension of the spaniards touching the appellation transferring the name of the roll to the plant itself thus did sancho of the shipyardgate become the first christian tobacco smoker an accomplishment in which he was so soon afterward rivalled by some of the greatest men of his age and which has extended down to our own times  on the return of his agents columbus again sailed pushing his way along the north shore of cuba while struggling against the trades with a view to get to the eastward he found the wind too fresh and determined to bear up for a favorite haven in the island of cuba that he had named puerto del principe with this view a signal was made to call the pinta down that vessel being far to windward and as night was near lights were carried in order to enable martin alonzo to close with his commander the next morning at the dawn of day when columbus came on deck he cast a glance around him and beheld the niña hoveto under his lee but no signs of the other caravel  have none seen the pinta demanded the admiral hastily of sancho who stood at the helm  señor i did as long as eyes could see a vessel that was striving to get out of view master martin alonzo hath disappeared in the eastern board while we have been lyingto here in waiting for him to come down  columbus now perceived that he was deserted by the very man who had once shown so much zeal in his behalf and who had given in the act new proof of the manner in which friendship vanishes before selfinterest and cupidity there had been among the adventurers many reports of the existence of gold mines obtained from the descriptions of the natives and the admiral made no doubt that his insubordinate follower had profited by the superior sailing of his caravel to keep the wind in the expectation to be the first to reach the eldorado of their wishes as the weather still continued unfavorable however the santa maria and the niña returned to port where they waited for a change this separation occurred on the 21st of november at which moment the expedition had not advanced beyond the north coast of cuba  from this time until the sixth of the following month columbus continued his examination of this noble island when he crossed what has since been termed the windward passage and first touched on the shores of hayti all this time there had been as much communication as circumstances would allow with the aborigines the spaniards making friends wherever they went as a consequence of the humane and prudent measures of the admiral it is true that violence had been done in a few instances by seizing half a dozen individuals in order to carry them to spain as offerings to doña isabella but this act was easily reconcilable to usage in that age equally on account of the deference that was paid to the kingly authority and on the ground that the seizures were for the good of the captives souls  the adventurers were more delighted with the bold and yet winning aspect of hayti than they had been with even the adjacent island of cuba the inhabitants were found to be handsomer and more civilized than any they had yet seen while they retained the gentleness and docility that had proved so pleasing to the admiral gold also was seen among them in considerable quantities and the spaniards set on foot a trade of some extent in which the usual incentive of civilized man was the great aim of one side and hawksbells appear to have been the principal desideratum with the other  in this manner and in making hazardous advances along the coast the admiral was occupied until the 20th of the month when he reached a point that was said to be in the vicinity of the residence of the great cacique of all that portion of the island this prince whose name as spelt by the spaniards was guacanagari had many tributary caciques and was understood from the halfintelligible descriptions of his subjects to be a monarch that was much beloved on the 22d while still lying in the bay of acúl where the vessels had anchored two days previously a large canoe was seen entering the haven it was shortly after announced to the admiral that this boat contained an ambassador from the great cacique who brought presents from his master with a request that the vessels would move a league or two further east and anchor off the town inhabited by the prince himself the wind preventing an immediate compliance a messenger was despatched with a suitable answer and the ambassador returned fatigued with idleness anxious to see more of the interior and impelled by a constitutional love of adventure luis who had struck up a hasty friendship with a young man called mattinao who attended the ambassador asked permission to accompany him taking his passage in the canoe columbus gave his consent to this proposal with a good deal of reluctance the rank and importance of our hero inducing him to avoid the consequences of any treachery or accident the importunity of luis finally prevailed however and he departed with many injunctions to be discreet being frequently admonished of the censure that would await the admiral in the event of any thing serious occurring as a precaution too sancho mundo was directed to accompany the young man in this chivalrous adventure in the capacity of an esquire  no weapon more formidable than a blunt arrow having yet been seen in the hands of the natives the young count de llera declined taking his mail going armed only with a trusty sword the temper of which had been tried on many a moorish corslet and helm in his foot encounters and protected by a light buckler an arquebuse had been put into his hand but he refused it as a weapon unsuited to knightly hands and as betraying a distrust that was not merited by the previous conduct of the natives sancho however was less scrupulous and accepted the weapon in order moreover to divert the attention of his followers from a concession that the admiral felt to be a departure from his own rigid laws luis and his companions landed and entered the canoe at a point concealed from the vessels in order that their absence might not be known it is owing to these circumstances as well as to the general mystery that was thrown about the connection of the young grandee with the expedition that the occurrences we are about to relate were never entered by the admiral in his journal and have consequently escaped the prying eyes of the various historians who have subsequently collected so much from that pregnant document     chapter xxiii      thou seemest to fancys eye       an animated blossom born in air     which breathes and bourgeons in the golden sky       and sheds its odors there      sutermeister   notwithstanding his native resolution and an indifference to danger that amounted to recklessness luis did not find himself alone with the haytians without at least a lively consciousness of the novelty of his situation still nothing occurred to excite uneasiness and he continued his imperfect communications with his new friends occasionally throwing in a remark to sancho in spanish who merely wanted encouragement to discourse by the hour instead of following the boat of the santa maria on board which the ambassador had embarked the canoe pushed on several leagues further east it being understood that luis was not to present himself in the town of guacanagari until after the arrival of the ships when he was to rejoin his comrades stealthily or in a way not to attract attention  our hero would not have been a true lover had he remained indifferent to the glories of the natural scenery that lay spread before his eyes as he thus coasted the shores of española the boldness of the landscape as in the mediterranean was relieved by the softness of a low latitude which throws some such witchery around rocks and promontories as a sunny smile lends to female beauty more than once did he burst out into exclamations of delight and as often did sancho respond in the same temper if not exactly in the same language the latter conceiving it to be a sort of duty to echo all that the young noble said in the way of poetry  i take it señor conde observed the seaman when they had reached a spot several leagues beyond that where the launch of the ship had put to shore i take it for granted señor conde that your excellency knoweth whither these naked gentry are paddling all this time they seem in a hurry and have a port in their minds if it be not in view  art thou uneasy friend sancho that thou puttest thy question thus earnestly  if i am don luis it is altogether on account of the family of bobadilla which would lose its head did any mishap befall your excellency what is it to sancho of the shipyardgate whether he is married to some princess in cipango and gets to be adopted by the great khan or whether he is an indifferent mariner out of moguer it is very much as if one should offer him the choice between wearing a doublet and eating garlic and going naked on sweet fruits and a full stomach i take it señor your excellency would not willingly exchange the castle of llera for the palace of this great cacique  thou art right sancho even rank must depend on the state of society in which we live a castilian noble cannot envy a haytian sovereign  more especially since my lord the señor don almirante hath publicly proclaimed that our gracious lady the doña isabella is henceforth and forever to be queen over him returned sancho with a knowing glance of the eye little do these worthy people understand the honor that is in store for them and least of all his highness king guacanagari  hush sancho and keep thy unpleasant intimations in thine own breast our friends turn the head of the canoe toward yonder rivers mouth and seem bent on landing  by this time indeed the natives had coasted as far as they intended and were turning in toward the entrance of a small stream which taking its rise among the noble mountains that were grouped inland found its way through a smiling valley to the ocean this stream was neither broad nor deep but it contained far more than water sufficient for any craft used by the natives its banks were fringed with bushes and as they glided up it luis saw fifty sites where he thought he could be content to pass his life provided always that it might possess the advantage of mercedes presence it is scarcely necessary to add too that in all these scenes he fancied his mistress attired in the velvets and laces that were then so much used by highborn dames and that he saw her natural grace embellished by the courtly ease and polished accessories of one who lived daily if not hourly in the presence of her royal mistress  as the canoe shut in the coast by entering between the two points that formed the rivers mouth sancho pointed out to the young noble a small fleet of canoes that was coming down before the wind from the eastward apparently bound like so many more they had seen that day to the bay of acúl on a visit to the wonderful strangers the natives in the canoe also beheld this little flotilla which was driving before the wind under cotton sails and by their smiles and signs showed that they gave it the same destination about this time too or just as they entered the mouth of the stream mattinao drew from under a light cotton robe that he occasionally wore a thin circlet of pure gold which he placed upon his head in the manner of a coronet this luis knew was a token that he was a cacique one of those who were tributary to guacanagari and he arose to salute him at this evidence of his rank an act that was imitated by all of the haytians also from this assumption of state luis rightly imagined that mattinao had now entered within the limits of a territory that acknowledged his will from the moment that the young cacique threw aside his incognito he ceased to paddle but assuming an air of authority and dignity he attempted to converse with his guest in the best manner their imperfect means of communication would allow he often pronounced the word ozema and luis inferred from the manner in which he used it that it was the name of a favorite wife it having been already ascertained by the spaniards or at least it was thought to be ascertained that the caciques indulged in polygamy while they rigidly restricted their subjects to one wife  the canoe ascended the river several miles until it reached one of those tropical valleys in which nature seems to expend her means of rendering this earth inviting while the scenery had much of the freedom of a wilderness the presence of man for centuries had deprived it of all its ruder and more savage features like those who tenanted it the spot possessed the perfection of native grace unfettered and uninvaded by any of the more elaborate devices of human expedients the dwellings were not without beauty though simple as the wants of their owners the flowers bloomed in midwinter and the generous branches still groaned with the weight of their nutritious and palatable fruits  mattinao was received by his people with an eager curiosity blended with profound respect his mild subjects crowded around luis and sancho with some such wonder as a civilized man would gaze at one of the prophets were he to return to earth in the flesh they had heard of the arrival of the ships but they did not the less regard their inmates as visitors from heaven this probably was not the opinion of the more elevated in rank for even in the savage state the vulgar mind is far from being that of the favored few whether it was owing to this greater facility of character and to habits that more easily adapted themselves to the untutored notions of the indians or to their sense of propriety sancho soon became the favorite with the multitude leaving the count of llera more especially to the care of mattinao and the principal men of his tribe owing to this circumstance the two spaniards were soon separated sancho being led away by the oi polloi to a sort of square in the centre of the village leaving don luis in the habitation of the cacique  no sooner did mattinao find himself in the company of our hero and that of two of his confidential chiefs than the name of ozema was repeated eagerly among the indians a rapid conversation followed a messenger was despatched luis knew not whither and then the chiefs took their departure leaving the young castilian alone with the cacique laying aside his golden band and placing a cotton robe about his person which had hitherto been nearly naked mattinao made a sign for his companion to follow him and left the building throwing the buckler over his shoulder and adjusting the belt of his sword in a way that the weapon should not incommode him in walking luis obeyed with as much confidence as he would have followed a friend along the streets of seville  mattinao led the way through a wilderness of sweets where tropical plants luxuriated beneath the branches of trees loaded with luscious fruits holding his course by a footpath which lay on the banks of a torrent that flowed from a ravine and poured its waters into the river below the distance he went might have been half a mile here he reached a cluster of rustic dwellings that occupied a lovely terrace on a hillside where they overlooked the larger town below the river and commanded a view of the distant ocean luis saw at a glance that this sweet retreat was devoted to the uses of the gentler sex and he doubted not that it formed a species of seraglio set apart for the wives of the young cacique he was led into one of the principal dwellings where the simple but grateful refreshments used by the natives were again offered to him  the intercourse of a month had not sufficed to render either party very familiar with the language of the other a few of the commoner words of the indians had been caught by the spaniards and perhaps luis was one of the most ready in their use still it is highly probable he was oftener wrong than right even when he felt the most confident of his success but the language of friendship is not easily mistaken and our hero had not entertained a feeling of distrust from the time he left the ships down to the present moment  mattinao had despatched a messenger to an adjacent dwelling when he entered that in which luis was now entertained and when sufficient time had been given for the last to refresh himself the cacique arose and by a courteous gesture such as might have become a master of ceremonies in the court of isabella he again invited the young grandee to follow they took their way along the terrace to a house larger than common and which evidently contained several subdivisions as they entered into a sort of anteroom here they remained but a minute the cacique after a short parley with a female removing a curtain ingeniously made of seaweed and leading the way to an inner apartment it had but a single occupant whose character luis fancied to be announced in the use of the single word ozema that the cacique uttered in a low affectionate tone as they entered luis bowed to this indian beauty as profoundly as he could have made his reverence to a highborn damsel of spain then recovering himself he fastened one long steady look of admiration on the face of the curious but halffrightened young creature who stood before him and exclaimed in such tones as only indicate rapture admiration and astonishment mingled  mercedes  the young cacique repeated this name in the best manner he could evidently mistaking it for a spanish term to express admiration or satisfaction while the trembling young thing who was the subject of all this wonder shrunk back a step blushed laughed and muttered in her soft low musical voice mercedes as the innocent take up and renew any source of their harmless pleasures she then stood with her arms folded meekly on her bosom resembling a statue of wonder but it may be necessary to explain why at a moment so peculiar the thoughts and tongue of luis had so suddenly resorted to his mistress in order to do this we shall first attempt a short description of the person and appearance of ozema as was in fact the name of the indian beauty  all the accounts agree in describing the aborigines of the west indies as being singularly well formed and of a natural grace in their movements that extorted a common admiration among the spaniards their color was not unpleasant and the inhabitants of hayti in particular were said to be very little darker than the people of spain those who were but little exposed to the bright sun of that climate and who dwelt habitually beneath the shades of groves or in the retirement of their dwellings like persons of similar habits in europe might by comparison have even been termed fair such was the fact with ozema who instead of being the wife of the young cacique was his only sister according to the laws of hayti the authority of a cacique was transmitted through females and a son of ozema was looked forward to as the heir of his uncle owing to this fact and to the circumstance that the true royal line if a term so dignified can be applied to a state of society so simple was reduced to these two individuals ozema had been more than usually fostered by the tribe leaving her free from care and as little exposed to hardships as at all comported with the condition of her people she had reached her eighteenth year without having experienced any of those troubles and exposures which are more or less the inevitable companions of savage life though it was remarked by the spaniards that all the indians they had yet seen seemed more than usually free from evils of this character they owed this exception to the generous quality of the soil the genial warmth of the climate and the salubrity of the air in a word ozema in her person possessed just those advantages that freedom from restraint native graces and wild luxuriance might be supposed to lend the female form under the advantages of a mild climate a healthful and simple diet and perfect exemption from exposure care or toil it would not have been difficult to fancy eve such a creature when she first appeared to adam fresh from the hands of her divine creator modest artless timid and perfect  the haytians used a scanty dress though it shocked none of their opinions to go forth in the garb of nature still few of rank were seen without some pretensions to attire which was worn rather as an ornament or a mark of distinction than as necessary either to usage or comfort ozema herself formed no exception to the general rule a cincture of indian cloth woven in gay colors circled her slender waist and fell nearly as low as her knees a robe of spotless cotton inartificially made but white as the driven snow and of a texture so fine that it might have shamed many of the manufactures of our own days fell like a scarf across a shoulder and was loosely united at the opposite side dropping in folds nearly to the ground sandals of great ingenuity and beauty protected the soles of feet that a queen might have envied and a large plate of pure gold rudely wrought was suspended from her neck by a string of small but gorgeous shells bracelets of the latter were on her pretty wrists and two light bands of gold encircled ankles that were as faultless as those of the venus of naples in that region the fineness of the hair was thought the test of birth with better reason than many imagine the feet and hands to be in civilized life as power and rank had passed from female to female in her family for several centuries the hair of ozema was silken soft waving exuberant and black as jet it covered her shoulders like a glorious mantle and fell as low as her simple cincture so light and silken was this natural veil that its ends waved in the gentle current of air that was rather breathing than blowing through the apartment  although this extraordinary creature was much the loveliest specimen of youngwomanhood that luis had seen among the wild beauties of the islands it was not so much her graceful and wellrounded form or even the charms of face and expression that surprised him as a decided and accidental resemblance to the being he had left in spain and who had so long been the idol of his heart this resemblance alone had caused him to utter the name of his mistress in the manner related could the two have been placed together it would have been easy to detect marked points of difference between them without being reduced to compare the intellectual and thoughtful expression of our heroines countenance with the wondering doubting halfstartled look of ozema but still the general likeness was so strong that no person who was familiar with the face of one could fail to note it on meeting with the other side by side it would have been discovered that the face of mercedes had the advantage in finesse and delicacy that her features and brow were nobler her eye more illuminated by the intelligence within her smile more radiant with thought and the feelings of a cultivated woman her blush more sensitive betraying most of the consciousness of conventional habits and that the expression generally was much more highly cultivated than that which sprung from the artless impulses and limited ideas of the young haytian nevertheless in mere beauty in youth and tint and outline the disparity was scarcely perceptible while the resemblance was striking and on the score of animation native frankness ingenuousness and all that witchery which ardent and undisguised feeling lends to woman many might have preferred the confiding abandon of the beautiful young indian to the more trained and dignified reserve of the castilian heiress what in the latter was earnest highsouled native but religious enthusiasm in the other was merely the outpourings of unguided impulses which however feminine in their origin were but little regulated in their indulgence  mercedes exclaimed our hero when this vision of indian loveliness unexpectedly broke on his sight mercedes repeated mattinao mercedes murmured ozema recoiling a step blushing laughing and then resuming her innocent confidence as she several times uttered the same word which she also mistook for an expression of admiration in her own low melodious voice  conversation being out of the question there remained nothing for the parties but to express their feelings by signs and acts of amity luis had not come on his little expedition unprovided with presents anticipating an interview with the wife of the cacique he had brought up from the village below several articles that he supposed might suit her untutored fancy but the moment he beheld the vision that actually stood before him they all seemed unworthy of such a being in one of his onsets against the moors he had brought off a turban of rich but light cloth and he had kept it as a trophy occasionally wearing it in his visits to the shore out of pure caprice and as a sort of ornament that might well impose on the simpleminded natives these vagaries excited no remarks as mariners are apt to indulge their whims in this manner when far from the observations of those to whom they habitually defer this turban was on his head at the moment he entered the apartment of ozema and overcome with the delight of finding so unexpected a resemblance and possibly excited by so unlookedfor an exhibition of feminine loveliness he gallantly unrolled it threw out the folds of rich cloth and cast it over the shoulders of the beautiful ozema as a mantle  the expressions of gratitude and delight that escaped this unsophisticated young creature were warm sincere and undisguised she cast the ample robe on the ground before her repeated the word mercedes again and again and manifested her pleasure with all the warmth of a generous and ingenuous nature if we were to say that this display of ozema was altogether free from the childlike rapture that was perhaps inseparable from her ignorance it would be attributing to her benighted condition the experience and regulated feelings of advanced civilization but notwithstanding the guileless simplicity with which she betrayed her emotions her delight was not without much of the dignity and tone that usually mark the conduct of the superior classes all over the world luis fancied it as graceful as it was naive and charming he endeavored to imagine the manner in which the lady of valverde might receive an offering of precious stones from the gracious hands of doña isabella and he even thought it very possible that the artless grace of ozema was not far behind what he knew would be the meek selfrespect mingled with grateful pleasure that mercedes could not fail to exhibit  while thoughts like these were passing through his mind the indian girl laid aside her own less enticing robe without a thought of shame and then she folded her faultless form in the cloth of the turban this was no sooner done with a grace and freedom peculiar to her unfettered mind than she drew the necklace of shells from her person and advancing a step or two toward our hero extended the offering with a halfaverted face though the laughing and willing eyes more than supplied the place of language luis accepted the gift with suitable eagerness nor did he refrain from using the castilian gallantry of kissing the pretty hand from which he took the bauble  the cacique who had been a pleased spectator of all that passed now signed for the count to follow him leading the way toward another dwelling here don luis was introduced to other young females and to two or three children the former of whom he soon discovered were the wives of mattinao and the latter his offspring by dint of gestures a few words and such other means of explanation as were resorted to between the spaniards and the natives he now succeeded in ascertaining the real affinity which existed between the cacique and ozema our hero felt a sensation like pleasure when he discovered that the indian beauty was not married and he was fain to refer the feeling perhaps justly to a sort of jealous sensitiveness that grew out of her resemblance to mercedes  the remainder of that and the whole of the three following days were passed by luis with his friend the cacique in this the favorite and sacred residence of the latter of course our hero was if any thing a subject of greater interest to all his hosts than they could possibly be to him they took a thousand innocent liberties with his person examining his dress and the ornaments he wore not failing to compare the whiteness of his skin with the redder tint of that of mattinao on these occasions ozema was the most reserved and shy though her look followed every movement and her pleased countenance denoted the interest she felt in all that concerned the stranger hours at a time did luis lie stretched on fragrant mats near this artless and lovely creature studying the wayward expression of her features in the fond hope of seeing stronger and stronger resemblances to mercedes and sometimes losing himself in that which was peculiarly her own in the course of the time passed in these dwellings efforts were made by the count to obtain some useful information of the island and whether it was owing to her superior rank or to a native superiority of mind or to a charm of manner he soon fancied that the caciques beautiful sister succeeded better in making him understand her meaning than either of the wives of mattinao or the cacique himself to ozema then luis put most of his questions and ere the day had passed this quickwitted and attentive girl had made greater progress in opening an intelligible understanding between the adventurers and her countrymen than had been accomplished by the communications of the two previous months she caught the spanish words with a readiness that seemed instinctive pronouncing them with an accent that only rendered them prettier and softer to the ear  luis de bobadilla was just as good a catholic as a rigid education a wandering life and the habits of the camp would be apt to make one of his rank years and temperament still that was an age in which most laymen had a deep reverence for religion whether they actually submitted to its purifying influence or not if there were any freethinkers at all they existed principally among those who passed their lives in their closets or were to be found among the churchmen themselves who often used the cowl as a hood to conceal their infidelity his close association with columbus too had contributed to strengthen our heros tendency to believe in the constant supervision of providence and he now felt a strong inclination to fancy that this extraordinary facility of ozemas in acquiring languages was one of its semimiraculous provisions made with a view to further the introduction of the religion of the cross among her people often did he flatter himself as he sat gazing into the sparkling and yet mild eyes of the girl listening to her earnest efforts to make him comprehend her meaning that he was to be the instrument of bringing about this great good through so young and charming an agent the admiral had also enjoined on him the importance of ascertaining if possible the position of the mines and he had actually succeeded in making ozema comprehend his questions on a subject that was allengrossing with most of the spaniards her answers were less intelligible but luis thought they never could be sufficiently full flattering himself the whole time that he was only laboring to comply with the wishes of columbus  the day after his arrival our hero was treated to an exhibition of some of the indian games these sports have been too often described to need repetition here but in all their movements and exercises which were altogether pacific the young princess was conspicuous for grace and skill luis too was required to show his powers and being exceedingly athletic and active he easily bore away the palm from his friend mattinao the young cacique manifested neither jealousy nor disappointment at this result while his sister laughed and clapped her hands with delight when he was outdone even at his own sports by the greater strength or greater efforts of his guest more than once the wives of mattinao seemed to utter gentle reproaches at this exuberance of feeling but ozema answered with smiling taunts and luis thought her at such moments more beautiful than even imagination could draw and perhaps with justice for her cheeks were flushed her eyes became as brilliant as ornaments of jet and the teeth that were visible between lips like cherries resembled rows of ivory we have said that the eyes of ozema were black differing in this particular from the deepblue melancholy orbs of the enthusiastic mercedes but still they were alike so often uttering the same feelings more especially touching matters in which luis was concerned more than once during the trial of strength did the young man fancy that the expression of the rapture which fairly danced in the eyes of ozema was the very counterpart of that of the deepseated delight which had so often beamed on him from the glances of mercedes in the tourney and at such times it struck him that the resemblance between the two was so strong as after some allowance had been made for dress and other sufficiently striking circumstances to render them almost identical  the reader is not to suppose from this that our hero was actually inconstant to big ancient love far from it mercedes was too deeply enshrined in his heartand luis with all his faults was as warmhearted and truehearted a cavalier as breathedto be so easily dispossessed but he was young distant from her he had so long adored and was withal not altogether insensible to admiration so artlessly and winningly betrayed by the indian girl had there been the least immodest glance any proof that art or design lay at the bottom of ozemas conduct he would at once have taken the alarm and been completely disenthralled from his temporary delusion but on the contrary all was so frank and natural with this artless girl when she most betrayed the hold he had taken of her imagination it was done with a simplicity so obvious a naïveté so irrepressible and an ingenuousness so clearly the fruit of innocence that it was impossible to suspect artifice in a word our hero merely showed that he was human by yielding in a certain degree to a fascination that under the circumstances might well have made deeper inroads on the faith even of men who enjoyed much better reputations for stability of purpose  in situations of so much novelty time flies swiftly and luis himself was astonished when on looking back he remembered that he had now been several days with mattinao most of which period had actually been passed in what might not inaptly be termed the seraglio of the cacique sancho of the shipyardgate had not been in the least neglected all this time he had been a hero in his own circle as well as the young noble nor had he been at all forgetful of his duty on the subject of searching for gold though he had neither acquired a single word of the haytian language nor taught a syllable of spanish to even one of the laughing nymphs who surrounded him he had decorated the persons of many of them with hawksbells and had contrived to abstract from them in return every ornament that resembled the precious metal which they possessed this transfer no doubt was honestly effected however having been made on that favorite principle of the free trade theorists which maintains that trade is merely an exchange of equivalents overlooking all the adverse circumstances which may happen just at the moment to determine the standard of value sancho had his notions of commerce as well as the modern philosophers and as he and luis occasionally met during their sojourn with mattinao he revealed a few of his opinions on this interesting subject in one of their interviews  i perceive thou hast not forgotten thy passion for doblas friend sancho said luis laughing as the old seaman exhibited the store of dust and golden plates he had collected there is sufficient of the metal in thy sack to coin a score of them each having the royal countenances of our lord the king and our lady the queen  double that señor conde just double that and all for the price of some seventeen hawksbells that cost but a handful of maravedis by the mass this is a most just and holy trade and such as it becomes us christians to carry on here are these savages they think no more of gold than your excellency thinks of a dead moor and to be revenged on them i hold a hawksbell just as cheap let them think as poorly as they please of their ornaments and yellow dust they will find me just as willing to part with the twenty hawksbells that remain let them barter away they will find me as ready as they possibly can be to give nothing for nothing  is this quite honest sancho to rob an indian of his gold in exchange for a bauble that copper so easily purchaseth remember thou art a castilian and henceforth give two hawksbells where thou hast hitherto given but one  i never forget my birth señor for happily the shipyard of moguer is in old spain is not the value of a thing to be settled by what it will bring in the market ask any of our traders and they will tell you this which is clear as the sun in the heavens when the venetians lay before candia grapes and figs and greek wine could be had for the asking in that island while western articles commanded any price oh nothing is plainer than the fact that every thing hath its price and it is real trade to give one worthless commodity for another  if it be honest to profit by the ignorance of another answered luis who had a noblemans contempt for commerce then it is just to deceive the child and the idiot  god forbid and especially st andrew my patron that i should do any thing so wicked hawksbells are of more account than gold in hayti señor and happening to know it i am willing to part with the precious things for the dross you see i am generous instead of being avaricious for all parties are in hayti where the value of the articles must be settled it is true that after running great risks at sea and undergoing great pains and chances by carrying this gold to spain i may be requited for my trouble and get enough benefit to make an honest livelihood i hope doña isabella will have so much feeling for these her new subjects as to prevent their ever going into the shipping businessa most laborious and dangerous calling as we both well know  and why art thou so particular in desiring this favor in behalf of these poor islanders and that too sancho at the expense of thine own bones  simply señor answered the knave with a cunning leer lest it unsettle trade which ought to be as free and unencumbered as possible here now if we spaniards come to hayti we sellone hawksbell for a dobla in gold whereas were we to give these savages the trouble to come to spain a dobla of their gold would buy a hundred hawksbells nonoit is right as it is and may a double allowance of purgatory be the lot of him who wishes to throw any difficulties in the way of a good honest free and civilizing trade say i  sancho was thus occupied in explaining his notions of free tradethe great mystification of modern philanthropistswhen there arose such a cry in the village of mattinao as is only heard in moments of extreme jeopardy and sudden terror the conversation took place in the grove about midway between the town and the private dwellings of the cacique and so implicit had become the confidence the two spaniards reposed in their friends that neither had any other arms about his person than those furnished by nature luis had left both sword and buckler half an hour earlier at the feet of ozetna who had been enacting a mimic hero with his weapons for their mutual diversion while sancho had found the arquebuse much too heavy to be carried about for a plaything the last was deposited in the room where he had taken up his comfortable quarters  can this mean treachery señor exclaimed sancho have these blackguards found out the true value of hawksbells after all and do they mean to demand the balance due them  my life on it mattinao and all his people are true sancho this uproar hath a different meaninghark is not that the cry of caonabo  the very same señor that is the name of the carib cacique who is the terror of all these tribes  thy arquebuse sancho if possible then join me at the dwellings above ozema and the wives of our good friend must be defended at every hazard  luis had no sooner given these orders than he and sancho separated the latter running toward the town which by this time was a scene of wild tumult while our hero slowly and sullenly retired toward the private dwellings of the cacique occasionally looking back as if he longed to plunge into the thickest of the fray twenty times did he wish for his favorite charger and a stout lance when indeed it would not have been an extraordinary feat for a knight of his prowess to put to flight a thousand enemies like those who now menaced him often had he singly broken whole ranks of christian footsoldiers and it is well known that solitary individuals when mounted subsequently drove hundreds of the natives before them  the alarm reached the dwelling of mattinao before our hero when he entered the house of ozema he found its mistress surrounded by fifty females some of whom had already ascended from the town below each of whom was eagerly uttering the terrible name of caonabo ozema herself was the most collected of them all though it was apparent that from some cause she was an object of particular solicitude from those around her as luis entered the apartment the wives of mattinao were pressing around the princess and he soon gathered from their words and entreaties that they urged her to fly lest she should fall into the hands of the carib chief he even fancied and he fancied it justly that the rest of the females supposed the seizure of the caciques beautiful sister to be the real object of the sudden attack this conjecture in no manner lessened luis ardor in the defence the moment ozema caught sight of him she flew to his side clasping her hands and uttering the name of caonabo in a tone that would have melted a heart of stone at the same time her eyes spoke a language of hope confidence and petition that was not necessary to enlist our heros resolution on her side in a moment the sword of the young cavalier was in his hand and the buckler on his arm he then assured the princess of his zeal in the best manner he could by placing the buckler before her throbbing breast and waving the sword as in defiance of her enemies no sooner was this pledge given than every other female disappeared some flying to the rescue of their children and all endeavoring to find places of concealment by this singular and unexpected desertion luis found himself for the first time since they had met alone with ozema  to remain in the house would be to suffer the enemy to approach unseen and the shrieks and cries sufficiently announced that each moment the danger grew nearer luis accordingly made a sign for the girl to follow him first rolling the turban into a bundle and placing it on her arm that it might serve her at need as a species of shield against the hostile arrows while he was thus employed ozemas head fell upon his breast and the excited girl burst into tears this display of weakness however lasted but a moment when she aroused herself smiled through her tears pressed the arm of luis convulsively and became the indian heroine again they then left the building together  luis soon perceived that his retreat from the house had not been made a moment too soon the family of mattinao had already disappeared and a strong party of the invaders was in full view rushing madly up the grove silent but evidently bent on seizing their prey he felt ozema who clung to his arm tremble violently and then he heard her murmuring  caonabononono  the young indian princess had caught the spanish monosyllable of dissent and luis understood this exclamation to express her strong disinclination to become a wife of the carib chief his resolution to protect her or to die was in no manner lessened by this involuntary betrayal of her feelings which he could not but think might have some connection with himself for while our hero was both honorable and generous he was human and consequently well disposed to take a favorable view of his own powers of pleasing it was only in connection with mercedes that luis de bobadilla was humble  a soldier almost from childhood the young count looked hastily around him for a position that would favor his means of defence and which would render his arms the most available luckily one offered so near him that it required but a minute to occupy it the terrace lay against a precipice of rocks and a hundred feet from the house was a spot where the face of this precipice was angular throwing forward a wall on each side to some distance while the cliff above overhung the base sufficiently to remove all danger from falling stones in the angle were several large fragments of rock that would afford shelter against arrows and there being a sufficient space of greensward before them on which a knight might well display his prowess when in possession of this position our hero felt himself strong if not impregnable since he could be assailed only in front ozema was stationed behind one of the fragments of the fallen rocks her person only half concealed however concern for luis and curiosity as related to her enemies equally inducing her to expose her head and beautiful bust  luis was scarcely in possession of this post ere a dozen indians were drawn up in a line at the distance of fifty yards in his front they were armed with bows warclubs and spears being without other defensive armor than his buckler the young man would have thought his situation sufficiently critical did he not know that the archery of the natives was any thing but formidable their arrows would kill certainly when shot at short distances and against the naked skin but it might be questioned if they would penetrate the stout velvet in which luis was encased and fifty yards was not near enough to excite undue alarm the young man did not dare to retreat to the rocks as a clear space was indispensable for the free use of his good sword and to that weapon alone he looked for his eventual triumph  it was perhaps fortunate for our hero that caonabo himself was not with the party which beleaguered him that redoubtable chieftain who had been led to a distance in pursuit of the flying females under a belief that she he sought was among them would doubtless have brought the matter to an immediate issue by a desperate charge when numbers might have prevailed against courage and skill the actual assailants chose a different course and began to poise their bows one of the most skilful among them drew an arrow to the head and let it fly the missile glanced from the buckler of the knight and struck the hill behind him as lightly as if the parties had been at their idle sports another followed and luis turned it aside with his sword disdaining to raise his shield against such a trifle this cool manner of receiving their assaults caused the indians to raise a shout whether in admiration or rage luis could not tell  the next attack was more judicious being made on a principle that napoleon is said to have adopted in directing discharges of his artillery all those who had bows some six or eight drew their arrows together and the weapons came rattling on the buckler of the assailed in a single flight it was not easy to escape altogether from such a combined assault and our hero received one or two bruises from glancing arrows though no blood followed the blows a second attempt of the same nature was about to be made when the alarmed girl rushed from her place of concealment and like the pocahontas of our own history threw herself before luis with her arms meekly placed on her bosom as soon as she appeared there was a cry of ozemaozema among the assailants who were not caribs as all will understand who are familiar with the island history but milder haytians governed by a carib chief  in vain luis endeavored to persuade the devoted girl to withdraw she thought his life in danger and no language had he been able to exert his eloquence on the occasion could have induced her to leave him exposed to such a danger as the indians were endeavoring to obtain chances at the person of luis without killing the princess he saw there remained no alternative but a retreat behind the fragment of rock just as he obtained this temporary security a fiercelooking warrior joined the assailants who immediately commenced a vociferous explanation of the actual state of the attack  caonabo demanded luis of ozema pointing toward the newcomer  the girl shook her head after taking an anxious look at the strangers face at the same time clinging to our heros arm with seductive dependence  nonono she said eagerly no caonabononono  luis understood the first part of this answer to mean that the stranger was not the carib chief and the last to signify ozemas strong and settled aversion to becoming his wife  the consultation among the assailants was soon ended six of them then poised their warclubs and spears and made a rush for the citadel of the besieged when they were within twenty feet of his cover our hero sprang lightly forward on the sward to meet his foes two of the spears he received on his buckler severing both shafts with a single blow of his keen and highlytempered sword as he recovered from the effort with an upward cut he met the raised arm of the clubman most in advance hand and club fell at his feet with the skilful touch making a sweep with the weapon in his front its point seamed the breasts of the two astonished spearsmen whose distance alone saved them from more serious injuries  this rapid and unlookedfor execution struck the assailants with awe and dread never before had they witnessed the power of metal as used in war and the sudden amputation of the arm struck them as something miraculous even the ferocious carib fell back in dismay and luis felt hopes of victory this was the first occasion on which the spaniards had come to blows with the mild inhabitants of the islands they had discovered though it is usual with the historians to refer to an incident of still latter occurrence as the commencement of strife the severe privacy which has ever been thrown over the connection of don luis with the expedition having completely baffled their slight and superficial researches of course the efficiency of a weapon like that used by our hero was as novel to the haytians as it was terrific  at this instant a shout among the assailants and the appearance of a fresh body of the invaders with a tall and commanding chief at their head announced the arrival of caonabo in person this warlike cacique was soon made acquainted with the state of affairs and it was evident that the prowess of our hero struck him as much with admiration as with wonder after a few minutes he directed his followers to fall back to a greater distance and laying aside his club he advanced fearlessly toward luis making signs of amity  when the two adversaries met it was with mutual respect and confidence the carib made a short and vehement speech in which the only word that was intelligible to our hero was the name of the beautiful young indian by this time ozema had also advanced as if eager to speak and her rude suitor turned to her with an appeal that was passionate if not eloquent he laid his hand frequently on his heart and his voice became soft and persuasive ozema replied earnestly and in the quick manner of one whose resolution was settled at the close of her speech the color mounted to the temples of the ardent girl and as if purposely to make her meaning understood by our hero she ended by saying in spanish  caonabonononoluisluis  the aspect of the hurricane of the tropics is not darker or more menacing than the scowl with which the carib chief heard this unequivocal rejection of his suit accompanied as it was by so plain a demonstration in favor of the stranger waving his hand in defiance he strode back to his people and issued orders for a fresh assault  this time a tempest of arrows preceded the rush and luis was fain to seek his former cover behind the rocks indeed this was the only manner in which he could save the life of ozema the devoted girl resolutely persevering in standing before his body in the hope it would shield him from his enemies there had been some words of reproach from caonabo to the carib chief who had retreated from the first attack and the air was yet filled with arrows as this man rushed forward singly to redeem his name luis met him firm as the rock behind him the shock was violent and the blow that fell on the buckler would have crushed an arm less inured to such rude encounters but it glanced obliquely from the shield and the club struck the earth with the weight of a beetle our hero saw that all now depended on a deep impression his sword flashed in the bright sun and the head of the carib tumbled by the side of his club actually leaving the body erect for an instant so keen was the weapon and so dexterous had been the blow  twenty savages were on the spring but they stopped like men transfixed at this unexpected sight caonabo however undaunted even when most surprised roared out his orders like a maddened bull and the wavering crowd was again about to advance when the loud report of an arquebuse was heard followed by the whistling of its deadly missives a second haytian fell dead in his tracks it exceeded the powers of savage endurance to resist this assault which to their uninstructed minds appeared to come from heaven in two minutes neither caonabo nor any of his followers were visible as they rushed down the hill sancho appeared from a cover carrying the arquebuse which he had taken the precaution to reload  the circumstances did not admit of delay not a being of mattinaos tribe was to be seen in any direction and luis made no doubt that they had all fled determined to save ozema at every hazard he now took his way to the river in order to escape in one of the canoes in passing through the town it was seen that not a house had been plundered and the circumstance was commented on by the spaniards luis pointing it out to his companion  caonabonononoozemaozema was the answer of the girl who well knew the real object of the inroad  a dozen canoes lay at the landing and five minutes sufficed for the fugitives to enter one and to commence their retreat the current flowed toward the sea and in a couple of hours they were on the ocean as the wind blew constantly from the eastward sancho soon rigged an apology for a sail and an hour before the sun set the party landed on a point that concealed them from the bay luis being mindful of the admirals injunction to conceal his excursion lest others might claim a similar favor     chapter xxiv      three score and ten i can remember well     within the volume of which time i have seen     hours dreadful and things strange but this sore sight     hath trifled former knowings      macbeth   a sight that struck our hero with a terror and awe almost as great as those experienced by the ignorant haytians at the report and effect of the arquebuse awaited him as he came in view of the anchorage the santa maria that vessel of the admiral which he had left only four days before in her gallant array and pride lay a stranded wreck on the sands with fallen masts broken sides and all the other signs of nautical destruction the niña was anchored in safety it is true at no great distance but a sense of loneliness and desertion came over the young man as he gazed at this small craft which was little more than a felucca raised to the rank of a ship for the purposes of the voyage the beach was covered with stores and it was evident that the spaniards and the people of guacanagari toiled in company at the construction of a sort of fortress an omen that some great change had come over the expedition ozema was immediately left in the house of a native and the two adventurers hurried forward to join their friends and to ask an explanation of what they had seen  columbus received his young friend kindly but in deep affliction the manner in which the ship was lost has been often told and luis learned that the niña being too small to carry all away a colony was to be left in the fortress while the remainder of the adventurers hastened back to spain guacanagari had shown himself full of sympathy and was kindness itself while every one had been too much occupied with the shipwreck to miss our hero or to hearken to rumors of an event as common as an inroad from a carib chief to carry off an indian beauty perhaps the latter event was still too recent to have reached the shores  the week that succeeded the return of luis was one of active exertion the santa maria was wrecked on the morning of christmas day 1492 and on that of the 4th of january following the niña was ready to depart on her return voyage during this interval luis had seen ozema but once and then he had found her sorrowing mute and resembling a withered flower that retained its beauty even while it drooped on the evening of the third however while lingering near the newfinished fortress he was summoned by sancho to another interview to the surprise of our hero he found the young cacique with his sister  although language was wanting on this occasion the parties easily understood each other ozema was no longer sorrowful and borne down with grief the smile and the laugh came easily from her young and buoyant spirits and luis thought he had never seen her so winning and lovely she had arranged her scanty toilet with indian coquetry and the bright warm color of her cheeks added new lustre to her brilliant eyes her light agile form a model of artless grace seemed so ethereal as scarce to touch the earth the secret of this sudden change was not long hid from luis the brother and sister after discussing all their dangers and escapes and passing in review the character and known determination of caonabo had come to the conclusion that there was no refuge for ozema but in flight what most determined the brother to consent that his sister should accompany the strangers to their distant home it would be useless to inquire but the motive of ozema herself can be no secret to the reader it was known that the admiral was desirous of carrying to spain a party of natives and three females one of whom was of ozemas rank had already consented to go this chieftains wife was not only known to ozema but she was a kinswoman every thing seemed propitious to the undertaking and as a voyage to spain was still a mystery to the natives who regarded it as something like an extended passage from one of their islands to another no formidable difficulties presented themselves to the imagination of either the cacique or his sister  this proposition took our hero by surprise he was both flattered and pleased at the selfdevotion of ozema even while it troubled him perhaps there were moments when he a little distrusted himself still mercedes reigned in his heart and he shook off the feeling as a suspicion that a true knight could not entertain without offering an insult to his own honor on second thoughts there were fewer objections to the scheme than he at first fancied and after an hours discussion he left the place to go and consult the admiral  columbus was still at the fortress and he heard our hero gravely and with interest once or twice luis eyes dropped under the searching glance of his superior but on the whole he acquitted himself of the task he had undertaken with credit  the sister of a cacique thou sayst don luis returned the admiral thoughtfully the virgin sister of a cacique  even so don christopher and of a grace birth and beauty that will give our lady the queen a most exalted idea of the merits of our discovery  thou wilt remember señor conde that naught but purity may be offered to purity doña isabella is a model for all queens and mothers and wives and i trust nothing to offend her angelic mind can ever come from her favored servants there has been no deception practised on this wild girl to lead her into sin and misery  don christopher you can scarce think this of me doña mercedes herself is not more innocent than the girl i mean nor could her brother feel more solicitude in her fortunes than i feel when the king and queen have satisfied their curiosity and dismissed her i propose to place her under the care of the lady of valverde  the rarer the specimens that we take the better luis this will gratify the sovereigns and cause them to think favorably of our discoveries as thou sayst it might be done without inconvenience the niña is small of a verity but we gain much in leaving this large party behind us i have given up the principal cabin to the other females since thou and i can fare rudely for a few weeks let the girl come and see thou to her comfort and convenience  this settled the matter early next morning ozema embarked carrying with her the simple wealth of an indian princess among which the turban was carefully preserved her relative had an attendant who sufficed for both luis paid great attention to the accommodations in which both comfort and privacy were duly respected the parting with mattinao was touchingly tender for the domestic affections appear to have been much cultivated among these simpleminded and gentle people but the separation it was supposed would be short and ozema had again and again assured her brother that her repugnance to caonabo powerful cacique as he might be was unconquerable each hour increased it strengthening her resolution never to become his wife the alternative was to secrete herself in the island or to make this voyage to spain and there was glory as well as security in the latter with this consolation the brother and sister parted  columbus had intended to push his discoveries much further before he returned to europe but the loss of the santa maria and the desertion of the pinta reduced him to the necessity of bringing the expedition to a close lest by some untoward accident all that had actually been achieved should be forever lost to the world accordingly in the course of the 4th of january 1493 he made sail to the eastward holding his course along the shores of hayti his great object now was to get back to spain before his remaining little bark should fail him when his own name would perish with the knowledge of his discoveries fortunately however on the 6th the pinta was seen coming down before the wind martin alonzo pinzon having effected one of the purposes for which he had parted company that of securing a quantity of gold but failed in discovering any mines which is believed to have been his principal motive  it is not important to the narrative to relate the details of the meeting that followed columbus received the offending pinzon with prudent reserve and hearing his explanations he directed him to prepare the pinta for the return passage after wooding and watering accordingly in a bay favorable to such objects the two vessels proceeded to the eastward in company still following the north shore of hayti española or little spain as the island had been named by columbus4  footnote 4 the fortunes of this beautiful island furnish a remarkable proof of the manner in which abusse are made by the providence of god to produce their own punishments this island which is about twothirds the size of the state of new york was the seat of spanish authority in the new world for many years the mild aborigines who were numerous and happy when discovered were literally exterminated by the cruelties of their new masters and it was found necessary to import negroes from africa to toil in the canefields toward the middle of the sixteenth century it is said that two hundred of the aborigines were not to be found in the island although ovando had decoyed no less than forty thousand from the bahamas to supply the places of the dead as early as 1518 at a later day española passed into the hands of the french and all know the terrible events by which it has gone into the exclusive possession of the descendants of the children of africa all that has been said of the influence of the white population of this country as connected with our own indians sinks into insignificance as compared with these astounding facts  it was the 16th of the month ere the adventurers finally took their leave of this beautiful spot they had scarcely got clear of the land steering a northeasterly course when the favorable winds deserted them and they were again met by the trades the weather was moderate however and by keeping the two vessels on the best tack by the 10th of february the admiral making sundry deviations from a straight course however had stretched across the track of ocean in which these constant breezes prevailed and reached a parallel of latitude as high as palos his port in making this long slant the niña contrary to former experience was much detained by the dull sailing of the pinta which vessel having sprung her aftermast was unable to bear a press of sail the light breeze also favored the first which had ever been deemed a fast craft in smooth water and gentle gales  most of the phenomena of the outward passage were observed on the homeward but the tunnyfish no longer excited hopes nor did the seaweed awaken fears these familiar objects were successfully but slowly passed and the variable winds were happily struck again in the first fortnight here the traverses necessarily became more and more complicated until the pilots unused to so long and difficult a navigation in which they received no aids from either land or water got confused in their reckonings disputing hotly among themselves concerning their true position  thou hast heard today luis said the admiral smiling in one of his renewed conferences with our hero the contentions of vicente yañez with his brother martin alonzo and the other pilots touching our distance from spain these constant shifts of wind have perplexed the honest mariners and they fancy themselves in any part of the atlantic but that in which they really are  much depends on you señor not only our safety but the knowledge of our great discoveries  thou sayst true don luis vicente yañez sancho ruiz pedro alonzo niño and bartolemeo roldan to say nothing of the profound calculators in the pinta place the vessels in the neighborhood of madeira which is nearer to spain by a hundred and fifty leagues than the truth would show these honest people have followed their wishes rather than their knowledge of the ocean and the heavens  and you don christopher where do you place the caravels since there is no motive to conceal the truth  we are south of flores young count fully twelve degrees west of the canaries and in the latitude of nafé in africa but i would that they should be bewildered until the right of possession to our discoveries be made a matter of certainty not one of these men now doubts his ability to do all i have done and yet neither is able to grope his way back again after crossing this track of water to asia  luis understood the admiral and the size of the vessels rendering the communication of secrets hazardous the conversation changed  up to this time though the winds were often variable the weather had been good a few squalls had occurred as commonly happens at sea but they had proved to be neither long nor severe all this was extremely grateful to columbus who now he had effected the great purpose for which he might have been said to live felt some such concern lest the important secret should be lost to the rest of mankind as one who carries a precious object through scenes of danger experiences for the safety of his charge a change however was at hand and at the very moment when the great navigator began to hope the best he was fated to experience the severest of all his trials  as the vessels advanced north the weather became cooler as a matter of course and the winds stronger during the night of the 11th of february the caravels made a great run on their course gaining more than a hundred miles between sunset and sunrise the next morning many birds were in sight from which fact columbus believed himself quite near the azores while the pilots fancied they were in the immediate vicinity of madeira the following day the wind was less favorable though strong and a heavy sea had got up the properties of the little niña now showed themselves to advantage for ere the turn of the day she had to contend with such a struggle of the elements as few in her had ever before witnessed fortunately all that consummate seamanship could devise to render her safe and comfortable had been done and she was in as perfect a state of preparation for a tempest as circumstances would allow the only essential defect was her unusual lightness since most of her stores as well as her water being nearly exhausted her draught of water was materially less than it should have been the caravel was so small that this circumstance which is of little consequence to the safety of large vessels got to be one of consideration in a craft whose means of endurance did not place her above the perils of squalls the reader will understand the distinction better when he is told that ships of size can only lose their spars by sudden gusts of wind seldom being thrown on their beam ends as it is termed unless by the power of the waves whereas smaller craft incur the risk of being capsized when the spread of their canvas is disproportioned to their stability although the seamen of the niña perceived this defect in their caravel which in a great measure proceeded from the consumption of the fresh water they hoped so soon to gain a haven that no means had been taken to remedy the evil  such was the state of things as the sun set on the night of the 12th of february 1493 as usual columbus was on the poop vessels of all sizes then carrying these clumsy excrescences though this of the niña was so small as scarcely to deserve the name luis was at his side and both watched the aspect of the heavens and the ocean in grave silence never before had our hero seen the elements in so great commotion and the admiral had just remarked that even he had not viewed many nights as threatening there is a solemnity about a sunset at sea when the clouds appear threatening and the omens of a storm are brooding that is never to be met with on the land the loneliness of a ship struggling through a waste of drearylooking water contributes to the influence of the feelings that are awakened as there appears to be but one object on which the wild efforts of the storm can expend themselves all else seem to be in unison to aid the general strife ocean heavens and the air being alike accessories in the murky picture when the wintry frowns of february are thrown around all the gloomy hues of the scene are deepened to their darkest tints  this is a brooding nightfall don luis columbus remarked just as the last rays that the sun cast upward on the stormylooking clouds disappeared from their ragged outlinesi have rarely seen another as menacing  one has a double confidence in the care of god while sailing under your guidance señor first in his goodness and next in the knowledge of his agents skilfulness  the power of the almighty is sufficient to endue the feeblest mortal with all fitting skill when it is his divine will to spare or to rob the most experienced of their knowledge when his anger can only be appeased by the worldly destruction of his creatures  you look upon the night as portentous don christopher  i have seen omens as ill though very seldom had not the caravel this burdensome freight i might view our situation less anxiously  you surprise me sir admiral the pilots have regretted that our bark is so light  true as to material substance but it beareth a cargo of knowledge luis that it would be grievous to see wasted on these vacant waters dost thou not perceive how fast and gloomily the curtain of night gathereth about us and the manner in which the niña is rapidly getting to be our whole world even the pinta is barely distinguishable like a shapeless shadow on the foaming billows serving rather as a beacon to warn us of our own desolation than as a consort to cheer us with her presence and companionship  i have never known you thus moody excellent señor on account of the aspect of the weather  tis not usual with me young lord but my heart is loaded with its glorious secret beholddost thou remark that further sign of the warring of the elements  the admiral as he spoke was standing with his face toward spain while his companions gaze was fastened on the portentouslooking horizon of the west around which still lingered sufficient light to render its frowns as chilling as they were visible he had not seen the change that drew the remark from columbus but turning quickly he asked an explanation notwithstanding the season the horizon at the northeast had been suddenly illuminated by a flash of lightning and even while the admiral was relating the fact and pointing out the quarter of the heavens in which the phenomenon had appeared two more flashes followed each other in quick succession  señor vicentecalled out columbus leaning forward in a way to overlook a group of dusky figures that was collected on the halfdeck beneath himis señor vicente yañez of your number  i am here don christopher and note the omen it is the sign of even more wind  we shall be visited with a tempest worthy vicente and it will come from that quarter of the heavens or its opposite have we made all sure in the caravel  i know not what else is to be done señor almirante our canvas is at the lowest every thing is well lashed and we carry as little aloft as can be spared sancho ruiz look you to the tarpaulings lest we ship more water than will be safe  look well to our light too that our consort may not part from us in the darkness this is no time for sleep vicenteplace your most trusty men at the tiller  señor they are selected with care sancho mundo and young pepe of moguer do that duty at present others as skilled await to relieve them when their watch ends  tis well good pinzonneither you nor i can close an eye tonight  the precautions of columbus were not uncalledfor about an hour after the unnatural flashes of lightning had been seen the wind rose from the southwest favorably as to direction but fearfully as to force notwithstanding his strong desire to reach port the admiral found it prudent to order the solitary sail that was set to be taken in and most of the night the two caravels drove before the gale under bare poles heading to the northeast we say both for martin alonzo practised as he was in stormy seas and disposed as he was to act only for himself now the great problem was solved kept the pinta so near the niña that few minutes passed without her being seen careering on the summit of a foaming sea or settling bodily into the troughs as she drove headlong before the tempest keeping side by side with her consort however as man clings to man in moments of dependency and peril  thus passed the night of the 13th the day bringing with it a more vivid picture of the whole scene though it was thought that the wind somewhat abated in its force as the sun arose perhaps this change existed only in the imaginations of the mariners the light usually lessening the appearance of danger by enabling men to face it each caravel however set a little canvas and both went foaming ahead hurrying toward spain with their unlookedfor tidings as the day advanced the fury of the gale sensibly lessened but as night drew on again it returned with renewed force more adverse and compelling the adventurers to take in every rag of sail they had ventured to spread nor was this the worst the caravels by this time had driven up into a tract of ocean where a heavy crosssea was raging the effects of some other gale that had recently blown from a different quarter both vessels struggled manfully to lay up to their course under these adverse circumstances but they began to labor in a way to excite uneasiness in those who comprehended the fullest powers of the machines and who knew whence the real sources of danger were derived as night approached columbus perceived that the pinta could not maintain her ground the strain on her aftermast proving too severe to be borne even without an inch of canvas spread reluctantly did he order the niña to edge away toward her consort separation at such a moment being the evil next to positive destruction  in this manner the night of the 14th drew around our lone and seagirt adventurers what had been merely menace and omens the previous night were now a dread reality columbus himself declared he had never known a bark to buffet a more furious tempest nor did he affect to conceal from luis the extent of his apprehensions with the pilots and before the crew he was serene and even cheerful but when alone with our hero he became frank and humble still was the celebrated navigator always calm and firm no unmanly complaint escaped him though his very soul was saddened at the danger his great discoveries ran of being forever lost  such was the state of feeling that prevailed with the admiral as he sat in his narrow cabin in the first hours of that appalling night watching for any change relieving or disastrous that might occur the howling of the winds which fairly scooped up from the surface of the raging atlantic the brine in sheets was barely audible amid the roar and rush of the waters at times indeed when the caravel sunk helplessly between two huge waves the fragment of sail she still carried would flap and the air seemed hushed and still and then again as the buoyant machine struggled upward like a drowning man who gains the surface by frantic efforts it would seem as if the columns of air were about to bear her off before them as lightly as the driving spray even luis albeit little apt to take alarm felt that their situation was critical and his constitutional buoyancy of spirits had settled down in a thoughtful gravity that was unusual with him had a column of a thousand hostile moors stood before our hero he would have thought rather of the means of overturning it than of escape but this warring of the elements admitted of no such relief it appeared actually like contending with the almighty in such scenes indeed the bravest find no means of falling back on their resolution and intrepidity for the efforts of man seem insignificant and bootless as opposed to the will and power of god  tis a wild night señor our hero observed calmly preserving an exterior of more unconcern than he really felt to me this surpasseth all i have yet witnessed of the fury of a tempest  columbus sighed heavily then he removed his hands from his face and glanced about him as if in search of the implements he wanted  count of llera he answered with dignity there remaineth a solemn duty to perform there is parchment in the draw on your side of this table and here are the instruments for writing let us acquit ourselves of this important trust while time is yet mercifully given us god alone knowing how long we have to live  luis did not blanch at these portentous words but he looked earnest and grave opening the draw he took out the parchment and laid it upon the table the admiral now seized a pen beckoning to his companion to take another and both commenced writing as well as the incessant motion of the light caravel would allow the task was arduous but it was clearly executed as columbus wrote a sentence he repeated it to luis who copied it word for word on his own piece of parchment the substance of this record was the fact of the discoveries made the latitude and longitude of española with the relative positions of the other islands and a brief account of what he had seen the letter was directed to ferdinand and isabella as soon as each had completed his account the admiral carefully enveloped his missive in a covering of waxed cloth luis imitating him in all things each then took a large cake of wax and scooping a hole in it the packet was carefully secured in the interior when it was covered with the substance that had been removed columbus now sent for the cooper of the vessel who was directed to inclose each cake in a separate barrel these vessels abound in ships and ere many minutes the two letters were securely inclosed in the empty casks each taking a barrel the admiral and our hero now appeared again on the halfdeck so terrific was the night that no one slept and most of the people of the niña men as well as officers were crowded together on the gratings near the mainmast where alone with the exception of the still more privileged places they considered themselves safe from being swept overboard indeed even here they were constantly covered with the wash of the sea the poop itself not being protected from rude visits of this nature  as soon as the admiral was seen again his followers crowded round him solicitous to hear his opinion and anxious to learn his present object to have told the truth would have been to introduce despair where hope had already nearly ceased and merely intimating that he performed a religious vow columbus with his own hands cast his barrel into the hissing ocean that of luis was placed upon the poop in the expectation that it would float should the caravel sink  three centuries and a half have rolled by since columbus took this wise precaution and no tidings have ever been obtained of that cask its buoyancy was such that it might continue to float for ages covered with barnacles it may still be drifting about the waste of waters pregnant with its mighty revelations it is possible it may have been repeatedly rolled upon some sandy beach and as frequently swept off again and it may have been passed unheeded on a thousand occasions by different vessels confounded with its vulgar fellows that are so often seen drifting about the ocean had it been found it would have been opened and had it been opened by any civilized man it is next to impossible that an occurrence of so much interest should have been totally lost  this duty discharged the admiral had leisure to look about him the darkness was now so great that but for the little light that was disengaged from the troubled water it would have been difficult to distinguish objects at the length of the caravel no one who has merely been at sea in a tall ship can form any just idea of the situation of the niña this vessel little more than a large felucca had actually sailed from spain with the latine rig that is so common to the light coasters of southern europe a rig that had only been altered in the canaries as she floated in a bay or a river her height above the water could not have exceeded four or five feet and now that she was struggling with a tempest in a cross sea and precisely in that part of the atlantic where the rake of the winds is the widest and the tumult of the waters the greatest it seemed as if she were merely some aquatic animal that occasionally rose to the surface to breathe there were moments when the caravel appeared to be irretrievably sinking into the abyss of the ocean huge black mounds of water rising around her in all directions the confusion in the waves having destroyed all the ordinary symmetry of the rolling billows although so much figurative language has been used in speaking of mountainous waves it would not be exceeding the literal truth to add that the niñas yards were often below the summits of the adjacent seas which were tossed upward in so precipitous a manner as to create a constant apprehension of their falling in cataracts on her gratings for midshipdeck strictly speaking she had none this indeed formed the great source of danger since one falling wave might have filled the little vessel and carried her with all in her hopelessly to the bottom as it was the crests of seas were constantly tumbling inboard or shooting athwart the hull of the caravel in sheets of glittering foam though happily never with sufficient power to overwhelm the buoyant fabric at such perilous instants the safety of the craft depended on the frail tarpaulings had these light coverings given way two or three successive waves would infallibly have so far filled the hold as to render the hull waterlogged when the loss of the vessel would have followed as an inevitable consequence  the admiral had ordered vicente yañez to carry the foresail close reefed in the hope of dragging the caravel through this chaos of waters to a part of the ocean where the waves ran more regularly the general direction of the seas too so far as they could be said to have a general direction at all had been respected and the niña had struggled onwardit might be better to say waded onwardsome five or six leagues since the disappearance of the day and found no change it was getting to be near midnight and still the surface of the ocean presented the same wild aspect of chaotic confusion vicente yañez approached the admiral and declared that the bark could no longer bear the rag of sail she carried  the jerk as we rise on the sea goes near to pull the stern out of the craft he said and the backward flap as we settle into the troughs is almost as menacing the niña will bear the canvas no longer with safety  who has seen aught of martin alonzo within the hour demanded columbus looking anxiously in the direction in which the pinta ought to be visible thou hast lowered the lantern vicente yañez  it would stand the hurricane no longer from time to time it hath been shown and each signal hath been answered by my brother  let it be shown once more this is a moment when the presence of a friend gladdens the soul even though he be helpless as ourselves  the lantern was hoisted and after a steady gaze a faint and distant light was seen glimmering in the rack of the tempest the experiment was repeated at short intervals and as often was the signal answered at increasing distances until the light of their consort was finally lost altogether  the pintas mast is too feeble to bear even its gear in such a gale observed vicente yañez and my brother hath found it impossible to keep as near the wind as we have done he goes off more to leeward  let the foresail be secured answered columbus as thou sayst our feeble craft can no longer bear these violent surges  vicente yañez now mustered a few of his ablest men and went forward himself to see this order executed at the same moment the helm was righted and the caravel slowly fell off until she got dead before the gale the task of gathering in the canvas was comparatively easy the yard being but a few feet above the deck and little besides the clews being exposed still it required men of the firmest nerve and the readiest hands to venture aloft at such an instant sancho took one side of the mast and pepe the other both manifesting such qualities as mark the perfect seaman only  the caravel was now drifting at the mercy of the winds and waves the term scudding being scarcely applicable to the motion of a vessel so low and which was so perfectly sheltered from the action of the wind by the height of the billows had the latter possessed their ordinary regularity the low vessel must have been pooped but in a measure her exemption from this calamity was owing to an irregularity that was only the source of a new danger still the niña drove ahead and that swiftly though not with the velocity necessary to outstrip the chasing water had the waves followed with their customary order and regularity the cross seas defeated this wave meeting wave actually sending those crests which otherwise would have rolled over in combing foam upward in terrific jets deau  this was the crisis of the danger there was an hour when the caravel careered amid the chaotic darkness with a sort of headlong fury not unfrequently dashing forward with her broadside to the sea as if the impatient stern was bent on overtaking the stem and exposing all to the extreme jeopardy of receiving a flood of water on the beam this imminent risk was only averted by the activity of the man at the helm where sancho toiled with all his skill and energy until the sweat rolled from his brow as if exposed again to the sun of the tropics at length the alarm became so great and general that a common demand was made to the admiral to promise the customary religious oblations for this purpose all but the men at the helm assembled aft and preparations were made to cast lots for the penance  ye are in the hands of god my friends said columbus and it is meet that ye all confess your dependence on his goodness placing your security on his blessings and favor alone in this cap which ye see in the hands of the señor de muños are the same number of peas that we are of persons one of these peas bears the mark of the holy cross and he who shall draw forth this blessed emblem stands pledged to make a pilgrimage to santa maria de guadalupe bearing a waxen taper of five pounds weight as the chiefest sinner among you no less than as your admiral the first trial shall be mine  here columbus put his hand into the cap and on drawing forth a pea and holding it to the lantern it was found to bear on its surface the mark he had mentioned  this is well señor said one of the pilots but replace the pea and let the chance be renewed for a still heavier penance and that at a shrine which is most in request with all good christians i mean that of our lady of loretto one pilgrimage to that shrine is worth two to any other  in moments of emergency the religious sentiment is apt to be strong and this proposition was seconded with warmth the admiral cheerfully consented and when all had drawn the marked pea was found in the hands of a common seaman of the name of pedro de villa one who bore no very good name for either piety or knowledge  tis a weary and costly journey grumbled the chosen penitent and cannot cheaply be made  heed it not friend pedro answered columbus the bodily pains shall limit thy sufferings for the cost of the journey shall be mine this night groweth more and more terrific good bartolemeo roldan  that doth it señor admiral and i am little content with such a pilgrim as pedro here although it may seem as if heaven itself directed the choice a mass in santa clara de moguer with a watcher all night in that chapel will be of more account than your distant journeys made by such an one as he  this opinion wanted not for supporters among the seamen of moguer and a third trial was made to determine the person again the pea was withdrawn from the cap by the admiral still the danger did not diminish the caravel actually threatening to roll over amid the turbulence of the waves  we are too light vicente yañez said columbus and desperate as the undertaking seemeth we must make an effort to fill our empty casks with seawater let hose be carefully introduced beneath the tarpaulings and send careful hands below to make sure that the water does not get into the hold instead of the casks  this order was obeyed and several hours passed in efforts to execute this duty the great difficulty was in protecting the men who raised the water from the sea for while the whole element was raging in such confusion around them it was no easy matter to secure a single drop in a useful manner patience and perseverance however prevailed in the end and ere the light returned so many empty casks had been filled as evidently to aid the steadiness of the vessel toward morning it rained in torrents and the wind shifted from south to west losing but little of its force however at this juncture the foresail was again got on the bark and she was dragged by it through a tremendous sea a few miles to the eastward  when the day dawned the scene was changed for the better the pinta was nowhere to be seen and most in the niña believed she had gone to the bottom but the clouds had opened a little and a sort of mystical brightness rested on the ocean which was white with foam and still hissing with fury the waves however were gradually getting to be more regular and the seamen no longer found it necessary to lash themselves to the vessel in order to prevent being washed overboard additional sail was got on the caravel and as her motion ahead increased she became steadier and more certain in all her movements  illustration     chapter xxv      for now from sight of land diverted clear     they drove uncertain oer the pathless deep     nor gave the adverse gale due course to steer     nor durst they the designd direction keep     the gathering tempest quickly raged so high     the waveencompassd boat but faintly reachd my eye      vision of patience   such was the state of things on the morning of the 15th and shortly after the sun arose the joyful cry of land was heard from aloft it is worthy of being mentioned that this land was made directly ahead so accurate were all the admirals calculations and so certain did he feel of his position on the chart a dozen opinions however prevailed among the pilots and people concerning this welcome sight some fancying it the continent of europe while others believed it to be madeira columbus himself publicly announced it to be one of the azores  each hour was lessening the distance between this welcome spot of earth and the adventurers when the gale chopped directly round bringing the island dead to windward throughout a long and weary day the little bark kept turning up against the storm in order to reach this muchdesired haven but the heaviness of the swell and the foul wind made their progress both slow and painful the sun set in wintry gloom again and the land still lay in the wrong quarter and apparently at a distance that was unattainable hour after hour passed and still in the darkness the niña was struggling to get nearer to the spot where the land had been seen columbus never left his post throughout all these anxious scenes for to him it seemed as if the fortunes of his discoveries were now suspended as it might be by a hair our hero was less watchful but even he began to feel more anxiety in the result as the moment approached when the fate of the expedition was to be decided  as the sun arose every eye turned inquiringly around the watery view and to the common disappointment no land was visible some fancied all had been illusion but the admiral believed they had passed the island in the darkness and he hove about with a view to stand further south this change in the course had not been made more than an hour or two when land was again dimly seen astern and in a quarter where it could not have been previously perceived for this island the caravel tacked and until dark she was beating up for it against a strong gale and a heavy sea night again drew around her and the land once more vanished in the gloom  at the usual hour of the previous night the people of the niña had assembled to chant the salve fac regina or the evening hymn to the virgin for it is one of the touching incidents of this extraordinary voyage that these rude sailors first carried with them into the unknown wastes of the atlantic the songs of their religion and the christians prayers while thus employed a light had been made to leeward which was supposed to be on the island first seen thus encouraging the admiral in his belief that he was in the centre of a group and that by keeping well to windward he would certainly find himself in a situation to reach a port in the morning that morning however had produced no other change than the one noted and he was now preparing to pass another night or that of the 17th in uncertainty when the cry of land ahead suddenly cheered the spirits of all in the vessel  the niña stood boldly in and before midnight she was near enough to the shore to let go an anchor so heavy were both wind and sea however that the cable parted thus rejecting them as it were from the regions to which they properly belonged sail was made and the effort to get to windward renewed and by daylight the caravel was enabled to run in and get an anchorage on the north side of the island here the wearied and almost exhausted mariners learned that columbus was right as usual and that they had reached the island of st mary one of the azores  it does not belong to this tale to record all the incidents that occurred while the niña lay at this port they embraced an attempt to seize the caravel on the part of the portuguese who as they had been the last to harass the admiral on his departure from the old world were the first to beset him on his return all their machinations failed however and after having the best portion of his crew in their power and actually having once sailed from the island without the men the admiral finally arranged the matter and took his departure for spain with all his people on board on the 24th of the month  providence seemed to favor the passage of the adventurers for the first few days the wind being favorable and the sea smooth between the morning of the 24th and the evening of the 26th the caravel had made nearly a hundred leagues directly on her course to palos when she was met by a foul wind and another heavy sea the gale now became violent again though sufficiently favorable to allow them to steer east a little northerly occasionally hauling more ahead the weather was rough but as the admiral knew he was drawing in with the continent of europe he did not complain cheering his people with the hopes of a speedy arrival in this manner the time passed until the turn of the day saturday march 2d when columbus believed himself to be within a hundred miles of the coast of portugal the long continuance of the scant southerly winds having set him thus far north  the night commenced favorably the caravel struggling ahead through a tremendous sea that was sweeping down from the south having the wind abeam blowing so fresh as to cause the sails to be reduced within manageable size the niña was an excellent craft as had been thoroughly proved and she was now steadier than when first assailed by the tempests her pilots having filled still more of the casks than they had been able to do during the late storm  thou hast lived at the helm sancho mundo since the late gales commenced said the admiral cheerfully as about the last hour of the first watch he passed near the post of the old mariner it is no small honor to hold that station in the cruel gales we have been fated to endure  i so consider it señor don almirante and i hope their illustrious and most excellent highnesses the two sovereigns will look upon it with the same eyes so far as the weight of the duty is concerned  and why not as respects the honor friend sancho put in luis who had become a sworn friend of the seaman since the rescue of the rocks  honor señor master pedro is cold food and sits ill on a poor mans stomach one dobla is worth two dukedoms to such a man as i am since the dobla would help to gain me respect whereas the dukedoms would only draw down ridicule upon my head no nomaster pedro your worship give me a pocket full of gold and leave honors to such as have a fancy for them if a man must be raised in the world begin at the beginning or lay a solid foundation after which he may be made a knight of st james if the sovereigns have need of his name to make out their list  thou art too garrulous for a helmsman sancho though so excellent otherwise observed the admiral gravely look to thy course doblas will not be wanting when the voyage is ended  many thanks señor almirante and as a proof that my eyes are not shut even though the tongue wags i will just desire your excellency and the pilots to study that rag of a cloud that is gathering up here at the southwest and ask yourselves if it means evil or good  by the mass the man is right don christopher exclaimed bartolemeo roldan who was standing near that is a most sinisterlooking cloud and is not unlike those that give birth to the white squalls of africa  see to itsee to itgood bartolemeo returned columbus hastily we have indeed counted too much on our good fortune and have culpably overlooked the aspect of the heavens let vicente yañez and all our people be called we may have need of them  columbus now ascended to the poop where he got a wider and a better view of the ocean and the skies the signs were indeed as portentous as they had been sudden in their appearance the atmosphere was filled with a white mist that resembled a light smoke and the admiral had barely time to look about him when a roar that resembled the trampling of a thousand horses passing a bridge at full speed came rushing down with the wind the ocean was heard hissing as is usual at such moments and the tempest burst upon the little bark as if envious demons were determined she should never reach spain with the glorious tidings she bore  a report like that of a heavy discharge of musketry was the first signal that the squall had struck the niña it came from the rent canvas every sail having given way at the same instant the caravel heeled until the water reached her masts and there was a breathless instant when the oldest seaman feared that she would be forced over entirely upon her side had not the sails split this calamity might truly have occurred sancho too had borne the tiller up in season and when the niña recovered from the shock she almost flew out of the water as she drove before the blast  this was the commencement of a new gale which even surpassed in violence that from which they had so recently escaped for the first hour awe and disappointment almost paralyzed the crew as nothing was or could be done to relieve them from the peril they were in the vessel was already scuddingthe last resource of seamenand even the rags of the canvas were torn piece by piece from the spars sparing the men the efforts that would have been necessary to secure them in this crisis again the penitent people resorted to their religious rites and again it fell to the lot of the admiral to make a visit to some favorite shrine in addition the whole crew made a vow to fast on bread and water the first saturday after they should arrive  it is remarkable don christopher said luis when the two were again alone on the poop it is remarkable that these lots should fall so often on you thrice have you been selected by providence to be an instrument of thankfulness and penitence this cometh of your exceeding faith  say rather luis that it cometh of my exceeding sins my pride alone should draw down upon me stronger rebukes than these i fear me i had forgotten that i was merely an agent chosen by god to work his own great ends and was falling into the snares of satan by fancying that i of my own wisdom and philosophy had done this great exploit which cometh so truly of god  do you believe us in danger señor  greater hazard besets us now don luis than hath befallen us since we left palos we are driving toward the continent which cannot be thirty leagues distant and as thou seest the ocean is becoming more troubled every hour happily the night is far advanced and with the light we may find the means of safety  the day did reappear as usual for whatever disturbances occur on its surface the earth continues its daily revolutions in the sublimity of its vastness affording at each change to the mites on its surface the indubitable proofs that an omnipotent power reigns over all its movements the light however brought no change in the aspects of the ocean and sky the wind blew furiously and the niña struggled along amid the chaos of waters driving nearer and nearer to the continent that lay before her  about the middle of the afternoon signs of land became quite apparent and no one doubted the vicinity of the vessel to the shores of europe nevertheless naught was visible but the raging ocean the murky sky and the sort of supernatural light with which the atmosphere is so often charged in a tempest the spot where the sun set though known by means of the compass could not be traced by the eye and again night closed on the wild wintry scene as if the little caravel was abandoned by hope as well as by day to add to the apprehensions of the people a high cross sea was running and as ever happens with vessels so small in such circumstances tons weight of water were constantly falling inboard threatening destruction to the gratings and their frail coverings of tarred cloth  this is the most terrible night of all son luis said columbus about an hour after the darkness had drawn around them if we escape this night well may we deem ourselves favored of god  and yet you speak calmly señor as calmly as if your heart was filled with hope  the seaman that cannot command his nerves and voice even in the utmost peril hath mistaken his calling but i feel calm luis as well as seem calm god hath us in his keeping and will do that which most advanceth his own holy will my boysmy two poor boys trouble me sorely but even the fatherless are not forgotten  if we perish señor the portuguese will remain masters of our secret to them only is it now known ourselves excepted since for martin alonzo i should think there is little hope  this is another source of grief yet have i taken such steps as will probably put their highnesses on the maintenance of their rights the rest must be trusted to heaven  at that moment was heard the startling cry of land this word which so lately would have been the cause of sudden bursts of joy was now the source of new uneasiness although the night was dark there were moments when the gloom opened as it might be for a mile or two around the vessel and when objects as prominent as a coast could be seen with sufficient distinctness both columbus and our hero hastened to the forward part of the caravel at this cry though even this common movement was perilous in order to obtain the best possible view of the shore it was indeed so near that all on board heard or fancied they heard the roar of the surf against the rocks that it was portugal none doubted and to stand on in the present uncertainty of their precise position or without a haven to enter would be inevitable destruction there remained only the alternative to ware with the caravels head off shore and endeavor to keep an offing until morning columbus had no sooner mentioned this necessity than vicente yañez set about its execution in the best manner circumstances would allow  hitherto the wind had been kept a little on the starboard quarter the caravel steering east a point or two north and it was now the aim to lay her head so far round as to permit her to steer north a point or two west by the manner in which the coast appeared to trend it was thought that this variation in the direction might keep them for a few hours at a sufficient distance from the shore but this manoeuvre could not be effected without the aid of canvas and an order was issued to set the foresail the first flap of the canvas as it was loosened to the gale was tremendous the jerk threatening to tear the foremast from its step and then all was still as death forward the hull sinking so low behind a barrier of water as actually to becalm the sail sancho and his associate seized the favorable moment to secure the clews and as the little bark struggled upward again the canvas filled with some such shock as is felt at the sudden checking of a cable from this moment the niña drew slowly off to sea again though her path lay through such a scene of turbulent water as threatened at each instant to overwhelm her  luis said a soft voice at our heros elbow as the latter stood clinging to the side of the door of the cabin appropriated to the femalesluishayti bettermattinao bettermuch bad luis  it was ozema who had risen from her pallet to look out upon the appalling view of the ocean during the mild weather of the first part of the passage the intercourse between luis and the natives on board had been constant and cheerful though slightly incommoded by her situation ozema had always received his visits with guileless delight and her progress in spanish had been such as to astonish even her teacher nor were the means of communication confined altogether to the advance of ozema since luis in his endeavors to instruct her had acquired nearly as many words of her native tongue as he had taught her of his own in this manner they conversed resorting to both dialects for terms as necessity dictated we shall give a free translation of what was said endeavoring at the same time to render the dialogue characteristic and graphic  poor ozema returned our hero drawing her gently to a position where he could support her against the effects of the violent motion of the caravelthou must regret hayti indeed and the peaceful security of thy groves  caonabo there luis  true innocent girl but even caonabo is not as terrible as this anger of the elements  nononocaonabo much bad break ozemas heart no caonabono hayti  thy dread of the carib

against this tempest  what luis do against caonabokill himcut indiansmake him run away  this was easy to a christian knight who carried a good sword and buckler but it is impossible against a tempest we have only one hope and that is to trust in the spaniards god  spaniards greathave great god  there is but one god ozema and he ruleth all whether in hayti or in spain thou rememberest what i have told thee of his love and of the manner of his death that we might all be saved and thou didst then promise to worship him and to be baptized when we should reach my country  godozema do what ozema say love luis god already  thou hast seen the holy cross ozema and hast promised me to kiss it and bless it  where cross see no crossup in heavenor where show ozema cross nowluis crosscross luis love  the young man wore the parting gift of mercedes near his heart and raising a hand he withdrew the small jewel pressed it to his own lips with pious fervor and then offered it to the indian girl  seehe saidthis is a cross we spaniards revere and bless it it is our pledge of happiness  that luis god enquired ozema in a little surprise  not so my poor benighted girl  what benighted interrupted the quickwitted haytian eagerly for no term that the young man could or did apply to her fell unheeded on her vigilant and attentive ear  benighted means those who have never heard of the cross or of its endless mercies  ozema no benighted now exclaimed the other pressing the bauble to her bosom got crosskeep crossno benighted again never cross mercedesfor by one of those mistakes that are not unfrequent in the commencement of all communications between those who speak different tongues the young indian had caught the notion from many of luis involuntary exclamations that mercedes meant all that was excellent  i would indeed that she of whom thou speakest had thee in her gentle care that she might lead thy pure soul to a just knowledge of thy creator that cross cometh of mercedes if it be not mercedes herself and thou dost well in loving it and in blessing it place the chain around thy neck ozema for the precious emblem may help in preserving thee should the gale throw us on the coast ere morning that cross is a sign of undying love  the girl understood enough of this especially as the direction was seconded by a little gentle aid on the part of our hero to comply and the chain was soon thrown around her neck with the holy emblem resting on her bosom the change in the temperature as well as a sense of propriety had induced the admiral to cause ample robes of cotton to be furnished all the females and ozemas beautiful form was now closely enveloped in one and beneath its folds she had hidden the jewel which she fondly hugged to her heart as a gift of luis not so did the young man himself view the matter he had merely meant to lend in a moment of extreme peril that which the superstitious feeling of the age seriously induced him to fancy might prove a substantial safeguard as ozema was by no means expert in managing the encumbrance of a dress to which she was unaccustomed even while native taste had taught her to throw it around her person gracefully the young man had half unconsciously assisted in placing the cross in its new position when a violent roll of the vessel compelled him to sustain the girl by encircling her waist with an arm partly yielding to the motion of the caravel which was constantly jerking even the mariners from their feet and probably as much seduced by the tenderness of her own heart ozema did not rebuke this libertythe first our hero had ever offered but stood in confiding innocence upheld by the arm that of all others it was most grateful to her feelings to believe destined to perform that office for life in another moment her head rested on his bosom and her face was turned upward with the eyes fastened on the countenance of the young noble  thou art less alarmed at this terrific storm ozema than i could have hoped apprehension for thee has made me more miserable than i could have thought possible and yet thou seemest not to be disturbed  ozema no unhappyno want haytino want mattinaono want any thingozema happy now got cross  sweet guileless innocent mayst thou never know any other feelingsconfide in thy cross  cross mercedesluis mercedes luis and ozema keep cross forever  it was perhaps fortunate for this highprized happiness of the girl that the niña now took a plunge that unavoidably compelled our hero to release his hold of her person or to drag her with him headlong toward the place where columbus stood sheltering his weatherbeaten form from a portion of the violence of the tempest when he recovered his feet he perceived that the door of the cabin was closed and that ozema was no longer to be seen  dost thou find our female friends terrified by this appalling scene son luis columbus quietly demanded for though his own thoughts had been much occupied by the situation of the caravel he had noted all that had just passed so near him they are stout of heart but even an amazon might quail at this tempest  they heed it not señor for i think they understand it not the civilized man is so much their superior that both men and women appear to have every confidence in our means of safety i have just given ozema a cross and bade her place her greatest reliance on that  thou hast done well it is now the surest protector of us all keep the head of the caravel as near to the wind as may be sancho when it lulls every inch off shore being so much gained in the way of security  the usual reply was made and then the conversation ceased the raging of the elements and the fearful manner in which the niña was compelled to struggle literally to keep on the surface of the ocean affording ample matter for the reflections of all who witnessed the scene  in this manner passed the night when the day broke it opened on a scene of wintry violence the sun was not visible that day the dark vapor driving so low before the tempest as to lessen the apparent altitude of the vault of heaven onehalf but the ocean was an undulating sheet of foam high land soon became visible nearly abeam of the caravel and all the elder mariners immediately pronounced it to be the rock of lisbon as soon as this important fact was ascertained the admiral wore with the head of the caravel inshore and laid his course for the mouth of the tagus the distance was not great some twenty miles perhaps but the necessity of facing the tempest and of making sail on a wind in such a storm rendered the situation of the caravel more critical than it had been in all her previous trials at that moment the policy of the portuguese was forgotten or held to be entirely a secondary consideration a port or shipwreck appearing to be the alternative every inch of their weatherly position became of importance to the navigators and vicente yañez placed himself near the helm to watch its play with the vigilance of experience and authority no sail but the lowest could be carried and these were reefed as closely as their construction would allow  in this manner the tempesttossed little bark struggled forward now sinking so low in the troughs that land ocean and all but the frowning billows with the clouds above their heads were lost to view and now rising as it might be from the calm of a sombre cavern into the roaring hissing and turbulence of a tempest these latter moments were the most critical when the light hull reached the summit of a wave falling over to windward by the yielding of the element beneath her it seemed as if the next billow must inevitably overwhelm her and yet so vigilant was the eye of vicente yañez and so ready the hand of sancho that she ever escaped the calamity to keep the wash of the sea entirely out was however impossible and it often swept athwart the deck forward like the sheets of a cataract that part of the vessel being completely abandoned by the crew  all now depends on our canvas said the admiral with a sigh if that stand we are safer than when scudding and i think god is with us to me it seemeth as if the wind was a little less violent than in the night  perhaps it is señor i believe we gain on the place you pointed out to me  it is yon rocky point that weathered and we are safe that not weathered and we see our common grave  the caravel behaveth nobly and i will still hope  an hour later and the land was so near that human beings were seen moving on it there are moments when life and death may be said to be equally presented to the seamans sight on one side is destruction on the other security as the vessel drew slowly in toward the shore not only was the thunder of the surf upon the rocks audible but the frightful manner in which the water was tossed upward in spray gave additional horrors to the view on such occasions it is no uncommon thing to see jets deau hundreds of feet in height and the driving spray is often carried to a great distance inland before the wind lisbon has the whole rake of the atlantic before it unbroken by island or headland and the entire coast of portugal is one of the most exposed of europe the southwest gales in particular drive across twelve hundred leagues of ocean and the billows they send in upon its shores are truly appalling nor was the storm we are endeavoring to describe one of common occurrence the season had been tempestuous seldom leaving the atlantic any peace and the surges produced by one gale had not time to subside ere another drove up the water in a new direction giving rise to that irregularity of motion which most distresses a vessel and which is particularly hazardous to small ones  she looks up better don christopher exclaimed luis as they got within musketshot of the desired point another ten minutes of as favorable a slant and we do it  thou art right son answered the admiral calmly were any calamity to throw us ashore on yonder rocks two planks of the niña would not hold together five minutes ease hergood vicente yañezease her quite a point and let her go through the water all depends on the canvas and we can spare that point she moves luis regard the land and thou wilt now see our motion  true señor but the caravel is drawing frightfully near the point  fear not a bold course is often the safest it is a deep shore and we need but little water  no one now spoke the caravel was dashing in toward the point with appalling speed and every minute brought her perceptibly nearer to the cauldron of water that was foaming around it without absolutely entering within this vortex the niña flew along its edge and in five minutes more she had a direct course up the tagus open before her the mainsail was now taken in and the mariners stood fearlessly on certain of a haven and security  thus virtually ended the greatest marine exploit the world has ever witnessed it is true that a run round to palos was subsequently made but it was insignificant in distance and not fruitful in incidents columbus had effected his vast purpose and his success was no longer a secret his reception in portugal is known as well as all the leading occurrences that took place at lisbon he anchored in the tagus on the 4th of march and left it again on the 13th on the morning of the 14th the niña was off cape st vincent when she hauled in to the eastward with a light air from the north at sunrise on the 15th she was again off the bar of saltes after an absence of only two hundred and twentyfour days     chapter xxvi      one eveningtide as with her crones she sate     making sweet solace of some scandal new     a boisterous noise came thundring at the gate     and soon a sturdie boy approached in view     with gold far glitter and were his vestments blue     and pyeshaped hat and of the silver sheen     an huge broad buckle glaunst in either shoe     and round his necke an indian kerchiefe clean     and in his hand a switcha jolly wight i ween      mickle   notwithstanding the noble conceptions that lay at the bottom of the voyage we have just related the perseverance and selfdevotion that were necessary to its accomplishment and the magnificence of the consequences that were dependent on its success it attracted very little attention amid the stirring incidents and active selfishness of the age until the result was known only a month before the arrangement was made with columbus the memorable edict of the two sovereigns for the expulsion of the jews had been signed and this uprooting of so large a portion of the spanish nation was of itself an event likely to draw off the eyes of the people from an enterprise deemed as doubtful and which was sustained by means so insignificant as that of the great navigator the close of the month of july had been set as the latest period for the departure of these persecuted religionists and thus at the very time almost on the very day when columbus sailed from palos was the attention of the nation directed toward what might be termed a great national calamity the departure was like the setting forth from egypt the highways being thronged with the moving masses many of which were wandering they knew not whither  the king and queen had left granada in may and after remaining two months in castile they passed into aragon about the commencement of august in which kingdom they happened to be when the expedition sailed here they remained throughout the rest of the season settling affairs of importance and quite probably disposed to avoid the spectacle of the misery their jewish edict had inflicted castile having contained much the greater portion of that class of their subjects in october a visit was paid to the turbulent catalans the court passing the entire winter in barcelona nor did momentous events cease to occupy them while in this part of their territories on the 7th of december an attempt was made on the life of ferdinand the assassin inflicting a severe though not a fatal wound by a blow on the neck during the critical weeks in which the life of the king was deemed to be in danger isabella watched at his bedside with the untiring affection of a devoted wife and her thoughts dwelt more on her affections than on any worldly aggrandisement then followed the investigation into the motives of the criminal conspiracies ever being distrusted in such cases although history would probably show that much the greater part of these wicked attempts on the lives of sovereigns are more the results of individual fanaticism than of any combined plans to destroy  isabella whose gentle spirit grieved over the misery her religious submission had induced her to inflict on the jews was spared the additional sorrow of mourning for a husband taken away by means so violent ferdinand gradually recovered all these occurrences together with the general cares of the state had served to divide the thoughts of even the queen from the voyage while the politic ferdinand in his mind had long since set down the gold expended in the outfit as so much money lost  the balmy spring of the south opened as usual and the fertile province of catalonia had already become delightful with the fresh verdure of the close of march the king had for some weeks resumed his usual occupations and isabella relieved from her conjugal fears had again fallen into the quiet current of her duties and her usual acts of beneficence indisposed to the gorgeousness of her station by the recent events and ever pining for the indulgence of the domestic affections this estimable woman notwithstanding the strong natural disposition she had always felt for that sort of life had lived more among her children and confidants of late than had been even her wont her earliest friend the marchioness of moya as a matter of course was ever near her person and mercedes passed most of her time either in the immediate presence of her royal mistress or in that of her children  there had been a small reception one evening near the close of the month and isabella glad to escape from such scenes had withdrawn to her private apartments to indulge in conversation in the circle she so much loved it was near the hour of midnight the king being at work as usual in an adjoining closet there were present besides the members of the royal family and doña beatriz with her lovely niece the archbishop of granada luis de st angel and alonzo de quintanilla the two last of whom had been summoned by the prelate to discuss some question of clerical finance before their illustrious mistress all business however was over and isabella was rendering the circle agreeable with the condescension of a princess and the gentle grace of a woman  are there fresh tidings from the unfortunate and deluded hebrews lord archbishop demanded isabella whose kind feelings ever led her to regret the severity which religious dependence on her confessors had induced her to sanction our prayers should surely attend them notwithstanding our policy and duty have demanded their expulsion  señora answered fernando de talavera they are doubtless serving mammon among the moors and turks as they served him in spain let not your highness gracious mind be disturbed on account of these descendants of the enemies and crucifiers of christ who if they suffer at all do but suffer justly for the unutterable sin of their forefathers let us rather inquire my gracious mistress of the señores st angel and quintanilla here what hath become of their favorite colon the genoese and when they look for his return dragging the great khan a captive by the beard  we know naught of him holy prelate put in de st angel briskly since his departure from the canaries  the canaries interrupted the queen in a little surprise hath aught been received that cometh from that quarter  by report only señora letters have not reached any in spain that i can learn but there is a rumor from portugal that the admiral touched at gomera and the grand canary where it would seem he had his difficulties and whence he shortly after departed holding a western course since which time no tidings have been received from either of the caravels  by which fact lord archbishop added quintanilla we can perceive that trifles are not likely to turn the adventurers back  ill warrant ye señores that a genoese adventurer who holdeth their highnesses commission as an admiral will be in no unseemly haste to get rid of the dignity rejoined the prelate laughing without much deference to his mistress concessions in columbus favor one does not see rank authority and emolument carelessly thrown aside when they may be retained by keeping aloof from the power whence they spring  thou art unjust to the genoese holy sir and judgest him harshly observed the queen truly i did not know of these tidings from the canaries and i rejoice to hear that colon hath got thus far in safety hath not the past been esteemed a most boisterous winter among mariners señor de st angel  so much so your highness that i have heard the seamen here in barcelona swear that within the memory of man there hath not been another like it should illluck wait upon colon i trust this circumstance may be remembered as his excuse though i doubt if he be very near any of our tempests and storms  not he exclaimed the bishop triumphantly it will be seen that he hath been safely harbored in some river of africa and we shall have some question yet to settle about him with don john of portugal  here is the king to give us his opinion interposed isabella it is long since i have heard him mention the name of colon have you entirely forgotten our genoese admiral don fernando  before i am questioned on subjects so remote returned the king smiling let me inquire into matters nearer home how long is it that your highness holdeth court and giveth receptions past the hour of midnight  call you this a court señor here are but our own dear children beatriz and her niece with the good archbishop and those two faithful servants of your own  true but you overlook the antechambers and those who await your pleasure without  none can await without at this unusual hour surely you jest my lord  then your own page diego de ballesteros hath reported falsely unwilling to disturb your privacy at this unseasonable hour he hath come to me saying that one of strange conduct and guise is in the palace insisting on an interview with the queen let it be late or early the accounts of this mans deportment are so singular that i have ordered him to be admitted and have come myself to witness the interview the page telleth me that he swears all hours are alike and that night and day are equally made for our uses  dearest don fernando there may be treason in this  fear not isabella assassins are not so bold and the trusty rapiers of these gentlemen will prove sufficient for our protectionhist there are footsteps and we must appear calm even though we apprehend a tumult  the door opened and sancho mundo stood in the royal presence the air and appearance of so singular a being excited both astonishment and amusement and every eye was fastened on him in wonder and this so much the more because he had decked his person with sundry ornaments from the imaginary indies among which were one or two bands of gold mercedes alone detected his profession by his air and attire and she rose involuntarily clasping her hands with energy and suffering a slight exclamation to escape her the queen perceived this little pantomime and it at once gave a right direction to her own thoughts  i am isabella the queen she said prising without any further suspicion of danger and thou art a messenger from colon the genoese  sancho who had found great difficulty in gaining admittance now that his end was obtained took matters with his native coolness his first act was to fall on his knees as he had been particularly enjoined by columbus to do he had caught the habit of using the weed of hayti and cuba from the natives and was in fact the first seaman who ever chewed tobacco the practice had already got to be confirmed with him and before he answered or as soon as he had taken this for him novel position he saw fit to fill a corner of his mouth with the attractive plant then giving his wardrobe a shake for all the decent clothes he owned were on his person he disposed himself to make a suitable reply  señoradoñayour highness he answered any one might have seen that at a glance i am sancho mundo of the shipyardgate one of your highness excellencys most faithful subjects and mariners being a native and resident of moguer  thou comest from colon i say  señora i do many thanks to your royal grace for the information don christopher hath sent me across the country from lisbon seeing that the wily portuguese would be less likely to distrust a simple mariner like myself than one of your everydaybooted couriers tis a weary road and there is not a mule between the stables of lisbon and the palace of barcelona fit for a christian to bestride  then hast thou letters one like thee can scarcely bear aught else  therein your graces highness doña reyña is mistaken though i am far from bearing half the number of doblas i had at starting mass the innkeepers took me for a grandee by the manner in which they charged  give the man gold good alonzohe is one that liketh his reward ere he will speak  sancho coolly counted the pieces that were put into his hand and finding them greatly to exceed his hopes he had no longer any motive for prevarication  speak fellow cried the king thou triflest where thou owest thy duty and obedience  the sharp quick voice of ferdinand had much more effect on the ear of sancho than the gentler tones of isabella notwithstanding his rude nature had been impressed with the matronly beauty and grace of the latter  if your highness would condescend to let me know what you wish to hear i will speak in all gladness  where is colon demanded the queen  at lisbon lately señora though i think now at palos de moguer or in that neighborhood  whither hath he been  to cipango and the territories of the great khan forty days sail from gomera and a country of marvellous beauty and excellence  thou canst notdarest not trifle with me can we put credit in thy words  if your highness only knew sancho mundo you would not feel this doubt i tell you señora and all these noble cavaliers and dames that don christopher colon hath discovered the other side of the earth which we now know to be round by having circled it and that he hath found out that the north star journeyeth about in the heavens like a gossip spreading her news and that he hath taken possession of islands as large as spain in which gold groweth and where the holy church may employ itself in making christians to the end of time  the lettersanchogive me the letter colon would scarce send thee as a verbal expositor  the fellow now undid sundry coverings of cloth and paper until he reached the missive of columbus when without rising from his knees he held it out toward the queen giving her the trouble to move forward several paces to receive it so unexpected and astounding were the tidings and so novel the whole scene that no one interfered leaving isabella to be the sole actor as she was virtually the sole speaker sancho having thus successfully acquitted himself of a task that had been expressly confided to him on account of his character and appearance which it was thought would prove his security from arrest and plunder settled down quietly on his heels for he had been directed not to rise until ordered and drawing forth the gold he had received he began coolly to count it anew so absorbing was the attention all gave to the queen that no one heeded the mariner or his movements isabella opened the letter which her looks devoured as they followed line after line as was usual with columbus the missive was long and it required many minutes to read it all this time not an individual moved every eye being fastened on the speaking countenance of the queen there were seen the heightening flush of pleasure and surprise the glow of delight and wonder and the look of holy rapture when the letter was ended isabella turned her eyes upward to heaven clasped her hands with energy and exclaimed  not unto us o lord but to thee be all the honor of this wonderful discovery all the benefits of this great proof of thy goodness and power  thus saying she sunk into a seat and dissolved in tears ferdinand uttered a slight ejaculation at the words of his royal consort and then he gently took the letter from her unresisting hand and read it with great deliberation and care it was not often that the wary king of aragon was as much affected in appearance at least as on this occasion the expression of his face at first was that of wonder eagerness not to say avidity followed and when he had finished reading his grave countenance was unequivocally illuminated by exultation and joy  good luis de st angel he cried and thou honest alonzo de quintanilla these must be grateful tidings to you both even thou holy prelate wilt rejoice that the church is like to have acquisitions so gloriousalbeit no favorer of the genoese of old far more than all our expectations are realized for colon hath truly discovered the indies increasing our dominions and otherwise advancing our authority in a most unheardof manner  it was unusual to see don ferdinand so excited and he seemed conscious himself that he was making an extraordinary exhibition for he immediately advanced to the queen and taking her hand he led her toward his own cabinet in passing out of the saloon he indicated to the three nobles that they might follow to the council the king made this sudden movement more from habitual wariness than any settled object his mind being disturbed in a way to which he was unaccustomed while caution formed a part of his religion as well as of his policy it is not surprising therefore that when he and the party he invited to follow him had left the room there remained only the princesses the marchioness of moya and mercedes no sooner had the king and queen disappeared than the royal children retired to their own apartments leaving our heroine her guardian and sancho the sole occupants of the saloon the latter still remained on his knees scarce heeding what had passed so intently was he occupied with his own situation and his own particular sources of satisfaction  thou canst rise friend observed doña beatriz their highnesses are no longer present  at this intelligence sancho quitted his humble posture brushed his knees with some care and looked about him with the composure that he was wont to exhibit in studying the heavens at sea  thou wert of colons company friend by the manner in which thou hast spoken and the circumstance that the admiral hath employed thee as his courier  you may well believe that señora your excellency for most of my time was passed at the helm which was within three fathoms of the very spot that don christopher and the señor de muños loved so well that they never quitted it except to sleep and not always then  hadst thou a señor de muños of thy party resumed the marchioness making a sign to her ward to control her feelings  that had we señora and a señor gutierrez and a certain don somebody else and they all three did not occupy more room than one common man prithee honorable and agreeable señora is there one doña beatriz de cabrera the marchioness of moya a lady of the illustrious house of bobadilla anywhere about the court of our gracious queen  i am she and thou hast a message for me from this very señor de muños of whom thou hast spoken  i no longer wonder that there are great lords with their beautiful ladies and poor sailors with wives that no one envies scarce can i open my mouth but it is known what i wish to say which is knowledge to make one party great and the other party little massdon christopher himself will need all his wit if he journeyeth as far as barcelona  tell us of this pedro de muños for thy message is to me  then señora i will tell you of your own brave nephew the conde de llera who goeth by two other names in the caravel one of which is supposed to be a sham while the other is still the greatest deception of the two  is it then known who my nephew really is are many persons acquainted with his secret  certainly señora it is known firstly to himself secondly to don christopher thirdly to me fourthly to master alonzo pinzon if he be still in the flesh as most probably he is not then it is known to your ladyship and this beautiful señorita must have some suspicions of the matter  enoughi see the secret is not public though how one of thy class came to be of it i cannot explain tell me of my nephewdid he too write if so let me at once peruse his letter  señora my departure took don luis by surprise and he had no time to write the admiral had given the princes and princesses that we brought from española in charge to the conde and he had too much to do to be scribbling letters else would he have written sheets to an aunt as respectable as yourself  princes and princesseswhat mean you friend by such highsounding terms  only that we have brought several of these great personages to spain to pay their respects to their highnesses we deal with none of the common fry señora but with the loftiest princes and the most beautiful princesses of the east  and dost thou really mean that persons of this high rank have returned with the admiral  out of all question lady and one of a beauty so rare that the fairest dames of castile need look to it if they wish not to be outdone she in particular is don luis friend and favorite  of whom speakest thou demanded doña beatriz in the lofty manner in which she was wont to insist on being answered directly what is the name of this princess and whence doth she come  her name your excellency is doña ozema de hayti of a part of which country her brother don mattinao is cacique or king señora ozema being the heiress or next of kin don luis and your humble servant paid that court a visit  thy tale is most improbable fellowart thou one whom don luis would be likely to select as a companion on such an occasion  look at it as you will señora it is as true as that this is the court of don ferdinand and doña isabella you must know illustrious marchioness that the young count is a little given to roving about among us sailors and on one occasion a certain sancho mundo of moguer happened to be of the same voyage and thus we became known to each other i kept the nobles secret and he got to be sanchos friend when don luis went to pay a visit to don mattinao the cacique which word meaneth your highness in the eastern tongue sancho must go with him and sancho went when king caonabo came down from the mountains to carry off the princess doña ozema for a wife and the princess was unwilling to go why there remained nothing to be done but for the conde de llera and his friend sancho of the shipyardgate to fight the whole army in her defence which we did gaining as great a victory as don fernando our sovereign master ever gained over the moors  carrying off the princess yourselves as would seem friend sancho of the shipyardgate if that be thy appellation this tale of thine is ingenious but it lacketh probability were i to deal justly by thee honest sancho it would be to order thee the stripes thou merietst so well as a reward for this trifling  the man speaketh as he hath been taught observed mercedes in a low unsteady voice i fear señora there is too much truth in his tale  you need fear nothing beautiful señorita put in sancho altogether unmoved at the menace implied by the words of the marchioness since the battle hath been fought the victory hath been gained and both the heroes escaped uninjured this illustrious señora to whom i can forgive any thing as the aunt of the best friend i have on earthany thing spoken i meanwill remember that the haytians know nothing of arquebuses by means of which we defeated caonabo and also that many is the column of moors that don luis hath broken singly and by means of his own good lance  ay fellow answered doña beatriz but that hath been in the saddle behind plaits of steel and with a weapon that hath overturned even alonzo de ojeda  hast thou truly brought away with thee the princess thou hast named asked mercedes earnestly  i swear to it señora and señorita illustrious ladies both by the holy mass and all the saints in the calendar a princess moreover surpassing in beauty the daughters of our own blessed queen if the fair ladies who passed out of this room even now are they as i suspect  out upon thee knave cried the indignant beatrizi will no more of this and marvel that my nephew should have employed one of so loose a tongue on any of his errands go to and learn discretion ere the morning or the favor of even thy admiral will not save thy bones mercedes we will seek our restthe hour is late  sancho was immediately left alone and in a minute a page appeared to show him to the place where he was to pass the night the old mariner had grumbled a little to himself concerning the spirit of don luis aunt counted anew his gold and was about to take possession of his pallet when the same page reappeared to summon him to another interview sancho who knew little distinction between night and day made no objections especially when he was told that his presence was required by the lovely señorita whose gentle tremulous voice had so much interested him in the late interview mercedes received her rude guest in a small saloon of her own after having parted from her guardian for the night as he entered her face was flushed her eye bright and her whole demeanor to one more expert in detecting female emotions would have betrayed intense anxiety  thou hast had a long and weary journey sancho said our heroine when alone with the seaman and i pray thee accept this gold as a small proof of the interest with which i have heard the great tidings of which thou hast been the bearer  señorita exclaimed sancho affecting indifference to the doblas that fell into his handi hope you do not think me mercenary the honor of being the messenger and of being admitted to converse with such illustrious ladies more than pays me for any thing i could do  still thou mayst need money for thy wants and wilt not refuse that which a lady offereth  on that ground i would accept it doña señorita even were it twice as much  so saying sancho placed the money with a suitable resignation by the side of that which he had previously received by order of the queen mercedes now found herself in the situation that they who task their powers too much are often fated to endure in other words now she had at command the means of satisfying her own doubts she hesitated about using them  sancho mercedes at length commenced thou hast been with the señor colon throughout this great and extraordinary voyage and must know much that it will be curious for us who have lived quietly in spain to hear is all thou hast said about the princes and princesses true  as true señorita as such things need be for a history massany one who hath been in a battle or seen any other great adventure and then cometh to hear it read of afterward will soon learn to understand the difference between the thing itself and the history that may be given of it now i was  never mind thy other adventures good sancho tell me only of this are there really a prince mattinao and a princess ozema his sister and have both accompanied the admiral to spain  i said not that beautiful señorita for don mattinao remained behind to rule his people it is only his handsome sister who hath followed don christopher and don luis to palos  followeddo the admiral and the conde de llera possess such influence over royal ladies as to induce them to abandon their native country and to follow them to a foreign land  ay señorita that might seem out of rule in castile or portugal or even in france but hayti is not yet a christian country and a princess there may not be more than a noble lady in castile and in the way of wardrobe perhaps not even as much still a princess is a princess and a handsome princess is a handsome princess doña ozema here is a wonderful creature and beginneth already to prattle your pure castilian and she had been brought up at toledo or burgos but don luis is a most encouraging master and no doubt made great headway during the time he was living in her palace as it might be alone with her before that incarnate devil don caonabo came down with his followers to seize the lady  is this lady a christian princess sancho  heaven bless your own pure soul doña señorita she can boast of but little in that way still she hath made something of a beginning as i see she now weareth a crossone small in size it is true but precious in material as indeed it ought to be seeing that it is a present from one as noble and rich as the count of llera  a cross sayst thou sancho interrupted mercedes almost gasping for breath yet so far subduing her feelings as to prevent the old seaman from detecting them hath don luis succeeded in inducing her to accept of a cross  that hath he señoritaone of precious stones that he once wore at his own neck  knowest thou the stoneswas it of turquoise embellished with the finest gold  for the gold i can answer lady though my learning hath never reached as high as the precious stones the heavens of hayti however are not bluer than the stones of that cross doña ozema calls it mercedes by which i understand that she looketh for the mercies of the crucifixion to help her benighted soul  is this cross then held so common that it hath gotten to be the subject of discourse even for men of thy class  hearkee señorita a man like me is more valued on board a caravel in a tossing sea than he is likely to be here in barcelona on solid ground we went to cipango to set up crosses and to make christians so that all hath been in character as for the lady ozema she taketh more notice of me than of another as i was in the battle that rescued her from caonabo and so she showed me the cross the day we anchored in the tagus or just before the admiral ordered me to bring his letter to her highness then it was that she kissed the cross and held it to her heart and said it was mercedes  this is most strange sancho hath this princess attendants befitting her rank and dignity  you forget señorita that the niña is but a small craft as her name signifieth and there would be no room for a large train of lords and ladies don christopher and don luis are honorable enough to attend on any princess and for the rest the doña ozema must wait until our gracious queen can command her a retinue befitting her birth besides my lady these haytian dames are simpler than our spanish nobles half of them thinking clothes of no great use in that mild climate  mercedes looked offended and incredulous but her curiosity and interest were too active to permit her to send the man away without further question  and don luis de bobadilla was ever with the admiral she said ever ready to support him and foremost in all hazards  señorita you describe the count as faithfully as if you had been present from first to last had you but seen him dealing out his blows upon caonabos followers and the manner in which he kept them all at bay with the doña ozema near him behind the rocks it would have drawn tears of admiration from your own lovely eyes  the doña ozema near himbehind rocksand assailants held at bay  si señora you repeat it all like a book it was much as you say though the lady ozema did not content herself with being behind the rocks for when the arrows came thickest she rushed before the count compelling the enemy to withhold lest they should slay the very prize they were battling for thereby saving the life of her knight  saving his lifethe life of luisof don luis de bobadillaan indian princess  it is just as you say and a most noble girl she is asking pardon for speaking so light of one of her high rank time and again since that day hath the young count told me that the arrows came in such clouds that his honor might have been tarnished by a retreat or his life been lost but for the timely resolution of the doña ozema she is a rare creature señorita and you will love her as a sister when you come to see and know her  sancho said our heroine blushing like the dawn thou saidst that the conde de llera bade thee speak of him to his aunt did he mention no one else  no one señorita  art certain sancho bethink thee welldid he mention no other name to thee  not that i can swear it is true that either he or old diego the helmsman spoke of one clara that keepeth an hosteria here in barcelona as a place famous for its wine but i think it more likely to have been diego than the count as one thinketh much of these matters and the other would not be apt to know aught of clara  thou canst retire sancho said mercedes in a faint voice we will say more to thee in the morning  sancho was not sorry to be dismissed and he gladly returned to his pallet little dreaming of the mischief he had done by the mixture of truth and exaggeration that he had been recounting     chapter xxvii      machomer too in prose or song     by the statepapers of buffon       to deep researches led     a galloceltic scheme may botch     to prove the ourang race were scotch       who from the highlands fled      lord john townshend   the intelligence of the return of columbus and of the important discoveries he had made spread through europe like wildfire it soon got to be in the general estimation the great event of the age for several years afterward or until the discovery of the pacific by balboa it was believed that the indies had been reached by the western passage and of course the problem of the earths spherical shape was held to be solved by actual experiment the transactions of the voyage the wonders seen the fertility of the soil of the east the softness of its climate its treasures in gold spices and pearls and the curious things that the admiral had brought as proofs of his success were all the themes of the hour men never wearied in discussing the subjects for many centuries had the spaniards been endeavoring to expel the moors from the peninsula but as that muchdesired event had been the result of time and a protracted struggle even its complete success seemed tame and insignificant compared with the sudden brilliancy that shone around the western discoveries in a word the pious rejoiced in the hope of spreading the gospel the avaricious feasted their imaginations on untold hoards of gold the politic calculated the increase of the power of spain the scientific exulted in the triumph of mind over prejudice and ignorance while they hoped for still greater accessions of knowledge and the enemies of spain wondered and deferred even while they envied  the first few days that succeeded the arrival of columbus courier were days of delight and curiosity answers were sent soliciting his early presence high honors were proffered to him and his name filled all mouths as his glory was in the heart of every true spaniard orders were issued to make the necessary outfits for a new voyage and little was talked of but the discovery and its consequences in this manner passed a month when the admiral arrived at barcelona attended by most of the indians he had brought with him from the islands his honors were of the noblest kind the sovereigns receiving him on a throne placed in a public hall rising at his approach and insisting on his being seated himself a distinction of the highest nature and usually granted only to princes of royal blood here the admiral related the history of his voyage exhibited the curiosities he had brought with him and dwelt on his hopes of future benefits when the tale was told all present knelt and te deum was chanted by the usual choir of the court even ferdinands stern nature dissolving into tears of grateful joy at this unlookedfor and magnificent behest of heaven  for a long time columbus was the mark of every eye nor did his honors and consideration cease untill he left spain in command of the second expedition to the east as the voyage was then termed  a few days previously to the arrival of the admiral at court don luis de bobadilla suddenly appeared in barcelona on ordinary occasions the movements of one of the rank and peculiarities of the young grandee would have afforded a topic for the courtiers that would not soon have been exhausted but the allengrossing theme of the great voyage afforded him a screen his presence however could not escape notice and it was whispered with the usual smiles and shrugs that he had entered the port in a caravel coming from the levant and it was one of the received pleasantries of the hour to say in an undertone that the young conde de llera had also made the eastern voyage all this gave our hero little concern and he was soon pursuing his ordinary life when near the persons of the sovereigns the day that columbus was received in state he was present in the hall attired in the richest vestments and no noble of spain did more credit to his lineage or his condition than don luis by his mien and carriage it was remarked that isabella smiled on him during the pageant but the head of more than one wary observer was shaken as its owner remarked how grave the queens favorite appeared for an occasion so joyous a fact that was attributed to the unworthy pursuits of her truant nephew no one that day gazed at luis with more delight than sancho who lingered at barcelona to share in the honors of his chief and who in virtue of his services was permitted to take his place among the courtiers themselves not a little admiration was excited by the manner in which he used the novel weed called tobacco and some fifteen or twenty of his neighbors were nauseated by their efforts to emulate his indulgence and satisfaction one of his exploits was of a character so unusual and so well illustrates the feeling of the hour that it may be well to record it in detail  the reception was over and sancho was quitting the hall with the rest of the crowd when he was accosted by a man apparently of forty well attired and of agreeable manner who desired the honor of his presence at a slight entertainment of which several had been prepared for the admiral and his friends sancho nothing loth the delights of distinction being yet so novel cheerfully complied and he was quickly led to a room of the palace where he found a party of some twenty young nobles assembled to do him honor for happy was he that day in barcelona who could get even one of the meanest of columbus followers to accept of his homage no sooner did the two enter the room than the young castilian lords crowded around them covering sancho with protestations of admiration and addressing eager questions a dozen at a time to his companion whom they styled señor pedro señor matir and occasionally señor pedro matir it is scarcely necessary to add that this person was the historian who has become known to us of these latter days as peter martyr an italian to whose care and instruction isabella had entrusted most of the young nobles of the court the present interview had been got up to indulge the natural curiosity of the youthful lords and sancho had been chosen for the occasion on the principle that when the best is denied us we must be content to accept information of an inferior quality  congratulate me señores cried peter martyr as soon as he could find an opportunity to speak since my success surpasseth our own hopes as for the liguirian himself and all of high condition about him they are in the hands of the most illustrious of spain for this day but here is a most worthy pilot no doubt the second in authority on board one of the caravels who consenteth to do us honor and to partake of our homely cheer i drew him from a crowd of applicants and have not yet had an opportunity to inquire his name which he is about to give us of his own accord  sancho never wanted for selfpossession and had far too much motherwit to be either clownish or offensively vulgar though the reader is not now to be told that he was neither qualified to be an academician nor had the most profound notions of natural philosophy he assumed an air of suitable dignity therefore and somewhat practised in his new vocation by the thousand interrogatories he had answered in the last month he disposed himself to do credit to the information of a man who had visited the indies  i am called sancho mundo señores at your servicesometimes sancho of the shipyardgate though i would prefer now to be called sancho of the indies unless indeed it should suit his excellency don christopher to take that appellationhis claim being somewhat better than mine  here several protested that his claims were of the highest order and then followed sundry introductions to sancho of the shipyardgate of several young men of the first families in castile for though the spaniards have not the same mania for this species of politeness as the americans the occasion was one in which native feeling got the ascendency of conventional reserve after this ceremony and the mendozas guzmans cerdas and toledos present felt honored in knowing this humble seaman the whole party repaired to the banquetingroom where a table was spread that did credit to the cooks of barcelona during the repast although the curiosity of the young men made some inroads on their breeding in this particular no question could induce sancho to break in upon the duty of the moment for which he entertained a sort of religious veneration once when pushed a little more closely than common he laid down his knife and fork and made the following solemn reply  señores he said i look upon food as a gift from god to man and hold it to be irreverent to converse much when the bounties of the table invite us to do homage to this great dispenser don christopher is of this way of thinking i know and all his followers imitate their beloved and venerated chief as soon as i am ready to converse señores don hidalgos you shall be told of it and then god help the ignorant and silly  after this admonition there remained nothing to be said until sanchos appetite was satisfied when he drew a little back from the table and announced his readiness to proceed  i profess to very little learning señor pedro martir he said but what i have seen i have seen and that which is known is as well known by a mariner as by a doctor of salamanca ask your questions then o heavens sake and expect such answers as a poor but honest man can give  the learned peter martyr was fain to make the best of his subject for at that moment any information that came from what might be termed first hands was greedily received he proceeded therefore to his inquiries as simply and as directly as he had been invited to do  well señor commenced the man of learning we are willing to obtain knowledge on any terms prithee tell us at once which of all the wonderful things that you witnessed on this voyage hath made the deepest impression on your mind and striketh you as the most remarkable  i know nothing to compare with the whiffling of the north star said sancho promptly that star hath always been esteemed among us seamen as being immovable as the cathedral of seville but in this voyage it hath been seen to change its place with the inconstancy of the winds  that is indeed miraculous exclaimed peter martyr who scarcely knew how to take the intelligence perhaps there is some mistake master sancho and you are not accustomed to sidereal investigations  ask don christopher when the phernomerthon as the admiral called it was first observed we talked the matter over together and came to the conclusion that nothing in this world was as permanent as it seemed to be depend on it señor don pedro the north star flits about like a weathercock  i shall inquire into this of the illustrious admiral but next to this star master sancho what deem you most worthy of observation i speak now of ordinary things leaving science to future discussion  this was too grave a question to be lightly answered and while sancho was cogitating the matter the door opened and luis de bobadilla entered the room in a blaze of manly grace and rich attire a dozen voices uttered his name and peter martyr rose to receive him with a manner in which kindness of feeling was blended with reproof  i asked this honor señor conde he said though you have now been beyond my counsel and control some time for it appeared to me that one fond of voyages as yourself might find a useful lesson as well as enjoy a high satisfaction in listening to the wonders of an expedition as glorious as this of colons this worthy seaman a pilot no doubt much confided in by the admiral hath consented to share in our poor hospitalities on this memorable day and is about to give us many interesting facts and incidents of the great adventure master sancho mundo this is don luis de bobadilla conde de llera a grandee of high lineage and one that is not unknown to the seas having often traversed them in his own person  it is quite unnecessary to tell me that señor pedro answered sancho returning luis gay and graceful salutation with profound but awkward respect since i see it at a glance his excellency hath been in the east as well as don christopher and myself though we went different ways and neither party went as far as cathay i am honored in your acquaintance don luis and shall just say that the noble admiral will bring navigation more in fashion than it hath been of late years if you travel in the neighborhood of moguer i beg you will not pass the door of sancho mundo without stopping to inquire if he be within  that i most cheerfully promise worthy master said luis laughing and taking a seat even though it lead me to the shipyardgate and now señor pedro let me not interrupt the discourse which i discovered was most interesting as i entered  i have been thinking of this matter señores resumed sancho gravely and the fact that appears most curious to me next to the whiffling of the north star is the circumstance that there are no doblas in cipango gold is not wanting and it seemeth passing singular that a people should possess gold and not bethink them of the convenience of striking doblas or some similar coin  peter martyr and his young pupils laughed at this sally and then the subject was pushed in another form  passing by this question which belongeth rather to the policy of states than to natural phenomena continued peter martyr what most struck you as remarkable in the way of human nature  in that particular señor i think the island of the women may be set down as the most extraordinary of all the phernomerthons we fell in with i have known women shut themselves up in convents and men too but never did i hear before this voyage of either shutting themselves up in islands  and is this true inquired a dozen voicesdid you really meet with such an island señor  i believe we saw it at a distance señores and i hold it to be lucky that we went no nearer for i find the gossips of moguer troublesome enough without meeting a whole island of them then there is the bread that grows like a rootwhat think you of that señor don luis is it not a most curious dish to taste of  nay master sancho that is a question of your own putting and it must be one of your own answering what know i of the wonders of cipango since candia lieth in an opposite course answer these matters for thyself friend  true illustrious conde and i humbly crave your pardon it is indeed the duty of him that seeth to relate as it is the duty of him that seeth not to believe i hope all here will perform their several duties  do these indians eat flesh as remarkable as their bread inquired a cerda  that do they noble sir seeing that they eat each other neither i nor don christopher was invited to any of their feasts of this sort for i suppose they were well convinced we would not go but we had much information touching them and by the nearest calculation i could make the consumption of men in the island of bohio must be about equal to that of beeves in spain  the speaker was interrupted by twenty exclamations of disgust and peter martyr shook his head like one who distrusted the truth of the account still as he had not expected any very profound philosophy or deep learning in one of sanchos character he pursued the conversation  know you any thing of the rare birds the admiral exhibited to their highnesses today he asked  señor i am well acquainted with several more particularly with the parrots they are sensible birds and i doubt not might answer some of the questions that are put to me by many here in barcelona to their perfect satisfaction  thou art a wag i see señor sancho and lovest thy joke answered the man of learning with a smile give way to thy fancy and if thou canst not improve us with thy science at least amuse us with thy conceits  san pedro knows that i would do any thing to oblige you señores but i was born with such a love of truth in my heart that i know not how to embellish what i see i believe and having been in the indies i cannot shut my eyes to their wonders there was the sea of weeds which was no everyday miracle since i make no doubt that the devils piled all these plants on the water to prevent us from carrying the cross to the poor heathens who dwell on the other side of them we got through that sea more by our prayers than by means of the winds  the young men looked at peter martyr to ascertain how he received this theory and peter martyr if tinctured with the superstition of the age was not disposed to swallow all that it pleased sancho to assert even though the latter had made a voyage to the indies  since you manifest so much curiosity señores on the subject of colon now admiral of the ocean sea by their highnesses honorable appointment i will in a measure relieve your minds on the subject by recounting what i know said luis speaking calmly but with dignity ye know that i was much with don christopher before he sailed and that i had some little connection with bringing him back to santa fé even when he had left the place as was supposed for the last time this intimacy hath been renewed since the arrival of the great genoese at barcelona and hours have we passed together in private discoursing on the events of the last few months what i have thus learned i am ready to impart if ye will do me the grace to listen  the whole company giving an eager assent luis now commenced a general narrative of the voyage detailing all the leading circumstances of interest and giving the reasons that were most in favor at the time concerning the different phenomena that had perplexed the adventurers he spoke more than an hour proceeding consecutively from island to island and dilating on their productions imaginary and real much that he related proceeded from the misconceptions of the admiral and misinterpretations of the signs and language of the indians as a matter of course but it was all told clearly in elegant if not in eloquent language and with a singular air of truth in short our hero palmed upon his audience the results of his own observation as the narrative of the admiral and more than once was he interrupted by bursts of admiration at the vividness and graphic beauties of his descriptions even sancho listened with delight and when the young man concluded he rose from his chair and exclaimed heartily  señores you may take all this as so much gospel had the noble señor witnessed himself that which he hath so well described it could not have been truer and i look on myself to be particularly fortunate to have heard this history of the voyage which henceforth shall be my history word for word for as my patron saint shall remember me naught else will i tell to the gossips of moguer when i get back to that blessed town of my childhood  sanchos influence was much impaired by the effects of luis narrative which peter martyr pronounced to be one that would have done credit to a scholar who had accompanied the expedition a few appeals were made to the old seaman to see if he would corroborate the statements he had just heard but his protestations became so much the louder in behalf of the accuracy of the account  it was wonderful how much reputation the conde de llera obtained by this little deception to be able to repeat with accuracy and effect language that was supposed to have fallen from the lips of columbus was a sort of illustration and peter martyr who justly enjoyed a high reputation for intelligence was heard sounding the praises of our hero in all places his young pupils echoing his words with the ardor and imitation of youth such indeed was the vast reputation obtained by the genoese that one gained a species of reflected renown by being thought to live in his confidence and a thousand follies of the count of llera real or imaginary were forgotten in the fact that the admiral had deemed him worthy of being the repository of facts and feelings such as he had related as luis moreover was seen to be much in the company of don christopher the world was very willing to give the young man credit for qualities that by some unexplained circumstance had hitherto escaped its notice in this manner did luis de bobadilla reap some advantages of a public character from his resolution and enterprise although vastly less than would have attended an open admission of all that occurred how far and in what manner these qualities availed him in his suit with mercedes will appear in our subsequent pages  illustration     chapter xxviii      each look each motion waked a newborn grace       that oer her form its transient glory cast     some lovelier wonder soon usurpd the place       chased by a charm still lovelier than the last      mason   the day of the reception of columbus at barcelona had been one of tumultuous feelings and of sincere delight with the ingenuous and pureminded queen of castile she had been the moving spirit of the enterprise as it was connected with authority and means and never was a sovereign more amply rewarded by a consciousness of the magnitude of the results that followed her wellmeant and zealous efforts  when the excitement and bustle of the day were over isabella retired to her closet and there as was usual with her on all great occasions she poured out her thankfulness on her knees entreating the divine providence to sustain her under the new responsibilities she felt and to direct her steps aright equally as a sovereign and as a christian woman she had left the attitude of prayer but a few minutes and was seated with her head leaning on her hand in deep meditation when a slight knock at the door called her attention there was but one person in spain who would be likely to take even this liberty guarded and modest as was the tap rising she turned the key and admitted the king  isabella was still beautiful her form always of admirable perfection still retained its grace her eyes had lost but little of their lustre and her smile ever sweet and beneficent failed not to reflect the pure and womanly impulses of her heart in a word her youthful beauty had been but little impaired by the usual transition to the matronly attractions of a wife and a mother but this night all her youthful charms seemed to be suddenly renewed her cheek was flushed with holy enthusiasm her figure dilated with the sublimity of the thoughts in which she had been indulging and her eyes beamed with the ennobling hopes of religious enthusiasm ferdinand was struck with this little change and he stood admiring her for a minute in silence after he had closed the door  is not this a most wonderful reward for efforts so small my husband and love exclaimed the queen who fancied the kings thoughts similar to her own a new empire thus cheaply purchased with riches that the imagination cannot tell and millions of souls to be redeemed from eternal woe by means of a grace that must be as unexpected to themselves as the knowledge of their existence hath been to us  ever thinking isabella of the welfare of souls but thou art right for what are the pomps and glories of the world to the hopes of salvation and the delights of heaven i confess colon hath much exceeded all my hopes and raised such a future for spain that the mind scarce knoweth where to place the limits to its pictures  think of the millions of poor indians that may live to bless our sway and to feel the influence and consolations of holy church  i trust that our kinsman and neighbor dom joao will not give us trouble in this matter your portuguese have so keen an appetite for discoveries that they little relish the success of other powers and it is said many dangerous and wicked proposals were made to the king even while our caravels lay in the tagus  colon assureth me fernando that he doubteth if these indians have now any religious creed so that our ministers will have no prejudices to encounter in presenting to their simple minds the sublime truths of the gospel  no doubt the admiral hath fully weighed these matters it is his opinion that the island he hath called española wanteth but little of being of the full dimensions of castile leon aragon granada and indeed of all our possessions within the peninsula  didst thou attend to what he said touching the gentleness and mildness of the inhabitants and wert thou not struck with the simple confiding aspects of those he hath brought with him such a people may readily be brought first as is due to worship the one true and living god and next to regard their sovereigns as kind and benignant parents  authority can ever make itself respected and don christopher hath assured me in a private conference that a thousand tried lances would overrun all that eastern region we must make early application to the holy father to settle such limits between us and don john as may prevent disputes hereafter touching our several interests i have already spoken to the cardinal on this subject and he flattereth me with the hope of having the ear of alexander  i trust that the means of disseminating the faith of the cross will not be overlooked in the negotiation for it paineth me to find churchmen treating of worldly things to the utter neglect of those of their great master  don ferdinand regarded his wife intently for an instant without making any reply he perceived as often happened in questions of policy that their feelings were not exactly attuned and he had recourse to an allusion that seldom failed to draw the thoughts of isabella from their loftier aspirations to considerations more worldly when rightly applied  thy children doña isabella will reap a goodly heritage by the success of this our latest and greatest stroke of policy thy dominions and mine will henceforth descend in common to the same heir then this marriage in portugal may open the way to new accessions of territory granada is already secured to thine by our united arms and here hath providence opened the way to an empire in the east that promiseth to outdo all that hath yet been performed in europe  are not my children thine fernando can good happen to one without its equally befalling the other i trust they will learn to understand why so many new subjects and such wide territories are added to their possessions and will ever remain true to their highest and first duty that of spreading the gospel that the sway of the one catholic church may the more speedily be accomplished  still it may be necessary to secure advantages that are offered in a worldly shape by worldly means  thou sayst true my lord and it is the proper care of loving parents to look well to the interest of their offspring in this as in all other particulars  isabella now lent a more willing ear to the politic suggestions of her consort and they passed an hour in discussing some of the important measures that it was thought their joint interests required should be immediately attended to after this ferdinand saluted his wife affectionately and withdrew to his own cabinet to labor as usual until his frame demanded rest  isabella sat musing for a few minutes after the king had retired and then she took a light and proceeded through certain private passages with which she was familiar to the apartment of her daughters here she spent an hour indulging in the affections and discharging the duties of a careful mother when embracing each in turn she gave her blessings and left the place in the same simple manner as she had entered instead however of returning to her own part of the palace she pursued her way in an opposite direction until reaching a private door she gently tapped a voice within bade her enter and complying the queen of castile found herself alone with her old and tried friend the marchioness of moya a quiet gesture forbade all the usual testimonials of respect and knowing her mistress wishes in this particular the hostess received her illustrious guest much as she would have received an intimate of her own rank in life  we have had so busy and joyful a day daughtermarchioness the queen commenced quietly setting down the little silver lamp she carried that i had near forgotten a duty which ought not to be overlooked thy nephew the count de llera hath returned to court bearing himself as modestly and as prudently as if he had no share in the glory of this great success of colons  señora luis is here but whether prudent or modest i leave for others who may be less partial to say  to me such seemeth to be his deportment and a young mind might be pardoned some exultation at such a result but i have come to speak of don luis and thy ward now that thy nephew hath given me this high proof of his perseverance and courage there can remain no longer any reason for forbidding their union thou knowst that i hold the pledged word of doña mercedes not to marry without my consent and this night will i make her happy as i feel myself by leaving her mistress of her own wishes nay by letting her know that i desire to see her countess of llera and that right speedily  your highness is all goodness to me and mine returned the marchioness coldly mercedes ought to feel deeply grateful that her royal mistress hath a thought for her welfare when her mind hath so many greater concerns to occupy it  it is that my friend that hath brought me hither at this late hour my soul is truly burdened with gratitude and ere i sleep were it possible i would fain make all as blessed as i feel myself where is thy ward  she left me for the night but as your highness entered i will summon her to hear your pleasure  we will go to her beatriz tidings such as i bring should not linger on weary feet  it is her duty and it would be her pleasure to pay all respect señora  i know that well marchioness but it is my pleasure to bear this news myself interrupted the queen leading the way to the door show thou the way which is better known to thee than to another we go with little state and ceremony as thou seest like colon going forth to explore his unknown seas and we go bearers of tidings as grateful to thy ward as those the genoese bore to the benighted natives of cipango these corridors are our trackless seas and all these intricate passages the hidden ways we are to explore  heaven grant your highness make not some discovery as astounding as that which the genoese hath just divulged for myself i scarce know whether to believe all things or to grant faith to none  i wonder not at thy surprise it is a feeling that hath overcome all others through the late extraordinary events answered the queen evidently misconceiving the meaning of her friends words but we have still another pleasure in store that of witnessing the joy of a pure female heart which hath had its trials and which hath borne them as became a christian maiden  doña beatriz sighed heavily but she made no answer by this time they were crossing the little saloon in which mercedes was permitted to receive her female acquaintances and were near the door of her chamber here they met a maid who hastened onward to inform her mistress of the visit she was about to receive isabella was accustomed to use a mothers liberties with those she loved and opening the door without ceremony she stood before our heroine ere the latter could advance to meet her  daughter commenced the queen seating herself and smiling benignantly on the startled girl i have come to discharge a solemn duty kneel thou here at my feet and listen to thy sovereign as thou wouldst listen to a mother  mercedes gladly obeyed for at that moment any thing was preferable to being required to speak when she had knelt the queen passed an arm affectionately round her neck and drew her closer to her person until by a little gentle violence the face of mercedes was hid in the folds of isabellas robe  i have all reason to extol thy faith and duty child said the queen as soon as this little arrangement to favor the feelings of mercedes had been considerately made thou hast not forgotten thy promise in aught and my object now is to leave thee mistress of thine own inclinations and to remove all impediments to their exercise thou hast no longer any pledge with thy sovereign for one who hath manifested so much discretion and delicacy may be surely trusted with her own happiness  mercedes continued silent though isabella fancied that she felt a slight shudder passing convulsively through her delicate frame  no answer daughter is it more preferable to leave another arbitress of thy fate than to exercise that office for thyself well then as thy sovereign and parent i will substitute command for consent and tell thee it is my wish and desire that thou becomest as speedily as shall comport with propriety and thy high station the wedded wife of don luis de bobadilla conde de llera  nononoseñoranevernevermurmured mercedes her voice equally stifled by her emotions and by the manner in which she had buried her face in the dress of the queen  isabella looked at the marchioness of moya in wonder her countenance did not express either displeasure or resentment for she too well knew the character of our heroine to suspect caprice or any weak prevarication in a matter that so deeply touched the feelings and the concern she felt was merely overshadowed at the suddenness of the intelligence by a feeling of ungovernable surprise  canst thou explain this beatriz the queen at length inquired have i done harm where i most intended good i am truly unfortunate for i appear to have deeply wounded the heart of this child at the very moment i fancied i was conferring supreme happiness  nononoseñora again murmured mercedes clinging convulsively to the queens knees your highness hath wounded no onewould wound no onecan wound no oneyou are all gracious goodness and thoughtfulness  beatriz i look to thee for the explanation hath aught justifiable occurred to warrant this change of feeling  i fear dearest señora that the feelings continue too much as formerly and that the change is not in this young and unpractised heart but in the fickle inclinations of man  a flash of womanly indignation darted from the usually serene eyes of the queen and her form assumed all of its native majesty  can this be true she exclaimed would a subject of castile dare thus to trifle with his sovereignthus to trifle with one sweet and pure as this girlthus to trifle with his faith with god if the reckless conde thinketh to do these acts of wrongfulness with impunity let him look to it shall i punish him that merely depriveth his neighbor of some paltry piece of silver and let him escape who woundeth the soul i wonder at thy calmness daughtermarchioness thou who art so wont to let an honest indignation speak out in the just language of a fearless and honest spirit  alas señora my beloved mistress my feelings have had vent already and nature will no more this boy moreover is my brothers son and when i would fain arouse a resentment against him such as befitteth his offence the image of that dear brother whose very picture he is hath arisen to my mind in a way to weaken all its energy  this is most unusual a creature so fairso youngso nobleso richevery way so excellent to be so soon forgotten canst thou account for it by any wandering inclination lady of moya  isabella spoke musingly and as one of her high rank is apt to overlook minor considerations when the feelings are strongly excited she did not remember that mercedes was a listener the convulsive shudder that again shook the frame of our heroine however did not fail to remind her of this fact and the queen could not have pressed the princess juana more fondly to her heart than she now drew the yielding form of our heroine  what would you señora returned the marchioness bitterly luis thoughtless and unprincipled boy as he is hath induced a youthful indian princess to abandon home and friends under the pretence of swelling the triumph of the admiral but really in obedience to a wandering fancy and in submission to those evil caprices that make men what in sooth they are and which so often render unhappy women their dupes and their victims  an indian princess sayst thou the admiral made one of that rank known to us but she was already a wife and far from being one to rival doña mercedes of valverde  ah dearest señora she of whom you speak will not compare with her i meanozemafor so is the indian lady calledozema is a different being and is not without high claims to personal beauty could mere personal appearances justify the conduct of the boy he would not be altogether without excuse  how knowst thou this beatriz  because your highness luis hath brought her to the palace and she is at this moment in these very apartments mercedes hath received her like a sister even while the stranger hath unconsciously crashed her heart  here sayst thou marchioness then can there be no vicious union between the thoughtless young man and the stranger thy nephew would not thus presume to offend virtue and innocence  of that we complain not señora tis the boyish inconstancy and thoughtless cruelty of the count that hath awakened my feelings against him never have i endeavored to influence my ward to favor his suit for i would not that they should have it in their power to say i sought a union so honorable and advantageous to our house but now do i most earnestly desire her to steel her noble heart to his unworthiness  ah señoramy guardian murmured mercedes luis is not so very culpable ozemas beauty and my own want of the means to keep him true are alone to blame  ozemas beauty slowly repeated the queen is this young indian then so very perfect beatriz that thy ward need fear or envy her i did not think that such a being lived  your highness knoweth how it is with men they love novelties and are most captivated with the freshest faces san iagoandres de cabrera hath caused me to know this though it were a crime to suppose any could teach this hard lesson to isabella of trastamara  restrain thy strong and impetuous feelings daughtermarchioness returned the queen glancing her eye at the bowed form of mercedes whose head was now buried in her lap truth seldom asserts its fullest power when the heart is overflowing with feeling don andres hath been a loyal subject and doth justice to thy merit and as to my lord the king he is the father of my children as well as thy sovereign but touching this ozemacan i see her beatriz  you have only to command señora to see whom you please but ozema is no doubt at hand and can be brought into your presence as soon as it may please your highness to order it done  nay beatriz if she be a princess and a stranger in the kingdom there is a consideration due to her rank and to her position let doña mercedes go and prepare her to receive us i will visit her in her own apartment the hour is late but she will overlook the want of ceremony in the desire to do her service  mercedes did not wait a second bidding but rising from her knees she hastened to do as the queen had suggested isabella and the marchioness were silent some little time when left to themselves then the former as became her rank opened the discourse  it is remarkable beatriz that colon should not have spoken to me of this princess she said one of her condition ought not to have entered spain with so little ceremony  the admiral hath deemed her the chosen subject of luis care and hath left her to be presented to your highness by my recreant nephew ah señora is it not wonderful that one like mercedes could be so soon supplanted by a halfnaked unbaptized benighted being on whom the church hath never yet smiled and whose very soul may be said to be in jeopardy of instantaneous condemnation  that soul must be cared for beatriz and that right quickly is the princess really of sufficient beauty to supplant a creature as lovely as the doña mercedes  it is not that señorait is not that but men are fickleand they so love novelties then is the modest restraint of cultivated manners less winning to them than the freedom of those who deem even clothes superfluous i mean not to question the modesty of ozema for according to her habits she seemeth irreproachable in this respect but the illregulated fancy of a thoughtless boy may find a momentary attraction in her unfettered conduct and halfattired person that is wanting to the air and manners of a highborn spanish damsel who hath been taught rigidly to respect herself and her sex  this may be true as toucheth the vulgar beatriz but such unworthy motives can never influence the conde de llera if thy nephew hath really proved the recreant thou supposest this indian princess must be of more excellence than we have thought  of that señora you can soon judge for yourself here is the maiden of mercedes to inform us that the indian is ready to receive the honor that your highness intendeth  our heroine had prepared ozema to meet the queen by this time the young haytian had caught so many spanish words that verbal communication with her was far from difficult though she still spoke in the disconnected and abrupt manner of one to whom the language was new she understood perfectly that she was to meet that beloved sovereign of whom luis and mercedes had so often spoken with reverence and accustomed herself to look up to caciques greater than her brother there was no difficulty in making her understand that the person she was now about to receive was the first of her sex in spain the only misconception which existed arose from the circumstance that ozema believed isabella to be the queen of all the christian world instead of being the queen of a particular country for in her imagination both luis and mercedes were persons of royal station  although isabella was prepared to see a being of surprising perfection of form she started with surprise as her eye first fell on ozema it was not so much the beauty of the young indian that astonished her as the native grace of her movements the bright and happy expression of her countenance and the perfect selfpossession of her mien and deportment ozema had got accustomed to a degree of dress that she would have found oppressive at hayti the sensitiveness of mercedes on the subject of female propriety having induced her to lavish on her new friend many rich articles of attire that singularly though wildly contributed to aid her charms still the gift of luis was thrown over one shoulder as the highestprized part of her wardrobe and the cross of mercedes rested on her bosom the most precious of all her ornaments  this is wonderful beatriz exclaimed the queen as she stood at one side of the room while ozema bowed her body in graceful reverence on the other can this rare being really have a soul that knoweth naught of its god and redeemer but let her spirit be benighted as it may there is no vice in that simple mind or deceit in that pure heart  señora all this is true spite of our causes of dissatisfaction my ward and i both love her already and could take her to our hearts forever one as a friend and the other as a parent  princess said the queen advancing with quiet dignity to the spot where ozema stood with downcast eyes and bended body waiting her pleasure thou art welcome to our dominions the admiral hath done well in not classing one of thy evident claims and station among those whom he hath exhibited to vulgar eyes in this he hath shown his customary judgment no less than his deep respect for the sacred office of sovereigns  almirante exclaimed ozema her looks brightening with intelligence for she had long known how to pronounce the wellearned title of columbus almirante mercedesisabella mercedesluis mercedes señora reyña  beatriz what meaneth this why doth the princess couple the name of thy ward with that of colon with mine and even with that of the young count of llera  señora by some strange delusion she hath got to think that mercedes is the spanish term for every thing that is excellent or perfect and thus doth she couple it with all that she most desireth to praise your highness must observe that she even united luis and mercedes a union that we once fondly hoped might happen but which now would seem to be impossible and which she herself must be the last really to wish  strange delusion repeated the queen the idea hath had its birth in some particular cause for things like this come not of accidents who but thy nephew beatriz would know aught of thy ward or who but he would have taught the princess to deem her very name a sign of excellence  señora exclaimed mercedes the color mounting to her pale cheek and joy momentarily flashing in her eyes can this be so  why not daughter we may have been too hasty in this matter and mistaken what are truly signs of devotion to thee for proofs of fickleness and inconstancy  ah señora but this can never be else would not ozema so love him  how knowst thou child that the princess hath any other feeling for the count than that which properly belongeth to one who is grateful for his care and for the inexpressible service of being made acquainted with the virtues of the cross here is some rash error beatriz  i fear not your highness touching the nature of ozemas feelings there can be no misconception since the innocent and unpractised creature hath not art sufficient to conceal them that her heart is all luis we discovered in the first few hours of our intercourse and it is too pure unsought to be won the feeling of the indian is not merely admiration but it is such a passionate devotion as partaketh of the warmth of that sun which we are told glows with a heat so genial in her native clime  could one see so much of don luis señora added mercedes under circumstances to try his martial virtues and so long daily be in communion with his excellent heart and not come to view him as far above all others  martial virtuesexcellent heartslowly repeated the queen and yet so regardless of the wrong he doeth he is neither knight nor cavalier worthy of the sex if what thou thinkest be true child  nay señora earnestly resumed the girl whose diffidence was yielding to the wish to vindicate our hero the princess hath told us of the manner in which he rescued her from her greatest enemy and persecutor caonabo a headstrong and tyrannical sovereign of her island and of his generous selfdevotion in her behalf  daughter do thou withdraw and first calling on holy maria to intercede for thee seek the calm of religious peace and submission on thy pillow beatriz i will question the princess alone  the marchioness and mercedes immediately withdrew leaving isabella with ozema in possession of the room the interview that followed lasted more than an hour that time being necessary to enable the queen to form an opinion of the strangers explanations with the imperfect means of communication she possessed that ozemas whole heart was luis isabella could not doubt unaccustomed to conceal her preferences the indian girl was too unpractised to succeed in such a design had she even felt the desire to attempt it but in addition to her native ingenuousness ozema believed that duty required her to have no concealments from the sovereign of luis and she laid bare her whole soul in the simplest and least disguised manner  princess said the queen after the conversation had lasted some time and isabella believed herself to be in possession of the means of comprehending her companion i now understand your tale caonabo is the chief or if thou wilt the king of a country adjoining thine own he sought thee for a wife but being already married to more than one princess thou didst very properly reject his unholy proposals he then attempted to seize thee by violence the conde de llera was on a visit to thy brother at the time  luisluisthe girl impatiently interrupted in her sweet soft voiceluis no condeluis  true princess but the conde de llera and luis de bobadilla are one and the same person luis then if thou wilt was present in thy palace and he beat back the presumptuous cacique who not satisfied with fulfilling the law of god by the possession of one wife impiously sought in thy person a second or a third and brought thee off in triumph thy brother next requested thee to take shelter for a time in spain and don luis becoming thy guardian and protector hath brought thee hither to the care of his aunt  ozema bowed her head in acknowledgment of the truth of this statement most of which she had no difficulty in understanding the subject having of late occupied so much of her thoughts  and now princess continued isabella i must speak to thee with maternal frankness for i deem all of thy birth my children while they dwell in my realms and have a right to look to me for advice and protection hast thou any such love for don luis as would induce thee to forget thine own country and to adopt his in its stead  ozema dont know what adopt his means observed the puzzled girl  i wish to inquire if thou wouldst consent to become the wife of don luis de bobadilla  wife and husband were words of which the indian girl had early learned the signification and she smiled guilelessly even while she blushed and nodded her assent  i am then to understand that thou expectest to marry the count for no modest young female like thee would so cheerfully avow her preference without having that hope ripened in her heart to something like a certainty  si señoraozema luis wife  thou meanest princess that ozema expecteth shortly to wed the countshortly to become his wife  nononoozema now luis wife luis marry ozema already  can this be so exclaimed the queen looking steadily into the face of the beautiful indian to ascertain if the whole were not an artful deception but the open and innocent face betrayed no guilt and isabella felt compelled to believe what she had heard in order however to make certain of the fact she questioned and crossquestioned ozema for near half an hour longer and always with the same result  when the queen arose to withdraw she kissed the princess for so she deemed this wild creature of an unknown and novel state of society and whispered a devout prayer for the enlightenment of her mind and for her future peace on reaching her own apartment she found the marchioness of moya in attendance that tried friend being unable to sleep until she had learned the impressions of her royal mistress  tis even worse than we had imagined beatriz said isabella as the other closed the door behind her thine heartless inconstant nephew hath already wedded the indian and she is at this moment his lawful wife  señora there must be some mistake in this the rash boy would hardly dare to practise this imposition on me and that in the very presence of mercedes  he would sooner place his wife in thy care daughtermarchioness than make the same disposition of one who had fewer claims on him but there can be no mistake i have questioned the princess closely and no doubt remaineth in my mind that the nuptials have been solemnized by religious rites it is not easy to understand all she would wish to say but that much she often and distinctly hath affirmed  your highnesscan a christian contract marriage with one that is yet unbaptized  certainly not in the eye of the church which is the eye of god but i rather think ozema hath received this holy rite for she often pointed to the cross she weareth when speaking of the union with thy nephew indeed from her allusions i understood her to say that she became a christian ere she became a wife  and that blessed cross señora was a gift of mercedes to the reckless fickleminded boy a parting gift in which the holy symbol was intended to remind him of constancy and faith  the world maketh so many inroads into the hearts of men beatriz that they know not womans reliance and womans fidelity but to thy knees and bethink thee of asking for grace to sustain thy ward in this cruel but unavoidable extremity  isabella now turned to her friend who advanced and raised the hand of her royal mistress to her lips the queen however was not content with this salutation warm as it was passing an arm around the neck of doña beatriz she drew her to her person and imprinted a kiss on her forehead  adieu beatriztrue friend as thou art she said if constancy hath deserted all others it hath still an abode in thy faithful heart  with these words the queen and the marchioness separated each to find her pillow if not her repose     chapter xxix      now gondarino what can you put on now     that may deceive us     have ye more strange illusions yet more mists     through which the weak eye may be led to error     what can ye say that may do satisfaction     both for her wronged honor and your ill      beaumont and fletcher   the day which succeeded the interview related in the preceding chapter was that which cardinal mendoza had selected for the celebrated banquet given to columbus on this occasion most of the high nobility of the court were assembled in honor of the admiral who was received with a distinction which fell little short of that usually devoted to crowned heads the genoese bore himself modestly though nobly in all these ceremonies and for the hour all appeared to delight in doing justice to his great exploits and to sympathize in a success so much surpassing the general expectation every eye seemed riveted on his person every ear listened eagerly to the syllables as they fell from his lips every voice was loud and willing in his praise  as a matter of course on such an occasion columbus was expected to give some account of his voyage and adventures this was not an easy task since it was virtually asserting how much his own perseverance and spirit his sagacity and skill were superior to the knowledge and enterprise of the age still the admiral acquitted himself with dexterity and credit touching principally on those heads which most redounded to the glory of spain and the lustre of the two crowns  among the guests was luis de bobadilla the young man had been invited on account of his high rank and in consideration of the confidence and familiarity with which he was evidently treated by the admiral the friendship of columbus was more than sufficient to erase the slightly unfavorable impressions that had been produced by luis early levities and men quietly submitted to the influence of the great mans example without stopping to question the motive or the end the consciousness of having done that which few of his station and hopes would ever dream of attempting gave to the proud mien and handsome countenance of luis a seriousness and elevation that had not always been seated there and helped to sustain him in the good opinion that he had otherwise so cheaply purchased the manner in which he had related to peter martyr and his companions the events of the expedition was also remembered and without understanding exactly why the world was beginning to associate him in some mysterious manner with the great western voyage owing to these accidental circumstances our hero was actually reaping some few of the advantages of his spirit though in a way he had never anticipated a result by no means extraordinary men as often receiving applause or reprobation for acts that were never meditated as for those for which reason and justice would hold them rigidly responsible  here is a health to my lord their highnesses admiral of the ocean sea cried luis de st angel raising his cup so that all at the board might witness the act spain oweth him her gratitude for the boldest and most beneficial enterprise of the age and no good subject of the two sovereigns will hesitate to do him honor for his services  the bumper was drunk and the meek acknowledgments of columbus listened to in respectful silence  lord cardinal resumed the freespeaking accountant of the churchs revenues i look upon the churchs cure as doubled by these discoveries and esteem the number of souls that will be rescued from perdition by the means that will now be employed to save them as forming no small part of the lustre of the exploit and a thing not likely to be forgotten at rome  thou sayst well good de st angel returned the cardinal and the holy father will not overlook gods agent or his assistants knowledge came from the east and we have long looked forward to the time when purified by revelation and the high commission that we hold direct from the source of all power it would be rolled backward to its place of beginning but we now see that its course is still to be westward reaching asia by a path that until this great discovery was hid from human eyes  although so much apparent sympathy ruled at the festival the human heart was at work and envy the basest and perhaps the most common of our passions was fast swelling in more than one breath the remark of the cardinal produced an exhibition of the influence of this unworthy feeling that might otherwise have been smothered among the guests was a noble of the name of juan de orbitello and he could listen no longer in silence to the praises of those whose breath he had been accustomed to consider fame  is it so certain holy sir he said addressing his host that god would not have directed other means to be employed to effect this end had these of don christopher failed or are we to look upon this voyage as the only known way in which all these heathen could be rescued from perdition  no one may presume señor to limit the agencies of heaven returned the cardinal gravely nor is it the office of man to question the means employed or to doubt the power to create others as wisdom may dictate least of all should laymen call in question aught that the church sanctioneth  this i admit lord cardinal answered the señor de orbitello a little embarrassed and somewhat vexed at the implied rebuke of the churchmans remarks and it was the least of my intentions to do so but you señor don christopher did you deem yourself an agent of heaven in this expedition  i have always considered myself a most unworthy instrument set apart for this great end señor returned the admiral with a grave solemnity that was well suited to impose on the spectators from the first i have felt this impulse as being of divine origin and i humbly trust heaven is not displeased with the creature it hath employed  do you then imagine señor almirante that spain could not produce another fitted equally with yourself to execute this great enterprise had any accident prevented either your sailing or your success  the boldness as well as the singularity of this question produced a general pause in the conversation and every head was bent a little forward in expectation of the reply columbus sat silent for more than a minute then reaching forward he took an egg and holding it up to view he spoke mildly but with great gravity and earnestness of manner  señores he said is there one here of sufficient expertness to cause this egg to stand on its end if such a man be present i challenge him to give us an exhibition of his skill  the request produced a good deal of surprise but a dozen immediately attempted the exploit amid much laughter and many words more than once some young noble thought he had succeeded but the instant his fingers quitted the egg it rolled upon the table as if in mockery of his awkwardness  by saint luke señor almirante but this notable achievement surpasseth our skill cried juan de orbitello here is the conde de llera who hath slain so many moors and who hath even unhorsed alonzo de ojeda in a tourney can make nothing of his egg in the way you mention  and yet it will no longer be difficult to him or even to you señor when the art shall be exposed  saying thus columbus tapped the smaller end of his egg lightly on the table when the shell being forced in it possessed a base on which it stood firmly and without tremor a murmur of applause followed this rebuke and the lord of orbitello was fain to shrink back into an insignificance from which it would have been better for him never to have emerged at this precise instant a royal page spoke to the admiral and then passed on to the seat of don luis de bobadilla  i am summoned hastily to the presence of the queen lord cardinal observed the admiral and look to your grace for an apology for my withdrawing the business is of weight by the manner of the message and you will pardon my now quitting the board though it seem early  the usual reply was made and bowed to the door by his host and all present columbus quitted the room almost at the same instant he was followed by the conde de llera  whither goest thou in this hurry don luis demanded the admiral as the other joined him art thou in so great haste to quit a banquet such as spain hath not often seen except in the palaces of her kings  by san iago nor there neither señor answered the young man gaily if king ferdinands board be taken as the sample but i quit this goodly company in obedience to an order of doña isabella who hath suddenly summoned me to her royal presence  then señor conde we go together and are like to meet on the same errand i too am hastening to the apartments of the queen  it gladdens my heart to hear this señor as i know of but one subject on which a common summons should be sent to us this affair toucheth on my suit and doubtless you will be required to speak of my bearing in the voyage  my mind and my time have been so much occupied of late with public cares luis that i have not had an occasion to question you of this how fareth the lady of valverde and when will she deign to reward thy constancy and love  señor i would i could answer the last of these questions with greater certainty and the first with a lighter heart since my return i have seen doña mercedes but thrice and though she was all gentleness and truth my suit for the consummation of my happiness hath been coldly and evasively answered by my aunt her highness is to be consulted it would seem and the tumult produced by the success of the voyage hath so much occupied her that there hath been no leisure to wait on trifles such as those that lead to the felicity of a wanderer like myself  then is it like luis that we are indeed summoned on this very affair else why should thou and i be brought together in a manner so unusual and so sudden  our hero was not displeased to fancy this and he entered the apartments of the queen with a step as elastic and a mien as bright as if he had come to wed his love the admiral of the ocean sea as columbus was now publicly called had not long to wait in antechambers and ere many minutes he and his companion were ushered into the presence  isabella received her guests in private there being no one in attendance but the marchioness of moya mercedes and ozema the first glances of their eyes told columbus and luis that all was not right every countenance denoted that its owner was endeavoring to maintain a calmness that was assumed the queen herself was serene and dignified it is true but her brow was thoughtful her eye melancholy and her cheek slightly flushed as for doña beatriz sorrow and indignation struggled in her expressive face and luis saw with concern that her look was averted from him in a way she always adopted when he had seriously incurred her displeasure mercedes lips were pale as death though a bright spot like vermilion was stationary on each cheek her eyes were downcast and all her mien was humbled and timid ozema alone seemed perfectly natural still her glances were quick and anxious though a gleam of joy danced in her eyes and even a slight exclamation of delight escaped her as she beheld luis whom she had seen but once since her arrival in barcelona already near a month  isabella advanced a step or two to meet the admiral and when the last would have kneeled she hurriedly prevented the act by giving him her hand to kiss  not sonot solord admiral exclaimed the queen this is homage unsuited to thy high rank and eminent services if we are thy sovereigns so are we also thy friends i fear my lord cardinal will scarce pardon the orders i sent him seeing that it hath deprived him of thy society somewhat sooner than he may have expected  his eminence and all his goodly company have that to muse on señora that may yet occupy them some time returned columbus smiling in his grave manner doubtless they will less miss me than at an ordinary time were it otherwise both i and this young count would not scruple to quit even a richer banquet to obey the summons of your highness  i doubt it not señor but i have desired to see thee this night on a matter of private rather than of public concernment doña beatriz here hath made known to me the presence at court as well as the history of this fair being who giveth one an idea so much more exalted of thy vast discoveries that i marvel she should ever have been concealed knowst thou her rank don christopher and the circumstances that have brought her to spain  señora i do in part through my own observation and in part from the statements of don luis de bobadilla i consider the rank of the lady ozema to be less than royal and more than noble if our opinions will allow us to imagine a condition between the two though it must always be remembered that hayti is not castile the one being benighted under the cloud of heathenism and the other existing in the sunshine of the church and civilization  nevertheless don christopher station is station and the rights of birth are not impaired by the condition of a country although it hath pleased him already and will still further please the head of the church to give us rights in our characters of christian princes over these caciques of india there is nothing unusual or novel in the fact the relation between the suzerain and the lieges is ancient and well established and instances are not wanting in which powerful monarchs have held certain of their states by this tenure while others have come direct from god in this view i feel disposed to consider the indian lady as more than noble and have directed her to be treated accordingly there remaineth only to relate the circumstances that have brought her to spain  these can better come from don luis than from me señora he being most familiar with the events  nay señor i would hear them from thine own lips i am already possessed of the substance of the conde de lleras story  columbus looked both surprised and pained but he did not hesitate about complying with the queens request  hayti hath its greater and its lesser princes or caciques your highness he added the last paying a species of homage and owing a certain allegiance to the first as hath been said  thou seest daughtermarchioness this is but a natural order of government prevailing equally in the east and in the west  of the first of these was guacanagari of whom i have already related so much to your highness continued columbus and of the last mattinao the brother of this lady don luis visited the cacique mattinao and was present at an inroad of caonabo a celebrated carib chief who would fain have made a wife of her who now stands in this illustrious presence the conde conducted himself like a gallant castilian cavalier routed the foe saved the lady and brought her in triumph to the ships here it was determined she should visit spain both as a means of throwing more lustre on the two crowns and of removing her for a season from the attempts of the carib who is too powerful and warlike to be withstood by a race as gentle as that of mattinaos  this is well señor and what i have already heard but how happeneth it that ozema did not appear with the rest of thy train in the public reception of the town  it was the wish of don luis it should be otherwise and i consented that he and his charge should sail privately from palos with the expectation of meeting me in barcelona we both thought the lady ozema too superior to her companions to be exhibited to rude eyes as a spectacle  there was delicacy if there were not prudence in the arrangement the queen observed a little drily then the lady ozema hath been some weeks solely in the care of the conde de llera  i so esteem it your highness except as she hath been placed under the guardianship of the marchioness of moya  was this altogether discreet don christopher or as one prudent as thou shouldst have consented to  señora exclaimed luis unable to restrain his feelings longer  forbear young sir commanded the queen i shall have occasion to question thee presently when thou mayst have a need for all thy readiness to give the fitting answers doth not thy discretion rebuke thy indiscretion in this matter lord admiral  señora the question like its motive is altogether new to me i have the utmost reliance on the honor of the count and then did i know that his heart hath long been given to the fairest and worthiest damsel of spain besides my mind hath been so much occupied with the grave subjects of your highness interests that it hath had but little opportunity to dwell on minor things  i believe thee señor and thy pardon is secure still for one so experienced it was a sore indiscretion to trust to the constancy of a fickle heart when placed in the body of a lightminded and truant boy and now conde de llera i have that to say to thee which thou mayst find it difficult to answer thou assentest to all that hath hitherto been said  certainly señora don christopher can have no motive to misstate even were he capable of the meanness i trust our house hath not been remarkable in spain for recreant and false cavaliers  in that i fully agree if thy house hath had the misfortune to produce one untrue and recreant heart it hath the gloryglancing at her friendof producing others that might equal the constancy of the most heroic minds of antiquity the lustre of the name of bobadilla doth not altogether depend on the fidelity and truth of its headnay hear me sir and speak only when thou art ready to answer my questions thy thoughts of late have been bent on matrimony  señora i confess it is it an offence to dream of the honorable termination of a suit that hath been long urged and which i had dared to hope was finally about to receive your own royal approbation  it is then as i feared beatriz exclaimed the queen and this benighted but lovely being hath been deceived by the mockery of a marriage for no subject of castile would dare thus to speak of wedlock in my presence with the consciousness that his vows had actually and lawfully been given to another both the church and the prince would not be thus braved by even the greatest profligate of spain  señora your highness speaketh most cruelly even while you speak in riddles cried luis may i presume to ask if i am meant in these severe remarks  of whom else should we be speaking or to whom else allude thou must have the inward consciousness unprincipled boy of all thy unworthiness and yet thou darest thus to brave thy sovereignnay to brave that suffering and angelic girl with a mien as bold as if sustained by the purest innocence  señora i am no angel myself however willing to admit doña mercedes to be one neither am i a saint of perfect purity perhapsin a word i am luis de bobadillabut as far from deserving these reproaches as from deserving the crown of martyrdom let me humbly demand my offence  simply that thou hast either cruelly deceived by a feigned marriage this uninstructed and confiding indian princess or hast insolently braved thy sovereign with the professions of a desire to wed another with thy faith actually plighted at the altar to another of which of these crimes thou art guilty thou knowst best thyself  and thou my auntthou mercedesdost thou too believe me capable of this  i fear it is but too true returned the marchioness coldly the proof is such that none but an infidel could deny belief  mercedes  no luis answered the generous girl with a warmth and feeling that broke down the barriers of all conventional restrainti do not think thee base as thisi do not think thee base at all merely unable to restrain thy wandering inclinations i know thy heart too well and thine honor too well to suppose aught more than a weakness that thou wouldst fain subdue but canst not  god and the holy virgin be blessed for this cried the count who had scarcely breathed while his mistress was speaking any thing but thy entertaining so low an opinion of me may be borne  there must be an end of this beatriz and i see no surer means than by proceeding at once to the facts said the queen come hither ozema and let thy testimony set this matter at rest forever  the young indian who comprehended spanish much better than she expressed herself in the language although far from having even a correct understanding of all that was said immediately complied her whole soul being engrossed with what was passing while her intelligence was baffled in its attempts thoroughly to comprehend it mercedes alone had noted the workings of her countenance as isabella reproved or luis made his protestations and they were such as completely denoted the interest she felt in our hero  ozema resumed the queen speaking slowly and with deliberate distinctness in order that the other might get the meaning of her words as she proceeded speakart thou wedded to luis de bobadilla or not  ozema luis wife answered the girl laughing and blushing luis ozemas husband  this is plain as words can make it don christopher and is no more than she hath already often affirmed on my anxious and repeated inquiries how and when did luis wed thee ozema  luis wed ozema with religionwith spaniards religion ozema wed luis with love and dutywith hayti manner  this is extraordinary señora observed the admiral and i would gladly look into it have i your highness permission to inquire into the affair myself  do as thou wilt señor returned the queen coldly my own mind is satisfied and it behoveth my justice to act speedily  conde de llera dost thou admit or dost thou deny that thou art the husband of the lady ozema demanded columbus gravely  lord admiral i deny it altogether neither have i wedded her nor hath the thought of so doing with any but mercedes ever crossed my mind  this was said firmly and with the open frankness that formed a principal charm in the young mans manner  hast thou then wronged her and given her a right to think that thou didst mean wedlock  i have not mine own sister would not have been more respected than hath ozema been respected by me as is shown by the fact that i have hastened to place her in the care of my dear aunt and in the company of doña mercedes  this seemeth reasonable señora for man hath ever that much respect for virtue in your sex that he hesitateth to offend it even in his levities  in opposition to all these protestations and to so much fine virtue señor colon we have the simple declaration of one untutored in deceptiona mind too simple to deceive and of a rank and hopes that would render such a fraud as unnecessary as it would be unworthy beatriz thou dost agree with me and it cannot find an apology for this recreant knight even though he were once the pride of thy house  señora i know not whatever may have been the failings and weaknesses of the boyand heaven it knows that they have been manydeception and untruth have never made a part i have even ascribed the manner in which he hath placed the princess in my immediate care to the impulses of a heart that did not wish to conceal the errors of the head and to the expectation that her presence in my family might sooner bring me to a knowledge of the truth i could wish that the lady ozema might be questioned more closely in order that we make certain of not being under the delusion of some strange error  this is right observed isabella whose sense of justice ever inclined her to make the closest examination into the merits of every case that required her decision the fortune of a grandee depends on the result and it is meet he enjoy all fair means of vindicating himself from so heinous an offence sir count thou canst therefore question her in our presence touching all proper grounds of inquiry  señora it would ill become a knight to put himself in array against a lady and she too of the character and habits of this stranger answered luis proudly coloring as he spoke with the consciousness that ozema was utterly unable to conceal her predilection in his favor if such an office is indeed necessary its functions would better become another  as the stern duty of punishing must fall on me the queen calmly observed i will then assume this unpleasant office señor almirante we may not shrink from any obligation that brings us nearer to the greatest attribute of god his justice princess thou hast said that don luis hath wedded thee and that thou considerest thyself his wife when and where didst thou meet him before a priest  so many attempts had been made to convert ozema to christianity that she was more familiar with the terms connected with religion than with any other part of the language though her mind was a confused picture of imaginary obligations and of mystical qualities like all who are not addicted to abstractions her piety was more connected with forms than with principles and she was better disposed to admit the virtue of the ceremonies of the church than the importance of its faith the question of the queen was understood and therefore it was answered without guile or a desire to deceive  luis wed ozema with christians cross she said pressing to her heart the holy emblem that the young man had given to her in a moment of great peril and in a manner the reader already knows luis think he about to dieozema think she about to dieboth wish to die man and wife and luis wed with the cross like good spanish christian ozema wed luis in her heart like hayti lady in her own country  here is some mistakesome sad mistake growing out of the difference of language and customs observed the admiral don luis hath not been guilty of this deception i witnessed the offering of that cross which was made at sea during a tempest and in a way to impress me favorably with the counts zeal in behalf of a benighted soul there was no wedlock there nor could any but one who hath confounded our usages through ignorance imagine more than the bestowal of a simple emblem that it was hoped might be useful in extremity to one that had not enjoyed the advantages of baptism and the churchs offices  don luis dost thou confirm this statement and also assert that thy gift was made solely with this object asked the queen  señora it is most true death was staring us in the face and i felt that this poor wanderer who had trusted herself to our care with the simple confidence of a child needed some consolation none seemed so meet at the moment as that memorial of our blessed redeemer and of our own redemption to me it seemed the preservative next to baptism  hast thou never stood before a priest with her nor in any manner abused her guileless simplicity  señora it is not my nature to deceive and every weakness of which i have been guilty in connexion with ozema shall be revealed her beauty and her winning manners speak for themselves as doth her resemblance to doña mercedes the last greatly inclined me to her and had not my heart been altogether anothers it would have been my pride to make the princess my wife but we met too late for that and even the resemblance led to comparisons in which one educated in infidelity and ignorance must necessarily suffer that i have had moments of tenderness for ozema i will own but that they ever supplanted or came near supplanting my love for mercedes i do deny if i have any fault to answer for to the lady ozema it is because i have not always been able to suppress the feelings that her likeness to the doña mercedes and her own ingenuous simplicitychiefly the formerhave induced never otherwise in speech or act have i offended against her  this soundeth upright and true beatriz thou knowst the count better than i and can easier say how far we ought to confide in these explanations  my life on their truth my beloved mistress luis is no hypocrite and i rejoiceoh how exultingly do i rejoiceat finding him able to give this fair vindication of his conduct ozema who hath heard of our form of wedlock and hath seen our devotion to the cross hath mistaken her position as she hath my nephews feelings and supposed herself a wife when a christian girl would not have been so cruelly deceived  this really hath a seeming probability señores continued the queen with her sexs sensitiveness to her sexs delicacy of sentiment not to say to her sexs rightsthis toucheth of a ladysnay of a princess feelings and must not be treated of openly it is proper that any further explanations should be made only among females and i trust to your honor as cavaliers and nobles that what hath this night been said will never be spoken of amid the revels of men the lady ozema shall be my care and count of llera thou shalt know my final decision tomorrow concerning doña mercedes and thyself  as this was said with a royal as well as with a womanly dignity no one presumed to demur but making the customary reverences columbus and our hero left the presence it was late before the queen quitted ozema but what passed in this interview will better appear in the scenes that are still to be given     chapter xxx      when sinking low the sufferer wan     beholds no arm outstretchd to save     fair as the bosom of the swan     that rises graceful oer the wave     ive seen your breast with pity heave     and therefore love you sweet genevieve      coleridge   when isabella found herself alone with ozema and mercedes for she chose that the last should be present she entered on the subject of the marriage with the tenderness of a sensitive and delicate mind but with a sincerity that rendered further error impossible the result showed how naturally and cruelly the young indian beauty had deceived herself ardent confiding and accustomed to be considered the object of general admiration among her own people ozema had fancied that her own inclinations had been fully answered by the young man from the first moment they met with the instinctive quickness of a woman she perceived that she was admired and as she gave way to the excess of her own feelings it was almost a necessary consequence of the communications she held with luis that she should think they were reciprocated the very want of language in words by compelling a substitution of one in looks and acts contributed to the mistake and it will be remembered that if luis constancy did not actually waver it had been sorely tried the false signification she attached to the word mercedes largely aided in the delusion and it was completed by the manly tenderness and care with which our hero treated her on all occasions even the rigid decorum that luis invariably observed and the severe personal respect which he maintained toward his charge had their effect on her feelings for wild and unsophisticated as had been her training the deep and unerring instinct of the feeble told her the nature of the power she was wielding over the strong  then came the efforts to give her some ideas of religion and the deep and lamentable mistakes which imperfectly explained and worse understood subtleties left on her plastic mind ozema believed that the spaniards worshipped the cross she saw it put foremost in all public ceremonies knelt to and apparently appealed to on every occasion that called for an engagement more solemn than usual whenever a knight made a vow he kissed the cross of his swordhilt the mariners regarded it with reverence and even the admiral had caused one to be erected as a sign of his right to the territory that had been ceded to him by guacanagari in a word to her uninstructed imagination it seemed as if the cross were used as a pledge for the fidelity of all engagements often had she beheld and admired the beautiful emblem worn by our hero and as the habits of her own people required the exchange of pledges of value as a proof of wedlock she fancied when she received this muchvalued jewel that she received the sign that our hero took her for a wife at a moment when death was about to part them forever further than this her simplicity and affections did not induce her to reason or to believe  it was an hour before isabella elicited all these facts and feelings from ozema though the latter clearly wished to conceal nothing in truth had nothing to conceal the painful part of the duty remained to be discharged it was to undeceive the confiding girl and to teach her the hard lesson of bitterness that followed this was done however and the queen believing it best to remove all delusion on the subject finally succeeded in causing her to understand that before the count had ever seen herself his affections were given to mercedes who was in truth his betrothed wife nothing could have been gentler or more femininely tender than the manner in which the queen made her communication but the blow struck home and isabella herself trembled at the consequences of her own act never before had she witnessed the outbreaking of feeling in a mind so entirely unsophisticated and the images of what she then saw haunted her troubled slumbers for many succeeding nights  as for columbus and our hero they were left mainly in the dark as to what had occurred for the following week it is true luis received a kind and encouraging note from his aunt the succeeding day and a page of mercedes silently placed in his hand the cross that he had so long worn but beyond this he was left to his own conjectures the moment for explanation however arrived and the young man received a summons to the apartment of the marchioness  luis did not as he expected meet his aunt on reaching the saloon which he found empty questioning the page who had been his usher he was desired to wait for the appearance of some one to receive him patience was not a conspicuous virtue in our heros character and he excited himself by pacing the room for near half an hour ere he discovered a single sign that his visit was remembered just as he was about to summon an attendant however again to announce his presence a door was slowly opened and mercedes stood before him  the first glance that the young man cast upon his betrothed told him that she was suffering under deep mental anxiety the hand which he eagerly raised to his lips trembled and the color came and went on her cheeks in a way to show that she was nearly overcome still she rejected the glass of water that he offered putting it aside with a faint smile and motioning her lover to take a chair while she calmly placed herself on a tabouretone of the humble seats she was accustomed to occupy in the presence of the queen  i have asked for this interview don luis mercedes commenced as soon as she had given herself time to command her feelings in order that there may no longer be any reasons for mistaking our feelings and wishes you have been suspected of having married the lady ozema and there was a moment when you stood on the verge of destruction through the displeasure of doña isabella  but blessed mercedes you never imputed to me this act of deception and unfaithfulness  i told you truth señorfor that i knew you too well i felt certain that whenever luis de bobadilla had made up his mind to the commission of such a step he would also have the manliness and courage to avow it i never for an instant believed that you had wedded the princess  why then those cold and averted lookseyes that sought the floor rather than the meeting of glances that love delights in and a manner which if it hath not absolutely displayed aversion hath at least manifested a reserve and distance that i had never expected to witness from thee to me  mercedes color changed and she made no answer for a minute during which little interval she had doubts of her ability to carry out her own purpose rallying her courage however the discourse was continued in the same manner as before  hear me don luis she resumed for my history will not be long when you left spain at my suggestion to enter on this great voyage you loved meof that grateful recollection no earthly power can deprive me yes you then loved me and me only we parted with our troth plighted to each other and not a day went by during your absence that i did not pass hours on my knees beseeching heaven in behalf of the admiral and his followers  beloved mercedes it is not surprising that success crowned our efforts such an intercessor could not fail to be heard  i entreat you sir to hear me until the eventful day which brought the tidings of your return no spanish wife could have felt more concern for him on whom she had placed all her hopes than i felt for you to me the future was bright and filled with hope if the present was loaded with fear and doubt the messenger who reached the court first opened my eyes to the sad realities of the world and taught me the hard lesson the young are ever slow to learnthat of disappointment it was then i first heard of ozemaof your admiration of her beautyyour readiness to sacrifice your life in her behalf  holy luke did that vagabond sancho dare to wound thy ear mercedes with an insinuation that touched the strength or the constancy of my love for thee  he related naught but the truth luis and blame him not i was prepared for some calamity by his report and i bless god that it came on me by such slow degrees and with the means of preparation to bear it when i beheld ozema i no longer wondered at thy change of feelingscarce blamed it her beauty i do think thou mightst have withstood but her unfeigned devotion to thyself her innocence her winning simplicity and her modest joyousness and nature are sufficient to win a lover from any spanish maiden  mercedes  nay luis i have told thee that i blame thee not it is better that the blow come now than later when i should not be able to bear it there is something which tells me that as a wife i should sink beneath the weight of blighted affections but now there are open to me the convent and the espousals of the son of god do not interrupt me luis she added smiling sweetly but with an effort that denoted how difficult it was to seem easy i have to struggle severely to speak at all and to an argument i am altogether unequal thou hast not been able to control thy affections and to the strange novelties that have surrounded ozema as well as to her winning ingenuousness i owe my loss and she oweth her gain it is the will of heaven and i strive to think it is to my everlasting advantage had i really wedded thee the tenderness that is even now swelling in my hearti wish not to conceal itmight have grown to such a strength as to supplant the love i owe to god it is therefore doubtless better as it is if happiness on earth is not to be my lot i shall secure happiness hereafter nay all happiness here will not be lost i can still pray for thee as well as for myselfand thou and ozema of all earthly beings will ever be uppermost in my thoughts  this is so wonderful mercedesso cruelso unreasonableand so unjust that i cannot credit my ears  i have said that i blame thee not the beauty and frankness of ozema are more than sufficient to justify thee for men yield to the senses rather than to the heart in bestowing their love thenmercedes blushed crimson as she continueda haytian maid may innocently use a power that it would ill become a christian damsel to employ and now we will come to facts that press for a decision ozema hath been illis still illdangerously so as her highness and my guardian believeeven as the physicians saybut it is in thy power luis to raise her as it might be from the grave see hersay but the word that will confer happinesstell her if thou hast not yet wedded her after the manner of spain that thou wiltnay let one of the holy priests who are in constant attendance on her to prepare the way for baptism perform the ceremony this very morning and we shall presently see the princess again the smiling radiant joyous creature she was when thou first placed her in our care  and this thou sayst to me mercedes calmly and deliberately as if thy words express thy very wishes and feelings  calmly i may seem to say it luis answered our heroine in a smothered tone and deliberately i do say it marry me loving another better thou canst not and why not then follow whither thy heart leadeth the dowry of the princess shall not be small for the convent recluse hath little need of gold and none of lands  luis gazed earnestly at the enthusiastic girl who in his eyes never appeared more lovely then rising he paced the room for three or four minutes like one who wished to keep down mental agony by physical action when he had obtained a proper command of himself he returned to his seat and taking the unresisting hand of mercedes he replied to her extraordinary proposal  watching over the sick couch of thy friend and too much brooding on this subject love hath impaired thy judgment ozema hath no hold on my heart in the way thou fanciestnever had beyond a passing and truant inclination  ah luis those passing and truant inclinations none suchpressing both her hands on her own hearthave ever found a place here  thy education and mine mercedesthy habits and minenay thy nature and the ruder elements of mine are not cannot be the same were they so i should not worship thee as i now do but didst thou not exist the certainty that i should wed ozema would not give me happinessbut thou existing and beloved as thou art it would entail on me a misery that even my buoyant nature could not endure in no case can i ever be the husband of the indian  although a gleam of happiness illumined the face of mercedes for a moment her high principles and pure intentions soon suppressed the momentary and unbidden triumph and even with a reproving manner she made her answer  is this just to ozema hath not her simplicity been deluded by those passing and truant inclinations and doth not honor require that thy acts now redeem the pledges that have been given by at least thy manner  mercedesbeloved girl hearken to me thou must know that with all my levities and backslidings i am no coxcomb never hath my manner said aught that the heart did not confirm and never hath the heart been drawn toward any but thee in this is the great distinction that i make between thee and all others of thy sex ozemas is not the only form hers are not the only charms that may have caught a truant glance from my eyes or extorted some unmeaning and bootless admiration but thou love art enshrined here and seemest already a part of myself didst thou know how often thy image hath proved a monitor stronger than conscience on how many occasions the remembrance of thy virtues and thy affections hath prevailed when even duty and religion and early lessons would have been forgotten thou wouldst understand the difference between the love i bear thee and what thou hast so tauntingly repeated as truant and passing inclinations  luis i ought not to listen to these alluring words which come from a goodness of heart that would spare me present pain only to make my misery in the end the deeper if thou hast never felt otherwise why was the cross that i gave thee at parting bestowed on another  mercedes thou knowst not the fearful circumstances under which i parted with that cross death was staring us in the face and i gave it as a symbol that might aid a heathen soul in its extremity that the gift or rather that the thing i lent was mistaken for a pledge of matrimony is an unhappy misconception that your own knowledge of christian usages will tell you i could not foresee otherwise i might now claim thee for my wife in consequence of having first bestowed it on me  ah luis when i gave thee that cross i did wish to be understood as plighting my faith to thee forever  and when thou didst send it back to me now within the week how was it thy wish to be understood  i sent it to thee luis in a moment of reviving hope and by the order of the queen her highness is now firmly thy friend and would fain see us united but for the melancholy condition of ozema to whom all has been explainedall as i fear except the real state of thy feelings toward us both  cruel girl am i then never to be believednever again to be happy i swear to thee dearest mercedes that thou alone hast my whole heartthat with thee i could be contented in a hovel and that without thee i should be miserable on a throne thou wilt believe this when thou seest me a wretch wandering the earth reckless alike of hopes and objects perhaps of character because thou alone canst make me and keep me the man i ought to be bethink thee mercedes of the influence thou canst havemust havewilt have on one of my temperament and passions i have long looked upon thee as my guardian angel one that can mould me to thy will and rule me when all others fail with theethe impatience produced by thy doubts exceptedam i not ever tractable and gentle hath doña beatriz ever exercised a tithe of thy power over me and hast thou ever failed to tame even my wildest and rashest humors  luisluisno one that knew it ever doubted of thy heart mercedes paused and the working of her countenance proved that the earnest sincerity of her lover had already shaken her doubts of his constancy still her mind reverted to the scenes of the voyage and her imagination portrayed the couch of the stricken ozema after a minutes delay she proceeded in a low humbled tonei will not deny that it is soothing to my heart to hear this language to which i fear i listen too readily she said still i find it difficult to believe that thou canst ever forget one who hath even braved the chances of death in order to shelter thy body from the arrows of thy foes  believe not this beloved girl thou wouldst have done that thyself in ozemas place and so i shall ever consider it  i should have the wish luis mercedes continued her eyes suffused with tears but i might not have the power  thou wouldstthou wouldsti know thee too well to doubt it  i could envy ozema the occasion were it not sinful i fear thou wilt think of this when thy mind shall have tired with attractions that have lost their novelty  thou wouldst not only have done it but thou wouldst have done it far better ozema moreover was exposed in her own quarrel whilst thou wouldst have exposed thyself in mine  mercedes again paused and appeared to muse deeply her eyes had brightened under the soothing asseverations of her lover and spite of the generous selfdevotion with which she had determined to sacrifice all her own hopes to what she had imagined would make her lover happy the seductive influence of requited affection was fast resuming its power  come with me then luis and behold ozema she at length continued when thou seest her in her present state thou wilt better understand thine own intentions i ought not to have suffered thee thus to revive thy ancient feelings in a private interview ozema not being present it is like forming a judgment on the hearing of only one side and luisher heightened color the effect of feeling not of shame rendered the girl surpassingly beautifuland luis if thou shouldst find reason to change thy language after visiting the princess however hard i may find it to be borne thou wilt be certain of my forgiveness for all that hath passed and of my prayers  sobs interrupted mercedes and she stopped an instant to wipe away her tears rejecting luis attempt to fold her in his arms in order to console her with a sensitive jealousy of the result a feeling however in which delicacy had more weight than resentment when she had dried her eyes and otherwise removed the traces of her agitation she led the way to the apartment of ozema where the presence of the young man was expected  luis started on entering the room a little on perceiving that the queen and the admiral were present and more at observing the inroads that disappointment had made on the appearance of ozema the color of the latter was gone leaving a deadly paleness in its place her eyes possessed a brightness that seemed supernatural and yet her weakness was so evident as to render it necessary to support her in a halfrecumbent posture on pillows an exclamation of unfeigned delight escaped her when she beheld our hero and then she covered her face with both her hands in childish confusion as if ashamed at betraying the pleasure she felt luis behaved with manly propriety for though his conscience did not altogether escape a few twinges at the recollection of the hours he had wasted in ozemas society and at the manner in which he had momentarily submitted to the influence of her beauty and seductive simplicity on the whole he stood selfacquitted of any thing that might fairly be urged as a fault and most of all of any thought of being unfaithful to his first love or of any design to deceive he took the hand of the young indian respectfully and he kissed it with an openness and warmth that denoted brotherly tenderness and regard rather than passion or the emotion of a lover mercedes did not dare to watch his movements but she observed the approving glance that the queen threw at her guardian when he had approached the couch on which ozema lay this glance she interpreted into a sign that the count had acquitted himself in a manner favorable to her own interests  thou findest the lady ozema weak and changed observed the queen who alone would presume to break a silence that was already awkward we have been endeavoring to enlighten her simple mind on the subject of religion and she hath at length consented to receive the holy sacrament of baptism the lord archbishop is even now preparing for the ceremony in my oratory and we have the blessed prospect of rescuing this one precious soul from perdition  your highness hath ever the good of all your people at heart said luis bowing low to conceal the tears that the condition of ozema had drawn from his eyes i fear this climate of ours ill agrees with the poor haytians generally for i hear that the sick among them at seville and palos offer but little hope of recovery  is this so don christopher  señora i believe it is only too true care hath been had however to their souls as well as to their bodies and ozema is the last of her people now in spain to receive the holy rite of christian baptism  señora said the marchioness coming from the couch with surprise and concern in her countenance i fear our hopes are to be defeated after all the lady ozema hath just whispered me that luis and mercedes must first be married in her presence ere she will consent to be admitted within the pale of the church herself  this doth not denote the right spirit beatrizand yet what can be done with a mind so little illuminated with the light from above tis merely a passing caprice and will be forgotten when the archbishop shall be ready  i think not señora never have i seen her so decided and clear in common we find her gentle and tractable but this hath she thrice said in a way to cause the belief of her perfect seriousness  isabella now advanced to the couch and spoke long and soothingly to the invalid in the meantime the admiral conversed with the marchioness and luis again approached our heroine the evidences of emotion were plain in both and mercedes scarce breathed not knowing what to expect but a few low words soon brought an assurance that could not fail to bring happiness spite of her generous efforts to feel for ozemathat the heart of our hero was all her own from this moment mercedes dismissed every doubt and she regarded luis as had so long been her wont  as is usual in the presence of royalty the conversation was carried on in a low tone and a quarter of an hour elapsed before a page announced that the oratory or little chapel was ready opening a door that communicated directly with it as he entered  this wilful girl persisteth daughtermarchioness said the queen advancing from the side of the couch and i know not what to answer it is cruel to deny her the offered means of grace and yet it is a sudden and unseemly request to make of thy nephew and thy ward  as for the first dearest señora never distrust his forgiveness though i much doubt the possibility of prevailing on mercedes her very nature is made up of religion and female decorum  it is indeed scarce right to think of it a christian maiden should have time to prepare her spirit for the holy sacrament of marriage by prayer  and yet señora many wed without it the time hath been when don ferdinand of aragon and doña isabella might not have hesitated for such a purpose  that time never was beatriz thou hast a habit of making me look back to our days of trial and youth whenever thou wouldst urge on me some favorite but illconsidered wish of thine own dost really think thy ward would overlook the want of preparation and time  i know not what she might feel disposed to overlook señora but i do know that if there be one woman in spain who is at all times ready in spirit for the most sacred rites of the church it is your highness and if there be another it is my ward  go togo togood beatriz flattery sitteth ill on thee none are always ready and all have an unceasing need for watchfulness bid doña mercedes follow to my closet i will converse with her on this subject at least there shall be no unfeminine and unseemly surprise  so saying the queen withdrew she had hardly reached her closet before our heroine entered with a doubtful and timid step as soon as her eyes met those of her sovereign mercedes burst into tears and falling on her knees she again buried her face in the robe of doña isabella this outbreak of feeling was soon subdued however and then the girl stood erect waiting her sovereigns pleasure  daughter commenced the queen i trust there is no longer any misapprehension between thee and the conde de llera thou knowst the views of thy guardian and myself and mayst in a matter like this with safety defer to our cooler heads and greater experience don luis loveth thee and hath never loved the princess though it would not be out of character did an impetuous young man who hath been much exposed to temptation betray some transient and passing feeling toward one of so much nature and beauty  luis hath admitted all señora inconstant he hath never been though he may have had his weaknesses  tis a hard lesson to learn child even in this stage of thy life said the queen gravely but it would have been harder were it deferred until the nearer tenderness of a wife had superseded the impulses of the girl thou hast heard the opinions of the learned there is little hope that the princess ozema can long survive  ah señora tis a cruel fate to die among strangers in the flower of her beauty and with a heart crushed by the weight of unrequited love  and yet mercedes if heaven open on her awaking eyes when the last earthly scene is over the transition will be most blessed and they who mourn her loss would do wiser to rejoice one so youthful and so innocent whose pure mind hath been laid bare to us as it might be and which we have found wanting in nothing beside the fruits of a pious instruction can have little to apprehend on the score of personal errors all that is required for such a being is to place her within the covenant of gods grace by obtaining the rite of baptism and there is not a bishop of the church that could depart with brighter hopes for the future  that holy office is my lord archbishop about to administer as i hear señora  that somewhat dependeth on thee daughter listen and be not hasty in thy decision which may touch on the security of a human soul  the queen now related to mercedes the romantic request of ozema placing it before her listener in terms so winning and gentle that it produced less surprise and alarm than she herself had anticipated  doña beatriz hath a proposal that may at first appear plausible but which reflection will not sanction her design was to cause the count actually to wed ozemamercedes started and turned palein order that the last hours of the young stranger might be soothed by the consciousness of being the wife of the man she idolized but i have found serious objections to the scheme what is thy opinion daughter  señora could i believeas lately i did but now do notthat luis had such a preference for the princess as might lead him in the end to the happiness of that mutual affection without which wedlock must be a curse instead of a blessing i would be the last to object nay i think i could even beg the boon of your highness on my knees for she who so truly loveth can only seek the felicity of its object but i am assured the count hath not the affection for the lady ozema that is necessary to this end and would it not be profane señora to receive the churchs sacraments under vows that the heart not only does not answer to but against which it is actually struggling  excellent girl these are precisely my own views and in this manner have i answered the marchioness the rites of the church may not be trifled with and we are bound to submit to sorrows that may be inflicted after all for our eternal good though it be harder to bear those of others than to bear our own it remaineth only to decide on this whim of ozemas and to say if thou wilt now be married in order that she may be baptized  notwithstanding the devotedness of feeling with which our heroine loved luis it required a strong struggle with her habits and her sense of propriety to take this great step so suddenly and with so little preparation the wishes of the queen however prevailed for isabella felt a deep responsibility on her own soul in letting the stranger depart without being brought within the pale of the church when mercedes consented she despatched a messenger to the marchioness and then she and her companion both knelt and passed near an hour together in the spiritual exercises that were usual to the occasion in this mood did these pureminded females without a thought to the vanities of the toilet but with every attention to the mental preparations of which the case admitted present themselves at the door of the royal chapel through which ozema had just been carried still stretched on her couch the marchioness had caused a white veil to be thrown over the head of mercedes and a few proper but slight alterations had been made in her attire out of habitual deference to the altar and its ministers  about a dozen persons deemed worthy of confidence were present already and just as the bride and bridegroom were about to take their places don ferdinand hastily entered carrying in his hand some papers which he had been obliged to cease examining in order to comply with the wishes of his royal consort the king was a dignified prince and when it suited him no sovereign enacted his part more gracefully or in better taste motioning the archbishop to pause he directed luis to kneel throwing over the shoulder of the young man the collar of one of his own orders he said  now arise noble sir and ever do thy duty to thy heavenly master as thou hast of late discharged it toward us  isabella rewarded her husband for this act of grace by an approving smile and the ceremony immediately proceeded in the usual time our hero and heroine were pronounced man and wife and the solemn rites were ended mercedes felt in the warm pressure with which luis held her to his heart that she now understood him and for a blissful instant ozema was forgotten in the fulness of her own happiness columbus had given away the bridean office that the king had assigned to him though he stood at the bridegrooms side himself with a view to do him honor and even so far condescended as to touch the canopy that was held above the heads of the newmarried couple but isabella kept aloof placing herself near the couch of ozema whose features she watched throughout the ceremony she had felt no occasion for public manifestations of interest in the bride their feelings having so lately been poured out together in dear and private communion the congratulations were soon over and then don ferdinand and all but those who were in the secret of ozemas history withdrew  the queen had not desired her husband and the other attendants to remain and witness the baptism of ozema out of a delicate feeling for the condition of a female stranger whom her habits and opinions had invested with a portion of the sacred rights of royalty she had noted the intensity of feeling with which the halfenlightened girl watched the movements of the archbishop and the parties and the tears had forced themselves from her own eyes at witnessing the struggle between love and friendship that was portrayed in every lineament of her pale but still lovely countenance  where cross ozema eagerly demanded as mercedes stooped to fold the wasted form of the young indian in her arms and to kiss her cheek give crossluis no marry with crossgive ozema cross  mercedes herself took the cross from the bosom of her husband where it had lain near his heart since it had been returned to him and put it in the hands of the princess  no marry with cross then murmured the girl the tears suffusing her eyes so as nearly to prevent her gazing at the muchprized bauble now quick señora and make ozema christian  the scene was getting to be too solemn and touching for many words and the archbishop at a sign from the queen commenced the ceremony it was of short duration and isabellas kind nature was soon quieted with the assurance that the stranger whom she deemed the subject of her especial care was put within the covenant for salvation that had been made with the visible church  is ozema christian now demanded the girl with a suddenness and simplicity that caused all present to look at each other with pain and surprise  thou hast now the assurance that gods grace will be offered to thy prayers daughter answered the prelate seek it with thy heart and thy end which is at hand will be more blessed  christian no marry heathenchristian marry christian  this hast thou been often told my poor ozema returned the queen the rite could not be duly solemnized between christian and heathen  christian marry first lady he love best  certainly to do otherwise would be a violation of his vow and a mockery of god  so ozema thinkbut he can marry second wifeinferior wifelady he love next luis marry mercedes first wife because he love bestthen he marry ozema second wifelower wifebecause he love next bestozema christian now and no harm come archbishop make ozema luis second wife  isabella groaned aloud and walked to a distant part of the chapel while mercedes burst into tears and sinking on her knees she buried her face in the cloth of the couch and prayed fervently for the enlightening of the soul of the princess the churchman did not receive this proof of ignorance in his penitent and of her unfitness for the rite he had just administered with the same pity and indulgence  the holy baptism thou hast just received benighted woman he said sternly is healthful or not as it is improved thou hast just made such a demand as already loadeth thy soul with a fresh load of sin and the time for repentance is short no christian can have two wives at the same time and god knoweth no higher or lower no first or last between those whom his church hath united thou canst not be a second wife the first still living  no would be to caonaboto luis yes fifty hundred wife to dear luis no possible  selfdeluded and miserable girl i tell thee no nonononevernevernever there is such a taint of sin in the very question as profaneth this holy chapel and the symbols of religion by which it is filled ay kiss and embrace thy cross and bow down thy very soul in despair for  lord archbishop interrupted the marchioness of moya with a sharpness of manner that denoted how much her ancient spirit was aroused there is enough of this the ear thou wouldst wound at such a moment is already deaf and the pure spirit hath gone to the tribunal of another and as i trust a milder judge ozema is dead  it was indeed true startled by the manner of the prelatebewildered with the confusion of ideas that had grown up between the dogmas that had been crowded on her mind of late and those in which she had been early taught and physically paralyzed by the certainty that her last hope of a union with luis was gone the spirit of the indian girl had deserted its beautiful tenement leaving on the countenance of the corpse a lovely impression of the emotions that had prevailed during the last moments of its earthly residence  thus fled the first of those souls that the great discovery was to rescue from the perdition of the heathen casuists may refine the learned dilate and the pious ponder on its probable fate in the unknown existence that awaited it but the meek and submissive will hope all from the beneficence of a merciful god as for isabella she received a shock from the blow that temporarily checked her triumph at the success of her zeal and efforts little however did she foresee that the event was but a type of the manner in which the religion of the cross was to be abused and misunderstood a sort of practical prognostic of the defeat of most of her own pious and gentle hopes and wishes  illustration     chapter xxxi      a perfect woman nobly planned     to warn to comfort and command     and yet a spirit still and bright     with something of an angel light      wordsworth   the lustre that was thrown around the voyage of columbus brought the seas into favor it was no longer deemed an inferior occupation or unsuited to nobles to engage in enterprises on its bosom and that very propensity of our hero which had so often been mentioned to his prejudice in former years was now frequently named to his credit though his real connection with columbus is published for the first time in these pages the circumstance having escaped the superficial investigations of the historians it was an advantage to him to be known as having manifested what might be termed a maritime disposition in an age when most of his rank and expectations were satisfied with the adventures of the land a sort of fashion was got up on behalf of the ocean and the cavalier who had gazed upon its vast and unbroken expanse beyond the view of his mother earth regarded him who had not much as he who had won his spurs looked down upon him who had suffered the proper period of life to pass without making the effort many of the nobles whose estates touched the mediterranean or the atlantic fitted out small coastersthe yachts of the fifteenth centuryand were met following the sinuosities of the glorious coasts of that part of the world endeavoring to derive a satisfaction from a pursuit that it seemed meritorious to emulate that all succeeded who attempted thus to transfer the habits of courts and castles to the narrow limits of xebecs and feluccas it would be hazarding too much to assert but there is little doubt that the spirit of the period was sustained by the experiments and that men were ashamed to condemn that which it was equally the policy and the affectation of the day to extol the rivalry between spain and portugal too contributed to the feeling of the times and there was soon greater danger of the youth who had never quitted his native shores being pointed out for his want of spirit than that the adventurer should be marked for his eccentric and vagrant instability  in the meanwhile the seasons advanced and events followed in their usual course from cause to effect about the close of the month of september the ocean just without that narrow and romantic pass that separates europe from africa while it connects the transcendent mediterranean with the broader wastes of the atlantic was glittering with the rays of the rising sun which at the same time was gilding the objects that rose above the surface of the blue waters the latter were not numerous though a dozen different sails were moving slowly on their several courses impelled by the soft breezes of the season of these our business is with one alone which it may be well to describe in a few general terms  the rig of the vessel in question was latine perhaps the most picturesque of all that the ingenuity of man has invented as the accessory of a view whether given to the eye by means of the canvas or in its real dimensions and substance its position too was precisely that which a painter would have chosen as the most favorable to his pencil the little felucca running before the wind with one of its high pointed sails extended on each side resembling the pinions of some enormous bird that was contracting its wings as it settled toward its nest unusual symmetry was apparent in the spars and rigging while the hull which was distinguished by lines of the fairest proportions had a neatness and finish that denoted the yacht of a noble  the name of this vessel was the ozema and she carried the count of llera with his youthful bride luis who had acquired much of the mariners skill in his many voyages directed the movements in person though sancho mundo strutted around her decks with an air of authority being the titular if not the real patron of the craft  ayaygood bartolemeo lash that anchor well said the last as he inspected the forecastle in his hourly rounds for fair as may be the breezes and mild as is the season no one can know what humor the atlantic may be in when it fairly waketh up in the great voyage to cathay nothing could have been more propitious than our outward passage and nothing savor more of devils incarnate than the homeward doña mercedes maketh an excellent sailor as ye all may see and no one can tell which way or how far the humor of the conde may carry him when he hath once taken his departure i tell ye fellows that glory and gold may alight upon ye all any minute in the service of such a noble and i hope none of ye have forgotten to come provided with hawksbells which are as remarkable for assembling doblas as the bells of the seville cathedral are for assembling christians  master mundo called out our hero from the quarterdeck let there be a man sent to the extremity of the foreyard and bid him look along the sea to the north and east of us  this command interrupted one of sanchos selfglorifying discourses and compelled him to see the order executed when the seaman who was sent aloft had shinned his way to the airy and seemingly perilous position he had been told to occupy an inquiry went up from the deck to demand what he beheld  señor conde answered the fellow the ocean is studded with sails in the quarter your excellency hath named looking like the mouth of the tagus at the first of a westerly wind  canst thou tell them and let me know their numbers called out luis  by the mass señor returned the man after taking time to make his count i see no less than sixteennay now i see another a smaller just opening from behind a carrack of sizeseventeen i make them in all  then are we in season love exclaimed luis turning toward mercedes with delightonce more shall i grasp the hand of the admiral ere he quitteth us again for cathay thou seemest glad as myself that our effort hath not failed  that which gladdeneth thee luis is sure to gladden me returned the bride where there is but one interest there ought to be but one wish  belovedbeloved mercedesthou wilt make me every thing thou canst desire this heavenly disposition of thine and this ready consenting to voyage with me will be sure to mould me in such a way that i shall be less myself than thee  as yet luis returned the young wife smiling the change promiseth to be the other way since thou art much likelier to make me a rover than i to make thee a fixture of the castle of llera  thou comest not out upon the sea mercedes contrary to thine own wishes demanded luis with the earnest quickness of one who was fearful he might unconsciously have done an act of indiscretion  no dearest luis so far from it that i have come with satisfaction apart from the pleasure i have had in obliging thee fortunately i feel no indisposition from the motion of the felucca and the novelty is of the most agreeable and exciting kind  to say that luis rejoiced to hear this on more accounts than one is but to add that he still found a pleasure in the scenes of the ocean  in half an hour the vessel of the admiral was visible from the ozemas deck and ere the sun had reached the meridian the little felucca was gliding into the centre of the fleet holding her course toward the carrack of columbus the usual hailing passed when apprised of the presence of mercedes the admiral gallantly repaired on board the ozema to pay his respects in person the scenes through which they had passed together had created in columbus a species of paternal regard for luis in which mercedes shared through the influence of her noble conduct during the events that occurred at barcelona he met the happy pair therefore with dignified affection and his reception partook of the feelings that the count and countess so fully reciprocated  nothing could be more striking to one who had an opportunity of witnessing both than the contrast between the means with which the genoese sailed on this and on his former voyage then he had set forth neglected almost forgotten in three vessels illfound and worse manned while now the ocean was whitened with his canvas and he was surrounded by no inconsiderable portion of the chivalry of spain as soon as it was known that the countess of llera was in the felucca that had stopped the fleet boats put off from most of the vessels and mercedes held a sort of court on the broad atlantic her own female attendants among whom were two or three of the rank of ladies assisting her in doing proper honor to the cavaliers who thronged the deck the balmy influence of the pure air of the ocean contributed to the happiness of the moment and for an hour the ozema presented a scene of gaiety and splendor such as had never before been witnessed by any person present  beautiful countess cried one who had been a rejected suitor of our heroine you see to what acts of desperation your cruelty hath driven me who am going forth on an adventure to the furthest east it is well for don luis that i did not make this venture before he won your favor as no damsel in spain is expected henceforth to withstand the suit of one of the admirals followers  it may be as you say señor returned mercedes her heart swelling with the consciousness that he whom she had chosen had made this same boasted adventure while others shrunk from its hazard and when its result was still a mystery in the unknown futureit may be as you say but one of moderate wishes like myself must be content with these unambitious voyages along the coast in which happily a wife may be her husbands companion  lady cried the gallant and reckless alonzo de ojeda in his turn don luis caused me to roll upon the earth in the tourney by a fair and manly effort that hath left no rancor behind it but i shall outdo him now since he is content to keep the shores of spain in view leaving to us the glory of seeking the indies and of reducing the infidels to the sway of the two sovereigns  it is a sufficient honor to my husband señor that he can boast of the success you name and he must rest satisfied with the reputation acquired in that one deed  countess a year hence you would love him better did he come forth with us and show his spirit among the people of the grand khan  thou seest don alonzo that the illustrious admiral doth not altogether despise him as it is they seek a private interview in my cabin together an attention don christopher would not be apt to pay a recreant or a laggard  tis surprising resumed the rejected suitor the favor of the conde with our noble admiral hath surprised us all at barcelona can it be de ojeda that they have met in some of their earlier nautical wanderings  by the mass señor cried alonzo laughing if don luis ever met the admiral as he met me in the lists i should think one interview would answer for the rest of their days  in this manner did the discourse proceed some speaking in levity some in more sober mood and all in amity while this was passing on deck columbus had indeed retired to a cabin with our hero  don luis said the admiral when they were seated near each other and alone thou knowst the regard i bear thee and i feel certain that thou returnest it with an equal degree of esteem i now go forth from spain on a far more perilous adventure than that in which thou wert my companion then i sailed concealed in contempt and veiled from human eyes by ignorance and pity now have i left the old world followed by malignancy and envy these facts am i too old not to have seen and foreseen in my absence many will be busy with my name even they who now shout at my heels will become my calumniators revenging themselves for past adulation by present detraction the sovereigns will be beset with lies and any disappointment in the degree of success will be distorted into crimes i leave friends behind me toofriends such as juan perez de st angel quintanilla and thyself on ye then do i greatly rely not for favors but for the interest of truth and justice  señor you may count upon my small influence under all circumstances i have seen you in the day of trial and it exceedeth ordinary misrepresentations to weaken my faith in you  this did i believe luis even before it was so warmly and sincerely said returned the admiral squeezing the young mans hand with fervor i doubt if fonseca who hath now so much power in the affairs of india is truly my friend then there is one of thy blood and name who hath already regarded me with unfavorable eyes and whom i distrust exceedingly should an occasion offer in which he might do me injury  i know him well don christopher and account him as doing no credit to the house of bobadilla  he hath credit nevertheless with the king which is of more importance just now  ah señor to that wily and doublefaced monarch you must look for nothing generous so long as doña isabellas ear can be kept open to the truth there is nothing to fear but don ferdinand groweth each day more worldly and temporizing massthat one who in youth was so bold and manly a knight should in his age betray so many of the meannesses that would disgrace a moor my noble aunt however is a host in herself and will ever remain true to you as she commenced  god overruleth all and it were sinful to distrust either his wisdom or justice and now luis one word touching thyself providence hath made thee the guardian of the happiness of such a being as is seldom found this side the gates of heaven the man who is blessed with a virtuous and amiable wife like her thou hast wedded should erect an altar in his heart on which he ought to make daily nay hourly sacrifices of gratitude to god for the boon since of all earthly blessings he enjoyeth the richest the purest and the most lasting should he not be unmindful of his own riches but a woman like doña mercedes is a creature as delicate as she is rare let her equanimity check thy impetuosity her purity rebuke the less refined elements of thy composition her virtue stimulate thine own her love keep thine in an unceasing flame and her tenderness be a constant appeal to thy manly indulgence and protection fulfil all thy duties as a spanish grandee son and seek felicity in the partner of thy bosom and in love to god  the admiral now gave luis his blessing and taking leave of mercedes in the same solemn manner he hastened to his carrack boat after boat quitted the felucca many calling out their leavetakings even after they were at a distance in a few minutes the heavy yards swung around and the fleet was again sweeping off toward the southwest holding its way as was then fancied toward the distant shores of india for an hour the ozema lay where she had been left by columbus as if gazing at her retiring friends then her canvas filled and she hauled up toward that bight of the coast at the bottom of which lay the port of palos de moguer  the afternoon was deliciously balmy and when the felucca drew in with the land the surface of the sea was as smooth as that of an inland lake there was just wind enough to cool the air and to propel the little vessel three or four knots through the water the day apartment occupied by our hero and heroine was on the quarterdeck it was formed on the exterior by a tarpauling bent like the tilt of a wagon while the interior was embellished with a lining of precious stuffs that converted it into a beautiful little saloon in front a canvas bulkhead protected it from the gaze of the crew and toward the stearn a rich curtain fell when it became necessary to shut out the view the latter was now carelessly festooned permitting the eye to range over a broad expanse of the ocean and to watch the glories of the setting sun  mercedes reclined on a luxurious couch gazing on the ocean and luis touched a guitar seated on a stool at her feet he had just played a favorite national air which he had accompanied with his voice and had laid aside the instrument when he perceived that his young wife did not listen with her usual fondness and admiration to his music  thou art thoughtful mercedes he said leaning forward to read the melancholy expression of those eyes that were so often glowing with enthusiasm  the sun is setting in the direction of the land of poor ozema luis mercedes answered a slight tremor pervading her voice the circumstance in connection with the sight of this boundless ocean that so much resembleth eternity hath led me to think of her end surelysurelya creature so innocent can never be consigned to eternal misery because her unenlightened mind and impassioned feelings were unable to comprehend all the churchs mysteries  i would that thou thoughtst less on this subject love thy prayers and the masses that have been said for her soul should content thee or if thou wilt the last can be repeated again and again  we will offer still more returned the young wife scarce speaking above her breath while the tears fell down her cheeks the best of us will need masses and we owe this to poor ozema didst thou bethink thee to intercede again with the admiral to do all service to mattinao on reaching española  that hath been attended to and so dismiss the subject from thy mind the monument is already erected at llera and we may feel regret for the loss of the sweet girl but can scarce mourn for her were i not luis de bobadilla thy husband dearest i could think her the subject of envy rather than of pity  ah luis thy flattery is too pleasing to bring reproof but it is scarce seemly even the happiness i feel in being assured of thy lovethat our fortunes fate name interests are oneis in truth but misery compared with the seraphic joys of the blessed and to such joys i could wish ozemas spirit might be elevated  doubt it not mercedes she hath all that her goodness and innocence can claim mass if she even have half that i feel in holding thee thus to my heart she is no subject for grief and thou sayst she hath or wilt have tenfold more  luisluisspeak not thus we will have other masses said at seville as well as at burgos and salamanca  as thou wilt love let them be said yearly monthly weekly forever or as long as the churchmen think they may have virtue  mercedes smiled her gratitude and the conversation became less painful though it continued to be melancholy an hour passed in this manner during which the communion was of the sweet character that pervades the intercourse of those who love tenderly mercedes had already acquired a powerful command over the headlong propensities and impetuous feelings of her husband and was gradually moulding him unknown to herself to be the man that was necessary to her own feelings in this change which was the result of influence and not of calculation or design she was aided by the manly qualities of our hero which were secretly persuading him that he had now the happiness of another in his keeping as well as his own this is an appeal that a really generous mind seldom withstands and far oftener produces the correction of minor faults than any direct management or open rebukes perhaps mercedes strongest arm however was her own implicit confidence in her husbands excellence luis feeling a desire to be that which she so evidently thought him an opinion that his own conscience did not in the fullest extent corroborate  just as the sun had set sancho came to announce that he had let go the anchor  here we are señor condehere we are at last señora doña mercedes lying off the town of palos and within a hundred yards of the very spot where don christopher and his gallant companions departed for the discovery of the indiesgod bless him a hundredfold and all who went with him the boat is ready to take you to the shore señora and there if you do not find seville or barcelona cathedrals and palaces you will find palos and santa clara and the shipyardgatethree places that are henceforth to be more renowned than either palos as having sent forth the expedition santa clara as having saved it from destruction by vows fulfilled at its altars and the gate for having had the ship of the admiral built within it  and other great events good sancho put in the count  just so your excellency and for other great events am i to land you lady  mercedes assented and in ten minutes she and her husband were walking on the beach within ten yards of the very spot where columbus and luis had embarked the previous year the firm sands were now covered with people walking in the cool of the evening most of them were of the humbler classes this being the only land we believe in which the population of countries that possess a favorable climate do not thus mingle in their public promenades at that witching hour  luis and his beautiful wife had landed merely for exercise and relaxation well knowing that the felucca possessed better accommodations than any hosteria of palos and they fell into the current of the walkers before them was a group of young matrons who were conversing eagerly and sufficiently loud to be overheard our hero and heroine instantly ceased their own discourse when they found that the subject was the voyage to cathay  this day said one of the party in a tone of authority did don christopher sail from cadiz the sovereigns deeming palos too small a port for the equipment of so great an enterprise you may depend on what i tell ye good neighbors my husband as you all well know holding an appointment in the admirals own ship  you are to be envied neighbor that he is in so good repute with so great a man  how could he be otherwise seeing that he was with him before when few had courage to be his companions and was ever faithful to his orders monicanay it was good monicasaid the admiral to me with his own mouth thy pepe is a truehearted mariner and hath conducted to my entire satisfaction he shall be made the boatswain of my own carrack and thou and thy posterity to the latest antiquity may boast that you belong to so good a man these were his words and what he said he didpepe being now a boatswain but the paters and aves that i said to reach this good fortune would pave this beach  luis now stepped forward and saluted the party making curiosity to know the particulars of the first departure his excuse as he expected monica did not recognize him in his present rich attire and she willingly related all she knew and not a little more the interview showed how completely this woman had passed from despair to exultation reducing the general and more public change of sentiment down to the individual example of a particular case  i have heard much of one pinzon added luis who went forth as pilot of a caravel in the voyage what hath become of him  señor he is dead answered a dozen voices monicas however so far getting the ascendency as to tell the story he was once a great man in this quarter but now his name is lost like his life he was untrue and died of grief it is said when he found the niña lying in the river when he expected to have had all the glory to himself  luis had been too much engrossed with his own feelings to have heard this news before and he continued his walk musing and sad  so much for unlawful hopes and designs that god doth not favor he exclaimed when they had walked a considerable distance providence hath i think been of the admirals side and certainly my love it hath been of mine  this is santa clara observed mercedes luis i would enter and return a thanksgiving at its altars for thy safety and return and offer a prayer for the future success of don christopher  they both entered the church and they knelt together at the principal altar for in that age the bravest warriors were not as much ashamed as in our own times of publicly acknowledging their gratitude to and their dependence on god this duty performed the happy pair returned silently to the beach and went off to the felucca  early in the morning the ozema sailed for malaga again luis being fearful he might be recognized if he continued at palos their port was reached in safety and shortly after the party arrived at valverde the principal estate of mercedes where we shall leave our hero and heroine in the enjoyment of a felicity that was as great as could be produced by the connection between manly tenderness on one side and purity of feeling and disinterested womanly love on the other  at a late day there were other luis de bobadillas in spain among her gallant and noble and other mercedes to cause the hearts of the gay and aspiring to ache but there was only one ozema she appeared at court in the succeeding reign and for a time blazed like a star that had just risen in a pure atmosphere her career however was short dying young and lamented since which time the name itself has perished it is in part owing to these circumstances that we have been obliged to drag so much of our legend from the lost records of that eventful period  illustration
