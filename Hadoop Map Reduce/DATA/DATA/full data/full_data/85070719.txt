at all for mountains  lady      dedmond has a firm thin face full of capability and decision      not without kindliness and faintly weathered as if she had      faced many situations in many parts of the world  she is fifty      five       paynter withdraws  sir charles  hullo  where are they  hm       as he speaks george reenters  lady dedmond  kissing her son  well george  wheres clare  george

feeling what i cant stand is being made a fool of before other people ordinary friction one can put up with  but that  sir charles  gone out on purpose  what  lady dedmond  what was the trouble  george  i told her this morning you were coming in to bridge appears shed asked that fellow malise for music  lady dedmond  without letting you know  george  i believe she did tell me  lady dedmond  but surely  george  i dont want to discuss it  theres never anything in particular  were all anyhow as you know  lady dedmond  i see  she looks shrewdly at her son  my dear i should be rather careful about him i think  sir charles  whos that  lady dedmond  that mr malise  sir charles  oh  that chap  george  clare isnt that sort  lady dedmond  i know  but she catches up notions very easily  i think its a great pity you ever came across him  sir charles  where did you pick him up  george  italythis springsome place or other where they couldnt speak english  sir charles  um  thats the worst of travellin  lady dedmond  i think you ought to have dropped him  these literary peoplequietly  from exchanging ideas to something else isnt very far george  sir charles  well make him play bridge  do him good if hes that sort of fellow  lady dedmond  is anyone else coming  george  reggie huntingdon and the fullartons  lady dedmond  softly  you know my dear boy ive been meaning to speak to you for

been going on for a long time  george  oh  leave it alone mother  lady dedmond  but george im afraid this man has brought it to a pointput ideas into her head  george  you cant dislike him more than i do  but theres nothing one can object to  lady dedmond  could reggie huntingdon do anything now hes home brothers sometimes  george  i cant bear my affairs being messed about  lady dedmond  well it would be better for you and clare to be supposed to be out together than for her to be out alone  go quietly into the diningroom and wait for her  sir charles  good  leave your mother to make up something  shell do it  lady dedmond  that may be he  quick       a bell sounds       george goes out into the hall leaving the door open in his      haste  lady dedmond following calls paynter  paynter      enters  lady dedmond  dont say anything about your master and mistress being out  ill explain  paynter  the master my lady  lady dedmond  yes i know  but you neednt say so  do you

dedmond  i shall simply say theyre dining out and that were not to wait bridge for them  sir charles  listening  hes having a palaver with that man of georges       paynter reappearing announces captain huntingdon  sir      charles and lady dedmond turn to him with relief  lady dedmond  ah  its you reginald  huntingdon  a tall fair soldier of thirty how dyou do  how are you sir  whats the matter with their man  she charles  what  huntingdon  i was going into the diningroom to get rid of my cigar and he said not in there sir  the masters there but my instructions are to the effect that hes not  she charles  i knew that fellow  lady dedmond  the fact is reginald clares out and george is waiting for her  its so important people shouldnt  huntingdon  rather       they draw together as people do discussing the misfortunes of      members of their families  lady dedmond  its getting serious reginald  i dont know whats to become of them  you dont think the rectoryou dont think your father would speak to clare  huntingdon  afraid the governors hardly well enough  he takes anything of that sort to heart soespecially clare  sir charles  cant you put in a word yourself  huntingdon  dont know where the mischief lies  sir charles  im sure george doesnt gallop her on the road  very steadygoin fellow old george  huntingdon  oh yes george is all right sir  lady dedmond  they ought to have had children  huntingdon  expect theyre pretty glad now they havent  i really dont know what to say maam  sir charles  saving your presence you know reginald ive often noticed parsons daughters grow up queer  get too much morality and rice puddin  lady dedmond  with a clear look  charles  sir charles  what was she like when you were kids  huntingdon  oh all right  could be rather a little devil of course when her monkey was up  sir charles  im fond of her  nothing she wants that she hasnt got is there  huntingdon  never heard her say so  sir charles  dimly  i dont know whether old george is a bit too matter of fact for her  hm       a short silence  lady dedmond  theres a mr malise coming here tonight  i forget if you know him  huntingdon  yes  rather a thoroughbred mongrel  lady dedmond  hes literary  with hesitation  youyou dont think heputserideas into her head  huntingdon  i asked greyman the novelist about him seems hes a bit of an ishmaelite even among those fellows  cant see clare  lady dedmond  no  only the great thing is that she shouldnt be encouraged  listenit is hercoming in  i can hear their voices gone to her room  what a blessing that man isnt here yet  the door bell rings tt  there he is i expect  sir charles  what are we goin to say  huntingdon  say theyre dining out and were not to wait bridge for them  sir charles  good       the door is opened and paynter announces mr kenneth malise      malise enters  he is a tall man about thirtyfive with a      strongly marked dark irregular ironic face and eyes which      seem to have needles in their pupils  his thick hair is rather      untidy and his dress clothes not too new  lady dedmond  how do you do  my son and daughterinlaw are so very sorry  theyll be here directly       malise bows with a queer curly smile  sir charles  shaking hands how dyou do sir  huntingdon  weve met i think       he gives malise that peculiar smiling stare which seems to warn      the person bowed to of the sort of person he is  malises eyes      sparkle  lady dedmond  clare will be so grieved  one of those invitations  malise  on the spur of the moment  sir charles  you play bridge sir  malise  afraid not  sir charles  dont mean that  then we shall have to wait for em  lady dedmond  i forget mr maliseyou write dont you  malise  such is my weakness  lady dedmond  delightful profession  sir charles  doesnt tie you  what  malise  only by the head  sir charles  im always thinkin of writin my experiences  malise  indeed  there is the sound of a door banged  sir charles  hastily  you smoke mr  malise  malise  too much  sir charles  ah  must smoke when you think a lot  malise  or think when you smoke a lot  sir charles  genially  dont know that i find that  lady dedmond  with her clear look at him  charles       the door is opened  clare dedmond in a creamcoloured evening      frock comes in from the hall followed by george  she is rather      pale of middle height with a beautiful figure wavy brown      hair full smiling lips and large grey mesmeric eyes one of      those women all vibration iced over with a trained stoicism of      voice and manner  lady dedmond  well my dear  sir charles  ah  george  good dinner  george  giving his hand to malise  how are you  clare  mr malise  clare  smilingin a clear voice with the faintest possible lisp yes we met on the doormat  pause  sir charles

has entered with a tray  george  paynter  take that table into the dining room  paynter  putting down the tray on a table behind the door  yes sir  malise  let me give you a hand       paynter and malise carry one of the bridge tables out george      making a halfhearted attempt to relieve malise  sir charles  very fine sunset       quite softly clare begins to laugh  all look at her first with      surprise then with offence then almost with horror  george is      about to go up to her but huntingdon heads him off  huntingdon  bring the tray along old man       george takes up the tray stops to look at clare then allows      huntingdon to shepherd him out  lady dedmond  without looking at clare  well if were going to play charles she jerks his sleeve  sir charles  what  he marches out  lady dedmond  meeting malise in the doorway  now you will be able to have your music       she follows the general out       clare stands perfectly still with her eyes closed  malise  delicious  clare  in her level clipped voice  perfectly beastly of me  im so sorry  i simply cant help running amok tonight  malise  never apologize for being fey  its much too rare  clare  on the doormat  and theyd whitewashed me so beautifully poor dears  i wonder if i oughtshe looks towards the door  malise  dont spoil it  clare  id been walking up and down the embankment for about three hours  one does get desperate sometimes  malise  thank god for that  clare  only makes it worse afterwards  it seems so frightful to them too  malise  softly and suddenly but with a difficulty in finding the right words  blessed be the respectable  may they dream ofme and blessed be all men of the world  may they perish of a surfeit ofgood form  clare  i like that  oh wont there be a row  with a faint movement of her shoulders  and the usual reconciliation  malise  mrs dedmond theres a whole world outside yours  why dont you spread your wings  clare  my dear fathers a saint and hes getting old and frail and

malise  thank god for beauty  paynter  opening the door  mr and mrs fullarton  malise  who are they  clare  rising  shes my chief pal  he was in the navy       she goes forward  mrs  fullerton is a rather tall woman with      dark hair and a quick eye  he one of those cleanshaven naval      men of good presence who have retired from the sea but not from      their susceptibility  mrs fullarton  kissing clare and taking in both malise and her husbands look at clare  weve only come for a minute  clare  theyre playing bridge in the diningroom  mr malise doesnt play  mr malisemrs fullarton mr

dependent on him  at home theyve got every bit as much as they can do to keep going  clare  i know  huntingdon  and youve got to think of the girls  any trouble would be very beastly for them  and the

when he has gone turns away from the door      holding herself in refusing to give rein to some outburst of      emotion  suddenly she sits down at the untouched bridge table      leaning her bare elbows on it and her chin on her hands quite      calm  george is coming in  paynter follows him  clare  nothing more wanted thank you paynter  you can go home and the maids can go to bed  paynter  we

you  im not unreasonable in any way that i can see  clare  well i think weve talked enough       she again moves towards the curtained door  george  look here clare you dont mean youre expecting me to put up with the position of a man whos neither married nor unmarried thats simple purgatory  you ought to know  clare  yes  i havent yet have i  george  dont go like that  do you suppose were the only couple whove found things arent what they thought and have to put up with each other and make the best of it  clare  not by thousands  george  well why do you imagine they do it  clare  i dont know  george  from a common sense of decency  clare  very  george  by jove  you can be the most maddening thing in all the world  taking up a pack of cards he lets them fall with a long slithering flutter  after behaving as you have this evening you might try to make some amends i should think       clare moves her head from side to side as if in sight of      something she could not avoid  he puts his hand on her arm  clare  no nono  george  dropping his hand  cant you make it up  clare  i dont feel very christian       she opens the door passes through and closes it behind her      george steps quickly towards it stops and turns back into the      room  he goes to the window and stands looking out shuts it      with a bang and again contemplates the door  moving forward      he rests his hand on the deserted card table clutching its      edge and muttering  then he crosses to the door into the hall      and switches off the light  he opens the door to go out then      stands again irresolute in the darkness and heaves a heavy sigh      suddenly he mutters no  crosses resolutely back to the      curtained door and opens it  in the gleam of light clare is      standing unhooking a necklet       he goes in shutting the door behind him with a thud                                 curtain      act ii       the scene is a large whitewashed disordered room whose outer      door opens on to a corridor and stairway  doors on either side      lead to other rooms  on the walls are unframed reproductions of      fine pictures secured with tintacks  an old winecoloured      armchair of low and comfortable appearance near the centre of      the room is surrounded by a litter of manuscripts books ink      pens and newspapers as though some one had already been up to      his neck in labour though by a grandfathers clock it is only      eleven  on a smallish table close by are sheets of paper      cigarette ends and two claret bottles  there are many books on      shelves and on the floor an overflowing pile whereon rests a      soft hat and a black knobby stick  malise sits in his      armchair garbed in trousers dressinggown and slippers      unshaved and uncollared writing  he pauses smiles lights a      cigarette and tries the rhythm of the last sentence holding up      a sheet of quarto ms  malise  not a word not a whisper of liberty from all those excellent frockcoated gentlemennot a sign not a grimace  only the monumental silence of their profound deference before triumphant tyranny       while he speaks a substantial woman a little over

and marches out      followed by lady dedmond whose voice is heard without answered      by his what  in the doorway as they pass george is      standing he comes in  george  going up to clare who has recovered all her selfcontrol will you come outside and speak to me  clare  no       george glances at malise who is leaning against the wall with      folded arms  george  in a low voice  clare  clare  well  george  you try me pretty high dont you forcing me to come here and speak before this fellow  most men would think the worst finding you like this  clare  you need not have comeor thought

lifes a lie  its stupid its disgusting  im tired of it  please leave me alone  george  you rather miss the point im afraid  i didnt come here to tell you what you know perfectly well when youre sane  i came here to say this anyone in her senses could see the game your friend here is playing  it wouldnt take a baby in  if you think that a gentleman like that  his stare travels round the dishevelled room till it rests on malise  champions a pretty woman for nothing you make a fairly bad mistake  clare  take care       but malise after one convulsive movement of his hands has      again become rigid  george  i dont pretend to be subtle or that kind of thing but i have ordinary common sense  i dont attempt to be superior to plain facts  clare  under her breath  facts  george  oh for goodness sake drop that hifalutin tone  it doesnt suit you  look here  if you like to go abroad with one of your young sisters until the autumn ill let the flat and go to the club  clare  put the fire out with a penny hose  slowly  i am not coming back to you george  the farce is over  george  taken aback for a moment by the finality of her tone suddenly fronts malise then there is something between you and this fellow  malise  dangerously but without moving  i beg your pardon  clare  thereisnothing  george  looking from one to the other  at all events i wonti wont see a woman who onceclare makes a sudden effacing movement with her hands  i wont see her go to certain ruin without lifting a finger  clare  that is noble  george  with intensity  i dont know that you deserve anything of me  but on my honour as a gentleman i came here this morning for your sake to warn you of what youre doing  he turns suddenly on malise  and i tell this precious friend of yours plainly what i think of him and that im not going to play into his hands       malise without stirring from the wall looks at clare and his      lips move  clare  shakes her head at himthen to george  will you go please  george  i

words and mine will never kiss each other  george  will you come  clare shakes her head  george  with fury  dyou mean to stay in this pigsty with that rhapsodical swine  malise  transformed by god if you dont go ill kill you  george  as suddenly calm  that remains to be seen  malise  with most deadly quietness  yes i will kill you       he goes stealthily along the wall takes up from where it lies      on the pile of books the great black knobby stick and      stealthily approaches george his face quite fiendish  clare  with a swift movement grasping the stick  please       malise resigns the stick and the two men perfectly still      glare at each other  clare letting the stick fall puts her      foot on it  then slowly she takes off her hat and lays it on      the table  clare  now will you go  there is silence  george  staring at her hat  you mad little fool  understand this if youve not returned home by three oclock ill divorce you and you may roll in the gutter with this highsouled friend of yours and mind this you siri wont spare youby god  your pocket shall suffer  thats the only thing that touches fellows like you       turning he goes out and slams the door  clare and malise      remain face to face  her lips have begun to quiver  clare  horrible       she turns away shuddering and sits down on the edge of the      armchair covering her eyes with the backs of her hands  malise      picks up the stick and fingers it lovingly  then putting it      down he moves so that he can see her face  she is sitting      quite still staring straight before her  malise  nothing could be better  clare  i dont know what to do  i dont know what to do  malise  thank the stars for your good fortune  clare  he means to have revenge on you  and its all my fault  malise  let him  let him go for his divorce  get rid of him  have done with himsomehow       she gets up and stands with face averted  then swiftly turning      to him  clare  if i must bring you harmlet me pay you back  i cant bear it otherwise  make some use of me if you dont mind  malise  my god       she puts up her face to be kissed shutting her eyes  malise  you poor       he clasps and kisses her then drawing back looks in her face      she has not moved her eyes are still closed but she is      shivering her lips are tightly pressed together her hands      twitching  malise  very quietly no no  this is not the house of a gentleman  clare  letting her head fall and almost in a whisper  im sorry  malise  i understand  clare  i dont feel  and withouti cant cant  malise  bitterly  quite right  youve had enough of that       there is a long silence  without looking at him she takes up      her hat and puts it on  malise  not going       clare nods  malise  you dont trust me  clare  i do  but

 good luck then  good luck       he releases her hand  just touching his bent head with her      other hand clare turns and goes  malise remains with bowed      head listening to the sound of her receding footsteps  they      die away  he raises himself and strikes out into the air with      his clenched fist                                 curtain     act iii       malises sittingroom  an

husband  shes out to save her soul alive and i dont join the hue and cry thats after her  on the contraryif i had the power  if your father wants to shelter her thats another matter  but shed her own ideas about that  huntingdon  perhaps you dont realize how unfit my sister is for rough and tumble  shes not one of this new sort of woman  shes always been looked after and had things done for her  pluck shes got but thats all and shes bound to come to grief  malise  very likelythe first birds do  but if she drops halfway its better than if shed never flown  your sister sir is trying the wings

responds      then the latter turns and goes out  malise  poor fugitive  where are you running now       he stands at the window through which the evening sunlight is      powdering the room with smoky gold  the stolid boy has again      come in  malise stares at him then goes back to the table      takes up the ms and booms it at him he receives the charge      breathing hard  malise  man of

doorway he shies violently at the figure of      clare standing there in a darkcoloured dress skids past her      and goes  clare comes into the gleam of sunlight her white      face alive with emotion or excitement  she looks round her      smiles sighs goes swiftly to the door closes it and comes      back to the table  there she stands fingering the papers on      the table smoothing malises hat wistfully eagerly waiting  malise  returning  you  clare  with a faint smile  not very glorious is it       he goes towards her and checks himself then slews the armchair      round  malise  come  sit down sit down  clare heaving a long sigh sinks down into the chair  teas nearly ready       he places a cushion for her and prepares tea she looks up at      him softly but as he finishes and turns to her she drops that      glance  clare  do you think me an awful coward for coming  she has taken a little plain cigarette case from her dress  would you mind if i smoked       malise shakes his head then draws back from her again as if      afraid to be too close  and again unseen she looks at him  malise  so youve lost your job  clare  how did you  malise  your brother

that soft eager look and once more      averts it as he turns to her  clare  my nerves have gone funny lately  its being always on ones guard and stuffy air and feeling people look and talk about you and dislike your being there  malise  yes that wants pluck  clare  shaking her head  i curl up all the time  the only thing i know for certain is that i shall never go back to him  the more ive hated

rises  oh and the feelingalways alwaysthat theres no sun or life or hope or anything  it was just like being ill the way ive wanted to ride and dance and get out into the country  her excitement dies away into the old clipped composure and she sits down again  dont think too badly of meit really is pretty ghastly  malise  gruffly  hm  why a shop  clare  references  i didnt want to tell more lies

as the lips of a dog going to bite  and said will you leave me alone please and he did  it was rather nice  and there was one quite decent little man in the shopi was sorry for himsuch a humble little man  malise  poor devilits hard not to wish for the moon       at the tone of his voice clare looks up at him his face is      turned away  clare  softly  how have you been  working very hard  malise  as hard as god will let me  clare  stealing another look have you any typewriting i could do i could learn and ive still got a brooch i could sell  which is the best kind  malise  i had a catalogue of them somewhere       he goes into the inner room  the moment he is gone clare      stands up her hands pressed to her cheeks as if she felt them      flaming  then with hands clasped she stands waiting  he      comes back with the old portfolio  malise  can you typewrite where you are  clare  i have to find a new room anyway  im changingto be safe she takes a luggage ticket from her glove  i took my things to charing crossonly a bag and one trunk  then with that queer expression on her face which prefaces her desperations you dont want me now i suppose  malise  what  clare  hardly above a whisper becauseif you still wanted me i donow       etext editors note in the 1924 revision 11 years after this      1913 edition i donow is changed to i couldnow      a significant change in meaning

eyes and so they stand for      a moment till the sound of a latchkey in the door sends them      apart  malise  its the housekeeper  give me that ticket ill send for your things       obediently she gives him the ticket smiles and goes quietly      into the inner room  mrs miler has entered her face more      chinese than ever shows no sign of having seen  malise  that lady will stay here mrs

you dont knowtheres two o them men about the stairs now       the moment she is gone malise makes a gesture of maniacal fury      he steals on tiptoe to the outer door and listens  then      placing his hand on the knob he turns it without noise and      wrenches back the door  transfigured in the last sunlight      streaming down the corridor are two men close together      listening and consulting secretly  they start back  malise  with strange almost noiseless ferocity  youve run her to earth your jobs done  kennel up hounds  and in their faces he slams the door

can       then goes  clare almost in a whisper repeats the words      love  you said  at the sound of a latchkey she runs as if to      escape into the bedroom but changes her mind and stands blotted      against the curtain of the door  malise enters  for a moment      he does not see her standing there against the curtain that is      much the same colour as her dress  his face is that of a man in      the grip of a rage that he feels to be impotent  then seeing      her he pulls himself together walks to his armchair and sits      down there in his hat and coat  clare  well  the watchfire  you may as well tell me  malise  nothing to tell you child       at that touch of tenderness she goes up to his chair and kneels      down beside it  mechanically malise takes off his hat  clare  then

hand that still rests on her shoulder life on sufferance breath at the pleasure of the enemy  and some day in the fullness of his mercy to be made a present of the right to eat and drink and breathe again  his gesture sums up the rage within him fine  he puts his hat on and rises  thats the last groan they get from me  class  are you going out again  he nods  where  malise  blackberrying  our trains not till six       he goes into the bedroom  clare gets up and stands by the fire      looking round in a dazed way  she puts her hand up and      mechanically gathers together the violets in the little vase      suddenly she twists them to a buttonhole and sinks down into      the armchair which he must pass  there she sits the violets      in her hand  malise comes out and crosses towards the outer      door  she puts the violets up to him  he stares at them      shrugs his shoulders and passes on  for just a moment clare      sits motionless  clare  quietly  give me a kiss       he turns and kisses her  but his lips after that kiss have      the furtive bitterness one sees on the lips of those who have      done what does not suit their mood  he goes out  she is left      motionless by the armchair her throat working  then      feverishly she goes to the little table seizes a sheet of      paper and writes  looking up suddenly she sees that mrs miler      has let herself in with her latchkey  mrs miler  ive settled the baker the milk the washin an the groceriesthis eres whats left       she counts down a fivepound note four sovereigns and two      shillings on

uncertain whether to come in  she advances into the doorway      it is clare  arnaud  pointing to the other table as he flies with dishes  nice table madame       clare moves to the corner of it  an artist in observation of      his clients arnaud takes in her facevery pale under her wavy      simplydressed hair shadowy beneath the eyes not powdered her      lips not reddened without a single ornament takes in her black      dress finely cut her arms and neck beautifully white and at      her breast three gardenias  and as he nears her she lifts her      eyes  it is very much the look of something lost appealing for      guidance  arnaud  madame is waiting for some one  she shakes her head  then madame will be veree well hereveree well  i take madames cloak       he takes the cloak gently and lays it on the back of the chair      fronting the room that she may put it round her when she      wishes  she sits down  languid voice  from the corner  waiter  arnaud  milord  languid voice  the roederer  arnaud  at once milord       clare sits tracing a pattern with her finger on the cloth her      eyes lowered  once she raises them and follows arnauds dark      rapid figure  arnaud  returning madame feels the eat  he scans her with increased curiosity you wish something madame  clare  again giving him that look  must i order  arnaud  non madame it is not necessary  a glass of water  he pours it out  i have not the pleasure of knowing madames face  clare  faintly smiling  no  arnaud  madame will find it veree good ere veree quiet  languid voice  waiter  arnaud  pardon  he goes       the barenecked ladies with large hats again pass down the      corridor outside and again their voices are wafted in tottie      not she  oh  my goodness she has got a pride on her      bobbiell never stick it  look here dear  galvanized      by those sounds clare has caught her cloak and halfrisen they      die away and she subsides  arnaud  back at her table with a quaint shrug towards the corridor it is not rowdy here madame as a rulenot as in some places  tonight a little noise  madame is fond of flowers  he whisks out and returns almost at once with a bowl of carnations from some table in the next room these smell good  clare  you are very kind  arnaud  with courtesy  not at all madame a pleasure  he bows       a young man tall thin hard straight with closecropped      sandyish hair and moustache a face tanned very red and one of      those small long lean heads that only grow in britain clad in      a thin dark overcoat thrown open an opera hat pushed back a      white waistcoat round his lean middle he comes in from the      corridor  he looks round glances at clare passes her table      towards the further room stops in the doorway and looks back      at her  her eyes have just been lifted and are at once cast      down again  the young man wavers catches arnauds eye jerks      his head to summon him and passes into the further room      arnaud takes up the vase that has been superseded and follows      him out  and clare sits alone in silence broken by the murmurs      of the languid lord and his partner behind the screen  she is      breathing as if she had been running hard  she lifts her eyes      the tall young man divested of hat and coat is standing by her      table holding out his hand with a sort of bashful hardiness  young man  how dyou do  didnt recognize you at first  so sorry awfully rude of me       clares eyes seem to fly from him to appeal to him to resign      herself all at once  something in the young man responds  he      drops his hand  clare  faintly  how dyou do  young man  stammering  youyou been down there today  clare  where  young man  with a smile  the derby  what  dont you

his face in the carnations  i saythese are jolly arent they  they do you pretty well here  clare  do they  young man  youve never been here  clare shakes her head by jove i thought i didnt know your

anythingi       he half rises  clare  its all right thank you       the young man sits down again uncomfortable nonplussed  there      is silence broken by the inaudible words of the languid lord      and the distant merriment of the supperparty  arnaud brings      the plovers eggs  young man  the wine quick  arnaud  at once sare  young man  abruptly dont you ever go racing then  clare  no       arnaud pours out champagne  young man  i remember awfully well my first day  it was pretty thicklost every blessed bob and my watch and chain playin three cards on the way home  clare  everything has a beginning hasnt it       she drinks  the young man stares at her  young man  floundering in these waters deeper than he had bargained for i sayabout things having beginningsdid you mean anything       clare nods  young man  what dyou mean its really the first       clare nods  the champagne has flicked her courage  young man  by george  he leans back  ive often wondered  arnaud  again filling the glasses  monsieur finds  young man  abruptly  its all right       he drains his glass then sits bolt upright  chivalry and the      camaraderie of class have begun to stir in him  young man  of course i can see that youre noti mean that youre aa lady  clare smiles  and i say you knowif you have to because youre in a holei should feel a cad  let me lend you  clare  holding up her glass le vin est tire il faut le boire       she drinks  the french words which he does not too well      understand completing his conviction that she is a lady he      remains quite silent frowning  as clare held up her glass two      gentlemen have entered  the first is blond of good height and      a comely insolence  his crisp fair hair and fair brushedup      moustache are just going grey an eyeglass is fixed in one of      two eyes that lord it over every woman they see his face is      broad and coloured with air and wine  his companion is a tall      thin dark bird of the night with sly roving eyes and hollow      cheeks  they stand looking round then pass into the further      room but in passing they have stared unreservedly at clare  young man  seeing her wince  look here  im afraid you must feel me rather a brute you know  clare  no i dont really  young man  are you absolute stoney  clare nods  but looking at her frock and cloak youre so awfully well  clare  i had the sense to keep them  young man  more and more disturbed  i say you knowi wish youd let me lend you something  i had quite a good day down there  clare  again tracing her pattern on the cloththen looking up at him full i cant take for nothing  young man  by jove  i dont knowreally i dontthis makes me feel pretty rotten  i mean its your being a lady  clare  smiling  thats not your fault is it  you see ive been beaten all along the line  and i really dont care what happens to me  she has that peculiar fey look on her face now  i really dont except that i dont take charity  its lucky for me its you and not some  the supperparty is getting still more boisterous and there comes a long view holloa and a blast of the horn  young man  but i say what about your people  you must have people of some sort       he is fast becoming fascinated for her cheeks have begun to      flush and her eyes to shine  clare  oh yes ive had people and a husband andeverything and here i am  queer isnt it  she touches her glass  this is going to my head  do you mind  i shant sing songs and get up and dance and i wont cry i promise you  young man  between fascination and chivalry  by george  one simply cant believe in this happening to a lady  clare  have you got sisters breaking into her soft laughter  my brothers in india  i shant meet him anyway  young man  no buti sayare you really quite cut off from everybody  clare nods  something rather awful must have happened       she smiles  the two gentlemen have returned the blond one is      again staring fixedly at clare  this time she looks back at      him flaming and with a little laugh he passes with his      friend into the corridor  clare  who are those two  young man  dont knownot been much about town yet  im just back from india myself  you said your brother was there whats his regiment  clare  shaking her head  youre not going to find out my name  i havent got onenothing       she leans her bare elbows on the table and her face on her      hands  clare  first of june  this day last year i broke covertive been running ever since  young man  i dont understand a bit  youmust have had aasome one       but there is such a change in her face such rigidity of her      whole body that he stops and averts his eyes  when he looks      again she is drinking  she puts the glass down and gives a      little laugh  young man  with a sort of awe  anyway it must have been like riding at a pretty stiff fence for you to come here tonight  clare  yes  whats the other side       the young man puts out his hand and touches her arm  it is      meant for sympathy but she takes it for attraction  clare  shaking her head  not yet please  im enjoying this  may i have a cigarette       he takes out his case and gives her one  clare  letting the smoke slowly forth  yes im enjoying it  had a pretty poor time lately not enough to eat sometimes  young man  not really  how damnable  i saydo have something more substantial       clare gives a sudden gasp as if going off into hysterical      laughter but she stifles it and shakes her head  young man  a peach       arnaud brings peaches to the table  clare  smiling thank you       he fills their glasses and retreats  clare raising her glass eat and drink for tomorrow welisten       from the supperparty comes the sound of an abortive chorus      with a hey ho chivy hark forrard hark forrard tantivy      jarring out into a discordant whoop it sinks  clare  this day a stag must die  jolly old song  young man  rowdy lot  suddenly i sayi admire your pluck  clare  shaking her head havent kept my end up  lots of women do you see im too fine and not fine enough  my best friend said that  too fine and not fine enough  she laughs i couldnt be a saint and martyr and i wouldnt be a soulless doll  neither one thing nor the otherthats the tragedy  young man  you must have had awful luck  clare  i did try  fiercely  but whats the goodwhen theres nothing before youdo i look ill  young man  no simply

dont you think it was rather sporting of me to buy these  she touches the gardenias  with the last shilling over from my cab fare  young man  did you really  dd sporting  clare  its no use doing things by halves is it  imin for it wish me luck  she drinks and puts her glass down with a smile in for itdeep  she flings up her hands above her smiling face down down till theyre just above water and thendown down down and all over  are you sorry now you came and spoke to me  young man  by jove no  it may be caddish but im not  clare  thank god for beauty  i hope i shall die pretty  do you

hot in here isnt it  wouldnt it be jollier drivin  shall weshall we make a move  clare  yes       the young man turns to look for the waiter but arnaud is not in      the room  he gets up  young man  feverishly dn that waiter  wait half a minute if you dont mind while i pay the bill       as he goes out into the corridor the two gentlemen reappear      clare is sitting motionless looking straight before her  dark one  a fiver you dont get her to  blond one  done       he advances to her table with his inimitable insolence and      taking the cigar from his mouth bends his stare on her and      says charmed to see you lookin so well  will you have supper      with me here tomorrow night  startled out of her reverie      clare looks up  she sees those eyes she sees beyond him the      eyes of his companionsly malevolent amusedwatching and she      just sits gazing without a word  at that regard so clear the      blond one does not wince  but rather suddenly he says thats      arranged then  halfpast eleven  so good of you  goodnight      he replaces his cigar and strolls back to his companion and in      a low voice says pay up  then at a languid hullo charles      they turn to greet the two in their nook behind the screen      clare has not moved nor changed the direction of her gaze      suddenly she thrusts her hand into the pocket of the cloak that      hangs behind her and brings out the little blue bottle which      six months ago she took from malise  she pulls out the cork      and pours the whole contents into her champagne  she lifts the      glass holds it before hersmiling as if to call a toast then      puts it to her lips and drinks  still smiling she sets the      empty glass down and lays the gardenia flowers against her      face  slowly she droops back in her chair the drowsy smile      still on her lips the gardenias drop into her lap her arms      relax her head falls forward on her breast  and the voices      behind the screen talk on and the sounds of joy from the      supperparty wax and wane       the waiter arnaud returning from the corridor passes to his      servicetable with a tall beribboned basket of fruit  putting      it down he goes towards the table behind the screen and sees      he runs up to clare  arnaud  madame madame  he listens for her breathing then suddenly catching sight of the little bottle smells at it bon dieu       at that queer sound they come from behind the screenall four      and look  the dark night bird says hallo fainted arnaud      holds out the bottle  languid lord  taking it and smelling good god  the woman bends over clare and lifts her hands arnaud rushes to his servicetable and speaks into his tube  arnaud  the boss  quick  looking up he sees the young man returning monsieur elle a fui  elle est morte  languid lord  to the young man standing there aghast  whats this friend of yours  young man  my god  she was a lady  thats all i know about her  languid lord  a lady       the blond and dark gentlemen have slipped from the room and out      of the supperpartys distant laughter comes suddenly a long      shrill gone away and the sound of the horn playing the seven      last notes of the old song this day a stag must die from the      last note of all the sound flies up to an octave higher sweet      and thin like a spirit passing till it is drowned once more in      laughter  the young man has covered his eyes with his hands      arnaud is crossing himself fervently the languid lord stands      gazing with one of the dropped gardenias twisted in his      fingers and the woman bending over clare kisses her forehead   curtain
