24513568	the british barbarians  a hilltop novel   by grant allen  1895     introduction   which every reader of this book is requested to read before beginning the story   this is a hilltop novel i dedicate it to all who have heart enough brain enough and soul enough to understand it  what do i mean by a hilltop novel well of late we have been flooded with stories of evil tendencies a hilltop novel is one which raises a protest in favour of purity  why have not novelists raised the protest earlier for this reason hitherto owing to the stern necessity laid upon the modern seer for earning his bread and incidentally for finding a publisher to assist him in promulgating his prophetic opinions it has seldom happened that writers of exceptional aims have been able to proclaim to the world at large the things which they conceived to be best worth their telling it especially has this been the case in the province of fiction let me explain the situation most novels nowadays have to run as serials through magazines or newspapers and the editors of these periodicals are timid to a degree which outsiders would hardly believe with regard to the fiction they admit into their pages endless spells surround them this story or episode would annoy their catholic readers that one would repel their wesleyan methodist subscribers such an incident is unfit for the perusal of the young person such another would drive away the offended british matron i do not myself believe there is any real ground for this excessive and to be quite frank somewhat ridiculous timidity incredible as it may seem to the ordinary editor i am of opinion that it would be possible to tell the truth and yet preserve the circulation a firstclass journal does not really suffer because two or three formalists or two or three bigots among its thousands of subscribers give it up for six weeks in a pet of illtemperand then take it on again still the effect remains it is almost impossible to get a novel printed in an english journal unless it is warranted to contain nothing at all to which anybody however narrow could possibly object on any grounds whatever religious political social moral or aesthetic the romance that appeals to the average editor must say or hint at nothing at all that is not universally believed and received by everybody everywhere in this realm of britain but literature as thomas hardy says with truth is mainly the expression of souls in revolt hence the antagonism between literature and journalism  why then publish ones novels serially at all why not appeal at once to the outside public which has few such prejudices why not deliver ones message direct to those who are ready to consider it or at least to hear it because unfortunately the serial rights of a novel at the present day are three times as valuable in money worth as the final book rights a man who elects to publish direct instead of running his story through the columns of a newspaper is forfeiting in other words threequarters of his income this loss the prophet who cares for his mission could cheerfully endure of course if only the diminished income were enough for him to live upon but in order to write he must first eat in my own case for example up till the time when i published the woman who did i could never live on the proceeds of direct publication nor could i even secure a publisher who would consent to aid me in introducing to the world what i thought most important for it having now found such a publisherhaving secured my mountaini am prepared to go on delivering my message from its top as long as the world will consent to hear it i will willingly forgo the serial value of my novels and forfeit threequarters of the amount i might otherwise earn for the sake of uttering the truth that is in me boldly and openly to a perverse generation  for this reason and in order to mark the distinction between these books which are really minemy own in thought in spirit in teachingand those which i have produced sorely against my will to satisfy editors i propose in future to add the words a hilltop novel to every one of my stories which i write of my own accord simply and solely for the sake of embodying and enforcing my own opinions  not that as critics have sometimes supposed me to mean i ever wrote a line even in fiction contrary to my own profound beliefs i have never said a thing i did not think but i have sometimes had to abstain from saying many things i did think when i wished to purvey strong meat for men i was condemned to provide milk for babes in the hilltop novels i hope to reverse all thatto say my say in my own way representing the world as it appears to me not as editors and formalists would like me to represent it  the hilltop novels however will not constitute in the ordinary sense a series i shall add the name as a trade mark to any story by whomsoever published which i have written as the expression of my own individuality nor will they necessarily appear in the first instance in volume form if ever i should be lucky enough to find an editor sufficiently bold and sufficiently righteous to venture upon running a hilltop novel as a serial through his columns i will gladly embrace that mode of publication but while editors remain as pusillanimous and as careless of moral progress as they are at present i have little hope that i shall persuade any one of them to accept a work written with a single eye to the enlightenment and bettering of humanity  whenever therefore in future the words a hilltop novel appear upon the titlepage of a book by me the reader who cares for truth and righteousness may take it for granted that the book represents my own original thinking whether good or bad on some important point in human society or human evolution  not again that any one of these novels will deliberately attempt to prove anything i have been amused at the allegations brought by certain critics against the woman who did that it failed to prove the practicability of unions such as herminias and alans the famous scotsman in the same spirit objected to paradise lost that it proved naething but his criticism has not been generally endorsed as valid to say the truth it is absurd to suppose a work of imagination can prove or disprove anything the author holds the strings of all his puppets and can pull them as he likes for good or evil he can make his experiments turn out well or ill he can contrive that his unions should end happily or miserably how then can his story be said to prove anything a novel is not a proposition in euclid i give due notice beforehand to reviewers in general that if any principle at all is proved by any of my hilltop novels it will be simply this act as i think right for the highest good of human kind and you will infallibly and inevitably come to a bad end for it  not to prove anything but to suggest ideas to arouse emotions is i take it the true function of fiction one wishes to make ones readers think about problems they have never considered feel with sentiments they have disliked or hated the novelist as prophet has his duty defined for him in those divine words of shelleys       singing songs unbidden      till the world is wrought      to sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not   that too is the reason that impels me to embody such views as these in romantic fiction not in deliberate treatises why sow your ideas broadcast many honest critics say in novels where mere boys and girls can read them why not formulate them in serious and argumentative books where wise men alone will come across them the answer is because wise men are wise already it is the boys and girls of a community who stand most in need of suggestion and instruction women in particular are the chief readers of fiction and it is women whom one mainly desires to arouse to interest in profound problems by the aid of this vehicle especially should one arouse them to such living interest while they are still young and plastic before they have crystallised and hardened into the conventional marionettes of polite society make them think while they are young make them feel while they are sensitive it is then alone that they will think and feel if ever i will venture indeed to enforce my views on this subject by a little apologue which i have somewhere read or heardor invented  a revolutionist desired to issue an election address to the working men of bermondsey the rector of the parish saw it at the printers and came to him much perturbed why write it in english he asked it will only inflame the minds of the lower orders why not allow me to translate it into ciceronian latin it would then be comprehensible to all university men your logic would be duly and deliberately weighed and the tanners and tinkers who are so very impressionable would not be poisoned by it my friend said the revolutionist it is the tanners and tinkers i want to get at my object is to win this election university graduates will not help me to win it  the business of the preacher is above all things to preach but in order to preach he must first reach his audience the audience in this case consists in large part of women and girls who are most simply and easily reached by fiction therefore fiction is today the best medium for the preacher of righteousness who addresses humanity  why once more this particular name a hilltop novel for something like this reason  i am writing in my study on a heatherclad hilltop when i raise my eye from my sheet of foolscap it falls upon miles and miles of broad open moorland my window looks out upon unsullied nature everything around is fresh and pure and wholesome through the open casement the scent of the pines blows in with the breeze from the neighbouring firwood keen airs sigh through the pineneedles grasshoppers chirp from deep tangles of bracken the song of a skylark drops from the sky like soft rain in summer in the evening a nightjar croons to us his monotonously passionate lovewail from his perch on the gnarled boughs of the windswept larch that crowns the upland but away below in the valley as night draws on a lurid glare reddens the northeastern horizon it marks the spot where the great wen of london heaves and festers up here on the free hills the sharp air blows in upon us limpid and clear from a thousand leagues of open ocean down there in the crowded town it stagnates and ferments polluted with the diseases and vices of centuries  this is an urban age the men of the villages alas are leaving behind them the green fields and purple moors of their childhood are foolishly crowding into the narrow lanes and purlieus of the great cities strange decadent sins and morbid pleasures entice them thither but i desire in these books to utter a word once more in favour of higher and purer ideals of life and art those who sicken of the foul air and lurid light of towns may still wander side by side with me on these heathery highlands far far below the theatre and the musichall spread their garish gaslamps let who will heed them but here on the open hilltop we know fresher and more wholesome delights those feverish joys allure us not o decadents of the town we have seen your sham idyls your tinsel arcadias we have tired of their stuffy atmosphere their dazzling jets their weary ways their gaudy dresses we shun the sunken cheeks the lacklustre eyes the heartsick souls of your painted goddesses we love not the fetid air thick and hot with human breath and reeking with tobacco smoke of your modern parnassusa parnassus whose crags were reared and shaped by the hands of the stagecarpenter your studied dalliance with your venal muses is little to our taste your halls are too stifling with carbonic acid gas for us we breathe oxygen  and the oxygen of the hilltops is purer keener rarer more ethereal it is rich in ozone now ozone stands to common oxygen itself as the cleancut metal to the dull and leaden exposed surface nascent and ever renascent it has electrical attraction it leaps to the embrace of the atom it selects but only under the influence of powerful affinities and what it clasps once it clasps for ever that is the pure air which we drink in on the heatherclad heightsnot the venomous air of the crowded casino nor even the close air of the middleclass parlour it thrills and nerves us how we smile we who live here when some dweller in the mists and smoke of the valley confounds our delicate atmosphere redolent of honey and echoing the manifold murmur of bees with that stifling miasma of the gambling hell and the dancing saloon trust me dear friend the moorland air is far other than you fancy you can wander up here along the purple ridges hand locked in hand with those you love without fear of harm to yourself or your comrade no bloom of ninon here but fresh cheeks like the peachblossom where the sun has kissed it no casual fruition of loveless joyless harlots but lifelong saturation of your own hearts desire in your own hearts innocence ozone is better than all the champagne in the strand or piccadilly if only you will believe it it is purity and life and sympathy and vigour its perfect freshness and perpetual fount of youth keep your age from withering it crimsons the sunset and lives in the afterglow if these delights thy mind may move leave oh leave the meretricious town and come to the airy peaks such joy is ours unknown to the squalid village which spreads its swamps where the poets silver thames runs dull and leaden  have we never our doubts though up here on the hilltops ay marry have we are we so sure that these gospels we preach with all our hearts are the true and final ones who shall answer that question for myself as i lift up my eyes from my paper once more my gaze falls first on the golden bracken that waves joyously over the sandstone ridge without and then within on a little white shelf where lies the greatest book of our greatest philosopher i open it at random and consult its sortes what comfort and counsel has herbert spencer for those who venture to see otherwise than the mass of their contemporaries  whoever hesitates to utter that which he thinks the highest truth lest it should be too much in advance of the time may reassure himself by looking at his acts from an impersonal point of view let him duly realise the fact that opinion is the agency through which character adapts external arrangements to itselfthat his opinion rightly forms part of this agencyis a unit of force constituting with other such units the general power which works out social changes and he will perceive that he may properly give full utterance to his innermost conviction leaving it to produce what effect it may it is not for nothing that he has in him these sympathies with some principles and repugnances to others he with all his capacities and aspirations and beliefs is not an accident but a product of the time he must remember that while he is a descendant of the past he is a parent of the future and that his thoughts are as children born to him which he may not carelessly let die he like every other man may properly consider himself as one of the myriad agencies through whom works the unknown cause and when the unknown cause produces in him a certain belief he is thereby authorised to profess and act out that belief for to render in their highest sense the words of the poet       nature is made better by no mean      but nature makes that mean over that art      which you say adds to nature is an art      that nature makes   not as adventitious therefore will the wise man regard the faith which is in him the highest truth he sees he will fearlessly utter knowing that let what may come of it he is thus playing his right part in the worldknowing that if he can effect the change he aims atwell if notwell also though not so well  that passage comforts me these then are my ideas they may be right they may be wrong but at least they are the sincere and personal convictions of an honest man warranted in him by that spirit of the age of which each of us is but an automatic mouthpiece  g a       the british barbarians     i   the time was saturday afternoon the place was surrey the person of the drama was philip christy  he had come down by the early fast train to brackenhurst all the world knows brackenhurst of course the greenest and leafiest of our southern suburbs it looked even prettier than its wont just then that town of villas in the first fresh tenderness of its wan spring foliage the first full flush of lilac laburnum horsechestnut and guelderrose the air was heavy with the odour of may and the hum of bees philip paused a while at the corner by the ivied cottage admiring it silently he was glad he lived thereso very aristocratic what joy to glide direct on the enchanted carpet of the southeastern railway from the gloom and din and bustle of cannon street to the breadth and space and silence and exclusiveness of that upland village for philip christy was a gentlemanly clerk in her majestys civil service  as he stood there admiring it all with roving eyes he was startled after a moment by the sudden and as it seemed to him unannounced apparition of a man in a wellmade grey tweed suit just a yard or two in front of him he was aware of an intruder to be sure there was nothing very remarkable at first sight either in the strangers dress appearance or manner all that philip noticed for himself in the newcomers mien for the first few seconds was a certain distinct air of social superiority an innate nobility of gait and bearing so much at least he observed at a glance quite instinctively but it was not this quiet and unobtrusive tone as of the best society that surprised and astonished him brackenhurst prided itself indeed on being a most wellbred and distinguished neighbourhood people of note grew as thick there as heather or whortleberries what puzzled him more was the abstruser question where on earth the stranger could have come from so suddenly philip had glanced up the road and down the road just two minutes before and was prepared to swear when he withdrew his eyes not a soul loomed in sight in either direction whence then could the man in the grey suit have emerged had he dropped from the clouds no gate opened into the road on either side for two hundred yards or more for brackenhurst is one of those extremely respectable villa neighbourhoods where every housean eligible family residencestands in its own grounds of at least six acres now philip could hardly suspect that so well dressed a man of such distinguished exterior would be guilty of such a gross breach of the recognised code of brackenhurstian manners as was implied in the act of vaulting over a hedgerow so he gazed in blank wonder at the suddenness of the apparition more than half inclined to satisfy his curiosity by inquiring of the stranger how the dickens he had got there  a moments reflection however sufficed to save the ingenuous young man from the pitfall of so serious a social solecism it would be fatal to accost him for mark you no matter how gentlemanly and welltailored a stranger may look you can never be sure nowadays in these topsyturvy times of subversive radicalism whether he is or is not really a gentleman that makes acquaintanceship a dangerous luxury if you begin by talking to a man be it ever so casually he may desire to thrust his company upon you willynilly in future and when you have ladies of your family living in a place you really cannot be too particular what companions you pick up there were it even in the most informal and momentary fashion besides the fellow might turn out to be one of your social superiors and not care to know you in which case of course you would only be letting yourself in for a needless snubbing in fact in this modern england of ours this fatherland of snobdom one passes ones life in a seesaw of doubt between the scylla and charybdis of those two antithetical social dangers you are always afraid you may get to know somebody you yourself do not want to know or may try to know somebody who does not want to know you  guided by these truly british principles of ancestral wisdom philip christy would probably never have seen anything more of the distinguishedlooking stranger had it not been for a passing accident of muscular action over which his control was distinctly precarious he happened in brushing past to catch the strangers eye it was a clear blue eye very deep and truthful it somehow succeeded in riveting for a second philips attention and it was plain the stranger was less afraid of speaking than philip himself was for he advanced with a pleasant smile on his open countenance and waved one gloveless hand in a sort of impalpable or halfchecked salute which impressed his new acquaintance as a vaguely polite continental gesture this affected philip favourably the newcomer was a somebody then and knew his place for just in proportion as philip felt afraid to begin conversation himself with an unplaced stranger did he respect any other man who felt so perfectly sure of his own position that he shared no such middleclass doubts or misgivings a duke is never afraid of accosting anybody philip was strengthened therefore in his first idea that the man in the grey suit was a person of no small distinction in society else surely he would not have come up and spoken with such engaging frankness and ease of manner  i beg your pardon the stranger said addressing him in pure and limpid english which sounded to philip like the dialect of the very best circles yet with some nameless difference of intonation or accent which certainly was not foreign still less provincial or scotch or irish it seemed rather like the very purest well of english undefiled philip had ever heardonly if anything a little more so i beg your pardon but im a stranger hereabouts and i should be so very much obliged if you could kindly direct me to any good lodgings  his voice and accent attracted philip even more now he stood near at hand than his appearance had done from a little distance it was impossible indeed to say definitely in set terms what there was about the man that made his personality and his words so charming but from that very first minute philip freely admitted to himself that the stranger in the grey suit was a perfect gentleman nay so much did he feel it in his ingenuous way that he threw off at once his accustomed cloak of dubious reserve and standing still to think answered after a short pause well weve a great many very nice furnished houses about here to let but not many lodgings brackenhursts a cut above lodgings dont you know its a residential quarter but i should think miss blakes at heathercliff house would perhaps be just the sort of thing to suit you  oh thank you the stranger answered with a deferential politeness which charmed philip once more by its graceful expressiveness and could you kindly direct me to them i dont know my way about at all you see as yet in this country  with pleasure philip replied quite delighted at the chance of solving the mystery of where the stranger had dropped from im going that way myself and can take you past her door its only a few steps then youre a stranger in england  the newcomer smiled a curious selfrestrained smile he was both young and handsome yes im a stranger in your england he answered gravely in the tone of one who wishes to avoid an awkward discussion in fact an alien i only arrived here this very morning  from the continent philip inquired arching his eyebrows slightly  the stranger smiled again no not from the continent he replied with provoking evasiveness  i thought you werent a foreigner philip continued in a blandly suggestive voice that is to say he went on after a seconds pause during which the stranger volunteered no further statement you speak english like an englishman  do i the stranger answered well im glad of that itll make intercourse with your englishmen so much more easy  by this time philips curiosity was thoroughly whetted but youre not an englishman you say he asked with a little natural hesitation  no not exactly what you call an englishman the stranger replied as if he didnt quite care for such clumsy attempts to examine his antecedents as i tell you im an alien but we always spoke english at home he added with an afterthought as if ready to vouchsafe all the other information that lay in his power  you cant be an american im sure philip went on unabashed his eagerness to solve the question at issue once raised getting the better for the moment of both reserve and politeness  no im certainly not an american the stranger answered with a gentle courtesy in his tone that made philip feel ashamed of his rudeness in questioning him  nor a colonist philip asked once more unable to take the hint  nor a colonist either the alien replied curtly and then he relapsed into a momentary silence which threw upon philip the difficult task of continuing the conversation  the member of her britannic majestys civil service would have given anything just that minute to say to him frankly well if youre not an englishman and youre not an american and youre not a colonist and you are an alien and yet you talk english like a native and have always talked it why what in the name of goodness do you want us to take you for but he restrained himself with difficulty there was something about the stranger that made him feel by instinct it would be more a breach of etiquette to question him closely than to question any one he had ever met with  they walked on along the road for some minutes together the stranger admiring all the way the golden tresses of the laburnum and the rich perfume of the lilac and talking much as he went of the quaintness and prettiness of the suburban houses philip thought them pretty too or rather important but failed to see for his own part where the quaintness came in nay he took the imputation as rather a slur on so respectable a neighbourhood for to be quaint is to be picturesque and to be picturesque is to be oldfashioned but the strangers voice and manner were so pleasant almost so ingratiating that philip did not care to differ from him on the abstract question of a qualifying epithet after all theres nothing positively insulting in calling a house quaint though philip would certainly have preferred himself to hear the eligible family residences of that aristocratic neighbourhood described in auctioneering phrase as imposing noble handsome or importantlooking  just before they reached miss blakes door the alien paused for a second he took out a loose handful of money gold and silver together from his trouser pocket one more question he said with that pleasant smile on his lips if youll excuse my ignorance which of these coins is a pound now and which is a sovereign  why a pound is a sovereign of course philip answered briskly smiling the genuine british smile of unfeigned astonishment that anybody should be ignorant of a minor detail in the kind of life he had always lived among to be sure he would have asked himself with equal simplicity what was the difference between a twentyfranc piece a napoleon and a louis or would have debated as to the precise numerical relation between twentyfive cents and a quarter of a dollar but then those are mere foreign coins you see which no fellow can be expected to understand unless he happens to have lived in the country they are used in the others are british and necessary to salvation that feeling is instinctive in the thoroughly provincial english nature no englishman ever really grasps for himself the simple fact that england is a foreign country to foreigners if strangers happen to show themselves ignorant of any petty matter in english life he regards their ignorance as silly and childish not to be compared for a moment to his own natural unfamiliarity with the absurd practices of foreign nations  the alien indeed seemed to have learned beforehand this curious peculiarity of the limited english intellect for he blushed slightly as he replied i know your currency as a matter of arithmetic of course twelve pence make one shilling twenty shillings make one pound  of course philip echoed in a tone of perfect conviction it would never have occurred to him to doubt for a moment that everybody knew intuitively those beggarly elements of the inspired british monetary system  though theyre singularly awkward units of value for any one accustomed to a decimal coinage so unreasonable and illogical the stranger continued blandly turning over the various pieces with a dubious air of distrust and uncertainty  i beg your pardon philip said drawing himself up very stiff and scarcely able to believe his ears he was an official of her britannic majestys government and unused to such blasphemy do i understand you to say you consider pounds shillings and pence unreasonable  he put an emphasis on the last word that might fairly have struck terror to the strangers breast but somehow it did not why yes the alien went on with imperturbable gentleness no order or principle you know no rational connection a mere survival from barbaric use a score and a dozen the score is one man ten fingers and ten toes the dozen is one man with shoes onfingers and feet together twelve pence make one shilling twenty shillings one pound how very confusing and then the nomenclatures so absurdly difficult which of these is halfacrown if you please and which is a florin and what are their respective values in pence and shillings  philip picked out the coins and explained them to him separately the alien meanwhile received the information with evident interest as a traveller in that vast tract that is called abroad might note the habits and manners of some savage tribe that dwells within its confines and solemnly wrapped each coin up in paper as his instructor named it for him writing the designation and value outside in a peculiarly beautiful and legible hand its so puzzling you see he said in explanation as philip smiled another superior and condescending british smile at this infantile proceeding the currency itself has no congruity or order and then even these queer unrelated coins havent for the most part their values marked in words or figures upon them  everybody knows what they are philip answered lightly though for a moment taken aback by the novelty of the idea he almost admitted in his own mind that to people who had the misfortune to be born foreigners there was perhaps a slight initial difficulty in this unlettered system but then you cannot expect england to be regulated throughout for the benefit of foreigners though to be sure on the one occasion when philip had visited the rhine and switzerland he had grumbled most consumedly from ostend to grindelwald at those very decimal coins which the stranger seemed to admire so much and had wondered why the deuce belgium germany holland and switzerland could not agree among themselves upon a uniform coinage it would be so much more convenient to the british tourist for the british tourist of course is not a foreigner  on the doorstep of miss blakes furnished apartments for families and gentlemen the stranger stopped again one more question he interposed in that same suave voice if im not trespassing too much on your time and patience for what sort of termby the day month yeardoes one usually take lodgings  why by the week of course philip answered suppressing a broad smile of absolute surprise at the mans childish ignorance  and how much shall i have to pay the alien went on quietly have you any fixed rule about it  of course not philip answered unable any longer to restrain his amusement everything in england was of course to philip you pay according to the sort of accommodation you require the number of your rooms and the nature of the neighbourhood  i see the alien replied imperturbably polite in spite of philips condescending manner and what do i pay per room in this latitude and longitude  for twenty seconds philip half suspected his new acquaintance of a desire to chaff him but as at the same time the alien drew from his pocket a sort of combined compass and chronometer which he gravely consulted for his geographical bearings philip came to the conclusion he must be either a seafaring man or an escaped lunatic so he answered him to the point i should think he said quietly as miss blakes are extremely respectable lodgings in a firstrate quarter and with a splendid view youll probably have to pay somewhere about three guineas  three what the stranger interposed with an inquiring glance at the little heap of coins he still held before him  philip misinterpreted his glance perhaps thats too much for you he suggested looking severe for if people cannot afford to pay for decent rooms they have no right to invade an aristocratic suburb and bespeak the attention of its regular residents  oh thats not it the alien put in reading his tone aright the money doesnt matter to me as long as i can get a tidy room with sun and air i dont mind what i pay its the guinea i cant quite remember about for the moment i looked it up i know in a dictionary at home but im afraid ive forgotten it let me see its twentyone pounds to the guinea isnt it then im to pay about sixtythree pounds a week for my lodgings  this was the right spirit he said it so simply so seriously so innocently that philip was quite sure he really meant it he was prepared if necessary to pay sixty odd pounds a week in rent now a man like that is the proper kind of man for a respectable neighbourhood hell keep a good saddlehorse join the club and play billiards freely philip briefly explained to him the nature of his mistake pointing out to him that a guinea was an imaginary coin unrepresented in metal but reckoned by prescription at twentyone shillings the stranger received the slight correction with such perfect nonchalance that philip at once conceived a high opinion of his wealth and solvency and therefore of his respectability and moral character it was clear that pounds and shillings were all one to him philip had been right no doubt in his first diagnosis of his queer acquaintance as a man of distinction for wealth and distinction are practically synonyms in england for one and the same quality possession of the wherewithal  as they parted the stranger spoke again still more at sea and are there any special ceremonies to be gone through on taking up lodgings he asked quite gravely any religious rites i mean to say any poojah or so forth that is he went on as philips smile broadened is there any taboo to be removed or appeased before i can take up my residence in the apartments  by this time philip was really convinced he had to do with a madmanperhaps a dangerous lunatic so he answered rather testily no certainly not how absurd you must see thats ridiculous youre in a civilised country not among australian savages all youll have to do is to take the rooms and pay for them im sorry i cant be of any further use to you but im pressed for time today so now goodmorning  as for the stranger he turned up the path through the lodginghouse garden with curious misgivings his heart failed him it was halfpast three by mean solar time for that particular longitude then why had this young man said so briskly good morning at 330 pm as if on purpose to deceive him was he laying a trap was this some wile and guile of the english medicinemen     ii   next day was not unnaturally sunday at halfpast ten in the morning according to his wont philip christy was seated in the drawingroom at his sisters house smooth silk hat in gloved hand waiting for frida and her husband robert monteith to go to church with him as he sat there twiddling his thumbs or beating the devils tattoo on the red japanese table the housemaid entered a gentleman to see you sir she said handing philip a card the young man glanced at it curiously a visitor to call at such an early hourand on sunday morning too how extremely odd this was really most irregular  so he looked down at the card with a certain vague sense of inarticulate disapproval but he noticed at the same time it was finer and clearer and more delicately engraved than any other card he had ever yet come across it bore in simple unobtrusive letters the unknown name mr bertram ingledew  though he had never heard it before name and engraving both tended to mollify philips nascent dislike show the gentleman in martha he said in his most grandiose tone and the gentleman entered  philip started at sight of him it was his friend the alien philip was quite surprised to see his madman of last night and what was more disconcerting still in the selfsame grey tweed homespun suit he had worn last evening now nothing can be more gentlemanly dont you know than a grey homespun in its proper place but its proper place philip christy felt was certainly not in a respectable suburb on a sunday morning  i beg your pardon he said frigidly rising from his seat with his sternest official airthe air he was wont to assume in the anteroom at the office when outsiders called and wished to interview his chief on important public business to what may i owe the honour of this visit for he did not care to be hunted up in his sisters house at a moments notice by a most casual acquaintance whom he suspected of being an escaped lunatic  bertram ingledew for his part however advanced towards his companion of last night with the frank smile and easy bearing of a cultivated gentleman he was blissfully unaware of the slight he was putting upon the respectability of brackenhurst by appearing on sunday in his grey tweed suit so he only held out his hand as to an ordinary friend with the simple words you were so extremely kind to me last night mr christy that as i happen to know nobody here in england i ventured to come round and ask your advice in unexpected circumstances that have since arisen  when bertram ingledew looked at him philip once more relented the mans eye was so captivating to say the truth there was something taking about the mysterious strangera curious air of unconscious superiorityso that the moment he came near philip felt himself fascinated he only answered therefore in as polite a tone as he could easily muster why how did you get to know my name or to trace me to my sisters  oh miss blake told me who you were and where you lived bertram replied most innocently his tone was pure candour and when i went round to your lodgings just now they explained that you were out but that i should probably find you at mrs monteiths so of course i came on here  philip denied the applicability of that naive of course in his inmost soul but it was no use being angry with mr bertram ingledew so much he saw at once the man was so simpleminded so transparently natural one could not be angry with him one could only smile at him a superior cynical londonbred smile for an unsophisticated foreigner so the civil servant asked with a condescending air well whats your difficulty ill see if peradventure i can help you out of it for he reflected to himself in a flash that as ingledew had apparently a good round sum in gold and notes in his pocket yesterday he was not likely to come borrowing money this morning  its like this you see the alien answered with charming simplicity i havent got any luggage  not got any luggage philip repeated awestruck letting his jaw fall short and stroking his cleanshaven chin with one hand he was more doubtful than ever now as to the mans sanity or respectability if he was not a lunatic then surely he must be this celebrated perpignan murderer whom everybody was talking about and whom the french police were just then engaged in hunting down for extradition  no i brought none with me on purpose mr ingledew replied as innocently as ever i didnt feel quite sure about the ways or the customs or the taboos of england so i had just this one suit of clothes made after an english pattern of the present fashion which i was lucky enough to secure from a collector at home and i thought id buy everything else i wanted when i got to london i brought nothing at all in the way of luggage with me  not even brush and comb philip interposed horrified  oh yes naturally just the few things one always takes in a vademecum bertram ingledew answered with a gracefully deprecatory wave of the hand which philip thought pretty enough but extremely foreign beyond that nothing i felt it would be best you see to set oneself up in things of the country in the country itself ones surer then of getting exactly whats worn in the society one mixes in  for the first and only time as he said those words the stranger struck a chord that was familiar to philip oh of course the civil servant answered with brisk acquiescence if you want to be really up to date in your dress you must go to firstrate houses in london for everything nobody anywhere can cut like a good london tailor  bertram ingledew bowed his head it was the acquiescent bow of the utter outsider who gives no opinion at all on the subject under discussion because he does not possess any as he probably came in spite of his disclaimer from america or the colonies which are belated places toiling in vain far in the rear of bond street philip thought this an exceedingly proper display of bashfulness especially in a man who had only landed in england yesterday but bertram went on halfmusingly and you had told me he said im sure not meaning to mislead me there were no formalities or taboos of any kind on entering into lodgings however i found as soon as id arranged to take the rooms and pay four guineas a week for them which was a guinea more than she asked me miss blake would hardly let me come in at all unless i could at once produce my luggage he looked comically puzzled i thought at first he continued gazing earnestly at philip the good lady was afraid i wouldnt pay her what id agreed and would go away and leave her in the lurch without a pennywhich was naturally a very painful imputation but when i offered to let her have three weeks rent in advance i saw that wasnt all there was a taboo as well she couldnt let me in without luggage she said because it would imperil some luck or talisman to which she frequently alluded as the respectability of her lodgings this respectability seems a very great fetich i was obliged at last in order to ensure a nights lodging of any sort to appease it by promising id go up to london by the first train today and fetch down my luggage  then youve things at charing cross in the cloakroom perhaps philip suggested somewhat relieved for he felt sure bertram ingledew must have told miss blake it was he who had recommended him to heathercliff house for furnished apartments  oh dear no nothing bertram responded cheerfully not a sack to my back ive only what i stand up in and i called this morning just to ask as i passed if you could kindly direct me to an emporium in london where i could set myself up in all thats necessary  a what philip interposed catching quick at the unfamiliar word with blank english astonishment and more than ever convinced in spite of denial that the stranger was an american  an emporium bertram answered in the most matteroffact voice a magazine dont you know a place where they supply things in return for money i want to go up to london at once this morning and buy what i require there  oh a shop you mean philip replied putting on at once his most respectable british sabbatarian air i can tell you of the very best tailor in london whose cut is perfect a fine flower of tailors but not today you forget youre in england and this is sunday on the continent its different but youll find no decent shops here open today in town or country  bertram ingledew drew one hand over his high white brow with a strangely puzzled air no more i will he said slowly like one who by degrees half recalls with an effort some forgotten fact from dim depths of his memory i ought to have remembered of course why i knew that long ago i read it in a book on the habits and manners of the english people but somehow one never recollects these taboo days wherever one may be till ones pulled up short by them in the course of ones travels now what on earth am i to do a box it seems is the open sesame of the situation some mystic value is attached to it as a moral amulet i dont believe that excellent miss blake would consent to take me in for a second night without the guarantee of a portmanteau to respectablise me  we all have moments of weakness even the most irreproachable philistine among us and as bertram said those words in rather a piteous voice it occurred to philip christy that the loan of a portmanteau would be a christian act which might perhaps simplify matters for the handsome and engaging stranger besides he was sure after allmystery or no mysterybertram ingledew was somebody that nameless charm of dignity and distinction impressed him more and more the longer he talked with the alien well i think perhaps i could help you he hazarded after a moment in a dubious tone though to be sure if he lent the portmanteau it would be like cementing the friendship for good or for evil which philip being a prudent young man felt to be in some ways a trifle dangerous for who borrows a portmanteau must needs bring it back againwhich opens the door to endless contingencies i might be able  at that moment their colloquy was suddenly interrupted by the entry of a lady who immediately riveted bertram ingledews attention she was tall and dark a beautiful woman of that riper and truer beauty in face and form that only declares itself as character develops her features were clear cut rather delicate than regular her eyes were large and lustrous her lips not too thin but rich and tempting her brow was high and surmounted by a luscious wealth of glossy black hair which bertram never remembered to have seen equalled before for its silkiness of texture and its strange blue sheen like a plate of steel or the grass of the prairies gliding grace distinguished her when she walked her motion was equable as once the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and straightway coveted them even so bertram ingledew looked on frida monteith and saw at the first glance she was a woman to be desired a soul highthroned very calm and beautiful  she stood there for a moment and faced him half in doubt in her flowing oriental or mauresque robe for she dressed as philip would have said artistically waiting to be introduced the while and taking good heed as she waited of the handsome stranger as for philip he hesitated not quite certain in his own mind on the point of etiquettesay rather of moralswhether one ought or ought not to introduce the ladies of ones family to a casual stranger picked up in the street who confesses he has come on a visit to england without a letter of introduction or even that irreducible minimum of respectabilitya portmanteau frida however had no such scruples she saw the young man was goodlooking and gentlemanly and she turned to philip with the hasty sort of glance that says as plainly as words could say it now then introduce me  thus mutely exhorted though with a visible effort philip murmured half inarticulately in a stifled undertone my sister mrs monteithmr bertram ingledew and then trembled inwardly  it was a surprise to bertram that the beautiful woman with the soul in her eyes should turn out to be the sister of the very commonplace young man with the boiledfish expression he had met by the corner but he disguised his astonishment and only interjected as if it were the most natural remark in the world im pleased to meet you what a lovely gown and how admirably it becomes you  philip opened his eyes aghast but frida glanced down at the dress with a glance of approbation the strangers frankness though quaint was really refreshing  im so glad you like it she said taking the compliment with quiet dignity as simply as it was intended its all my own taste i chose the stuff and designed the make of it and i know who this is phil without your troubling to tell me its the gentleman you met in the street last night and were talking about at dinner  youre quite right philip answered with a deprecating look as who should say aside i really couldnt help it hehes rather in a difficulty and then he went on to explain in a few hurried words to frida with sundry shrugs and nods of profoundest import that the supposed lunatic or murderer or foreigner or fool had gone to miss blakes without luggage of any sort and that perhapsvery dubitativelya portmanteau or bag might help him out of his temporary difficulties  why of course frida cried impulsively with prompt decision roberts gladstone bag and my little brown trunk would be the very things for him i could lend them to him at once if only we can get a sunday cab to take them  not before service surely philip interposed scandalised if he were to take them now you know hed meet all the churchpeople  is it taboo then to face the clergy with a gladstone bag bertram asked quite seriously in that childlike tone of simple inquiry that philip had noticed more than once before in him your bonzes object to meet a man with luggage they think it unlucky  frida and philip looked at one another with quick glances and laughed  well its not exactly tabooed frida answered gently and its not so much the rector himself you know as the feelings of ones neighbours this is a very respectable neighbourhoodoh quite dreadfully respectableand people in the houses about might make a talk of it if a cab drove away from the door as they were passing i think phil youre right hed better wait till the churchpeople are finished  respectability seems to be a very great object of worship in your village bertram suggested in perfect good faith is it a local cult or is it general in england  frida glanced at him half puzzled oh i think its pretty general she answered with a happy smile but perhaps the disease is a little more epidemic about here than elsewhere it affects the suburbs and my brothers got it just as badly as any one  as badly as any one bertram repeated with a puzzled air then you dont belong to that creed yourself you dont bend the knee to this embodied abstractionits your brother who worships her i suppose for the family  yes hes more of a devotee than i am frida went on quite frankly but not a little surprised at so much freedom in a stranger though were all of us tarred with the same brush no doubt its a catching complaint i suppose respectability  bertram gazed at her dubiously a complaint did she say was she serious or joking he hardly understood her but further discussion was cut short for the moment by frida goodhumouredly running upstairs to see after the gladstone bag and brown portmanteau into which she crammed a few useless books and other heavy things to serve as makeweights for miss blakes injured feelings  youd better wait a quarter of an hour after we go to church she said as the servant brought these necessaries into the room where bertram and philip were seated by that time nearly all the churchpeople will be safe in their seats and phils conscience will be satisfied you can tell miss blake youve brought a little of your luggage to do for today and the rest will follow from town tomorrow morning  oh how very kind you are bertram exclaimed looking down at her gratefully im sure i dont know what i should ever have done in this crisis without you  he said it with a warmth which was certainly unconventional frida coloured and looked embarrassed there was no denying he was certainly a most strange and untrammelled person  and if i might venture on a hint philip put in with a hasty glance at his companions extremely unsabbatical costume it would be that you shouldnt try to go out much today in that suit youre wearing it looks peculiar dont you know and might attract attention  oh is that a taboo too the stranger put in quickly with an anxious air now thats awfully kind of you but its curious as well for two or three people passed my window last night all englishmen as i judged and all with suits almost exactly like this onewhich was copied as i told you from an english model  last night oh yes philip answered last night was saturday that makes all the difference the suits right enough in its way of coursevery neat and gentlemanly but not for sunday youre expected on sundays to put on a black coat and waistcoat you know like the ones im wearing  bertrams countenance fell and if im seen in the street like this he asked will they do anything to me will the guardians of the peacethe police i meanarrest me  frida laughed a bright little laugh of genuine amusement  oh dear no she said merrily it isnt an affair of police at all not so serious as that its only a matter of respectability  i see bertram answered respectabilitys a religious or popular not an official or governmental taboo i quite understand you but those are often the most dangerous sort will the people in the street who adore respectability be likely to attack me or mob me for disrespect to their fetich  certainly not frida replied flushing up he seemed to be carrying a joke too far this is a free country everybody wears and eats and drinks just what he pleases  well thats all very interesting to me the alien went on with a charming smile that disarmed her indignation for ive come here on purpose to collect facts and notes about english taboos and similar observances im secretary of a nomological society at home which is interested in pagodas topes and josshouses and ive been travelling in africa and in the south sea islands for a long time past working at materials for a history of taboo from its earliest beginnings in the savage stage to its fully developed european complexity so of course all you say comes home to me greatly your taboos i foresee will prove a most valuable and illustrative study  i beg your pardon philip interposed stiffly now put upon his mettle we have no taboos at all in england youre misled no doubt by a mere playful facon de parler which society indulges in england you must remember is a civilised country and taboos are institutions that belong to the lowest and most degraded savages  but bertram ingledew gazed at him in the blankest astonishment no taboos he exclaimed taken aback why ive read of hundreds among nomological students england has always been regarded with the greatest interest as the home and centre of the highest and most evolved taboo development and you yourself he added with a courteous little bow have already supplied me with quite half a dozen but perhaps you call them by some other name among yourselves though in origin and essence of course theyre precisely the same as the other taboos ive been examining so long in asia and africa however im afraid im detaining you from the function of your josshouse you wish no doubt to make your genuflexions in the temple of respectability  and he reflected silently on the curious fact that the english give themselves by law fiftytwo weekly holidays a year and compel themselves by custom to waste them entirely in ceremonial observances     iii   on the way to church the monteiths sifted out their new acquaintance  well what do you make of him frida philip asked leaning back in his place with a luxurious air as soon as the carriage had turned the corner lunatic or sharper  frida gave an impatient gesture with her neatly gloved hand for my part she answered without a seconds hesitation i make him neither i find him simply charming  thats because he praised your dress philip replied looking wise did ever you know anything so cool in your life was it ignorance now or insolence  it was perfect simplicity and naturalness frida answered with confidence he looked at the dress and admired it and being transparently naif he didnt see why he shouldnt say so it wasnt at all rude i thoughtand it gave me pleasure  he certainly has in some ways charming manners philip went on more slowly he manages to impress one if hes a madman which i rather more than half suspect its at least a gentlemanly form of madness  his manners are more than merely charming frida answered quite enthusiastic for she had taken a great fancy at first sight to the mysterious stranger theyve such absolute freedom thats what strikes me most in them theyre like the best english aristocratic manners without the insolence or the freest american manners without the roughness hes extremely distinguished and oh isnt he handsome  he is goodlooking philip assented grudgingly philip owned a lookingglass and was therefore accustomed to a very high standard of manly beauty  as for robert monteith he smiled the grim smile of the wholly unfascinated he was a dour business man of scotch descent who had made his money in palmoil in the city of london and having married frida as a remarkably fine woman with a splendid figure to preside at his table he had very small sympathy with what he considered her highflown fads and nonsensical fancies he had seen but little of the stranger too having come in from his weekly stroll or tour of inspection round the garden and stables just as they were on the very point of starting for st barnabas and his opinion of the man was in no way enhanced by fridas enthusiasm as far as im concerned he said with his slow scotch drawl inherited from his father for though londonborn and bred he was still in all essentials a pure caledonianas far as im concerned i havent the slightest doubt but the mans a swindler i wonder at you frida that you should leave him alone in the house just now with all that silver i stepped round before i left and warned martha privately not to move from the hall till the fellow was gone and to call up cook and james if he tried to get out of the house with any of our property but you never seemed to suspect him and to supply him with a bag too to carry it all off in well women are reckless hullo there policemanstop price one momenti wish youd keep an eye on my house this morning theres a man in there i dont half like the look of when he drives away in a cab that my boys going to call for him just see where he stops and take care he hasnt got anything my servants dont know about  in the drawingroom meanwhile bertram ingledew was reflecting as he waited for the church people to clear away how interesting these english clothestaboos and daytaboos promised to prove beside some similar customs he had met with or read of in his investigations elsewhere he remembered how on a certain morning of the year the high priest of the zapotecs was obliged to get drunk an act which on any other day in the calendar would have been regarded by all as a terrible sin in him he reflected how in guinea and tonquin at a particular period once a twelvemonth nothing is considered wrong and everything lawful so that the worst crimes and misdemeanours go unnoticed and unpunished he smiled to think how some days are tabooed in certain countries so that whatever you do on them were it only a game of tennis is accounted wicked while some days are periods of absolute licence so that whatever you do on them were it murder itself becomes fit and holy to him and his people at home of course it was the intrinsic character of the act itself that made it right or wrong not the particular day or week or month on which one happened to do it what was wicked in june was wicked still in october but not so among the unreasoning devotees of taboo in africa or in england there what was right in may became wicked in september and what was wrong on sunday became harmless or even obligatory on wednesday or thursday it was all very hard for a rational being to understand and explain but he meant to fathom it all the same to the very bottomto find out why for example in uganda whoever appears before the king must appear stark naked while in england whoever appears before the queen must wear a tailors sword or a long silk train and a headdress of ostrichfeathers why in morocco when you enter a mosque you must take off your shoes and catch a violent cold in order to show your respect for allah while in europe on entering a similar religious building you must uncover your head no matter how draughty the place may be since the deity who presides there appears to be indifferent to the danger of consumption or chestdiseases for his worshippers why certain clothes or foods are prescribed in london or paris for sundays and fridays while certain others just equally warm or digestible or the contrary are perfectly lawful to all the world alike on tuesdays and saturdays these were the curious questions he had come so far to investigate for which the fakirs and dervishes of every land gave such fanciful reasons and he saw he would have no difficulty in picking up abundant examples of his subjectmatter everywhere in england as the metropolis of taboo it exhibited the phenomena in their highest evolution the only thing that puzzled him was how philip christy an englishman born and evidently a most devout observer of the manifold taboos and juggernauts of his country should actually deny their very existence it was one more proof to him of the extreme caution necessary in all anthropological investigations before accepting the evidence even of wellmeaning natives on points of religious or social usage which they are often quite childishly incapable of describing in rational terms to outside inquirers they take their own manners and customs for granted and they cannot see them in their true relations or compare them with the similar manners and customs of other nationalities     iv   whether philip christy liked it or not the monteiths and he were soon fairly committed to a tolerably close acquaintance with bertram ingledew for as chance would have it on the monday morning bertram went up to town in the very same carriage with philip and his brotherinlaw to set himself up in necessaries of life for a six or eight months stay in england when he returned that night to brackenhurst with two large trunks full of underclothing and so forth he had to come round once more to the monteiths as philip anticipated to bring back the gladstone bag and the brown portmanteau he did it with so much graceful and gracious courtesy and such manly gratitude for the favour done him that he left still more deeply than ever on fridas mind the impression of a gentleman he had found out all the right shops to go to in london he said and he had ordered everything necessary to social salvation at the very best tailors so strictly in accordance with philips instructions that he thought he should now transgress no more the sumptuary rules in that matter made and established as long as he remained in this realm of england he had commanded a black cutaway coat suitable for sunday morning and a curious garment called a frockcoat buttoned tight over the chest to be worn in the afternoon especially in london and a still quainter coat made of shiny broadcloth with strange tails behind which was considered respectable after seven pm for a certain restricted class of citizensthose who paid a particular impost known as incometax as far as he could gather from what the tailor told him though the classes who really did any good in the state the working men and so forth seemed exempted by general consent from wearing it their dress indeed he observed was strange to say the least cared for and evidently the least costly of anybodys  he admired the monteith children so unaffectedly too telling them how pretty and how sweetmannered they were to their very faces that he quite won fridas heart though robert did not like it robert had evidently some deepseated superstition about the matter for he sent maimie the eldest girl out of the room at once she was four years old and he took little archie the twoyearold on his knee as if to guard him from some moral or social contagion then bertram remembered how he had seen african mothers beat or pinch their children till they made them cry to avert the evil omen when he praised them to their faces and he recollected too that most fetichistic races believe in nemesisthat is to say in jealous gods who if they see you love a child too much or admire it too greatly will take it from you or do it some grievous bodily harm such as blinding it or maiming it in order to pay you out for thinking yourself too fortunate he did not doubt therefore but that in scotland which he knew by report to be a country exceptionally given over to terrible superstitions the people still thought their sanguinary calvinistic deity fashioned by a race of stern john knoxes in their own image would do some harm to an overpraised child to wean them from it he was glad to see however that frida at least did not share this degrading and hateful belief handed down from the most fiendish of savage conceptions on the contrary she seemed delighted that bertram should pat little maimie on the head and praise her sunny smile and her lovely hair just like her mothers  to philip this was all a rather serious matter he felt he was responsible for having introduced the mysterious alien however unwillingly into the bosom of robert monteiths family now philip was not rich and frida was supposed to have made a good match of itthat is to say she had married a man a great deal wealthier than her own upbringing so philip after his kind thought much of the monteith connection he lived in lodgings at brackenhurst at a highly inconvenient distance from town so as to be near their house and catch whatever rays of reflected glory might fall upon his head like a shadowy halo from their horses and carriages their dinners and gardenparties he did not like therefore to introduce into his sisters house anybody that robert monteith that moneyed man of oil in the west african trade might consider an undesirable acquaintance but as time wore on and bertrams new clothes came home from the tailors it began to strike the civil servants mind that the mysterious alien though he excited much comment and conjecture in brackenhurst was accepted on the whole by local society as rather an acquisition to its ranks than otherwise he was well off he was well dressed he had no trade or profession and brackenhurst undermanned hailed him as a godsend for afternoon teas and informal tennisparties that ineffable air of distinction as of one royal born which philip had noticed at once the first evening they met seemed to strike and impress almost everybody who saw him people felt he was mysterious but at any rate he was someone and then he had been everywhereexcept in europe and had seen everythingexcept their own society and he talked agreeably when he was not on taboos and in suburban towns dont you know an outsider who brings fresh blood into the fieldwho has anything to say we do not all know beforehandis always welcome so brackenhurst accepted bertram ingledew before long as an eccentric but interesting and romantic person  not that he stopped much in brackenhurst itself he went up to town every day almost as regularly as robert monteith and philip christy he had things he wanted to observe there he said for the work he was engaged upon and the work clearly occupied the best part of his energies every night he came down to brackenhurst with his notebook crammed full of modern facts and illustrative instances he worked most of all in the east end he told frida confidentially there he could see best the remote results of certain painful english customs and usages he was anxious to study still he often went west too for the west end taboos though not in some cases so distressing as the east end ones were at times much more curiously illustrative and ridiculous he must master all branches of the subject alike he spoke so seriously that after a time frida who was just at first inclined to laugh at his odd way of putting things began to take it all in the end quite as seriously as he did he felt more at home with her than with anybody else at brackenhurst she had sympathetic eyes and he lived on sympathy he came to her so often for help in his difficulties that she soon saw he really meant all he said and was genuinely puzzled in a very queer way by many varied aspects of english society  in time the two grew quite intimate together but on one point bertram would never give his new friend the slightest information and that was the whereabouts of that mysterious home he so often referred to oddly enough no one ever questioned him closely on the subject a certain singular reserve of his which alternated curiously with his perfect frankness prevented them from trespassing so far on his individuality people felt they must not somehow when bertram ingledew let it once be felt he did not wish to be questioned on any particular point even women managed to restrain their curiosity and he would have been either a very bold or a very insensitive man who would have ventured to continue questioning him any further so though many people hazarded guesses as to where he had come from nobody ever asked him the pointblank question who are you if you please and what do you want here  the alien went out a great deal with the monteiths robert himself did not like the fellow he said one never quite knew what the deuce he was driving at but frida found him always more and more charmingso full of informationwhile philip admitted he was excellent form and such a capital tennis player so whenever philip had a day off in the country they three went out in the fields together and frida at least thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated the freedom and freshness of the newcomers conversation  on one such day they went out as it chanced into the meadows that stretch up the hill behind brackenhurst frida remembered it well afterwards it was the day when an annual saturnalia of vulgar vice usurps and pollutes the open downs at epsom bertram did not care to see it he saidthe rabble of a great town turned loose to desecrate the open face of natureeven regarded as a matter of popular custom he had looked on at much the same orgies before in new guinea and on the zambesi and they only depressed him so he stopped at brackenhurst and went for a walk instead in the fresh summer meadows robert monteith for his part had gone to the derbyso they call that orgyand philip had meant to accompany him in the dogcart but remained behind at the last moment to take care of frida for frida being a lady at heart always shrank from the pollution of vulgar assemblies as they walked together across the lush green fields thick with campion and yellowrattle they came to a dense copse with a rustic gate above which a threatening noticeboard frowned them straight in the face bearing the usual selfish and antisocial inscription trespassers will be prosecuted  lets go in here and pick orchids bertram suggested leaning over the gate just see how pretty they are the scented white butterfly it loves moist bogland now mrs monteith wouldnt a few long sprays of that lovely thing look charming on your dinnertable  but its preserved philip interposed with an awestruck face you cant go in there its sir lionel longdens and hes awfully particular  cant go in there oh nonsense bertram answered with a merry laugh vaulting the gate like a practised athlete mrs monteith can get over easily enough im sure shes as light as a fawn may i help you over and he held one hand out  but its private philip went on in a somewhat horrified voice and the pheasants are sitting  private how can it be theres nothing sown here its all wild wood we cant do any damage if it was growing crops of course one would walk through it not at all or at least very carefully but this is pure woodland are the pheasants tabooed then or why maynt we go near them  theyre not tabooed but theyre preserved philip answered somewhat testily making a delicate distinction without a difference after the fashion dear to the official intellect this land belongs to sir lionel longden i tell you and he chooses to lay it all down in pheasants he bought it and paid for it so he has a right i suppose to do as he likes with it  thats the funniest thing of all about these taboos bertram mused as if half to himself the very people whom they injure and inconvenience the most the people whom they hamper and cramp and debar dont seem to object to them but believe in them and are afraid of them in samoa i remember certain fruits and fish and animals and so forth were tabooed to the chiefs and nobody else ever dared to eat them they thought it was wrong and said if they did some nameless evil would at once overtake them these nameless terrors these bodiless superstitions are always the deepest people fight hardest to preserve their bogeys they fancy some appalling unknown dissolution would at once result from reasonable action i tried one day to persuade a poor devil of a fellow in samoa whod caught one of these fish and who was terribly hungry that no harm would come to him if he cooked it and ate it but he was too slavishly frightened to follow my advice he said it was taboo to the goddescended chiefs if a mortal man tasted it he would die on the spot so nothing on earth would induce him to try it though to be sure even there nobody ever went quite so far as to taboo the very soil of earth itself everybody might till and hunt where he liked its only in europe where evolution goes furthest that taboo has reached that last silly pitch of injustice and absurdity well were not afraid of the fetich you and i mrs monteith jump up on the gate ill give you a hand over and he held out one strong arm as he spoke to aid her  frida had no such fanatical respect for the bogey of vested interests as her superstitious brother so she mounted the gate gracefullyshe was always graceful bertram took her small hand and jumped her down on the other side while philip not liking to show himself less bold than a woman in this matter climbed over it after her though with no small misgivings they strolled on into the wood picking the pretty white orchids by the way as they went for some little distance the rich mould underfoot was thick with sweet woodruff and trailing loosestrife every now and again as they stirred the lithe brambles that encroached upon the path a pheasant rose from the ground with a loud whirrr before them philip felt most uneasy youll have the keepers after you in a minute he said with a deprecating shrug this is just full nesting time theyre down upon anybody who disturbs the pheasants  but the pheasants cant belong to any one bertram cried with a greatly amused face you may taboo the landi understand thats donebut surely you cant taboo a wild bird that can fly as it likes from one piece of ground away into another  philip enlightened his ignorance by giving him offhand a brief and profoundly servile account of the english gamelaws interspersed with sundry anecdotes of poachers and poaching bertram listened with an interested but gravely disapproving face and do you mean to say he asked at last they send men to prison as criminals for catching or shooting hares and pheasants  why certainly philip answered its an offence against the law and also a crime against the rights of property  against the law yes but how on earth can it be a crime against the rights of property obviously the pheasants the property of the man who happens to shoot it how can it belong to him and also to the fellow who taboos the particular piece of ground it was snared on  it doesnt belong to the man who shoots it at all philip answered rather angrily it belongs to the man who owns the land of course and who chooses to preserve it  oh i see bertram replied then you disregard the rights of property altogether and only consider the privileges of taboo as a principle thats intelligible one sees its consistent but how is it that you all allow these chiefslandlords dont you call themto taboo the soil and prevent you all from even walking over it dont you see that if you chose to combine in a body and insist upon the recognition of your natural rightsif you determined to make the landlords give up their taboo and cease from injusticetheyd have to yield to you and then you could exercise your native right of going where you pleased and cultivate the land in common for the public benefit instead of leaving it as now to be cultivated anyhow or turned into waste for the benefit of the tabooers  but it would be wrong to take it from them philip cried growing fiery red and half losing his temper for he really believed it it would be sheer confiscation the lands their own they either bought it or inherited it from their fathers if you were to begin taking it away what guarantee would you have left for any of the rights of property generally  you didnt recognise the rights of property of the fellow who killed the pheasant though bertram interposed laughing and imperturbably goodhumoured but thats always the way with these taboos everywhere they subsist just because the vast majority even of those who are obviously wronged and injured by them really believe in them they think theyre guaranteed by some divine prescription the fetich guards them in polynesia i recollect some chiefs could taboo almost anything they liked even a girl or a woman or fruit and fish and animals and houses and after the chief had once said it is taboo everybody else was afraid to touch them of course the fact that a chief or a landowner has bought and paid for a particular privilege or species of taboo or has inherited it from his fathers doesnt give him any better moral claim to it the question is is the claim in itself right and reasonable for a wrong is only all the more a wrong for having been long and persistently exercised the central africans say this is my slave i bought her and paid for her ive a right if i like to kill her and eat her the king of ibo on the west coast had a hereditary right to offer up as a human sacrifice the first man he met every time he quitted his palace and he was quite surprised audacious freethinkers should call the morality of his right in question if you english were all in a body to see through this queer landtaboo now which drives your poor off the soil and prevents you all from even walking at liberty over the surface of the waste in your own country you could easily  oh lord what shall we do philip interposed in a voice of abject terror if here isnt sir lionel  and sure enough right across the narrow path in front of them stood a short fat stumpy unimpressive little man with a very red face and a norfolk jacket boiling over with anger  what are you people doing here he cried undeterred by the presence of a lady and speaking in the insolent supercilious voice of the english landlord in defence of his pheasant preserves this is private property you must have seen the notice at the gate trespassers will be prosecuted  yes we did see it bertram answered with his unruffled smile and thinking it an uncalledfor piece of aggressive churlishness both in form and substancewhy we took the liberty to disregard it  sir lionel glared at him in that servile neighbourhood almost entirely inhabited by the flunkeys of villadom it was a complete novelty to him to be thus bearded in his den he gasped with anger do you mean to say he gurgled out growing purple to the neck you came in here deliberately to disturb my pheasants and then brazen it out to my face like this sir go back the way you came or ill call my keepers  no i will not go back the way i came bertram responded deliberately with perfect selfcontrol and with a sideglance at frida every human being has a natural right to walk across this copse which is all waste ground and has no crop sown in it the pheasants cant be yours theyre common property besides theres a lady we mean to make our way across the copse at our leisure picking flowers as we go and come out into the road on the other side of the spinney its a universal right of which no country and no law can possibly deprive us  sir lionel was livid with rage strange as it may appear to any reasoning mind the man really believed he had a natural right to prevent people from crossing that strip of wood where his pheasants were sitting his ancestors had assumed it from time immemorial and by dint of never being questioned had come to regard the absurd usurpation as quite fair and proper he placed himself straight across the narrow path blocking it up with his short and stumpy figure now look here young man he said with all the insolence of his caste if you try to go on ill stand here in your way and if you dare to touch me its a common assault and by george youll have to answer at law for the consequences  bertram ingledew for his part was all sweet reasonableness he raised one deprecating hand now before we come to open hostilities he said in a gentle voice with that unfailing smile of his lets talk the matter over like rational beings lets try to be logical this copse is considered yours by the actual law of the country you live in your tribe permits it to you youre allowed to taboo it very well then i make all possible allowances for your strange hallucination youve been brought up to think you had some mystic and intangible claim to this corner of earth more than other people your even christians that claim of course you cant logically defend but failing arguments you want to fight for it wouldnt it be more reasonable now to show you had some right or justice in the matter im always reasonable if you can convince me of the propriety and equity of your claim ill go back as you wish by the way i entered if notwell theres a lady here and im bound as a man to help her safely over  sir lionel almost choked i see what you are he gasped out with difficulty ive heard this sort of rubbish more than once before youre one of these damned landnationalising radicals  on the contrary bertram answered urbane as ever with charming politeness of tone and manner im a born conservative im tenacious to an almost foolishly sentimental degree of every old custom or practice or idea unless indeed its either wicked or sillylike most of your english ones  he raised his hat and made as if he would pass on now nothing annoys an angry savage or an uneducated person so much as the perfect coolness of a civilised and cultivated man when he himself is boiling with indignation he feels its superiority an affront on his barbarism so with a vulgar oath sir lionel flung himself pointblank in the way damn it all no you wont sir he cried ill soon put a stop to all that i can tell you you shant go on one step without committing an assault upon me and he drew himself up foursquare as if for battle  oh just as you like bertram answered coolly never losing his temper im not afraid of taboos ive seen too many of them and he gazed at the fat little angry man with a gentle expression of mingled contempt and amusement  for a minute frida thought they were really going to fight and drew back in horror to await the contest but such a warlike notion never entered the man of peaces head he took a step backward for a second and calmly surveyed his antagonist with a critical scrutiny sir lionel was short and stout and puffy bertram ingledew was tall and strong and wellknit and athletic after an instants pause during which the doughty baronet stood doubling his fat fists and glaring silent wrath at his lither opponent bertram made a sudden dart forward seized the little stout man bodily in his stalwart arms and lifting him like a baby in spite of kicks and struggles carried him a hundred paces to one side of the path where he laid him down gingerly without unnecessary violence on a bed of young bracken then he returned quite calmly as if nothing had happened to fridas side with that quiet little smile on his unruffled countenance  frida had not quite approved of all this small episode for she too believed in the righteousness of taboo like most other englishwomen and devoutly accepted the common priestly doctrine that the earth is the landlords and the fulness thereof but still being a woman and therefore an admirer of physical strength in men she could not help applauding to herself the masterly way in which her squire had carried his antagonist captive when he returned she beamed upon him with friendly confidence but philip was very much frightened indeed  youll have to pay for this you know he said this is a lawabiding land hell bring an action against you for assault and battery and youll get three months for it  i dont think so bertram answered still placid and unruffled there were three of us who saw him and it was a very ignominious position indeed for a person who sets up to be a great chief in the country he wont like the little boys on his own estate to know the great sir lionel was lifted up against his will carried about like a baby and set down in a brackenbed indeed i was more than sorry to have to do such a thing to a man of his years but you see he would have it its the only way to deal with these tabooing chiefs you must face them and be done with it in the caroline islands once i had to do the same thing to a cazique who was going to cook and eat a very pretty young girl of his own retainers he wouldnt listen to reason the law was on his side so being happily not a lawabiding person myself i took him up in my arms and walked off with him bodily and was obliged to drop him down into a very painful bed of stinging plants like nettles so as to give myself time to escape with the girl clear out of his clutches i regretted having to do it so roughly of course but there was no other way out of it  as he spoke for the first time it really came home to fridas mind that bertram ingledew standing there before her regarded in very truth the polynesian chief and sir lionel longden as much about the same sort of unreasoning peoplesavages to be argued with and cajoled if possible but if not then to be treated with calm firmness and force as an english officer on an exploring expedition might treat a wrathful central african kinglet and in a dim sort of way too it began to strike her by degrees that the analogy was a true one that bertram ingledew among the englishmen with whom she was accustomed to mix was like a civilised being in the midst of barbarians who feel and recognise but dimly and halfunconsciously his innate superiority  by the time they had reached the gate on the other side of the hanger sir lionel overtook them boiling over with indignation  your card sir he gasped out inarticulately to the calmly innocent alien you must answer for all this your card i say instantly  bertram looked at him with a fixed gaze sir lionel having had good proof of his antagonists strength kept his distance cautiously  certainly not my good friend bertram replied in a firm tone why should i who am the injured and insulted party assist you in identifying me it was you who aggressed upon my free individuality if you want to call in the aid of an unjust law to back up an unjust and irrational taboo you must find out for yourself who i am and where i come from but i wouldnt advise you to do anything so foolish three of us here saw you in the ridiculous position into which by your obstinacy you compelled me to put you and you wouldnt like to hear us recount it in public with picturesque details to your brother magistrates let me say one thing more to you he added after a pause in that peculiarly soft and melodious voice of his dont you think on reflectioneven if youre foolish enough and illogical enough really to believe in the sacredness of the taboo by virtue of which you try to exclude your fellowtribesmen from their fair share of enjoyment of the soil of englanddont you think you might at any rate exercise your imaginary powers over the land you arrogate to yourself with a little more gentleness and common politeness how petty and narrow it looks to use even an undoubted right far more a tribal taboo in a tyrannical and needlessly aggressive manner how mean and small and low and churlish the damage we did your land as you call itif we did any at allwas certainly not a hapennyworth was it consonant with your dignity as a chief in the tribe to get so hot and angry about so small a value how grotesque to make so much fuss and noise about a matter of a hapenny we who were the aggrieved parties we whom you attempted to debar by main force from the common human right to walk freely over earth wherever theres nothing sown or planted and who were obliged to remove you as an obstacle out of our path at some personal inconveniencehe glanced askance at his clothes crumpled and soiled by sir lionels unseemly resistancewe didnt lose our tempers or attempt to revile you we were cool and collected but a taboo must be on its very last legs when it requires the aid of terrifying notices at every corner in order to preserve it and i think this of yours must be well on the way to abolition still as i should like to part friendshe drew a coin from his pocket and held it out between his finger and thumb with a courteous bow towards sir lioneli gladly tender you a hapenny in compensation for any supposed harm we may possibly have done your imaginary rights by walking through the wood here     v   for a day or two after this notable encounter between tabooer and taboobreaker philip moved about in a most uneasy state of mind he lived in constant dread of receiving a summons as a party to an assault upon a most respectable and respected landed proprietor who preserved more pheasants and owned more ruinous cottages than anybody else except the duke round about brackenhurst indeed so deeply did he regret his involuntary part in this painful escapade that he never mentioned a word of it to robert monteith nor did frida either to say the truth husband and wife were seldom confidential one with the other but to philips surprise bertrams prediction came true they never heard another word about the action for trespass or the threatened prosecution for assault and battery sir lionel found out that the person who had committed the gross and unheardof outrage of lifting an elderly and respectable english landowner like a baby in arms on his own estate was a lodger at brackenhurst variously regarded by those who knew him best as an escaped lunatic and as a foreign nobleman in disguise fleeing for his life from a charge of complicity in a nihilist conspiracy he wisely came to the conclusion therefore that he would not be the first to divulge the story of his own ignominious defeat unless he found that damned radical chap was going boasting around the countryside how he had balked sir lionel and as nothing was further than boasting from bertram ingledews gentle nature and as philip and frida both held their peace for good reasons of their own the baronet never attempted in any way to rake up the story of his grotesque disgrace on what he considered his own property all he did was to double the number of keepers on the borders of his estate and to give them strict notice that whoever could succeed in catching the damned radical in flagrante delicto as trespasser or poacher should receive most instant reward and promotion  during the next few weeks accordingly nothing of importance happened from the point of view of the brackenhurst chronicler though bertram was constantly round at the monteiths garden for afternoon tea or a game of lawntennis he was an excellent player lawntennis was most popular at home he said in that same mysterious and noncommitting phrase he so often made use of only he found the racquets and balls very best london make rather clumsy and awkward he wished he had brought his own along with him when he came here philip noticed his style of service was particularly good and even wondered at times he did not try to go in for the all england championship but bertram surprised him by answering with a quiet smile that though it was an excellent amusement he had too many other things to do with his time to make a serious pursuit of it  one day towards the end of june the strange young man had gone round to the grangethat was the name of fridas housefor his usual relaxation after a very tiring and distressing day in london on important business the business whatever it was had evidently harrowed his feelings not a little for he was sensitively organised frida was on the tennislawn she met him with much lamentation over the unpleasant fact that she had just lost a sisterinlaw whom she had never cared for  well but if you never cared for her bertram answered looking hard into her lustrous eyes it doesnt much matter  oh i shall have to go into mourning all the same frida continued somewhat pettishly and waste all my nice new summer dresses its such a nuisance  why do it then bertram suggested watching her face very narrowly  well i suppose because of what you would call a fetich frida answered laughing i know its ridiculous but everybody expects it and im not strongminded enough to go against the current of what everybody expects of me  you will be byandby bertram answered with confidence theyre queer things these deathtaboos sometimes people cover their heads with filth or ashes and sometimes they bedizen them with crape and white streamers in some countries the survivors are bound to shed so many tears to measure in memory of the departed and if they cant bring them up naturally in sufficient quantities they have to be beaten with rods or pricked with thorns or stung with nettles till theyve filled to the last drop the regulation bottle in swaziland too when the king dies so the queen told me every family of his subjects has to lose one of its sons or daughters in order that they may all truly grieve at the loss of their sovereign i think there are more horrible and cruel devices in the way of deathtaboos and deathcustoms than anything else ive met in my researches indeed most of our nomologists at home believe that all taboos originally arose out of ancestral ghostworship and sprang from the craven fear of dead kings or dead relatives they think fetiches and gods and other imaginary supernatural beings were all in the last resort developed out of ghosts hostile or friendly and from what i see abroad i incline to agree with them but this mourning superstition nowsurely it must do a great deal of harm in poor households in england people who can very ill afford to throw away good dresses must have to give them up and get new black ones and that often at the very moment when theyre just deprived of the aid of their only support and breadwinner i wonder it doesnt occur to them that this is absolutely wrong and that they oughtnt to prefer the meaningless fetich to their clear moral duty  theyre afraid of what people would say of them frida ventured to interpose you see were all so frightened of breaking through an established custom  yes i notice that always wherever i go in england bertram answered theres apparently no clear idea of whats right and wrong at all in the ethical sense as apart from whats usual i was talking to a lady up in london today about a certain matter i may perhaps mention to you byandby when occasion serves and she said shed been always brought up to think soandso it seemed to me a very queer substitute indeed for thinking  i never thought of that frida answered slowly ive said the same thing a hundred times over myself before now and i see how irrational it is but there mr ingledew thats why i always like talking with you so much you make one take such a totally new view of things  she looked down and was silent a minute her breast heaved and fell she was a beautiful woman very tall and queenly bertram looked at her and paused then he went on hurriedly just to break the awkward silence and this dance at exeter theni suppose you wont go to it  oh i cant of course frida answered quickly and my two other niecesroberts side you knowwho have nothing at all to do with my brother toms wife out there in indiatheyll be so disappointed i was going to take them down to it nasty thing how annoying of her she might have chosen some other time to go and die im sure than just when she knew i wanted to go to exeter  well if it would be any convenience to you bertram put in with a serious face im rather busy on wednesday but i could manage to take up a portmanteau to town with my dress things in the morning meet the girls at paddington and run down by the evening express in time to go with them to the hotel you meant to stop at theyre those two pretty blondes i met here at tea last sunday arent they  frida looked at him halfincredulous he was very nice she knew and very quaint and fresh and unsophisticated and unconventional but could he be really quite so ignorant of the common usages of civilised society as to suppose it possible he could run down alone with two young girls to stop by themselves without even a chaperon at an hotel at exeter she gazed at him curiously oh mr ingledew she said now youre really too ridiculous  bertram coloured up like a boy if she had been in any doubt before as to his sincerity and simplicity she could be so no longer oh i forgot about the taboo he said im so sorry i hurt you i was only thinking what a pity those two nice girls should be cheated out of their expected pleasure by a silly question of pretended mourning where even you yourself who have got to wear it dont assume that you feel the slightest tinge of sorrow i remember now of course what a lady told me in london the other day your young girls arent even allowed to go out travelling alone without their mother or brothers in order to taboo them absolutely beforehand for the possible husband who may some day marry them it was a pitiful tale i thought it all most painful and shocking  but you dont mean to say frida cried equally shocked and astonished in her turn that youd let young girls go out alone anywhere with unmarried men goodness gracious how dreadful  why not bertram asked with transparent simplicity  why just consider the consequences frida exclaimed with a blush after a moments hesitation  there couldnt be any consequences unless they both liked and respected one another bertram answered in the most matterofcourse voice in the world and if they do that we think at home its nobodys business to interfere in any way with the free expression of their individuality in this the most sacred and personal matter of human intercourse its the one point of private conduct about which were all at home most sensitively anxious not to meddle to interfere or even to criticise we think such affairs should be left entirely to the hearts and consciences of the two persons concerned who must surely know best how they feel towards one another but i remember having met lots of taboos among other barbarians in much the same way to preserve the mere material purity of their womena thing we at home wouldnt dream of even questioning in new ireland for instance i saw poor girls confined for four or five years in small wickerwork cages where theyre kept in the dark and not even allowed to set foot on the ground on any pretext theyre shut up in these prisons when theyre about fourteen and there theyre kept strictly tabooed till theyre just going to be married i went to see them myself it was a horrid sight the poor creatures were confined in a dark close hut without air or ventilation in that stifling climate which is as unendurable from heat as this one is from cold and damp and fogginess and there they sat in cages coarsely woven from broad leaves of the pandanus trees so that no light could enter for the people believed that light would kill them no man might see them because it was close taboo but at last with great difficulty i persuaded the chief and the old lady who guarded them to let them come out for a minute to look at me a lot of beads and cloth overcame these peoples scruples and with great reluctance they opened the cages but only the old woman looked the chief was afraid and turned his head the other way mumbling charms to his fetich out they stole one by one poor souls ashamed and frightened hiding their faces in their hands thinking i was going to hurt them or eat themjust as your nieces would do if i proposed today to take them to exeterand a dreadful sight they were cramped with long sitting in one close position and their eyes all blinded by the glare of the sunlight after the long darkness ive seen women shut up in pretty much the same way in other countries but i never saw quite so bad a case as this of new ireland  well you cant say weve anything answering to that in england frida put in looking across at him with her frank open countenance  no not quite like that in detail perhaps but pretty much the same in general principle bertram answered warmly your girls here are not cooped up in actual cages but theyre confined in barrackschools as like prisons as possible and theyre repressed at every turn in every natural instinct of play or society they mustnt go here or they mustnt go there they mustnt talk to this one or to that one they mustnt do this or that or the other their whole life is bound round im told by a closely woven web of restrictions and restraints which have no other object or end in view than the interests of a purely hypothetical husband the chinese cramp their womens feet to make them small and useless you cramp your womens brains for the selfsame purpose even lights excluded for they mustnt read books that would make them think they mustnt be allowed to suspect the bare possibility that the world may be otherwise than as their priests and nurses and grandmothers tell them though most even of your own men know it well to be something quite different why i met a girl at that dance i went to in london the other evening who told me she wasnt allowed to read a book called tess of the durbervilles that id read myself and that seemed to me one of which every young girl and married woman in england ought to be given a copy it was the one true book i had seen in your country and another girl wasnt allowed to read another book which ive since looked at called robert elsmerean ephemeral thing enough in its way i dont doubt but proscribed in her case for no other reason on earth than because it expressed some mild disbelief as to the exact literary accuracy of those lower syrian pamphlets to which your priests attach such immense importance  oh mr ingledew frida cried trembling yet profoundly interested if you talk like that any more i shant be able to listen to you  there it is you see bertram continued with a little wave of the hand youve been so blinded and bedimmed by being deprived of light when a girl that now when you see even a very faint ray it dazzles you and frightens you that mustnt be soit neednt i feel confident i shall have to teach you how to bear the light your eyes i know are naturally strong you were an eagle born youd soon get used to it  frida lifted them slowly those beautiful eyes and met his own with genuine pleasure  do you think so she asked half whispering in some dim instinctive way she felt this strange man was a superior being and that every small crumb of praise from him was well worth meriting  why frida of course i do he answered without the least sense of impertinence do you think if i didnt id have taken so much trouble to try and educate you for he had talked to her much in their walks on the hillside  frida did not correct him for his bold application of her christian name though she knew she ought to she only looked up at him and answered gravely  i certainly cant let you take my nieces to exeter  i suppose not he replied hardly catching at her meaning one of the girls at that dance the other night told me a great many queer facts about your taboos on these domestic subjects so i know how stringent and how unreasoning they are and indeed i found out a little bit for myself for there was one nice girl there to whom i took a very great fancy and i was just going to kiss her as i said goodnight when she drew back suddenly almost as if id struck her though wed been talking together quite confidentially a minute before i could see she thought i really meant to insult her of course i explained it was only what id have done to any nice girl at home under similar circumstances but she didnt seem to believe me and the oddest part of it all was that all the time we were dancing i had my arm round her waist as all the other men had theirs round their partners and at home we consider it a much greater proof of confidence and affection to be allowed to place your arm round a ladys waist than merely to kiss her  frida felt the conversation was beginning to travel beyond her ideas of propriety so she checked its excursions by answering gravely oh mr ingledew you dont understand our code of morals but im sure you dont find your east end young ladies so fearfully particular  they certainly havent quite so many taboos bertram answered quietly but thats always the way in tabooing societies these things are naturally worst among the chiefs and great people i remember when i was stopping among the ot danoms of borneo the daughters of chiefs and great sundescended families were shut up at eight or ten years old in a little cell or room as a religious duty and cut off from all intercourse with the outside world for many years together the cells dimly lit by a single small window placed high in the wall so that the unhappy girl never sees anybody or anything but passes her life in almost total darkness she maynt leave the room on any pretext whatever not even for the most pressing and necessary purposes none of her family may see her face but a single slave womans appointed to accompany her and wait upon her long want of exercise stunts her bodily growth and when at last she becomes a woman and emerges from her prison her complexion has grown wan and pale and waxlike they take her out in solemn guise and show her the sun the sky the land the water the trees the flowers and tell her all their names as if to a newborn creature then a great feast is made a poor crouching slave is killed with a blow of the sword and the girl is solemnly smeared with his reeking blood by way of initiation but this is only done of course with the daughters of wealthy and powerful families and i find it pretty much the same in england in all these matters your poorer classes are relatively pure and simple and natural its your richer and worse and more selfish classes among whom sextaboos are strongest and most unnatural  frida looked up at him a little pleadingly  do you know mr ingledew she said in a trembling voice im sure you dont mean it for intentional rudeness but it sounds to us very like it when you speak of our taboos and compare us openly to these dreadful savages im a woman i know buti dont like to hear you speak so about my england  the words took bertram fairly by surprise he was wholly unacquainted with that rank form of provincialism which we know as patriotism he leaned across towards her with a look of deep pain on his handsome face  oh mrs monteith he cried earnestly if you dont like it ill never again speak of them as taboos in your presence i didnt dream you could object it seems so natural to uswellto describe like customs by like names in every case but if it gives you painwhy sooner than do that id never again say a single word while i live about an english custom  his face was very near hers and he was a son of adam like all the rest of usnot a being of another sphere as frida was sometimes half tempted to consider him what might next have happened he himself hardly knew for he was an impulsive creature and fridas rich lips were full and crimson had not philips arrival with the two miss hardys to make up a set diverted for the moment the nascent possibility of a leading incident     vi   it was a sunday afternoon in full july and a small party was seated under the spreading mulberry tree on the monteiths lawn general claviger was of the number that wellknown constructor of scientific frontiers in india or africa and so was dean chalmers the popular preacher who had come down for the day from his london house to deliver a sermon on behalf of the society for superseding the existing superstitions of china and japan by the dying ones of europe philip was there too enjoying himself thoroughly in the midst of such good company and so was robert monteith bleak and grim as usual but deeply interested for the moment in dividing metaphysical and theological cobwebs with his friend the dean who as a brother scotsman loved a good discussion better almost than he loved a good discourse general claviger for his part was congenially engaged in describing to bertram his pet idea for a campaign against the madhi and his men in the interior of the soudan bertram rather yawned through that technical talk he was a man of peace and schemes of organised bloodshed interested him no more than the details of a projected human sacrifice given by a central african chief with native gusto would interest an average european gentleman at last however the general happened to say casually i forget the exact name of the place i mean i think its malolo but i have a very good map of all the district at my house down at wanborough  what wanborough in northamptonshire bertram exclaimed with sudden interest do you really live there  im lord of the manor general claviger answered with a little access of dignity the clavigers or clavigeros were a spanish family of andalusian origin who settled down at wanborough under philip and mary and retained the manor no doubt by conversion to the protestant side after the accession of elizabeth  thats interesting to me bertram answered with his frank and fearless truthfulness because my people came originally from wanborough beforewell before they emigrated philip listening askance pricked up his ears eagerly at the telltale phrase after all then a colonist but they werent anybody distinguishedcertainly not lords of the manor he added hastily as the general turned a keen eye on him are there any ingledews living now in the wanborough district one likes as a matter of scientific heredity to know all one can about ones ancestors and ones county and ones collateral relatives  well there are some ingledews just now at wanborough the general answered with some natural hesitation surveying the tall handsome young man from head to foot not without a faint touch of soldierly approbation but they can hardly be your relatives however remote theyre people in a most humble sphere of life unless indeedwell we know the vicissitudes of familiesperhaps your ancestors and the ingledews that i know drifted apart a long time ago  is he a cobbler bertram inquired without a trace of mauvaise honte  the general nodded well yes he said politely thats exactly what he is though as you seemed to be asking about presumed relations i didnt like to mention it  oh then hes my ancestor bertram put in quite pleased at the discovery that is to say he added after a curious pause my ancestors descendant almost all my people a little way back you see were shoemakers or cobblers  he said it with dignity exactly as he might have said they were dukes or lord chancellors but philip could not help pitying him not so much for being descended from so mean a lot as for being fool enough to acknowledge it on a gentlemans lawn at brackenhurst why with manners like his if he had not given himself away one might easily have taken him for a descendant of the plantagenets  so the general seemed to think too for he added quickly but youre very like the duke and the dukes a bertram is he also a relative  the young man coloured slightly yees he answered hesitating but were not very proud of the bertram connection they never did much good in the world the bertrams i bear the name one may almost say by accident because it was handed down to me by my grandfather ingledew who had bertram blood but was a vast deal a better man than any other member of the bertram family  ill be seeing the duke on wednesday the general put in with marked politeness and ill ask him if you like about your grandfathers relationship who was he exactly and what was his connection with the present man or his predecessor  oh dont please bertram put in halfpleadingly it is true but still with that same ineffable and indefinable air of a great gentleman that never for a moment deserted him the duke would never have heard of my ancestors im sure and i particularly dont want to be mixed up with the existing bertrams in any way  he was happily innocent and ignorant of the natural interpretation the others would put upon his reticence after the true english manner but still he was vaguely aware from the silence that ensued for a moment after he ceased that he must have broken once more some important taboo or offended once more some muchrevered fetich to get rid of the awkwardness he turned quietly to frida what do you say mrs monteith he suggested to a game of tennis  as bad luck would have it he had floundered from one taboo headlong into another the dean looked up openmouthed with a sharp glance of inquiry did mrs monteith then permit such frivolities on the sunday you forget what day it is i think frida interposed gently with a look of warning  bertram took the hint at once so i did he answered quickly at home you see we let no man judge us of days and of weeks and of times and of seasons it puzzles us so much with us whats wrong today can never be right and proper tomorrow  but surely the dean said bristling up some day is set apart in every civilised land for religious exercises  oh no bertram replied falling incautiously into the trap we do right every day of the week alikeand never do poojah of any sort at any time  then where do you come from the dean asked severely pouncing down upon him like a hawk ive always understood the very lowest savages have at least some outer form or shadow of religion  yes perhaps so but were not savages either low or otherwise bertram answered cautiously perceiving his error and as to your other point for reasons of my own i prefer for the present not to say where i come from you wouldnt believe me if i told youas you didnt i saw about my remote connection with the duke of east anglias family and were not accustomed where i live to be disbelieved or doubted its perhaps the one thing that really almost makes us lose our tempers so if you please i wont go any further at present into the debatable matter of my place of origin  he rose to stroll off into the gardens having spoken all the time in that peculiarly grave and dignified tone that seemed natural to him whenever any one tried to question him closely nobody save a churchman would have continued the discussion but the dean was a churchman and also a scot and he returned to the attack unabashed and unbaffled but surely mr ingledew he said in a persuasive voice your people whoever they are must at least acknowledge a creator of the universe  bertram gazed at him fixedly his eye was stern my people sir he said slowly in very measured words unaware that one must not argue with a clergyman acknowledge and investigate every reality they can find in the universeand admit no phantoms they believe in everything that can be shown or proved to be natural and true but in nothing supernatural that is to say imaginary or nonexistent they accept plain facts they reject pure phantasies how beautiful those lilies are mrs monteith such an exquisite colour shall we go over and look at them  not just now frida answered relieved at the appearance of martha with the tray in the distance heres tea coming she was glad of the diversion for she liked bertram immensely and she could not help noticing how hopelessly he had been floundering all that afternoon right into the very midst of what he himself would have called their taboos and jossbusiness  but bertram was not well out of his troubles yet martha brought the round trayoriental brass finely chased with flowing arabic inscriptionsand laid it down on the dainty little rustic table then she handed about the cups bertram rose to help her maynt i do it for you he said as politely as he would have said it to a lady in her drawingroom  no thank you sir martha answered turning red at the offer but with the imperturbable solemnity of the welltrained english servant she knew her place and resented the intrusion but bertram had his own notions of politeness too which were not to be lightly set aside for local class distinctions he could not see a pretty girl handing cups to guests without instinctively rising from his seat to assist her so very much to marthas embarrassment he continued to give his help in passing the cake and the breadandbutter as soon as she was gone he turned round to philip thats a very pretty girl and a very nice girl he said simply i wonder now as you havent a wife youve never thought of marrying her  the remark fell like a thunderbolt on the assembled group even frida was shocked your most openminded woman begins to draw a line when you touch her class prejudices in the matter of marriage especially with reference to her own relations why really mr ingledew she said looking up at him reproachfully you cant mean to say you think my brother could marry the parlourmaid  bertram saw at a glance he had once more unwittingly run his head against one of the dearest of these strange peoples taboos but he made no retort openly he only reflected in silence to himself how unnatural and how wrong they would all think it at home that a young man of philips age should remain nominally celibate how horrified they would be at the abject misery and degradation such conduct on the part of half his caste must inevitably imply for thousands of innocent young girls of lower station whose lives he now knew were remorselessly sacrificed in vile dens of tainted london to the supposed social necessity that young men of a certain class should marry late in a certain style and keep a wife in the way shes been accustomed to he remembered with a checked sigh how infinitely superior they would all at home have considered that wholesome capable goodlooking martha to an emptyheaded and useless young man like philip and he thought to himself how completely taboo had overlaid in these peoples minds every ethical idea how wholly it had obscured the prime necessities of healthy vigorous and moral manhood he recollected the similar though less hideous taboos he had met with elsewhere the castes of india and the horrible pollution that would result from disregarding them the vile egyptian rule by which the divine king in order to keep up the socalled purity of his royal and goddescended blood must marry his own sister and so foully pollute with monstrous abortions the very stock he believed himself to be preserving intact from common or unclean influences his mind ran back to the strange and complicated forbidden degrees of the australian blackfellows who are divided into crossclasses each of which must necessarily marry into a certain other and into that other only regardless of individual tastes or preferences he remembered the profound belief of all these people that if they were to act in any other way than the one prescribed some nameless misfortune or terrible evil would surely overtake them yet nowhere he thought to himself had he seen any system which entailed in the end so much misery on both sexes though more particularly on the women as that system of closely tabooed marriage founded upon a broad basis of prostitution and infanticide which has reached its most appalling height of development in hypocritical and puritan england the ghastly levity with which all englishmen treated this most serious subject and the fatal readiness with which even frida herself seemed to acquiesce in the most inhuman slavery ever devised for women on the face of this earth shocked and saddened bertrams profoundly moral and sympathetic nature he could sit there no longer to listen to their talk he bethought him at once of the sickening sights he had seen the evening before in a london musichall of the corrupting mass of filth underneath by which alone this abomination of iniquity could be kept externally decent and this vile system of false celibacy whitened outwardly to the eye like oriental sepulchres and he strolled off by himself into the shrubbery very heavy in heart to hide his real feelings from the priest and the soldier whose coarsergrained minds could never have understood the enthusiasm of humanity which inspired and informed him  frida rose and followed him moved by some unconscious wave of instinctive sympathy the four children of this world were left together on the lawn by the rustic table to exchange views by themselves on the extraordinary behaviour and novel demeanour of the mysterious alien     vii   as soon as he was gone a sigh of relief ran halfunawares through the little square party they felt some unearthly presence had been removed from their midst general claviger turned to monteith thats a curious sort of chap he said slowly in his military way who is he and where does he come from  ah where does he come fromthats just the question monteith answered lighting a cigar and puffing away dubiously nobody knows hes a mystery he poses in the role youd better ask philip it was he who brought him here  i met him accidentally in the street philip answered with an apologetic shrug by no means well pleased at being thus held responsible for all the strangers moral and social vagaries its the merest chance acquaintance i know nothing of his antecedents ieri lent him a bag and hes fastened himself upon me ever since like a leech and come constantly to my sisters but i havent the remotest idea who he is or where he hails from he keeps his business wrapped up from all of us in the profoundest mystery  hes a gentleman anyhow the general put in with military decisiveness how manly of him to acknowledge at once about the cobbler being probably a near relation most men you know christy would have tried to hide it he didnt for a second he admitted his ancestors had all been cobblers till quite a recent period  philip was astonished at this verdict of the generals for he himself on the contrary had noted with silent scorn that very remark as a piece of supreme and hopeless stupidity on bertrams part no fellow can help having a cobbler for a grandfather of course but he need not be such a fool as to volunteer any mention of the fact spontaneously  yes i thought it bold of him monteith answered almost bolder than was necessary for he didnt seem to think we should be at all surprised at it  the general mused to himself hes a fine soldierly fellow he said gazing after the tall retreating figure i should like to make a dragoon of him hes the very man for a saddle hed dash across country in the face of heavy guns any day with the best of them  he rides well philip answered and has a wonderful seat i saw him on that bay mare of wilders in town the other afternoon and i must say he rode much more like a gentleman than a cobbler  oh hes a gentleman the general repeated with unshaken conviction a thoroughbred gentleman and he scanned philip up and down with his keen grey eye as if internally reflecting that philips own right to criticise and classify that particular species of humanity was a trifle doubtful i should much like to make a captain of hussars of him hed be splendid as a leader of irregular horse the very man for a scrimmage for the generals one idea when he saw a fine specimen of our common race was the zulus or the red indianswhat an admirable person he would be to employ in killing and maiming his fellowcreatures  hed be better engaged so the dean murmured reflectively than in diffusing these horrid revolutionary and atheistical doctrines for the church was as usual in accord with the sword theoretically all peace practically all bloodshed and rapine and aggression and anything that was not his own opinion envisaged itself always to the deans crystallised mind as revolutionary and atheistic  hes very like the duke though general claviger went on after a moments pause during which everybody watched bertram and frida disappearing down the walk round a clump of syringas very like the duke and you saw he admitted some sort of relationship though he didnt like to dwell upon it you may be sure hes a byblow of the family somehow one of the bertrams perhaps the old duke who was out in the crimea may have formed an attachment for one of these ingledew girlsthe cobblers sisters i dare say they were no better in their conduct than they ought to beand this may be the consequence  im afraid the old duke was a man of loose life and doubtful conversation the dean put in with a tone of professional disapprobation for the inevitable transgressions of the great and the highplaced he didnt seem to set the example he ought to have done to his poorer brethren  oh he was a thorough old rip the duke if it comes to that general claviger responded twirling his white moustache and sos the present mana rip of the first water theyre a regular bad lot the bertrams root and stock they never set an example of anything to anybodybar horsebreedingas far as im aware and even at that their trainers have always fairly cheated em  the present dukes a most exemplary churchman the dean interposed with christian charity for a nobleman of position he gave us a couple of thousand last year for the cathedral restoration fund  and that would account philip put in returning abruptly to the previous question which had been exercising him meanwhile for the peculiarly distinguished air of birth and breeding this man has about him for philip respected a duke from the bottom of his heart and cherished the common britannic delusion that a man who has been elevated to that highest degree in our barbaric ranksystem must acquire at the same time a nobler type of physique and countenance exactly as a jew changes his semitic features for the european shape on conversion and baptism  oh dear no the general answered in his most decided voice the bertrams were never much to look at in any way and as for the old duke he was as insignificant a little monster of redhaired ugliness as ever youd see in a days march anywhere if he hadnt been a duke with a rentroll of forty odd thousand a year hed never have got that beautiful lady camilla to consent to marry him but bless you women ll do anything for the strawberry leaves it isnt from the bertrams this man gets his good looks it isnt from the bertrams old ingledews daughters are pretty enough girls if their aunts were like em its there your young friend got his air of distinction  we never know whos who nowadays the dean murmured softly being himself the son of a small scotch tradesman brought up in the free kirk and elevated into his present exalted position by the early intervention of a balliol scholarship and a studentship of christ church he felt at liberty to moralise in such noncommitting terms on the gradual decay of aristocratic exclusiveness  i dont see it much matters what a mans family was the general said stoutly so long as hes a fine wellmade soldierly fellow like this ingledew body capable of fighting for his queen and country hes an australian i suppose what tall chaps they do send home to be sure those australians are going to lick us all round the field presently  thats the curious part of it philip answered nobody knows what he is he doesnt even seem to be a british subject he calls himself an alien and he speaks most disrespectfully at timeswell not exactly perhaps of the queen in person but at any rate of the monarchy  utterly destitute of any feeling of respect for any power of any sort human or divine the dean remarked with clerical severity  for my part monteith interposed knocking his ash off savagely i think the mans a swindler and the more i see of him the less i like him hes never explained to us how he came here at all or what the dickens he came for he refuses to say where he lives or whats his nationality he poses as a sort of unexplained caspar hauser in my opinion these mystery men are always impostors he had no letters of introduction to anybody at brackenhurst and he thrust himself upon philip in a most peculiar way ever since which hes insisted upon coming to my house almost daily i dont like him myself its mrs monteith who insists upon having him here  he fascinates me the general said frankly i dont at all wonder the women like him as long as he was by though i dont agree with one word he says i couldnt help looking at him and listening to him intently  so he does me philip answered since the general gave him the cue and i notice its the same with people in the train they always listen to him though sometimes he preaches the most extravagant doctrinesoh much worse than anything hes said here this afternoon hes really quite eccentric  what sort of doctrines the dean inquired with languid zeal not i hope irreligious  oh dear no philip answered not that so much he troubles himself very little i think about religion social doctrines dont you know such very queer viewsabout women and so forth  indeed the dean said quickly drawing himself up very stiff for you touch the ark of god for the modern cleric when you touch the question of the relations of the sexes and what does he say its highly undesirable men should go about the country inciting to rebellion on such fundamental points of moral order in public railway carriages for it is a peculiarity of minds constituted like the deans say ninetynine per cent of the population to hold that the more important a subject is to our general happiness the less ought we all to think about it and discuss it  why he has very queer ideas philip went on slightly hesitating for he shared the common vulgar inability to phrase exposition of a certain class of subjects in any but the crudest and ugliest phraseology he seems to think dont you know the recognised forms of vicewell what all young men doyou know what i meanof course its not right but still they do them the dean nodded a cautious acquiescence he thinks theyre horribly wrong and distressing but he makes nothing at all of the virtue of decent girls and the peace of families  if i found a man preaching that sort of doctrine to my wife or my daughters monteith said savagely i know what id doid put a bullet through him  and quite right too the general murmured approvingly  professional considerations made the dean refrain from endorsing this open expression of murderous sentiment in its fullest form a clergyman ought always to keep up some decent semblance of respect for the gospel and the ten commandmentsor at least the greater part of them so he placed the tips of his fingers and thumbs together in the usual deliberative clerical way gazed blankly through the gap and answered with mild and perfunctory disapprobation a bullet would perhaps be an unnecessarily severe form of punishment to mete out but i confess i could excuse the man who was so far carried away by his righteous indignation as to duck the fellow in the nearest horsepond  well i dont know about that philip replied with an outburst of unwonted courage and originality for he was beginning to like and he had always from the first respected bertram theres something about the man that makes me feeleven when i differ from him mostthat he believes it all and is thoroughly in earnest i dare say im wrong but i always have a notion hes a better man than me in spite of all his nonsensehigher and clearer and differently constitutedand that if only i could climb to just where he has got perhaps i should see things in the same light that he does  it was a wonderful speech for philipa speech above himself but all the same by a fetch of inspiration he actually made it intercourse with bertram had profoundly impressed his feeble nature but the dean shook his head  a very undesirable young man for you to see too much of im sure mr christy he said with marked disapprobation for in the deans opinion it was a most dangerous thing for a man to think especially when hes young thinking is of course so likely to unsettle him  the general on the other hand nodded his stern grey head once or twice reflectively  hes a remarkable young fellow he said after a pause a most remarkable young fellow as i said before he somehow fascinates me id immensely like to put that young fellow into a smart hussar uniform mount him on a good charger of the punjaub breed and send him helterskelter pulldevil pullbaker among my old friends the duranis on the northwest frontier     viii   while the men talked thus bertram ingledews ears ought to have burned behind the bushes but to say the truth he cared little for their conversation for had he not turned aside down one of the retired gravel paths in the garden alone with frida  thats general claviger of herat i suppose he said in a low tone as they retreated out of earshot beside the clump of syringas what a stern old man he is to be sure with what a stern old face he looks like a person capable of doing or ordering all the strange things ive read of him in the papers  oh yes frida answered misunderstanding for the moment her companions meaning hes a very clever man i believe and a most distinguished officer  bertram smiled in spite of himself oh i didnt mean that he cried with the same odd gleam in his eyes frida had so often noticed there i meant he looked capable of doing or ordering all the horrible crimes hes credited with in history you remember it was he who was employed in massacring the poor savage zulus in their last stand at bay and in driving the afghan women and children to die of cold and starvation on the mountaintops after the taking of kabul a terrible fighter indeed a terrible history  but i believe hes a very good man in private life frida put in apologetically feeling compelled to say the best she could for her husbands guest i dont care for him much myself to be sure but robert likes him and hes awfully nice every one says to his wife and stepchildren  how can he be very good bertram answered in his gentlest voice if he hires himself out indiscriminately to kill or maim whoever hes told to irrespective even of the rights and wrongs of the private or public quarrel he happens to be employed upon its an appalling thing to take a fellowcreatures life even if youre quite quite sure its just and necessary but fancy contracting to take anybodys and everybodys life youre told to without any chance even of inquiring whether they may not be in the right after all and your own particular king or people most unjust and cruel and bloodstained aggressors why its horrible to contemplate do you know mrs monteith he went on with his faraway air its that that makes society here in england so difficult to me its so hard to mix on equal terms with your paid high priests and your hired slaughterers and never display openly the feelings you entertain towards them fancy if you had to mix so yourself with the men who flogged women to death in hungary or with the governors and jailors of some siberian prison thats the worst of travel when i was in central africa i sometimes saw a poor black woman tortured or killed before my very eyes and if id tried to interfere in her favour to save or protect her id only have got killed myself and probably have made things all the worse in the end for her and yet its hard indeed to have to look on at or listen to such horrors as these without openly displaying ones disgust and disapprobation whenever i meet your famous generals or your judges and your bishops i burn to tell them how their acts affect me yet im obliged to refrain because i know my words could do no good and might do harm for they could only anger them my sole hope of doing anything to mitigate the rigour of your cruel customs is to take as little notice of them as possible in any way whenever i find myself in unsympathetic society  then you dont think me unsympathetic frida murmured with a glow of pleasure  o frida the young man cried bending forward and looking at her you know very well youre the only person here i care for in the least or have the slightest sympathy with  frida was pleased he should say so he was so nice and gentle but she felt constrained none the less to protest for forms sake at least against his calling her once more so familiarly by her christian name not frida to you if you please mr ingledew she said as stiffly as she could manage you know it isnt right mrs monteith you must call me but she wasnt as angry somehow at the liberty he had taken as she would have been in anybody elses case he was so very peculiar  bertram ingledew paused and checked himself  you think i do it on purpose he said with an apologetic air i know you do of course but i assure you i dont its all pure forgetfulness the fact is nobody can possibly call to mind all the intricacies of your english and european customs at once unless hes to the manner born and carefully brought up to them from his earliest childhood as all of you yourselves have been he may recollect them after an effort when he thinks of them seriously but he cant possibly bear them all in mind at once every hour of the day and night by a pure tour de force of mental concentration you know its the same with your people in other barbarous countries your own travellers say it themselves about the customs of islam they cant learn them and remember them all at every moment of their lives as the mohammedans do and to make one slip there is instant death to them  frida looked at him earnestly but i hope she said with an air of deprecation pulling a rose to pieces petal by petal nervously as she spoke you dont put us on quite the same level as mohammedans were so much more civilised so much better in every way do you know mr ingledew and she hesitated for a minute i cant bear to differ from you or blame you in anything because you always appear to me so wise and good and kindhearted and reasonable but it often surprises me and even hurts me when you seem to talk of us all as if we were just so many savages youre always speaking about taboo and castes and poojah and fetiches as if we werent civilised people at all but utter barbarians now dont you thinkdont you admit yourself its a wee bit unreasonable or at any rate impolite of you  bertram drew back with a really pained expression on his handsome features o mrs monteith he cried frida im so sorry if ive seemed rude to you its all the same thingpure human inadvertence inability to throw myself into so unfamiliar an attitude i forget every minute that you do not recognise the essential identity of your own taboos and poojahs and fetiches with the similar and often indistinguishable taboos and poojahs and fetiches of savages generally they all come from the same source and often retain to the end as in your temple superstitions and your marriage superstitions the original features of their savage beginnings and as to your being comparatively civilised i grant you that at once only it doesnt necessarily make you one bit more rationalcertainly not one bit more humane or moral or brotherly in your actions  i dont understand you frida cried astonished but there i often dont understand you only i know when youve explained things i shall see how right you are  bertram smiled a quiet smile  youre certainly an apt pupil he said with brotherly gentleness pulling a flower as he went and slipping it softly into her bosom why what i means just this civilisation after all in the stage in which you possess it is only the ability to live together in great organised communities it doesnt necessarily imply any higher moral status or any greater rationality than those of the savage all it implies is greater cohesion more unity higher division of functions but the functions themselves like those of your priests and judges and soldiers may be as barbaric and cruel or as irrational and unintelligent as any that exist among the most primitive peoples advance in civilisation doesnt necessarily involve either advance in real knowledge of ones relations to the universe or advance in moral goodness and personal culture some highly civilised nations of historic times have been more cruel and barbarous than many quite uncultivated ones for example the romans at the height of their civilisation went mad drunk with blood at their gladiatorial shows the athenians of the age of pericles and socrates offered up human sacrifices at the thargelia like the veriest savages and the phoenicians and carthaginians the most civilised commercial people of the world in their time as the english are now gave their own children to be burnt alive as victims to baal the mexicans were far more civilised than the ordinary north american indians of their own day and even in some respects than the spanish christians who conquered converted enslaved and tortured them but the mexican religion was full of such horrors as i could hardly even name to you it was based entirely on cannibalism as yours is on mammon human sacrifices were commoncommoner even than in modern england i fancy newborn babies were killed by the priests when the corn was sown children when it had sprouted men when it was full grown and very old people when it was fully ripe  how horrible frida exclaimed  yes horrible bertram answered like your own worst customs it didnt show either gentleness or rationality youll admit but it showed whats the one thing essential to civilisationgreat coherence high organisation much division of function some of the rites these civilised mexicans performed would have made the blood of kindly savages run cold with horror they sacrificed a man at the harvest festival by crushing him like the corn between two big flat stones sometimes the priests skinned their victim alive and wore his raw skin as a mask or covering and danced hideous dances so disguised in honour of the hateful deities whom their fancies had createddeities even more hateful and cruel perhaps than the worst of your own christian calvinistic fancies i cant see myself that civilised people are one whit the better in all these respects than the uncivilised barbarian they pull together better thats all but war bloodshed superstition fetichworship religious rites castes class distinctions sex taboos restrictions on freedom of thought on freedom of action on freedom of speech on freedom of knowledge are just as common in their midst as among the utterly uncivilised  then what you yourself aim at frida said looking hard at him for he spoke very earnestlywhat you yourself aim at is  bertrams eyes came back to solid earth with a bound  oh what we at home aim at he said smiling that sweet soft smile of his that so captivated frida is not mere civilisation though of course we value that too in its meet degree because without civilisation and cooperation no great thing is possible but rationality and tenderness we think reason the first goodto recognise truly your own place in the universe to hold your head up like a man before the face of high heaven afraid of no ghosts or fetiches or phantoms to understand that wise and right and unselfish actions are the great requisites in life not the service of nonexistent and misshapen creatures of the human imagination knowledge of facts knowledge of nature knowledge of the true aspects of the world we live inthese seem to us of first importance after that we prize next reasonable and reasoning goodness for mere ruleofthumb goodness which comes by rote and might so easily degenerate into formalism or superstition has no honour among us but rather the contrary if any one were to say with us after he had passed his first infancy that he always did such and such a thing because he had been told it was right by his parents or teachersstill more because priests or fetichmen had commanded ithe would be regarded not as virtuous but as feeble or wickeda sort of moral idiot unable to distinguish rationally for himself between good and evil thats not the sort of conduct we consider right or befitting the dignity of a grown man or woman an ethical unit in an enlightened community rather is it their prime duty to question all things to accept no rule of conduct or morals as sure till they have thoroughly tested it  mr ingledew frida exclaimed do you know when you talk like that i always long to ask you where on earth you come from and who are these your people you so often speak about a blessed people i would like to learn about them and yet im afraid to you almost seem to me like a being from another planet  the young man laughed a quiet little laugh of deprecation and sat down on the garden bench beside the yellow rosebush  oh dear no frida he said with that transparent glance of his now dont look so vexed i shall call you frida if i choose its your name and i like you why let this funny taboo of ones own real name stand in the way of reasonable friendship in many savage countries a womans never allowed to call her husband by his name or even to know it or for the matter of that to see him in the daylight in your england the arrangements exactly reversed no mans allowed to call a woman by her real name unless shes tabooed for life to himwhat you europeans call married to him but let that pass if one went on pulling oneself up short at every one of your customs oned never get any further in any question one was discussing now dont be deceived by nonsensical talk about living beings in other planets there are no such creatures its a pure delusion of the ordinary egotistical human pattern when people chatter about life in other worlds they dont mean lifewhich of a sort there may be therethey mean human lifea very different and much less important matter well how could there possibly be human beings or anything like them in other stars or planets the conditions are too complex too peculiar too exclusively mundane we are things of this world and of this world only dont lets magnify our importance were not the whole universe our race is essentially a development from a particular type of monkeylike animalthe andropithecus of the upper uganda eocene this monkeylike animal itself again is the product of special antecedent causes filling a particular place in a particular tertiary fauna and flora and impossible even in the fauna and flora of our own earth and our own tropics before the evolution of those succulent fruits and grainlike seeds for feeding on which it was specially adapted without edible fruits in short there could be no monkey and without monkeys there could be no man  but maynt there be edible fruits in the other planets frida inquired halftimidly more to bring out this novel aspect of bertrams knowledge than really to argue with him for she dearly loved to hear his views of things they were so fresh and unconventional  edible fruits yes possibly and animals or something more or less like animals to feed upon them but even if there are such which planetoscopists doubt they must be very different creatures in form and function from any we know on this one small world of ours for just consider frida what we mean by life we mean a set of simultaneous and consecutive changes going on in a complex mass of organised carbon compounds when most people say life howeverespecially here with you where education is undevelopedthey arent thinking of life in general at all which is mainly vegetable but only of animal and often indeed of human life well then consider even on this planet itself how special are the conditions that make life possible there must be water in some form for theres no life in the desert there must be heat up to a certain point and not above or below it for fire kills and theres no life at the poles as among alpine glaciers or what little there is depends upon the intervention of other life wafted from elsewherefrom the lands or seas in fact where it can really originate in order to have life at all as we know it at least and i cant say whether anything else could be fairly called life by any true analogy until ive seen and examined it you must have carbon and oxygen and hydrogen and nitrogen and many other things under certain fixed conditions you must have liquid water not steam or ice you must have a certain restricted range of temperature neither very much higher nor very much lower than the average of the tropics now look even with all these conditions fulfilled how diverse is life on this earth itself the one place we really knowvarying as much as from the oak to the cuttlefish from the palm to the tiger from man to the fern the seaweed or the jellyspeck every one of these creatures is a complex result of very complex conditions among which you must never forget to reckon the previous existence and interaction of all the antecedent ones is it probable then even a priori that if life or anything like it exists on any other planet it would exist in forms at all as near our own as a buttercup is to a human being or a seaanemone is to a cat or a pinetree  well it doesnt look likely now you come to put it so frida answered thoughtfully for though english she was not wholly impervious to logic  likely of course not bertram went on with conviction planetoscopists are agreed upon it and above all why should one suppose the living organisms or their analogues if any such there are in the planets or fixed stars possess any such purely human and animal faculties as thought and reason thats just like our common human narrowness if we were oaks i suppose we would only interest ourselves in the question whether acorns existed in mars and saturn he paused a moment then he added in an afterthought no frida you may be sure all human beings you and i alike and thousands of others a great deal more different are essential products of this one wee planet and of particular times and circumstances in its history we differ only as birth and circumstances have made us differ there is a mystery about who i am and where i come from i wont deny it but it isnt by any means so strange or so marvellous a mystery as you seem to imagine one of your own old sacred books says as i remember hearing in the josshouse i attended one day in london god hath made of one blood all the nations of the earth if for god in that passage we substitute common descent its perfectly true we are all of one race and i confess when i talk to you every day i feel our unity more and more profoundly he bent over on the bench and took her tremulous hand frida he said looking deep into her speaking dark eyes dont you yourself feel it  he was so strange so simpleminded so different in every way from all other men that for a moment frida almost halfforgot to be angry with him in point of fact in her heart she was not angry at all she liked to feel the soft pressure of his strong mans hand on her dainty fingers she liked to feel the gentle way he was stroking her smooth arm with that delicate white palm of his it gave her a certain immediate and unthinking pleasure to sit still by his side and know he was full of her then suddenly with a start she remembered her duty she was a married woman and she ought not to do it quickly with a startled air she withdrew her hand bertram gazed down at her for a second half taken aback by her hurried withdrawal  then you dont like me he cried in a pained tone after all you dont like me one moment later a ray of recognition broke slowly over his face oh i forgot he said leaning away i didnt mean to annoy you a year or two ago of course i might have held your hand in mine as long as ever i liked you were still a free being but what was right then is wrong now according to the kaleidoscopic etiquette of your countrywomen i forgot all that in the heat of the moment i recollected only we were two human beings of the same race and blood with hearts that beat and hands that lay together i remember now you must hide and stifle your native impulses in future youre tabooed for life to robert monteith i must needs respect his seal set upon you  and he drew a deep sigh of enforced resignation  frida sighed in return these problems are so hard she said  bertram smiled a strange smile there are no problems he answered confidently you make them yourselves you surround life with taboos and thenyou talk despairingly of the problems with which your own taboos alone have saddled you     ix   at halfpast nine one evening that week bertram was seated in his sittingroom at miss blakes lodgings making entries as usual on the subject of taboo in his big black notebook it was a large bare room furnished with the customary round rosewood centre table and decorated by a pair of green china vases a set of wax flowers under a big glass shade and a picture representing two mythical beings with womens faces and birds wings hovering over the figure of a sleeping baby suddenly a hurried knock at the door attracted his attention come in he said softly in that gentle and almost deferential voice which he used alike to his equals and to the lodginghouse servant the door opened at once and frida entered  she was pale as a ghost and she stepped light with a terrified tread bertram could see at a glance she was profoundly agitated for a moment he could hardly imagine the reason why then he remembered all at once the strict harem rules by which married women in england are hemmed in and circumvented to visit an unmarried man alone by night is contrary to tribal usage he rose and advanced towards his visitor with outstretched arms why frida he criedmrs monteithno fridawhats the matter what has happened since i left you look so pale and startled  frida closed the door cautiously flung herself down into a chair in a despairing attitude and buried her face in her hands for some moments in silence o mr ingledew she cried at last looking up in an agony of shame and doubt bertrami know its wrong i know its wicked i ought never to have come robert would kill me if he found out but its my one last chance and i couldnt bear not to say goodbye to youjust this oncefor ever  bertram gazed at her in astonishment long and intimately as he had lived among the various devotees of divine taboos the whole world over it was with difficulty still he could recall each time each particular restriction of the various systems then it came home to him with a rush he removed the poor girls hands gently from her face which she had buried once more in them for pure shame and held them in his own dear frida he said tenderly stroking them as he spoke why what does all this mean whats this sudden thunderbolt youve come here tonight without your husbands leave and youre afraid hell discover you  frida spoke under her breath in a voice halfchoked with frequent sobs dont talk too loud she whispered miss blake doesnt know im here if she did shed tell on me i slipped in quietly through the open back door but i felt i musti really really must i couldnt stop away i couldnt help it  bertram gazed at her distressed her tone was distressing horror and indignation for a moment overcame him she had had to slip in there like a fugitive or a criminal she had had to crawl away by stealth from that man her keeper she a grown woman and a moral agent with a will of her own and a heart and a conscience was held so absolutely in serfdom as a particular mans thrall and chattel that she could not even go out to visit a friend without these degrading subterfuges of creeping in unperceived by a back entrance and talking low under her breath lest a lodginghouse crone should find out what she was doing and all the world of england was so banded in league with the slavedriver against the soul he enslaved that if miss blake had seen her she could hardly have come in while once in she must tremble and whisper and steal about with muffled feet for fear of discovery in this innocent adventure he held his breath with stifled wrath it was painful and degrading  but he had no time just then to think much of all this for there sat frida tremulous and shivering before his very eyes trying hard to hide her beautiful white face in her quivering hands and murmuring over and over again in a very low voice like an agonised creature i couldnt bear not to be allowed to say goodbye to you for ever  bertram smoothed her cheek gently she tried to prevent him but he went on in spite of her with a mans strong persistence notwithstanding his gentleness he was always virile goodbye he cried goodbye why on earth goodbye frida when i left you before dinner you never said one word of it to me  oh no frida cried sobbing its all robert robert as soon as ever you were gone he called me into the librarywhich always means hes going to talk over some dreadful business with meand he said to me frida ive just heard from phil that this man ingledew whos chosen to foist himself upon us holds opinions and sentiments which entirely unfit him from being proper company for any lady now hes been coming here a great deal too often of late next time he calls i wish you to tell martha youre not at home to him  bertram looked across at her with a melting look in his honest blue eyes and you came round to tell me of it you dear thing he cried seizing her hand and grasping it hard o frida how kind of you  frida trembled from head to foot the blood throbbed in her pulse then youre not vexed with me she sobbed out all tremulous with gladness  vexed with you o frida how could i be vexed you poor child im so pleased so glad so grateful  frida let her hand rest unresisting in his but bertram she murmuredi must call you bertrami couldnt help it you know i like you so much i couldnt let you go for ever without just saying goodbye to you  you dont like me you love me bertram answered with masculine confidence no you neednt blush frida you cant deceive me my darling you love me and you know i love you why should we two make any secret about our hearts any longer he laid his hand on her face again making it tingle with joy frida he said solemnly you dont love that man you call your husband you havent loved him for years you never really loved him  there was something about the mere sound of bertrams calm voice that made frida speak the truth more plainly and frankly than she could ever have spoken it to any ordinary englishman yet she hung down her head even so and hesitated slightly just at first she murmured halfinaudibly i used to think i loved him at any rate i was pleased and flattered he should marry me  pleased and flattered bertram exclaimed more to himself than to her great heavens how incredible pleased and flattered by that man one can hardly conceive it but youve never loved him since frida you cant look me in the face and tell me you love him  no not since the first few months frida answered still hanging her head but bertram hes my husband and of course i must obey him  you must do nothing of the sort bertram cried authoritatively you dont love him at all and you mustnt pretend to its wrong its wicked sooner or later he checked himself frida he went on after a moments pause i wont speak to you of what i was going to say just now ill wait a bit till youre stronger and better able to understand it but there must be no more silly talk of farewells between us i wont allow it youre mine nowa thousand times more truly mine than ever you were monteiths and i cant do without you you must go back to your husband for the present i supposethe circumstances compel it though i dont approve of it but you must see me again and soon and often just the same as usual i wont go to your house of course the house is monteiths and everywhere among civilised and rational races the sanctity of the home is rightly respected but you yourself he has no claim or right to taboo and if i can help it he shant taboo you you may go home now tonight dear one but you must meet me often if you cant come round to my roomsfor fear of miss blakes fetich the respectability of her housewe must meet elsewhere till i can make fresh arrangements  frida gazed up at him in doubt but will it be right bertram she murmured  the man looked down into her big eyes in dazed astonishment why frida he cried halfpained at the question do you think if it were wrong id advise you to do it im here to help you to guide you to lead you on by degrees to higher and truer life how can you imagine id ask you to do anything on earth unless i felt perfectly sure and convinced it was the very most right and proper conduct  his arm stole round her waist and drew her tenderly towards him frida allowed the caress passively there was a robust frankness about his lovemaking that seemed to rob it of all taint or tinge of evil then he caught her bodily in his arms like a man who has never associated the purest and noblest of human passions with any lower thought any baser personality he had not taken his first lessons in the art of love from the wearied lips of joyless courtesans whom his own kind had debased and unsexed and degraded out of all semblance of womanhood he bent over the woman of his choice and kissed her with chaste warmth on the forehead first then after a short interval twice on the lips at each kiss from which she somehow did not shrink as if recognising its purity frida felt a strange thrill course through and through her she quivered from head to foot the scales fell from her eyes the taboos of her race grew null and void within her she looked up at him more boldly o bertram she whispered nestling close to his side and burying her blushing face in the mans curved bosom i dont know what youve done to me but i feel quite differentas if id eaten the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil  i hope you have bertram answered in a very solemn voice for frida you will need it he pressed her close against his breast and frida monteith a free woman at last clung there many minutes with no vile inherited sense of shame or wrongfulness i cant bear to go she cried still clinging to him and clutching him tight im so happy here bertram oh so happy so happy  then why go away at all bertram asked quite simply  frida drew back in horror oh i must she said coming to herself i must of course because of robert  bertram held her hand smoothing it all the while with his own as he mused and hesitated well its clearly wrong to go back he said after a moments pause you ought never of course to spend another night with that man you dont love and should never have lived with but i suppose thats only a counsel of perfection too hard a saying for you to understand or follow for the present youd better go back just tonight and as time moves on i can arrange something else for you but when shall i see you againfor now you belong to me i sealed you with that kiss when will you come and see me  i cant come here you know frida whispered halfterrified for if i did miss blake would see me  bertram smiled a bitter smile to himself so she would he said musing and though shes not the least interested in keeping up robert monteiths proprietary claim on your life and freedom im beginning to understand now that it would be an offence against that mysterious and incomprehensible entity they call respectability if she were to allow me to receive you in her rooms its all very curious but of course while i remain i must be content to submit to it byandby perhaps frida we two may manage to escape together from this iron generation meanwhile i shall go up to london less often for the present and you can come and meet me dear in the middle mill fields at two oclock on monday  she gazed up at him with perfect trust in those luminous dark eyes of hers i will bertram she said firmly she knew not herself what his kiss had done for her but one thing she knew from the moment their lips met she had felt and understood in a flood of vision that perfect love which casteth out fear and was no longer afraid of him  thats right darling the man answered stooping down and laying his cheek against her own once more you are mine and i am yours you are not and never were robert monteiths my frida so now goodnight till monday at two beside the stile in middle mill meadows  she clung to him for a moment in a passionate embrace he let her stop there while he smoothed her dark hair with one free hand then suddenly with a burst the older feelings of her race overcame her for a minute she broke from his grasp and hid her head all crimson in a cushion on the sofa one second later again she lifted her face unabashed the new impulse stirred her im proud i love you bertram she cried with red lips and flashing eyes and im proud you love me  with that she slipped quietly out and walked erect and graceful no longer ashamed down the lodginghouse passage     x   when she returned robert monteith sat asleep over his paper in his easychair it was his wont at night when he returned from business frida cast one contemptuous glance as she passed at his burly unintelligent form and went up to her bedroom  but all that night long she never slept her head was too full of bertram ingledew  yet strange to say she felt not one qualm of conscience for their stolen meeting no feminine terror no fluttering fear disturbed her equanimity it almost seemed to her as if bertrams kiss had released her by magic at once and for ever from the taboos of her nation she had slipped out from home unperceived that night in fear and trembling with many sinkings of heart and dire misgivings while robert and phil were downstairs in the smokingroom she had slunk round crouching low to miss blakes lodgings and she had terrified her soul on the way with a good womans doubts and a good womans fears as to the wrongfulness of her attempt to say goodbye to the friend she might now no longer mix with but from the moment her lips and bertrams touched all fear and doubt seemed utterly to have vanished she lay there all night in a fierce ecstasy of love hugging herself for strange delight thinking only of bertram and wondering what manner of thing was this promised freedom whereof her lover had spoken to her so confidently she trusted him now she knew he would do right and right alone whatever he advised she would be safe in following  next day robert went up to town to business as usual he was immersed in palmoil by a quarter to two frida found herself in the fields but early as she went to fulfil her tryst bertram was there before her he took her hand in his with a gentle pressure and frida felt a quick thrill she had never before experienced course suddenly through her she looked around to right and left to see if they were observed bertram noticed the instinctive movement my darling he said in a low voice this is intolerable unendurable its an insult not to be borne that you and i cant walk together in the fields of england without being subjected thus to such a manyheaded espionage i shall have to arrange something before long so as to see you at leisure i cant be so bound by all the taboos of your country  she looked up at him trustfully as you will bertram she answered without a moments hesitation i know im yours now let it be what it may i can do what you tell me  he looked at her and smiled he saw she was pure woman he had met at last with a sister soul there was a long deep silence  frida was the first to break it with words why do you always call them taboos bertram she asked at last sighing  why frida dont you see he said walking on through the deep grass because they are taboos thats the only reason why not give them their true name we call them nothing else among my own people all taboos are the same in origin and spirit whether savage or civilised eastern or western you must see that now for i know you are emancipated they begin with belief in some fetich or bogey or other nonexistent supernatural being and they mostly go on to regard certain absolutely harmlessnay sometimes even praiseworthy or morally obligatoryacts as proscribed by him and sure to be visited with his condign displeasure so south sea islanders think if they eat some particular luscious fruit tabooed for the chiefs theyll be instantly struck dead by the mere power of the taboo in it and english people think if they go out in the country for a picnic on a tabooed day or use certain harmless tabooed names and words or inquire into the historical validity of certain incredible ancient documents accounted sacred or even dare to think certain things that no reasonable man can prevent himself from thinking theyll be burned for ever in eternal fire for it the common element is the dread of an unreal sanction so in japan and west africa the people believe the whole existence of the world and the universe is bound up with the health of their own particular king or the safety of their own particular royal family and therefore they wont allow their mikado or their chief to go outside his palace lest he should knock his royal foot against a stone and so prevent the sun from shining and the rain from falling in other places its a tree or a shrub with which the stability and persistence of the world is bound up whenever that tree or shrub begins to droop or wither the whole population rushes out in bodily fear and awe bearing water to pour upon it and crying aloud with wild cries as if their lives were in danger if any man were to injure the tree which of course is no more valuable than any other bush of its sort theyd tear him to pieces on the spot and kill or torture every member of his family and so too in england most people believe without a shadow of reason that if men and women were allowed to manage their own personal relations free from tribal interference all life and order would go to rack and ruin the world would become one vast horrible orgy and society would dissolve in some incredible fashion to prevent this imaginary and impossible result they insist upon regulating one anothers lives from outside with the strictest taboos like those which hem round the west african kings and punish with cruel and relentless heartlessness every man and still more every woman who dares to transgress them  i think i see what you mean frida answered blushing  and i mean it in the very simplest and most literal sense bertram went on quite seriously id been among you some time before it began to dawn on me that you english didnt regard your own taboos as essentially identical with other peoples to me from the very first they seemed absolutely the same as the similar taboos of central africans and south sea islanders all of them spring alike from a common origin the queer savage belief that various harmless or actually beneficial things may become at times in some mysterious way harmful and dangerous the essence of them all lies in the erroneous idea that if certain contingencies occur such as breaking an image or deserting a faith some terrible evil will follow to one man or to the world which evil as a matter of fact theres no reason at all to dread in any way sometimes as in ancient rome egypt central africa and england the whole of life gets enveloped at last in a perfect mist and labyrinth of taboos a cobweb of conventions the flamen dialis at rome you know mightnt ride or even touch a horse he mightnt see an army under arms nor wear a ring that wasnt broken nor have a knot in any part of his clothing he mightnt eat wheaten flour or leavened bread he mightnt look at or even mention by name such unlucky things as a goat a dog raw meat haricot beans or common ivy he mightnt walk under a vine the feet of his bed had to be daubed with mud his hair could only be cut by a free man and with a bronze knife he was encased and surrounded as it were by endless petty restrictions and regulations and taboosjust like those that now surround so many men and especially so many young women here in england  and you think they arise from the same causes frida said halfhesitating for she hardly knew whether it was not wicked to say so  why of course they do bertram answered confidently thats not matter of opinion now its matter of demonstration the worst of them all in their present complicated state are the ones that concern marriage and the other hideous sextaboos they seem to have been among the earliest human abuses for marriage arises from the stoneage practice of felling a woman of another tribe with a blow of ones club and dragging her off by the hair of her head to ones own cave as a slave and drudge and they are still the most persistent and cruel of anyso much so that your own people as you know taboo even the fair and free discussion of this the most important and serious question of life and morals they make it as we would say at home a refuge for enforced ignorance for its well known that early tribes hold the most superstitious ideas about the relation of men to women and dread the most ridiculous and impossible evils resulting from it and these absurd terrors of theirs seem to have been handed on intact to civilised races so that for fear of i know not what ridiculous bogey of their own imaginations or dread of some unnatural restraining deity men wont even discuss a matter of so much importance to them all but rather than let the taboo of silence be broken will allow such horrible things to take place in their midst as i have seen with my eyes for these last six or seven weeks in your cities o frida you cant imagine what thingsfor i know they hide them from you cruelties of lust and neglect and shame such as you couldnt even dream of women dying of foul disease in want and dirt deliberately forced upon them by the will of your society destined beforehand for death a hateful lingering deatha death more disgusting than aught you can conceivein order that the rest of you may be safely tabooed each a maid intact for the man who weds her its the hatefullest taboo of all the hateful taboos ive ever seen on my wanderings the unworthiest of a pure or moral community  he shut his eyes as if to forget the horrors of which he spoke they were fresh and real to him frida did not like to question him further she knew to what he referred and in a dim vague way for she was less wise than he she knew she thought she could imagine why he found it all so terrible  they walked on in silence a while through the deep lush grass of the july meadow at last bertram spoke again frida he said with a trembling quiver i didnt sleep last night i was thinking this thing overthis question of our relations  nor did i frida answered thrilling through responsive i was thinking the same thing and bertram twas the happiest night i ever remember  bertrams face flushed rosy red that native colour of triumphant love but he answered nothing he only looked at her with a look more eloquent by far than a thousand speeches  frida he went on at last ive been thinking it all over and i feel if only you can come away with me for just seven days i could arrange at the end of that timeto take you home with me  fridas face in turn waxed rosy red but she answered only in a very low voice thank you bertram  would you go with me bertram cried his face aglow with pleasure you know its a very very long way off and i cant even tell you where it is or how you get there but can you trust me enough to try are you not afraid to come with me  fridas voice trembled slightly  im not afraid if thats all she answered in a very firm tone i love you and i trust you and i could follow you to the worlds endor if needful out of it but theres one other question bertram ought i to  she asked it more to see what answer bertram would make to her than from any real doubt for ever since that kiss last night she felt sure in her own mind with a womans certainty whatever bertram told her was the thing she ought to do but she wanted to know in what light he regarded it  bertram gazed at her hard  why frida he said its right of course to go the thing thats wrong is to stop with that man one minute longer thans absolutely necessary you dont love himyou never loved him or if you ever did youve long since ceased to do so well then its a dishonour to yourself to spend one more day with him how can you submit to the hateful endearments of a man you dont love or care for how wrong to yourself how infinitely more wrong to your still unborn and unbegotten children would you consent to become the mother of sons and daughters by a man whose whole character is utterly repugnant to you nature has given us this divine instinct of love within to tell us with what persons we should spontaneously unite will you fly in her face and unite with a man whom you feel and know to be wholly unworthy of you with us such conduct would be considered disgraceful we think every man and woman should be free to do as they will with their own persons for that is the very basis and foundation of personal liberty but if any man or woman were openly to confess they yielded their persons to another for any other reason than because the strongest sympathy and love compelled them we should silently despise them if you dont love monteith its your duty to him and still more your duty to yourself and your unborn children at once to leave him if you do love me its your duty to me and still more your duty to yourself and our unborn children at once to cleave to me dont let any sophisms of taboomongers come in to obscure that plain natural duty do right first let all else go for one of yourselves a poet of your own has said truly        because right is right to follow right      were wisdom in the scorn of consequence   frida looked up at him with admiration in her big black eyes she had found the truth and the truth had made her free  o bertram she cried with a tremor its good to be like you i felt from the very first how infinitely you differed from the men about me you seemed so much greater and higher and nobler how grateful i ought to be to robert monteith for having spoken to me yesterday and forbidden me to see you for if he hadnt you might never have kissed me last night and then i might never have seen things as i see them at present  there was another long pause for the best things we each say to the other are said in the pauses then frida relapsed once more into speech but what about the children she asked rather timidly  bertram looked puzzled why what about the children he repeated in a curious way what difference on earth could that make to the children  can i bring them with me i mean frida asked a little tremulous for the reply i couldnt bear to leave them even for you dear bertram i could never desert them  bertram gazed at her dismayed leave them he cried why frida of course you could never leave them do you mean to say anybody would be so utterly unnatural even in england as to separate a mother from her own children  i dont think robert would let me keep them frida faltered with tears in her eyes and if he didnt the law of course would take his side against me  of course bertram answered with grim sarcasm in his face of course i might have guessed it if there is an injustice or a barbarity possible i might have been sure the law of england would make haste to perpetrate it but you neednt fear frida long before the law of england could be put in motion ill have completed my arrangements for taking youand them toowith me there are advantages sometimes even in the barbaric delay of what your lawyers are facetiously pleased to call justice  then i may bring them with me frida cried flushing red  bertram nodded assent yes he said with grave gentleness you may bring them with you and as soon as you like too remember dearest every night you pass under that creatures roof you commit the vilest crime a woman can commit against her own purity     xi   never in her life had frida enjoyed anything so much as those first four happy days at heymoor she had come away with bertram exactly as bertram himself desired her to do without one thought of anything on earth except to fulfil the higher law of her own nature and she was happy in her intercourse with the one man who could understand it the one man who had waked it to its fullest pitch and could make it resound sympathetically to his touch in every chord and every fibre they had chosen a lovely spot on a heatherclad moorland where she could stroll alone with bertram among the gorse and ling utterly oblivious of robert monteith and the unnatural world she had left for ever behind her her soul drank in deep draughts of the knowledge of good and evil from bertrams lips she felt it was indeed a privilege to be with him and listen to him she wondered how she could ever have endured that old bad life with the lower man who was never her equal now she had once tasted and known what life can be when two wellmatched souls walk it together abreast in holy fellowship  the children too were as happy as the day was long the heath was heaven to them they loved bertram well and were too young to be aware of anything unusual in the fact of his accompanying them at the little inn on the hilltop where they stopped to lodge nobody asked any compromising questions and bertram felt so sure he could soon complete his arrangements for taking frida and the children home as he still always phrased it that frida had no doubts for their future happiness as for robert monteith that bleak cold man she hardly even remembered him bertrams first kiss seemed almost to have driven the very memory of her husband clean out of her consciousness she only regretted now she had left him the false and mistaken sense of duty which had kept her so long tied to an inferior soul she could never love and did wrong to marry  and all the time what strange new lessons what beautiful truths she learned from bertram as they strolled together those sweet august mornings hand locked in hand over the breezy upland what new insight he gave her into men and things what fresh impulse he supplied to her keen moral nature the misery and wrong of the world she lived in came home to her now in deeper and blacker hues than ever she had conceived it in and with that consciousness came also the burning desire of every wakened soul to right and redress it with bertram by her side she felt she could not even harbour an unholy wish or admit a wrong feeling that vague sense of his superiority as of a higher being which she had felt from the very first moment she met him at brackenhurst had deepened and grown more definite now by closer intercourse and she recognised that what she had fallen in love with from the earliest beginning was the beauty of holiness shining clear in his countenance she had chosen at last the better part and she felt in her soul that come what might it could not be taken away from her  in this earthly paradise of pure love undefiled she spent three full days and part of another on the morning of the fourth she sent the country girl they had engaged to take care of the children out on the moor with the little ones while she herself and bertram went off alone past the barrow that overlooks the devils saucepan and out on the open ridge that stretches with dark growth of heath and bracken far away into the misty blue distance of hampshire bertram had just been speaking to her as they sat on the dry sand of the buried chieftain whose bones still lay hid under that grassgrown barrow and of the slaughtered wives whose bodies slept beside him massacred in cold blood to accompany their dead lord to the world of shadows he had been contrasting these hideous slaveries of tabooridden england past or present with the rational freedom of his own dear country whither he hoped so soon with good luck to take her when suddenly frida raised her eager eyes from the ground and saw somebody or something coming across the moor from eastward in their direction  all at once a vague foreboding of evil possessed her hardly quite knowing why she felt this approaching object augured no good to their happiness look bertram she cried seizing his arm in her fright theres somebody coming  bertram raised his eyes and looked then he shaded them with his hands how strange he said simply in his candid way it looks for all the world just like the man who was once your husband  frida rose in alarm oh what can we do she cried wringing her hands what ever can we do its he its robert  surely he cant have come on purpose bertram exclaimed taken aback when he sees us hell turn aside he must know of all people on earth hes the one least likely at such a time to be welcome he cant want to disturb the peace of another mans honeymoon  but frida better used to the savage ways of the world she had always lived in made answer shrinking and crouching hes hunted us down and hes come to fight you  to fight me bertram exclaimed oh surely not that i was told by those who ought best to know you english had got far beyond the stage of private war and murderous vendetta  for everything else frida answered cowering down in her terror of her husbands vengeance not for herself indeed so much as for bertram for everything else we have but not for a woman  there was no time just then however for further explanation of this strange anomaly monteith had singled them out from a great distance with his keen clear sight inherited from generations of highland ancestors and now strode angrily across the moor with great wrathful steps in his rivals direction frida nestled close to bertram to protect her from the man to whom her countrys laws and the customs of her tribe would have handed her over blindfold bertram soothed her with his hand and awaited in silence with some dim sense of awe the angry barbarians arrival  he came up very quickly and stood full in front of them glaring with fierce eyes at the discovered lovers for a minute or two his rage would not allow him to speak nor even to act he could but stand and scowl from under his brows at bertram but after a long pause his wrath found words you infernal scoundrel he burst forth so at last ive caught you how dare you sit there and look me straight in the face you infernal thief how dare you how dare you  bertram rose and confronted him his own face too flushed slightly with righteous indignation but he answered for all that in the same calm and measured tones as ever i am not a scoundrel and i will not submit to be called so even by an angry savage i ask you in return how dare you follow us you must have known your presence would be very unwelcome i should have thought this was just the one moment in your life and the one place on earth where even you would have seen that to stop away was your imperative duty mere selfrespect would dictate such conduct this lady has given you clear proof indeed that your society and converse are highly distasteful to her  robert monteith glared across at him with the face of a tiger you infamous creature he cried almost speechless with rage do you dare to defend my wifes adultery  bertram gazed at him with a strange look of mingled horror and astonishment you poor wretch he answered as calmly as before but with evident contempt how can you dare such a thing as you to apply these vile words to your moral superiors adultery it was indeed and untruth to her own higher and purer nature for this lady to spend one night of her life under your roof with you what she has taken now in exchange is holy marriage the only real and sacred marriage the marriage of true souls to which even the wiser of yourselves the poets of your nation would not admit impediment if you dare to apply such base language as this to my ladys actions you must answer for it to me her natural protector for i will not permit it  at the words quick as lightning monteith pulled from his pocket a loaded revolver and pointed it full at his rival with a cry of terror frida flung herself between them and tried to protect her lover with the shield of her own body but bertram gently unwound her arms and held her off from him tenderly no no darling he said slowly sitting down with wonderful calm upon a big grey sarsenstone that abutted upon the pathway i had forgotten again i keep always forgetting what kind of savages i have to deal with if i chose i could snatch that murderous weapon from his hand and shoot him dead with it in selfdefencefor im stronger than he is but if i did what use i could never take you home with me and after all what could we either of us do in the end in this bad wild world of your fellowcountrymen they would take me and hang me and all would be up with you for your sake frida to shield you from the effects of their cruel taboos theres but one course open i must submit to this madman he may shoot me if he will stand free and let him  but with a passionate oath robert monteith seized her arm and flung her madly from him she fell reeling on one side his eyes were bloodshot with the savage thirst for vengeance he raised the deadly weapon bertram ingledew still seated on the big round boulder opened his breast in silence to receive the bullet there was a moments pause for that moment even monteith himself in his maniac mood felt dimly aware of that mysterious restraining power all the rest who knew him had so often felt in their dealings with the alien but it was only for a moment his coarser nature was ill adapted to recognise that ineffable air as of a superior being that others observed in him he pulled the trigger and fired frida gave one loud shriek of despairing horror bertrams body fell back on the bare heath behind it     xii   mad as he was with jealousy that lowest and most bestial of all the vile passions man still inherits from the ape and tiger robert monteith was yet quite sane enough to know in his own soul what deed he had wrought and in what light even his countrys barbaric laws would regard his action so the moment he had wreaked to the full his fiery vengeance on the man who had never wronged him he bent over the body with strangely eager eyes expecting to see upon it some evidence of his guilt some bloody mark of the hateful crime his own hand had committed at the same instant frida recovering from his blow that had sent her reeling rushed frantically forward flung herself with wild passion on her lovers corpse and covered the warm lips with hot despairing kisses  one marvellous fact however impressed them both with a vague sense of the unknown and the mysterious from the very first second no spot nor trace of blood marred the body anywhere and even as they looked a strange perfume as of violets or of burning incense began by degrees to flood the moor around them then slowly while they watched a faint blue flame seemed to issue from the wound in bertrams right side and rise lambent into the air above the murdered body frida drew back and gazed at it a weird thrill of mystery and unconscious hope beguiling for one moment her profound pang of bereavement monteith too stood away a pace or two in doubt and surprise the deep consciousness of some strange and unearthly power overawing for a while even his vulgar and commonplace scotch bourgeois nature gradually as they gazed the pale blue flame rising higher and higher gathered force and volume and the perfume as of violets became distinct on the air like the savour of a purer life than this century wots of bit by bit the wan blue light flickering thicker and thicker shaped itself into the form and features of a man even the outward semblance of bertram ingledew shadowy but transfigured with an ineffable glory it hovered for a minute or two above the spot on the moor where the corpse had lain for now they were aware that as the flameshape formed the body that lay dead upon the ground beneath dissolved by degrees and melted into it not a trace was left on the heath of robert monteiths crime not a dapple of blood not a clot of gore only a pale blue flame and a persistent image represented the body that was once bertram ingledews  again even as they looked a still weirder feeling began to creep over them the figure growing fainter seemed to fade away piecemeal in the remote distance but it was not in space that it faded it appeared rather to become dim in some vaguer and far more mysterious fashion like the memories of childhood or the aching abysses of astronomical calculation as it slowly dissolved frida stretched out her hands to it with a wild cry like the cry of a mother for her firstborn o bertram she moaned where are you going do you mean to leave me wont you save me from this man wont you take me home with you  dim and hollow as from the womb of time unborn a calm voice came back to her across the gulf of ages your husband willed it frida and the customs of your nation you can come to me but i can never return to you in three days longer your probation would have been finished but i forgot with what manner of savage i had still to deal and now i must go back once more to the place whence i cameto the twentyfifth century  the voice died away in the dim recesses of the future the pale blue flame flickered forward and vanished the shadowy shape melted through an endless vista of tomorrows only the perfume as of violets or of a higher life still hung heavy upon the air and a patch of daintier purple burned bright on the moor like a pool of crimson blood where the body had fallen only that and a fierce ache in fridas tortured heart only that and a halo of invisible glory round the rich red lips where his lips had touched them     xiii   frida seated herself in her misery on the iceworn boulder where three minutes earlier bertram had been sitting her face was buried in her bloodless hands all the world grew blank to her  monteith for his part sat down a little way off with folded arms on another sarsenstone fronting her the strange and unearthly scene they had just passed through impressed him profoundly for the first few minutes a great horror held him but his dogged scottish nature still brooded over his wrongs in spite of the terrible sight he had so unexpectedly evoked in a way he felt he had had his revenge for had he not drawn upon his man and fired at him and killed him still after the fever and torment of the last few days it was a relief to find after all he was not as this world would judge a murderer man and crime were alike mere airy phantoms he could go back now to the inn and explain with a glib tongue how mr ingledew had been hurriedly called away to town on important business there was no corpse on the moor no blabbing blood to tell the story of his attempted murder nobody anywhere he felt certain in his own stolid soul would miss the mysterious alien who came to them from beyond the distant abyss of centuries with true scotch caution indeed even in the midst of his wrath robert monteith had never said a word to any one at brackenhurst of how his wife had left him he was too proud a man if it came to that to acknowledge what seemed to him a personal disgrace till circumstances should absolutely force such acknowledgment upon him he had glossed it over meanwhile with the servants and neighbours by saying that mrs monteith had gone away with the children for their accustomed holiday as always in august frida had actually chosen the day appointed for their seaside journey as the fittest moment for her departure with bertram so his story was received without doubt or inquiry he had bottled up his wrath in his own silent soul there was still room therefore to make all right again at home in the eyes of the worldif but frida was willing so he sat there long staring hard at his wife in speechless debate and discussing with himself whether or not to make temporary overtures of peace to her  in this matter his pride itself fought hard with his pride that is the wont of savages would it not be better now bertram ingledew had fairly disappeared for ever from their sphere to patch up a hollow truce for a time at least with frida and let all things be to the outer eye exactly as they had always been the bewildering and brainstaggering occurrences of the last halfhour indeed had struck deep and far into his hard scotch nature the knowledge that the man who had stolen his wife from him as he phrased it to himself in his curious belated mediaeval phraseology was not a real live man of flesh and blood at all but an evanescent phantom of the twentyfifth century made him all the more ready to patch up for the timebeing a nominal reconciliation his nervesfor even he had nerveswere still trembling to the core with the mystic events of that wizard morning but clearer and clearer still it dawned upon him each moment that if things were ever to be set right at all they must be set right then and there before he returned to the inn and before frida once more went back to their children to be sure it was fridas place to ask forgiveness first and make the first advances but frida made no move so after sitting there long salving his masculine vanity with the flattering thought that after all his rival was no mere man at all but a spirit an avatar a thing of pure imagination he raised his head at last and looked inquiringly towards frida  well he said slowly  frida raised her head from her hands and gazed across at him scornfully  i was thinking monteith began feeling his way with caution but with a magnanimous air that perhapsafter allfor the childrens sake frida  with a terrible look his wife rose up and fronted him her face was red as fire her heart was burning she spoke with fierce energy robert monteith she said firmly not even deigning to treat him as one who had once been her husband for the childrens sake or for my own sake or for any power on earth do you think poor empty soul after ive spent three days of my life with him id ever spend three hours again with you if you do then this is all murderer that you are you mistake my nature  and turning on her heel she moved slowly away towards the far edge of the moor with a queenly gesture  monteith followed her up a step or two she turned and waved him back he stood glued to the ground that weird sense of the supernatural once more overcoming him for some seconds he watched her without speaking a word then at last he broke out what are you going to do frida he asked almost anxiously  frida turned and glanced back at him with scornful eyes her mien was resolute the revolver with which he had shot bertram ingledew lay close by her feet among the bracken on the heath where monteith had flung it she picked it up with one hand and once more waved him backward  im going to follow him she answered solemnly in a very cold voice where you have sent him but alone by myself not here before you and she brushed him away as he tried to seize it with regal dignity  monteith abashed turned back without one word and made his way to the inn in the little village but frida walked on by herself in the opposite direction across the open moor and through the purple heath towards black despair and the troutponds at broughton  the end
