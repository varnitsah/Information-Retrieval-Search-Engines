in adventures in the field the forest and on the river and lake both in winter and summer  the boys of these stories are bright wideawake lads of today with a taste for rod and shotgun and a life in the open air  they know a good deal about fishing and how to shoot and camp life is no new thing to them  in the first volume entitled four boy hunters they organize a little club of four members and go forth for a summer vacation  they have such good times that when winter comes on they resolve to go camping again and do so as related in the second volume called guns and snowshoes  in that story they fall victims to a blizzard and spend a most remarkable christmas but of course all ends happily  in the present story summer is once more at hand and again the boy hunters venture forth this time bound for a large lake a good many miles from their home town  they have a jolly cruise on the water fall in with a very peculiar old hermit and are molested not a little by some rivals  they likewise follow up two bears and are treated to a ghost scare calculated to make anybodys hair stand on end  what the ghost proved to be i leave the pages which follow to reveal  as i have said before good hunting especially in our eastern states is fast becoming a thing of the past  in some sections only small game can be had and even then the eager hunter has to travel many miles sometimes for a shot  trusting that all boys who love the woods and waters a rod a gun and a restful camp will enjoy reading this volume i remain  your sincere friend captain ralph bonehill     chapter i  four lively boys   boys im going swimming  who is going along  count me in snap answered shep reed  swimming came from a third youth of the crowd of four  why you couldnt keep me away if you tried  ive been waiting for a swim for about eleven years  and a day broke in a small stout youth  dont forget the day whopper if you want to be really truthful  all right put in the day cheerfully assented the lad called whopper because of his propensity to exaggerate when speaking  of course youll go too giant he added questioningly  will i answered the small youth  will a duck swim and a cow eat clover  to be sure ill go  but ill have to run home first and tell mother  ill have to go home too said the lad called snap  but i can be back here in a quarter of an hour  where shall we go asked shep reed  i was thinking of going up to lanes cove answered snap dodge  lanes cove cried the smallest youth of the crowd  yes  isnt that a nice place  sure it is but dont you know that ham spinks father has bought all the land around there  what of that giant  maybe he wont let us go swimming on his propertybecause of the trouble we had with ham  oh i dont believe hell see us came from the boy called whopper why ive been swimming at the cove a thousand times and nobody ever tried to stop me  if he orders us away we can go said shep reed  i know he is just mean enough to do it  is ham home yet asked one of the boys  no but i heard he was going to come home as soon as that boarding school shut up for the summer  wonder if hell try to make more trouble  if he does hed better watch out or hell get into hot water said shep reed and then the boys separated to get their swimming outfits and tell their folks what they proposed to do  the boys lived in the town of fairview a country place located on the rocky river about ten miles above a fine sheet of water called lake cameron  the town boasted of a score of stores several churches a hotel and a neat railroad station at which during the summer months as high as ten trains stopped daily  on the outskirts of the town were a saw mill a barrel factory and several other industries  to those who have read the two former books in this series entitled four boy hunters and guns and snowshoes the lads getting ready for a swim will need no special introduction  the lad called snap was charley dodge the son of one of the most influential men of that neighborhood who was a school trustee and also part owner of the saw mill and a large summer hotel  charley was a brave and wideawake youth and was often looked up to as a leader by the others  where his nickname of snap had originated it would be hard to say although he was as full of snap and ginger as a shad is full of bones  sheppard reed always called shep for short was the son of a wellknown physician a boy who loved outdoor life and one who was as strong as he was handsome  he and snap had been chums for many years and as a consequence were occasionally known as the twins although they were no relation to each other  frank dawson had moved to fairview about three years before this tale opens  he was a merry lad with laughing eyes and his method of exaggerating had speedily gained for him the nickname of whopper  but frank was withal a truthful lad his whoppers being of the sort meant to deceive nobody  even his mother could not make him give up his extravagant speech  once when she spoke about it he gravely replied  i know it is wrong mother but i simply cant stop it  why ive made up my mind over a million times to  and then he broke down and his mother had to laugh in spite of herself  the smallest lad of the four was will caslette always called billy or giant  he was the son of a widow lady who owned a small but neat cottage on one of the side streets of the town  mrs caslette thought the world of her offspring and giant was fully worthy of the affection she bestowed upon him  although small in size he was manly in his deportment and at school he was as bright as any one in his class  about a year before the four boys had organized an outing or gun club and obtained permission to go camping for a few weeks in the vicinity of lake cameron  they reached the lake after several adventures and settled down in a comfortable camp from which however they were driven by a saw mill owner named andrew felps who ran a rival concern to that in which snaps father owned an interest  the young hunters then moved to firefly lake a mile away and there hunted and fished to their hearts content  they were frequently joined by old jed sanborn a trapper who lived in the mountains between the lakes  they had some trouble with ham spink a dudish young man of the town who established a rival camp not far off and they came close to perishing during a disastrous forest fire  the summer outing made the boys hungry for more and as soon as the winter holidays were at hand they made arrangements to go into the woods again this time taking their outfits on sleds they had with them their snowshoes and found the latter articles very useful when out after game  they fixed up a comfortable camp and rescued a halffrozen tramp  but the tramp did not appreciate what had been done for him and ran away with some of their things which brought on a lively pursuit  then the boys had more trouble with ham spink and his crony carl dudder  in the end it was discovered that ham and carl had gotten the tramp to annoy the young hunters and as a result mr spink and mr dudder had to foot some heavy bills for their sons  ham and carl were sent off to a strict boarding school where their parents hoped they would turn over a new leaf  snap and his chums came back home loaded down with game  the best outing ever declared more than one of the boys  well have to go again  yes indeed  and then and there they began to plan what to do during the next vacation  ive got an idea said snap one day during the spring  why not get a good boatone that will stand some hard knocksand go through lake cameron and firefly lake to lake narsac  jed sanborn was telling me that was a fine place for hunting and fishing and the lake is as clear as crystal  its an awfully wild place so i was told said shep  about a million snakes up there so i once heard put in whopper snakes are so thick you have to kick em out of your way to walk around  excuse me i dont want any snakes answered giant with a shiver  somebody once told me the lake was haunted said snap  but of course that wouldnt scare uswe are not afraid of ghosts are we  no came from all of the others promptly  the ghost that tries to scare me will get his ear pinched added giant and said this so drolly that all had to laugh  one thing is sure said shep after a pause with fish game snakes and ghosts wed certainly find enough to interest us eh  is the lake very deep asked giant  jed sanborn told me that you cant touch bottom in some places answered snap  the lake lies right between three tall mountains he said we might have to carry our boat around some of the rocks in the stream leading to it  well we can do that toproviding the boat isnt too heavy  this talk led to many others and in the end it was decided that the four boys should start on the trip the week following the fourth of july  then commenced active preparations  guns were cleaned camping outfits overhauled and the lads looked around for just the right boat in which to make the trip  through mr dodge a fine strong craft was obtained and then the lads waited impatiently for the day to come when they should begin the outing on the lake  they anticipated some adventures but did not dream of the curious happenings in store for them     chapter ii  swimming and what followed   lanes cove was situated almost a mile from fairview but the four boys did not think anything of walking that distance  all were good pedestrians for their numerous outings had hardened their muscles and given them good lung power  even little giant trudged along as swiftly as the rest and even suggested a race when they came in sight of the spot selected by snap for the afternoons fun  no dont runyoull get overheated said whopper  when i run i sweat like a house afire  sweating like a house afire is good murmured giant with a grin  now if you had only said sweat like a stone or a piece of iron all of us would have known what you meant  as it is and then he stopped and ducked to escape the piece of dried mud whopper playfully shied at him  the cove reached the boys speedily found a spot that suited them it was at a point where some overhanging bushes and trees sheltered a strip of sandy shore  at one point a rock ran out into the river making an excellent place from which to dive  the lads hustled into the bushes and in a very few minutes snap appeared in his bathing outfit and was followed by shep  beat you in cried the doctors son but hardly had he spoken when snap made a leap and landed into the river with a loud splash shep came after him and both disappeared under the surface to come up a second later thrashing around wildly  whew  it isnt so warm as i thought ejaculated shep  no turkish bath about this and he gave a slight shiver  youll soon get used to it replied snap  its always the first plunge that takes the breath out of a fellow  giant came in next diving from the rock  whopper followed more slowly putting in first one foot and then the other  moses in the bulrushes he gasped  say this water is about half ice isnt it  and he drew back again  whopper you know better than to go in that way remonstrated snap wet your face and then go in head firstits the only right way if you go in by inches youll gasp fit to turn your liver over  very gingerly whopper wet his face  as the water ran down his backbone he let out another yell  dont know as ill go in he observed  i thought it would be much warmer  oh yes come in urged snap  in the meantime shep had come to shore and crawled out behind some bushes  softly he crept up behind whopper  then came a sudden shove and over went frank with a loud yell and a splash that sent the spray in all directions  before he came up shep was out of sight behind a tree  say whwho spluttered whopper as he came up and gazed around half angrily  then he caught sight of a shoulder back of the tree  come out of that and let me give you something to remember me by and he struck out for shore  but shep had no intention of being caught and as whopper came out he sprang in  then frank came after him and a race ensued in which snap and giant joined  the rapid swimming warmed all the boys and then they declared the water just ok as snap expressed it  whopper watched his chance to get even with shep and when the other was not looking dove down and caught the doctors son by the foot  shep was just shouting to giant and had his mouth wide open and as a consequence swallowed a lot of water  when he and whopper came up they indulged in a splashing contest lasting several minutes  whats the matter with swimming across the river suggested snap presently  its a pretty good distance answered giant  and you must remember the current is rather swift  ill go snap said shep who was always ready to follow his twin  i dont think ill try it today put in whopper  ill stay on this side with giant  if you find anything good to eat over there bring it along he added  might find some berries said snap  at this point the river from the outer edge of the cove was about a hundred yards wide  the boys had frequently swum across so snaps proposal to go over was nothing unusual  side by side the boys started out and took their time  they did not attempt to stem the current but allowed it to carry them down the river for several hundred feet  they landed where there was an old orchard backed up by a large strawberry patch  no apples ripe around here said snap as he and his chum walked up the river bank to a point opposite where they had left giant and whopper  let us go over to the strawberry patch suggested shep  we may find some strawberries worth eating  as nobody was in sight the proposition was readily accepted and the boys picked their way carefully along for they had no desire to hurt their bare feet  reaching the patch they began a hunt and soon discovered a corner where the berries were thick and sweet  say this is prime observed the doctors son smacking his lips this would suit giant and whopper to a t  wonder if we can carry any over to them shep  i dont see why not  a little water wont hurt them  in fact they ought to be washed they are that full of sand  who owns this patch  old tom ashenbury  well we had better keep out of his sight or hell be after us with his gun  dont you remember how he chased us once when we were walking through his peach orchard  indeed i do  but we are doing little harm here  in a few days all these berries will be rotten  i guess he has given up picking them  in moving around the boys had found a couple of old berry baskets and these they now proceeded to fill  the task was about half completed when snap suddenly straightened up  what was that he asked  what demanded his chum  i thought i heard a cry from across the river  both listened but nothing came to their ears  you must have been mistaken said the doctors son and resumed his work of picking strawberries  no use of picking more said snap a few minutes later  well be lucky to get over with these  perhaps well drop half of them trying to swim  hi look there shouted his companion and pointed across the field in the direction of the river  a flock of sheep had suddenly appeared some fifteen or twenty in number  at the head was a large ram who gazed in wonder at the two boys in their bathing outfits  say that ram means business ejaculated snap an instant later we had better clear out of here  come on im willing responded the doctors son and started for the stream carrying the basket of strawberries in one hand  let us go up the stream went on snap  no use of getting too close to him  i dont like his looks  both boys had good cause to feel alarmed for the ram was coming toward them on a trot  once or twice he stopped and pawed the ground but then he came on and they could see he meant to attack them  hes coming for us  can we reach the river  we must reach it  then the two boys broke into a run giving no further heed to the fact that the ground was uneven and that their feet were bare  they had heard stories of vicious rams many times and knew that only the year before a girl had been almost mauled to death by such an animal  they had still fifty yards to cover when snap went into a hole and pitched headlong  shep was directly behind him and over he went on top of his chum crushing one of the baskets of strawberries between them  the other basket was scattered in all directions over the ground  there go our berries grumbled snap  too bad  get up roared shep scrambling to his feet  here comes the ram and hes as wild as they make em  he caught his chum by the arm and both tried to go on  but snaps ankle had received a bad wrench and he was forced to limp  the boys had to pass a low shed used occasionally for the storage of fruit and baskets  as they reached this the ram came up and lowered his head  jump for the shed yelled shep and caught hold of the roof of the structure  he scrambled to the top and gave his chum a hand  then on came the ram and hit the side of the frail building a resounding whack with his head  snap escaped by less than a foot and then both boys stood upright on the top of the shed wondering what they had best do next     chapter iii  a trick that failed   we are in a pickle snap  it certainly looks like it shep  how long do you suppose that ram is going to keep us here  i dont knowmaybe youd better ask him  i wouldnt feel quite so bad if i had on my regular clothing and my shoes  but with this thin outfit  here he comes again was the cry and crash  the head of the ram struck the shed once more causing it to tremble greatly  i really think hes trying to knock the old thing down was the comment of the doctors son  the boys tried to look across the river but could not because of a heavy clump of bushes growing between the shed and the waters edge they heard a distant cry and wondered what it meant  i believe that is giant and whopper calling said snap  more than likely they are tired of waiting for us  maybe they are dressing  a few of the sheep had come up and were gazing curiously at the boys and the ram  then the ram commenced to walk around the shed viewing it speculatively from all sides  looks like a warrior doesnt he said shep  wish i had a brickbat to throw at him  heres a short board cried snap and tore off a piece that was partly loose  i wish i could reach him with this  wait ill coax him over answered the doctors son and put down a leg over the edge of the roof  at once the ram charged and as he did this snap threw the board at him hitting him in the side this so surprised the animal that he turned and ran away a distance of several rods  now is our chance  come yelled snap and leaped from the roof of the shed on the river side  his chum followed and once again the pair put for the stream with all speed  they kept out of sight of the ram as much as possible and he did not see them until they were almost at the waters edge  before he could come up they dove into the stream and swam out several yards  say thats what i call a narrow shave cried shep when he and his chum realized that the danger was over  i want nothing more to do with that ram  its a pity we lost the strawberries returned snap  however it cant be helped  the two boys were soon well out in the river and they looked anxiously over to the cove  nothing was to be seen of giant and whopper  they must be behind the bushes dressing said snap  hello he yelled  hello  where are you  no answer was returned and the doctors son joined in the cry  then both boys pulled a more hasty stroke and soon got to a point where they could wade ashore  it cant be possible they went home said snap as he gazed around in perplexity  well soon see was the answer and the doctors son ran to the bushes where the clothing had been left  well i never he cried  why all the clothing is gone  yes their clothing and ours too  do you think theyve played a trick on us  no they wouldnt be so mean  but where are they and where is our clothing  i dont know  in deep perplexity the two chums looked around that vicinity  no trace of giant or whopper was to be found and the only article of wearing apparel they could discover was a blueandwhite sock  thats giants sock said snap  and that proves something is wrong  he wouldnt go away and leave his own sock behind  true enough snap but what do you think happened  i dont know unless they caught somebody in the act of running off with our duds and ran after them  let us call again  this they did using the full power of their lungs  soon an answering cry came back and whopper appeared on the river bank above them followed by giant  each carried a bundle of clothing under his arm and some shoes in his hand  well what does this mean demanded the doctors son as the others drew closer  youre fine fellows to stay away so long grumbled giant  we called to you about a million times that we wanted help put in whopper  well weve had our troubles of our own answered snap  a big angry ram came after us and held us prisoners for awhile  but what happened here  did somebody run away with our outfits  yes and we had a great time getting them again answered whopper  we had to run after the chaps barefooted came from giant just look at my feet and he showed how they had been cut and scratched  who were they demanded the doctors son  we dont know exactly but weve got our suspicions answered the small boy  there were two of them said whopper  both goodsized fellows we didnt hear them until they had all the clothes in their arms and were running away  as soon as they heard us coming both threw their coats up over their heads so we wouldnt recognize them they would have gotten away sure only giant yelled that he would fire a pistol at them if they didnt stop and then they got scared and dropped the clothing in a ditch  and who do you think they were asked snap  ham spink and carl dudder  why they arent home from boarding school yet cried shep  i dont care thats what i think said giant sturdily  i know just how those fellows look and walk  of course i didnt see their faces but i am pretty sure they were ham and carl  they may have gotten home during the last day or two said snap slowly and it would be just like them to lay around waiting to play some mean trick on us  if they had gotten off with our clothing wed have been in a fine pickle truly  thats rightworse than with the ram answered the doctors son and then he and snap told of what had occurred on the other side of the river  too bad you lost those strawberries sighed whopper  i like strawberries so much i could eat about  a million platesful finished snap with a grin  no i was going to say a spoonful or two said whopper and then snap groaned  the boys found two socks a collar and a necktie missing and a long search around failed to bring the articles to light  one of the undershirts had been knotted up tightly and shep had to chaw on the beef as boys call it to get the knots untied  id like to know if it really was ham and carl he growled  if it was ill fix them for this new trick of theirs  how were they dressed asked snap  each wore a brown suit kind of yellow brown answered whopper id know em out of a million  well lay for them whopper  having donned their clothing the four boys started back for town to get to the road they had to cross a wide pasture and when they were in the middle of this they saw a man approaching  the man carried a heavy cane which he shook at them  hello its mr spink cried snap  come to warn us away i suppose grumbled the doctors son  shall i tell him about what was done to our clothing  no answered whopper  we are not certain it was ham and carl  mr spink was a tall overbearing man who dressed almost as loudly as did his son  he strode up to the four lads with a dark look on his face and this look grew even more resentful when he recognized them  ha so you are going to come here in spite of my warnings eh he said harshly  you havent warned us or anything mr spink answered snap calmly  cant you read  doesnt the sign say all trespassing forbidden that is plain english isnt it  i havent seen any sign said shep  because you didnt want to see it young man  we have only been down to the cove swimming put in giant  this land is mine now and i want you boys to keep off of it exclaimed mr spink hotly  if i catch you on it again ill have you arrested  well get off as soon as we can answered snap  and then he added suddenly is ham home  you mean my son hamilton i presume  yes he is home  what do you want of him  nothing just now  but we may want something later answered snap and started again for the road his chums following     chapter iv  the story of a ghost   i say what do you want of my son hamilton repeated mr spink coming after the boys with a look of curiosity on his face  we want to see him replied snap after a look at his chums  what about  we think he played us a mean trick put in whopper as snap paused  oh i thought that affair was a thing of the past said mr spink loftily  my son was not to blame so much as that tramp the tramp told a string of falsehoods  we dont mean that mr spink spoke up giant  we mean a trick ham and his friend carl dudder played on us this afternoon  humph  you ahemyou must be mistaken  if we are we wont say anything said whopper  but if he did play the trick  well get square with him for it finished shep  what are you talking about anyway demanded the rich man  i dont see why you cant leave my son alone  we willif hell leave us alone said snap  what do you accuse him of  while we were swimming two fellows came up took our clothes and tried to run away with them came from giant  we are pretty sure the fellows were ham and carl  when we went after them they dropped the clothes in a hurry  two socks a collar and a necktie are missing  yes and my undershirt was full of knots grumbled the doctors son just wait till i catch the fellows who did thatill show em  humph is that all growled mr spink  i imagine you are only making up this tale to get my son into difficultiesjust because you know i will not permit you to come here to swim now clear out and be quick about itand dont ever come here again and having thus delivered himself he shook his heavy cane at them turned on his heel and walked away  hes a gentleman i must say declared snap when mr spink was out of hearing  a person can easily see where ham gets his arrogant ways  yes and hell stick up for ham first last and all the time added whopper  as the boys walked home they discussed the situation from several points of view  reaching the street leading to the railroad depot they came in sight of a familiar figure ahead of them  it was the old hunter jed sanborn and he carried a gun in one hand and a fishing rod in the other while a basket was slung over his shoulder by a broad strap  hello jed sang out snap and ran forward to stop the man  why boys how are ye said the old hunter turning around and halting  ready to go on your summer trip and he smiled broadly  not yet answered shep  but we are going out after the fourth of july  so i heard  well i hope ye have as good a time as ye had last summer an last winter  we want to know something about lake narsac came from whopper ive heard there were about a million snakes up there and all big fellows too  is that true  o course it is answered jed sanborn with a grin  snakes is twenty to fifty feet long and so thick ye have to wade through em up to your knees  ha ha and he commenced to laugh  i got ahead of ye thet time didnt i whopper  but tell us the truth insisted giant  were thinking of camping up there and of course we wont want to go if there is any real danger  well to tell the plain everyday truth boys i dont allow as how there is any more reptiles up to lake narsac nor there be around lake firefly an in the mountains whar i hang out  narsac may have a few more rattlers an thems the wust kindyou know thet as well as i do  the wust thing i know about lake narsac is the ghost up thar  is there really and truly a ghost queried the doctors son of course i dont believe in them he added hastily  if ye dont believe in em why do ye ask about em demanded the old hunter rather indignantly  oh well and shep could not finish  did you ever see the ghost asked snap  i sure did my boy  when cried whopper  what did it look like demanded giant  i see the ghost less nor a month agowhen i was up to lake narsac after fish  it was a foggy morning an i was fishing from a little island near the upper end o the lake  all to once i heard a strange sound like somebody was moanin  i sat up an listened an i looked around  and what did you see asked giant excitedly  didnt see nuthing just then  soon the moanin died out an i thought i must have made a mistake an i went on fishin agin then come that strange moanin once more an it made me shiver for i was in a mighty lonely spot  all to once something cried out hes dead  hes dead i looked around but i couldnt see a soul  who is thar i called  then i heard a strange whistle an a rustlin in the bushes  a minute later i saw a figure in bright yellow standin out before me on the lake  it seemed to move right over the water in the fog an in less than a minute it was gone  what was it asked snap and his voice trembled a little  i dunno snap  it looked like a real old man with clawlike hands  i called out to him but he didnt answer and when he seemed to be lost like in a smoke i was scared an i dont deny it  just then i felt a big tug on my line an i pulled in an found i had hooked a water snake  thet settled me an i came down to firefly lake an to hum quick as i could git thar  what do you think it was asked whopper  i cant for the life o me tell  are you sure you heard that voice or was that imagination asked snap  it wasnt no imagination whatsoever answered the old hunter positively  i heard thet voice jest as plain as i can hear yourn an it come right out o the sky too  that is certainly queer mused snap  you say the ghost was yellow  it was  i thought most ghosts were white put in the doctors son  was it a man asked frank  if it was how did he walk on the water demanded jed sanborn oh it was a sure ghost no two ways on it  and the old hunter shook his head positively  are there any houses near the lake questioned giant  not a house within two or three miles  it is the wildest place you ever visited answered jed sanborn  hunters dont go there much on account of the rough rocks in the stream flowing into narsac  if you take a boat you may have to tote it a good bitan it aint much use to go up there less youve got a boat because you cant travel much along the shoretoo many thorn bushes  after that the old hunter told them all he knew about lake narsac he said the lake and its surroundings were owned by the estate of a new england millionaire who had died four years before in settling the estate the heirs had gone to law and the rightful possession of the sheet of water with the mountains around it was still in dispute  one thing is sartin said the old hunter  if ye go up thar ye wont have no andrew felps chasin ye awayas was the case up to lake cameron  no but we may have the ghost chasing us answered giant  say maybe we had better go somewhere else suggested whopper hesitatingly  whopper are you afraid of ghosts demanded snap  nno but ierid like to go somewhere where we wouldnt be bothered by anything  i am going to lake narsac ghosts or no ghosts cried the doctors son  so am i added snap promptly  if whopper wants to stay behind  who said anything about staying behind demanded whopper  if you go so will i even if there are a million ghosts up there  i dont believe in ghosts came from little giant  its some humbug thats what it is  maybe maybe answered jed sanborn  but if you hear that voice and see that yellow thingwell i reckon your hair will stick up on end jest as mine did     chapter v  a fourth of july celebration   on the following monday snap and shep were walking down the main street of fairview when they heard a cry and saw giant beckoning to them from the postoffice steps  whats up asked snap as he came up to the small youth  ham spink and carl dudder just went in to mail some letters said giant  what of that  whopper went in after them  whopper and i are now sure it was ham and carl who tried to steal our clothing the day we went swimming  how do you know that asked the doctors son  by the way they are dressed  they have the same yellowbrown suits on they wore that day  giant had scarcely spoken when whopper came out  his face showed that he was angry  i told you they did it he said to giant  then seeing the others he explained  i accused them of it and they admitted taking the clothes they said it was nothing but a little joke and they laughed at me  then when i said they could pay for the missing things they told me to clear out or theyd have me locked up for trespassing on mr spinks land  thats like ham answered snap  i wish we could pay them off good went on whopper  just then ham spink and carl dudder came out of the postoffice snap and the others were standing behind some boxes of goods and the dude and his chum did not at once see them  well have a celebration with those fireworks when they come ham was saying  well show fairview a great sight  thats right returned carl dudder  well put them in my fathers barn until we want to use them  then both boys caught sight of snap and the others and broke off their talk  they wanted to brush past without speaking but snap and shep blocked the way  we want to talk to you said snap  we have nothing to say cried ham haughtily  get out of my way and he tried to brush past again  ham spink i want to say just one thing answered snap  i think you are as mean as you ever were and i for one am going to pay you back for what you did the day we went swimming  oh give us a rest muttered the dudish youth and went on and carl dudder followed sticking his tongue in his cheek as he passed  say shall we pitch into them whispered whopper  we can knock them into the middle of next month  nowaitive just thought of something interposed snap  let them go and come with me  he led the way to a safe distance and then turned to whopper  did you hear them speak of some fireworks  sure  did they say anything about the fireworks in the post office  why yes  but what has that got to do with  what did they say whopper  why it seems ham and carl and some other fellowsthe same crowd that has been against us for so longhave chipped in and ordered some fireworks from the city  they are going to set the fireworks off in front of the dudder house on fourth of july night  the spink family and some others are to be there  ham and carl are boasting what a fine celebration it is to be  then i know what im going to do said snap  what came from all of the others  they took our clothingwhy cant we take the fireworks  whoop  just the cheese ejaculated whopper  we can set them off in the public square  where the whole community can see them added giant  and we can return the remains after they are shot off came from the doctors son  the matter was talked over for a half hour  all of the boys knew it was not just right to appropriate the fireworks but they were dead sore on ham and carl and knew no other way to get square  the boys had made only a few preparations for the fourth for nearly all of their spending money had been used up in buying things for the proposed outing  they had some firecrackers and some blank cartridges for their pistols and that was all  independence day dawned bright and clear and throughout the town of fairview there was the usual amount of noise  during the morning snap heard from another lad how ham and carl were boasting of their fireworks  finest fireworks the town ever saw ham had said  all the boys were invited to hang on the dudder fence and see them set off that evening at nine oclock  now is the time for us to do something said snap to his chums a little later  the evening before they had visited the dudder barn but had failed to locate the fireworks  thats right said giant  the fireworks are there nowi saw carl and ham bringing them from the express office  with caution the four boys walked down a side street which connected by an alleyway with the dudder barn  nobody was in sight and they slipped into the barn with ease  in a corner on the floor they saw a long flat box marked fireworks  with care  we mustnt take them all said shep  we must leave a top rowjust to fool em  the others understood and went to work with care  in a very few minutes they had most of the fireworks pinwheels rockets roman candles flower pots and othersin their possession then they stuffed hay in the bottom of the box and on the top placed two pinwheels and three small roman candles  im afraid theyll suspect us if we set these off said snap when he and his chums were at a safe distance  what if they do demanded the doctors son  if they say anything we can yell stolen clothes at them  the boys were afraid ham and carl would attempt to sort out the fireworks before the time to set them off but this fear proved groundless for ham and carl were busy showing off two silverplated pistols they had purchased  they were firing at a target set up near hams house but they failed to hit the bullseye more than once in a dozen shots  no wonder they cant bring down any game observed giant when he heard of this  i could do almost as good as that with my eyes shut  in a quiet way word was passed around to the juvenile element of fairview that there would be something doing at the public square directly it was dark  secretly a notice was posted up that the swimmer company would give a free exhibition of carlham fireworks several wanted to know who the swimmer company were and what carlham fireworks were like but no answer could be had to these queries  at exactly halfpast seven that evening there was the flare of a rocket in the public square followed by the discharge of several roman candles  folks came running from all directions to learn who might be giving the exhibition  they saw a truly marvelous sight  four men or boys were there dressed in fantastic suits and wearing old gloves and big pointedtop hats  each had a mask over his face so that it was utterly impossible to tell who he was  boom bang sizz went the fireworks being set off by all four of the persons at once  rockets flew high in the sky leaving a golden train behind them and roman candles let out balls of various colors while on the ground flower pots spouted forth in great beauty and pinwheels whizzed from several trees and hitchingposts  this is great cried several  a bangup exhibition added another  never saw a finer display did you put in an old man  and all free too he continued greatly pleased  carl and ham could not resist the temptation to see what was going on and came running to the square leaving their box in the barn they were full of envy but went through the crowd boasting that their own display would be much better  at last everything was set off but three large rockets  these were left in charge of one of the masked figures while the other three figures suddenly disappeared in the darkness following a pinwheel flare  the three figures took with them what could be found of the burntout roman candles and other things  with one grand sizz the three rockets went up into the air simultaneously  the crowd gazed in admiration at the sight  then as the sky grew dark they looked out on the square for the last of the masked figures  it had disappeared     chapter vi  preparing for the grand outing   less than quarter of an hour after the celebration at the public square snap and his three chums met at whoppers back gate  they were minus their tall hats and gloves but still wore a portion of their grotesque outfits  hurry up said whopper and led the way to a carriage house here with great rapidity the four youths stripped off the odd suits and donned their regular garments  then they hid the other things in an outoftheway corner  did you place the burntout fireworks in the box asked shep who had been left at the square to set off the three rockets  we did answered snap  hurry up we want to see the rest of the fun cried giant and set off on a dogtrot in the direction of the dudder mansion  when the four boys reached that vicinity they found quite a crowd collected  more people were coming from the public square  the piazza of the dudder homestead was illuminated with chinese lanterns and there sat mr and mrs spink the dudder family and a dozen specially invited guests  carl isnt it about time you began to set off those fireworks asked mr dudder as his son came up the steps  ham and i are going to get them out right away answered carl  who set off the fireworks at the square questioned mrs spink  i dont know  were they nice asked mrs dudder  not near as nice as those we are going to show returned ham  hurry up wid dem fireworks shouted an urchin hanging on the fence  you get off that fence or you wont see anything cried carl  bring on the fireworks shouted several  we are going to have a regular programme announced carl standing on a garden bench  first there will be a bouquet of four rockets then will follow two large roman candles six varicolored pinwheels two large and four small flower pots one living picture of george washington two aerial bombs four golden clusters one living serpent two mines and a whole lot of other things too numerous to mention  go on with the show shouted a man outside  we dont want to listen to no speech  come let us get the box said ham and then he and carl hurried down to the barn where they found the flat box  much to their surprise it was bound around and around with some old telegraph wire  snap and his chums had wanted to nail the box up but had been afraid of the noise  somebodys been playing a joke on us growled ham  never mind well soon have the wire off answered his crony let us take the box outside  they lifted the box and carried it out into the yard  there a number of visitors gathered around to watch proceedings two holding up lanterns to illuminate the scene  it took several minutes to take the wire from the box  then the cover was wrenched off  here we are cried carl and took up the top layer of fireworks let us stack them against that bench ham  look screamed ham and pulled up a handful of straw in which the fireworks had been packed  what does this mean  as he spoke he held up two halfburnt pasteboard tubesthe remains of two roman candles  the burntout remains of several pinwheels followed  carl dove into the box and withdrew his hands covered with soot and holding several burntout flower pots and the frame upon which had once been fastened the living picture of our first president  what does this mean  somebody has been at this box  the fireworks have all been shot off  hurry up with that display came from the fence  dont keep us waiting all night  thought you was going to show us something better than that show at the square piped in a small boy  we have been swindled groaned ham  somebody has tricked us gasped carl  oh this is dreadful  whats the matter boys asked mr dudden coming up followed by mr spink  the box is full ofof rubbish father  somebody set off the things and put them back burnt up added ham  after that there was considerable excitement  the box was overturned and out tumbled the remains of the square celebration  with the articles came a small basket wrapped in a brown paper and sealed up  ham tore the covering from the basket and out droppedtwo lemons  on one was a bit of paper labeled ham and on the other a paper marked carl  oh just let me catch the fellow who played this trick roared ham dancing around in his rage  wont i just fix him  wont i though  aint you going to set off them fireworks called a boy from the fence  dont believe theyve got any to set off said another  its a shame to keep us waiting here put in a third  you shut up all of you cried carl who was as angry as ham well set off the fireworks when we choose  oh if this isnt the limit he murmured  with no fireworks worth mentioning the proposed celebration could not come off and everybody was bitterly disappointed  the crowd outside the fence began to jeer and some small boys threw lumps of soft mud at ham and carl  then mr dudder got angry and ordered everybody off and took his guests into the mansion  ham and carl were so chagrined they knew not what to do  we must find out who did this said ham  maybe it was snap dodge and his crowd suggested carl  it would be just like them  if they are guiltyill fix them went on ham bitterly they had no business to touch our fireworks  just think what they cost us  and it made us the laughingstock of the whole town added carl sourly  ive got an ideathat celebration at the squaremaybe they held it with our fireworks  what  say it must be so  oh what fools we were  of course it was them  i see it all nowcarlham fireworks indeed thats carl and ham as plain as day  yes and the swimmer company is plain enough too  they did this to get even for taking their clothes away that day  we cant say they stole the fireworks  if we do they may say we stole their clothes  we wont say anythingbut let us get square the first chance we get and so it was decided  it was several days before ham and carl heard the last of the grand celebration they had reported they would give  with the fun of independence day at an end snap and his chums turned their attention once more to the matter of the summer outing they realized that a trip to lake narsac would be quite different from one only as far as lake cameron or firefly lake  the two latter resorts were close to civilization while narsac lake was a wild spot seldom visited by the regular run of sportsmen to get to the lake would be quite a task in itself and whatever would be needed for the trip must be procured at home or at one of the other lakes  and while they must take all needed articles along they must make their boat load as light as possible  doctor reed made them a present of something which was much to their liking  this was a nest of aluminum cooking utensils including a pepper and salt box and a match safe  this kit weighed very little and was exceedingly handy  as mr dodge had procured for them a suitable boat and the doctor the cooking things mr dawson said he would present them with a new tent of light but strong and waterproof material  he also got for them a rubber cloth to be spread over their things when it rained  my mother is going to supply us with the eatables said giant she told me to get the list and she would have them all ready the day we are to start  and then the list was made out including bacon beans flour salt and pepper sugar and many other necessities the boys also got a liberal supply of powder and shot for their guns some cartridges for the rifle and some fishing hooks and lines  everything was stored away in the boathouse on the river which was locked up tightly so that nobody might carry off their belongings     chapter vii  at the boathouse   i wonder if ham and carl will attempt to get at our outfit said shep the evening before the start was to be made  well we mustnt forget that they blew up the old boathouse before answered snap  of course they may be afraid to try on the same thingtheyd know theyd be in danger of arrest  let us go down and take a look at the things put in whopper  i wouldnt want to have anything happen to the outfit for a million dollars  the three boys walked in the direction of the building where the things were stored  giant was not with themhe having been detained at home to do some work for his mother  apparently the outfit was as it had been left and the three boys breathed a sigh of relief  having overhauled the things carefully they prepared to lock up once more when snap noticed a small boy named joe bright hanging around  well joe whats doing he questioned  nuthin answered joe  say are you fellows going on a trip to lake narsac  yes  aint you afraid of the hobgoblins up there  not particularly  my uncle was up there once and the hobgoblins took his things away from him  what did they take asked whopper  took his coat which he had hung on a tree while he was fishing and took his basket of fish too  say he was scared when he saw that thing i can tell you  he wouldnt go there again  did he see the ghost asked shep  no he didnt see anything but he heard it moan and groan and heard it say something about being cold and hungry  we are not afraid said snap as bravely as he could  we are going to keep our eyes peeled for that ghost and if it shows itself there will be some shooting done  by the way joe how long have you been around here  two or three hours  i didnt have nuthin to do and i like the water  have you seen anybody around this building  yes two fellows were here but they went away when they saw me  who were they asked the doctors son  one of em was ham spink and the other was that chap who is always with him  carl dudder  i guess thats his namethe chap who was going to give the fireworks celebration  humph muttered snap  what did they do  walked around the building several times and peeped in the windows one of em tried the back door but just then the other fellow saw me and he gave a little whistle  then both of em walked away pretty quick  the rascals cried whopper  ill bet a sour apple against a gooseberry they wanted to spoil our outfit  sure they did answered snap  ill tell you what i think said shep after the boys had talked the matter over for several minutes  i think somebody ought to stay here tonight and watch this outfit  for all we know they may come back  there is an old cot in the boathousea fellow might sleep on that suggested whopper  then that is what i am going to doif my folks will let me answered the doctors son  youll be lonely said snap  maybe id  better stay with you if ham and carl did come back you couldnt manage them alone  i could if i had a shotgun  oh you wouldnt want to shoot anybody snap  no but i could scare em off  ive got an idea cried whopper  why not fix it so as to give them a warm receptionif they do come and then he explained what he meant  in the end it was decided that snap and shep should remain at the boathouse and whopper ran off to tell their folks and to get a few things  as the boys were used to outings the youths parents thought little of their staying away that night and only sent word back that they should keep out of mischief  well keep out if we are left alone said the doctors son grimly  whopper had brought with him an old tin pail containing some hot water and half a pound of flour  this was stirred up into a thick flour paste and to give it the proper flavor as snap suggested they broke into the mixture two ancient eggs which one of the party had picked up  joe bright had been sent away with instructions to say nothing about what was going on at the boathouse and soon whopper followed him  then snap and shep went into the building and locked the door behind them  the structure was a onestory affair with a small loft overhead for the storage of extra oars and odds and ends of boat lumber up into the loft went the two boys and opened the tiny window at either endthus letting in some needed fresh air  then they took the ranksmelling flour paste and poured half of the stuff into an old paint can that was handy  let us take turns at resting suggested snap and so it was arranged  it was a calm clear night and before long the town was wrapped in slumber and only the occasional bark of a dog or yowl of a cat broke the stillness  out on the river nothing was stirring  it was after midnight and snap had almost reached the conclusion that the alarm had been a false one when looking from one of the little windows he saw two figures approaching the boathouse  the two boys or men had their coat collars turned up and their soft hats pulled well down over their foreheads  making no noise snap aroused shep who was sound asleep on the cot  what is it demanded the doctors son  they are coming  hush or they may hear you  silently the two boys crawled to the small window facing the town the two figures outside were now close by and snap and shep felt sure they were ham and carl  anybody around came the question in a whisper  i dont see anybody  we dont want to get caught at this  oh dont get chickenhearted carl  humph  please remember what happened last winter ham  hush  dont speak my name please  well then dont speak mine  i didnt  yes you did  i did not i say  come on  how are you going to get in  you said you knew of a way  i am certain the doors and windows are all tight  just you follow me and ill show you a nice little trick  but where do you want me to follow you to insisted carl dudder  under the boathouse  under it  yes  here is a place where we can crawl under very easily  yes but what are you going to do after you are under the building  get inside  is there a trap door  no but i know where a couple of boards are loose in the flooring and we can shove them up easily  oh  all right go ahead and ill follow  a moment later ham spink let himself down in a little hole beside the boathouse  here his feet were close to the water but he supported himself on a cross rail nailed from one section of the spiling to another  carl dudder followed him and both moved cautiously forward to the front end of the building  once ham slipped and a slight splash followed  whats that cried carl in alarm for he was decidedly nervous  my foot slipped thats all was the answer  is it deep under here  not over four or five feet  where are those loose boards  right here  now take hold of that end and well soon have them up and be inside the building answered ham     chapter viii  how two prowlers were treated   while ham and carl were moving around under the boathouse shep and snap were not idle  the doctors son on awakening had wanted to throw the flour paste out of the window at the midnight prowlers but snap thought of another plan  come on below and wait until they shove up the flooring he whispered  the doctors son understood and with caution so as not to make any noise the two chums came down out of the tiny loft bringing with them the pail and the tin can of awfulsmelling flour paste  it was absolutely dark below but they could plainly hear ham and carl working on the loose boards of the floor near the river end of the boathouse  thither they made their way snap with the pail and shep with the can both ready for action  slowly one board was lifted and pushed aside and a second followed then two heads appeared in the gloom  robbers cried snap  burglars yelled the doctors son  shoot them  dont let them get away alive  then with a vigorous throw snap landed his pail of stuff full upon the head of ham spink  splosh it struck the dudish youth squarely in the face and ear  another splosh followed and carl dudder was likewise decorated  hi wow spluttered ham  ioh what a smell  oh my eye groaned carl  phew whats this  were discovered  whats this they threw on us  oh did you ever smell such stuff  robbers thieves yelled snap and shep  shoot them  give them a dose of buckshot  they are going to shoot us screamed carl dudder and dodged down  then he lost his footing on the wet and slippery rails clutched at ham to save himself and both went down with a loud splash into the dirty water under the boathouse  there they go cried shep  let us scare them some more whispered snap  pretend you dont recognize them  quickly a lantern was lit and held over the opening in the floor down below two dark forms covered with mud and flour paste could be seen clutching at the slippery braces of the spiling  snap and shep could scarcely keep from roaring  there they are  get the gun yelled the doctors son  two dangerous burglars cried snap  wonder where they came from  wwe arare not burglars spluttered carl  we are  dodont shshoot wailed ham spink  we dididnt mean  bang went the shotgun snap had picked up  he fired at the corner of the building into a mass of rubbish  a piercing yell of terror came up from below and down dropped ham and carl into the water once more  they were too afraid to come up under the boathouse again and so struck out for the river bank some distance away  they are going away called out shep  they are two desperate burglars  give them another shot  perhaps they have been robbing some stores called out snap then he discharged the shotgun once more and down ducked ham and carl again yelling wildly in their fright  they swam with energy and soon reached the shelter of another boathouse  here they crawled from the water and took to their legs with all the speed at their command  both were frightened nearly out of their wits and for the time being paid no attention to the foulsmelling paste and mud that covered them  theythey thought we were thithieves panted carl after he and his crony had covered several blocks  yes and we came near being shot dead added ham  i didnt know they were going to stay there tonight  neither did i  those shots will wake up the whole town  yes and we must get out of sight  phew what a smell  they dumped something down on us  must have been rotten eggs  what are we going to do  i dont knowgo home i guess  i cant go home looking this way  youll have to go  well its lucky they didnt recognize us  thats true  but this suit is about ruined  so is mine  and we didnt hurt their outfit at all  never mind well get square with them another time  after that carl and ham separated and each lost no time in sneaking home and washing up and trying to clean his garments  they did not dare to tell their parents of what had occurred and so had to suffer in silence  the shots from the gun aroused some folks living near the river front and several men came down to the boathouse to learn what was the matter  two fellows tried to get in here but we scared them away said snap  who were they asked one man  two fellows dressed in dark suits and with slouch hats  did you hit them  no we only fired to scare them off  where did they go  ran back of dicksons boathouse answered the doctors son  a brief search was made but the prowlers of course were not located  then the men went home and snap and shep settled down to make themselves comfortable for the rest of the night  ham and carl wont forget that reception in a hurry remarked the doctors son and indulged in a laugh in which his chum joined  the rest of the night passed without anything unusual happening early in the morning whopper and giant appeared and were told of what had occurred  served em right cried giant  oh i wish i had seen them he added with a broad grin  i dont think theyll try any such game again in a thousand years said whopper  make it a million whopper added the doctors son  whopper and giant had had breakfast and said goodbye to their folks and now snap and shep went off to get something to eat  by nine oclock they returned and said they were ready for the start the others already had the boat out and the outfit properly stored on board  all ready called out snap who was looked upon as the leader of the club  all ready came from the others  sure we havent left anything behindsalt mustard vinegar or canned softsoap  maybe whoppers left his shaving outfit behind suggested giant  humph muttered the youth mentioned be sure and take giants hobby horse with you  and then there was a general laugh in the midst of which snap shoved off from the boathouse dock  it was arranged that shep and whopper should row for the first few miles and then be relieved by snap and giant  a number of boys had come down to the dock to see them off  there was a general shouting  hope you have a good time  be sure and bring back plenty of game  say if you see that ghost up to lake narsac give him my regards  i wouldnt go up to that locality for a farm  youll be sure to get into trouble  every spot up there is alive with snakes  ill bet they wont go any further than lake cameron or firefly lake said one boy who was a chum to ham and carl  its lake narsac or bust cried snap  huh ill believe it when i see it returned the boy on shore  dont worry youll never get there jack voss said a man standing by  you are too much of a coward  wont i answered jack voss  a lot of us are going up to lake narsac in a few days or next week  who  never mind  we are going and thats enough answered jack voss i aint afraid of that ghostor of snakes either he added  there they go shouted joe bright enthusiastically  hurrah for the young hunters of the lake  hurrah shouted several and waved their hands and handkerchiefs  those in the rowboat waved in return  then shep and whopper bent to the oars and the summer outing was begun  little did the young hunters realize how many strange adventures were in store for them     chapter ix  the first day of the outing   as my old readers know the distance to lake cameron in an air line was about ten miles but the river was a winding one and this added three miles to the journey  beyond the town the banks of the stream were lined with farms orchards and patches of dense woods a beautiful outlook and one which the boys thoroughly enjoyed as they rowed along  they passed simon lundys farmwhere they had once had such a curious happening when after apples as related in four boy hunters and then continued along under the overhanging branches of some willows where it was shady and cool  do you think jack voss spoke the truth when he said he was going to lake narsac queried shep after he had turned his oars over to snap  it may be truealthough jack knows how to blow answered snap  if he goes out it will most likely be with ham and carl and that crowd put in whopper  they always travel together  id like to know how ham and carl feel this morning cried giant  most likely pasty answered the doctors son and this made the others laugh  if that crowd should take it into their heads to go to lake narsac i hope they dont camp near us went on snap after a pause  theyll try to bother us all they can you can rest assured of that said whopper  they seem to live for nothing else  well we can give them as good as they send cant we asked giant im not afraid of em  of course were not afraid of them returned whopper hastily  to reach lake cameron the young hunters had to take to a side stream lined on either side with blackberry and elderberry bushes they resolved to push on to the lake before stopping for lunch then they would row to the head of the lake camp there over night and the next day strike out for firefly lake  here they would put in another day and then embark for lake narsac  they found lake cameron and its shores just as beautiful as during the previous summer  to be sure the portion that had been burnt down during the great forest fire looked black and desolate but only a small portion of this territory was to be seen from the boat  they passed along the shore opposite and put in at a little cove that looked particularly inviting  im as hungry as a bear cried whopper  i can eat about a hundred sandwiches ten pieces of pie and any other old thing that happens to be handy  jed sanborn was telling me he had seen some wild ducks up here last week said the doctors son  if they are around we must keep our eyes peeled for them  they are pretty scarce  all of the boys wanted coffee and so some wood was gathered and a campfire started over which they made the beverage  snap and whopper prepared the midday meal and while they did this giant and the doctors son got their rods cast in their lines and tried their luck at fishing  first prize called out shep in a few minutes and drew in a small perch  if we can get enough we might have fish for lunch suggested whopper  better keep them for supper answered snap  well be good and hungry by night  as if i wasnt hungry enough now growled whopper  shep caught three perch hand running while giant did not get a nibble the small member of the club was somewhat disappointed but suddenly there came a tug that almost pulled him into the lake  got something he sang out  must be a whale  maybe its a maskalonge sang out whopper  want any help  no was the reply and then giant began to play his catch with the skill of a natural born fisherman  soon came a deft swing of the fishing rod and out on the grassy bank landed a lake pickerel of good size  a pickerel cried snap  and a beauty  thats better than my three perch was sheps comment  giant youre the fisherman of this club and no mistake  the two boys continued to fish both before lunch and after and when they finally wound up their lines they had nine perch two chub and two pickerelcertainly a very respectable haul  that means fish for both supper and breakfast was snaps comment theyll taste fine too coming right out of the water  having put away the things used in getting lunch the four boy hunters embarked once more and the journey along the shore of lake cameron was resumed  as they had not a great distance to go to reach the other end of the sheet of water they took their time watching the trees and bushes for a possible sight of game  there are your wild ducks cried whopper after half a mile had been covered  he pointed inland to where there was a clearing among the trees probably some marshy spot  several wild ducks were settling down and in a few seconds they were out of sight  want to go ashore asked giant who was rowing  i dont think so answered snap  perhaps well see some of them on the lake  i see three now called whopper softly and pointed almost dead ahead  turn the boat into the bushes ordered the leader of the club and giant did as commanded  snap was already reaching for a shotgun and whopper and shep did likewise  the wild ducks had settled on the bosom of the lake and were paddling in the direction of the rowboat  they came on slowly however and the young hunters could scarcely wait until they got within gunshot giant still had the oars and now he dropped one rather loudly on the bow  at once one of the ducks took alarm and arose in the air  they are flying away yelled shep and raised his shotgun  bang spoke the weapon and reports from the two other firearms followed one of the ducks came down heavily while a second fluttered around badly wounded  the third flew off apparently untouched  we must get that second one cried snap and fired once more but the wounded duck had reached the cover of some bushes and was not hit again  the rowboat was hastily turned in the direction and snap and whopper leaped ashore  then the duck tried to fly but a shot from whoppers firearm laid it low  soon the boys had both ducks on board and were examining the game  they are pretty plump was snaps comment and he uttered the words with satisfaction  not so bad for the first days record said giant  fish and ducks  now if we could only get some squirrels a few rabbits a deer and three or four bears began whopper  do you want to bring down everything within ten miles the first day demanded the doctors son  i believe if whopper was hunting lions hed want to bring down a dozen the first clip was snaps comment  let me tell you there will be many days when we wont bring down a thing  oh i know that answered whopper  i was only fooling  say it will be fine to have roast duck for dinner tomorrow eh  and he smacked his lips  duck stuffed with sage and onions murmured giant patting himself in the region of the stomach  no stuffings in this cried the doctors son  i just want pure ducka nice brown legyum  say you make me duckhungry already cried whopper  lets go on unless we are going to stay here for the rest of the day  once again the oars were taken up and with scarcely a sound they moved along the shore of the lake  the sun was now well over to the hills in the west and the trees along the shore cast long shadows over the rippling surface  no use of talking such a spot as this is a regular paradise was snaps comment  i can tell you there isnt anything like a life in the open  especially when it rains suggested giant  or when youre caught in a blizzard added shep  do you remember that blizzard last christmas  will we ever forget it answered giant  just the same what snap says is truegive me such an outing as this every time some fellows are always hankering after the citybut i never did  an hour later the young hunters reached the end of the lake where a small rocky watercourse joined that body of water to firefly lake  here they went into camp pitching their tent in a convenient spot among the trees  over a bright campfire they cooked some of the fish to a turn and took their time eating the meal  then they sat around and chatted and giant told his chums something which interested them not a little     chapter x  the story of a strange disappearance   the boys were talking about money matters in general and inheritances in particular when giant mentioned the fact that his mother had some money coming to her but could not get possession of it  you know my mother came from france said the small member of the club  she arrived in this country when she was about sixteen years of age coming with an uncle who was her guardian  my uncles name was pierre dunrot and he was by profession a teacher of ancient history  no wonder you always get your history lessons so easily was whoppers comment  it must run in the blood  you keep quiet whopper and let giant tell us about this money interposed snap  after my mother was in this country about six years she met my father and married him  my uncle approved of the match although he told my mother he wished she had married a frenchman instead of an american  they all went to live at a place called watchville on the seacoast  my uncle was then writing a great work on ancient history to be issued in ten big volumes  phew i hope he didnt want any fellows to study it murmured the doctors son  mother has told me that my uncle was all right in his mind while i was a little boy and when my father was alive  but after my father died uncle pierre grew kind of queer in his head  my mother thought it was too much study and she advised him to take a rest but he said he must get his big history written and he kept on writing and burning the midnight oil as college fellows call it and it made him queerer and queerer every day  one day he went to the postoffice for his mail  that was when i was about nine years old  when he got back he began to dance around and he caught me by the hands and rushed around the house like a crazy man  a hundred thousand francs  a hundred thousand francs he kept calling out over and over again  then my mother asked him what he meant  he said a distant relative had died and left him and her a hundred thousand francs  how much is that asked whopper who knew little about french money  a franc is worth about nineteen cents said snap  yes and a hundred thousand francs is about nineteen thousand dollars went on giant  my mother tried to get the particulars from uncle pierre but he was so excited she could not excepting that half the money was coming to himself and half to her  he said he would see about it the next day  that night there came a violent thunderstorm and our house was struck by lightning  the only damage done was to one corner in which was located uncle pierres writing desk  the desk was ripped apart by the lightning bolt and some of his precious manuscripts were burnt  when my uncle discovered that part of his great historical work had been destroyed he acted as if he was insane  he was almost on the point of committing suicide but my mother stopped him she told him to remember about his good fortune in having all that money left to him but he only shook his head and said he would rather have his manuscripts back  at last she got him to bed but in the morning he had disappeared  disappeared came from the others  yes  he had put on the oldest suit of clothes he had and gone away of course my mother sent out an alarm and men hunted all over for him  but he was not to be found  but you found him later ventured snap  no he was never found  when folks learned how queerly he had acted all came to the conclusion that he had gone to the river and drowned himself and after awhile my mother thought so too  and what of the fortune questioned shep  my mother tried to find the letter uncle pierre had received but that was gone too  then she wrote to france  she learned that some money was really coming to her and my uncle but could not get any particulars  she even employed a lawyer but after a year the lawyer gave up too  there was a mystery about the whole affair and the solution it seems rested with my uncle pierre  and you never got the money asked whopper  not a dollar of it  its queer you never spoke about this before said snap  well mother doesnt like to speak of it because she doesnt want folks to know we had a crazy man in our family  but uncle pierre wasnt really crazyhe was only queerand that lightning bolt burning up his beloved manuscripts unset him completely  i hope youll get that money some day giant said snap  i wouldnt give up trying for it so easily  when i am a man and can afford it i am going to france and try to hunt it up answered the small youth  does your mother ever say anything about it questioned shep  not much  she hates to think of my uncle  she was very much attached to him and to have him disappear like that makes her shudder and feel very bad  were you living over on the coast when he disappeared  oh no we were living at a place called bartonville about twenty miles to the north of here  my father used to be cashier of the bartonville lumber company  i once heard of a man disappearing and coming home fifteen years later said shep  but he simply ran away because he had some trouble with his wife  i heard of a case like that put in whopper with a grin on his face  that man wanted his wife to make him some gooseberry pie and she wouldnt do it  when he came back he asked her maria will you make the gooseberry pie now and she answered no  all right said he ill go away again and he did  thats a whopper all right enough cried snap  its about time you turned up  you have been very quiet lately  i never tell anything but the strict truth said whopper meekly  when it came time to retire snap asked the others if they should post a guard  oh i think we are safe enough without one answered the doctors son who was fagged out  lets chance it  most of our outfit is on the boat said whopper  i dont believe anybody will carry it off  let us fix the fire so it will burn the most of the night said giant  that will scare off any wild animals that may be prowling around  wood was to be had in plenty and they cut several sticks which were not very dry and would consequently burn slowly  they sat up until about nine oclock and then turned in resolved to be up at daybreak and on their way once more directly after breakfast  it was cozy enough in the tent which was just large enough to accommodate the four boys  as they were to remain there but one night they had not fixed up any couches further than to throw down some dry brushwood and a few cedar boughs  giant and whopper rested at the rear of the tent and snap and shep in front close to the halfopen flap  snap had been asleep about two hours when he awoke with a start he listened and heard the bark of a fox not very far from the camp  wish i could bring him down just for the fun of the thing he murmured to himself and then reaching for his shotgun he arose and tiptoed his way out of the tent  the fire had burned low and snap was wise enough to slink into the shadows so that the fox might not see him  just back of the temporary camp was a big rock and toward this he crawled keeping his firearm before him and ready for use  several minutes passed and then he heard the bark of the fox once more this time much closer  he strained his eyes to catch sight of the creature but the darkness under the trees was too great  after that fully five minutes passed and snap had about made up his mind that the fox had gotten scared and turned tail when he heard a cracking of brushwood directly in front of him  with eyes on the alert he watched in the direction from whence the sound had proceeded and at last caught the gleam of two small eyes as they looked suspiciously at the campfire  now is my chance thought the young hunter and raising his shotgun he took hasty aim and pulled the trigger  only a sharp click followed and all in a flash snap remembered that in the evening he had cleaned the firearm but had not loaded it  the fox heard the click caught sight of snap and whirling around made a leap for the woods and was out of sight in a twinkling     chapter xi  a search for a rowboat   well of all the chumps in this world im the worst  thus it was that snap upbraided himself for having forgotten to load the firearm  he knew it would be useless to dash back to the tent for ammunitionthe fox was gone and would take good care to keep its distance  much chagrined over his mistake the youth turned back and walked toward the fire  then he set his gun against a tree and built up the blaze a bit for the night was chilly  he was just about to leave the fire and crawl back in the tent when a voice reached him  who is out there it was shep who asked the question  it is i snap was the reply  whats wrong and now the doctors son poked his head from the shelter  i heard a fox and thought id shoot himbut he ran away said snap  he was in no humor to tell about the empty shotgun for he did not wish his chum to have the laugh on him  oh is that all  say do you know its cold  yes and that is why i am stirring up the fire answered snap  do you know i had an awful dream continued the doctors son it has left me wideawake  better go to sleep shep or youll be fagged out in the morning  i dreamed somebody ran away with our boat and all our supplies went on shep  we didnt have a thing left and we were in our nightclothes  you must have been thinking of ham spink and carl dudder and what they did last year  maybe  of course the boat and outfit are safe went on the doctors son  i suppose soi havent looked  just take a look before you turn in will you  yes  sheps head disappeared and snap finished fixing the fire  then he turned to the lake where the boat with the most of the outfit had been left tied to an overhanging tree  the craft with its contents was gone  snap could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses  he pinched himself to make certain that he was awake  it was truethe craft was nowhere in sight  at first he thought to arouse the others but then concluded to look for the boat first  perhaps it had only broken away and was drifting close by  if so he would bring it back and fasten it securely without giving the alarm  but a fiveminutes hunt convinced snap that the rowboat with its valuable contents was nowhere in that vicinity and then he ran back to the tent much disturbed  get up you fellows he called  get up  the boat is gone  at first nobody paid attention for even shep was asleep once more  but then giant roused up quickly followed by his chums  whats the matter  the boat and our outfit is gone  gone  whyeri dreamed it stammered the doctors son  am i awake or asleep  youre awake answered snap and then he continued hurriedly shep do you think you heard somebody take the boat while you were in a doze and so imagined you dreamed it  ieri dont know  no i dont think i didmy dream was so unnatural  come to think of it the boat had wings and flew away now that couldnt happen  not unless some wizard turned the craft into an airship answered whopper  all were soon at the waters edge and looking in all directions for the missing rowboat  what had been left of the outfit had been stored in the stern and tied down with a rubber cloth to keep off the heavy dew  they stirred up the campfire still more and each provided himself with a firebrand as a torch  this is the worst luck yet observed the doctors son with something like a groan  supposing we cant get our boat and outfit back  oh weve got to get em back burst out whopper  well do it if we have to scrape the lake with a finetooth comb  i wish it was morningwe cant see much in the dark even with the torches said shep  giant was examining the shore for the possible discovery of strange footprints  but he could discover none that looked different from their own  if i was an indian i might distinguish them but to me they all look alike he said  what to do next the young hunters did not know  had they had a second boat they might have rowed up and down the lake but even this move was denied to them  let us go up and down the shore on foot suggested snap  it is all out of the question to go back to bedi couldnt sleep a wink  it was decided that shep and snap should go north while whopper and giant went south  all procured new torches and each took along a gun  if you discover anything give the old whistle said the leader of the club  the way snap and shep had chosen was anything but easy  to the northward the shore of lake cameron was rocky and uneven with many gullies and little streams flowing over the rocks  more than once they thought they heard somebody or some animal moving but the sound proved to be nothing but the falling water  once shep stepped into a hollow and was scared by the sudden appearance of several big bullfrogs  wish they were rabbits or squirrels i might shoot them he said  well you can shoot the frogs if you wish answered snap  the hind legs are as sweet as squirrel meat  i know thatbut im not out for frogs just now  i want to find that boat  the two young hunters covered a quarter of a mile when they came out on a small point of land overlooking the broad lake  as they did this snag uttered a cry  what is that out yonder shep  why i declare it looks like the boat  just what i was thinking  how can we get to her  i dont knowunless we swim over  is anybody on board  i cant make outin fact i am not at all sure it is the boat was the slow answer  the object they had discovered was quite a distance out on the lake and the light from their torches reached it but faintly  the thing was drifting down the lake slowly and as they watched it almost passed from view  here this wont do cried snap  if it is the boat we must catch her and bring her in  its kind of cold swimmingthis time of night answered the doctors son who did not relish such a bath  here you hold my things and ill swim out declared snap i dont think the water is any colder now than in the day time  he was soon ready for the plunge and noting the direction in which the object had last been seen he waded into the water the first touch felt icy but after he had ducked down and taken a few strokes it did not seem so bad  he struck out lustily and shep held up both torches that he might have some light by which to guide himself  snap was a good swimmer but the object out on the lake was further away than he had calculated and it took him fully five minutes to get in the vicinity of it  the sky had clouded over a bit hiding the stars so he could see little or nothing on the water  on the shore he could see the two torches that the doctors son was waving and that was all  at last snap saw the dark object directly ahead of him  by this time he was somewhat exhausted by his swim and he was glad to think that he would soon be able to rest  then he made a discovery which did not please him at all  the object was nothing more than a part of a fallen tree the trunk resting half in and half out of the water and several branches sticking out in as many directions  at a distance it looked a little like the rowboat but the resemblance faded completely as he got closer  too bad  i thought it was the boat sure he murmured  well ill have to rest on the log a bit before i strike out for shore  he swam up to one of the branches and caught hold of it  he was on the point of reaching for the tree trunk when an unusual sound came to his ears  then snap made a discovery that almost took his breath from him on the tree trunk rested a big wildcat its eyes gleaming fiercely at the youth in the water     chapter xii  the camp on lake cameron   snap did not stand upon the order of his going but went at once without a thing with which to defend himself he had no desire to come into contact with such a savage creature as a wildcat and consequently he dropped back into the water in a hurry and started back for the shore  he almost fancied he heard the wildcat splash in after him and a chill crept down his backbone which was not caused by the night air  hello  hello he yelled to shep  got the boat came back the cry  not much  get your shotgun ready and fire a shot into the air  whats the matter  a wildcat is out hereon a floating log  im afraid hes after me  a wildcat  want me to scare him away  yes  the doctors son now understood and raising his shotgun with one arm he pulled the trigger  the report sounded out loudly in the night air and the echoes went ringing over the surrounding hills  in the meantime snap continued to swim for the shore with all possible speed  fortunately he came in where there was a sandbar so that he could wade to solid ground  when shep reached him he was panting for breath  i wawasnever so scarscared in my life he panted  it was only an old tree and i was going to take a rest on it when i heard the wildcat  he was a big fellow and his eyes seemed to bore me through and through  maybe i didnt strike out for shore in a hurry  i dont blame you answered the doctors son  did he jump in the water after you  i dont know  and it wasnt the boat  no i didnt see a thing of the boat  snap lost no time in dressing and in the meantime shep kept his eyes open for the possible appearance of the wildcat  but the savage creature did not show itself nor did the fallen tree come again into view  the report of the gun had reached giant and whopper and they came up on the run fearing something serious had occurred  we walked along the shore for almost quarter of a mile said whopper but we didnt see a blessed thing that looked like the boat  i am afraid its gone for good  if it is well have to go home and that will be the end of this outing answered shep  oh were going to find that boat declared giant  but i dont think well be able to do much until daybreak  they followed the shore for a short distance further and then went back to the temporary camp  it was now halfpast three in the morning  it will be growing light in another hour said whopper  i move we get breakfast and be ready to start off as soon as we can see  his suggestion was carried out  snaps swim had made him cold and he was glad enough to drink two cups of steaming hot coffee  the boys had brought some doughnuts along and these with the coffee and some fried fish gave them a very appetizing breakfast  they took their time eating waiting impatiently for the first signs of light in the eastern sky  at last it was light enough to see almost across the lake and then they looked in all directions for some sign of the missing rowboat the craft was not in sight and once again the party divided this time whopper and snap going to the south and shep and giant to the north  each took his gun along and it was snap who told them to make sure the firearms were loaded  you never want to go out with an empty gun he said  humph muttered giant  did you ever do such a thing  but snap pretended not to hear and did not answer  whopper and snap covered almost half a mile before they came to a turn in the lake shore  here there was quite a good sized cove and much to their surprise they saw two large tents standing among the trees  nearby was the remains of a campfire with sticks an iron chain and a big iron pot over it  i didnt notice this camp when we came up said whopper  all the folks here must be asleep said snap  but as he spoke a man came from one of the tents and stared at them  it was andrew felps the rich lumber merchant who owned much of the land around the lake and who had treated them so meanly the summer and the winter previous  hi you roared felps  what are you doing around here  looking for our boat answered snap  humph  this is a pretty time to visit our camp i must say  we didnt know you had a camp here said whopper  id like to know what you are doing hereafter my ordering you away last summer and last winter went on the lumber merchant sourly  didnt i say i was looking for our boat said snap  well if youve got a boat you must be camping up here  we stayed ashore over night thats all  we are bound for lake narsac said whopper  did you see a boat drifting past he continued  no i didnt snapped andrew felps  look here he continued if this is a trick let me warn you  you cant camp around here and that settles it  we dont want to camp around here mr felps answered snap  all we want is our boat which got away from us last night  if you saw anything of the craft  i want you to get out of here roared the lumber merchant i wont have you hanging around  at this moment two men came from one of the tents  they were giles faswig and vance lemon the lumber merchants two friends and the men who had once tried to get the boys to let them have some ammunition  they had treated the young hunters so meanly that the latter had voted not to let them have any powder or cartridges and this had broken up the outing of the felps party  hello those young rascals are out here again muttered vance lemon who was naturally as sour as his name implied  say ive fixed them whispered giles faswig with a wink at lemon ill tell you about it later  i took a walk late last night and i discovered they were camping not far from this spot  we are not young rascals cried snap indignantly  we are just as good as you are and maybe better  bah dont talk to me growled vance lemon  you thought you were smart last winter when you refused to sell us a little ammunition broke in giles faswig  i havent forgotten that dirty trick  you know well enough why we didnt let you have the ammunition answered snap  you didnt deserve it  humph  just wait and youll find out the man did not finish  now i want you two boys to go awayand stay away cried andrew felps  if you are bound for lake narsac better be on your way  we cant go until we have found our missing boat said whopper it must be somewhere on this lake  make them go away said giles faswig and then he whispered something in the rich lumber dealers ear  whatever he had to tell made andrew felps grin  snap and whopper saw the whispering and the grin and instantly they suspected some trick  they well remembered what a rage faswig had been in when they had refused to let him have any ammunition  look here if you know anything about our boat i want to know it said whopper without stopping to think twice  your boat repeated vance lemon and then he looked at giles faswig who winked  yes our boat repeated whopper  we tied it to a tree last night and now it is gone  i didnt touch your boat growled andrew felps  nor did i put in vance lemon  you had better be gone about your business came from giles faswig we didnt come up here to be bothered by a lot of kids  we want our boatand we are bound to get it said snap firmly  well go find it cried andrew felps  we want to know if anybody in this camp knows anything about the boat  just then a boy of eight or nine years of age came out of one of the tents rubbing his eyes sleepily  uncle giles he said walking up to faswig where are we going today and what are you going to do with that boat you brought in when i woke up last night     chapter xiii  in the camp of the enemy   snap and whopper listened to the words of the small boy with keen interest  instantly they came to the conclusion that the lad must be speaking of their own craft  hush dick cried giles faswig hastily  you go back in the tent and stay there until these strangers go away  what boat did your uncle bring in last night asked snap walking up to the lad  see here you leave my nephew alone roared faswig  cant i speak to him  no i dont want him talking to the likes of you  he said you brought in a boat last night when he woke up came from whopper  was it our boat  none of your business snapped giles faswig and as he spoke he took his nephew by the arm and turned him back into one of the tents  stay there now mind he added in a low tense voice  its a good deal of our business said snap if it was our boat  come on and take a look around added whopper and started for the other side of the cove where a mass of brushwood and overhanging trees screened a portion of the water from view  giles faswig strode up to the two young hunters and caught snap by the arm  the next instant the hand was shaken off violently and the youth stood before the man with blazing eyes and doubledup fists  dont you try that again mr faswig said snap in a cold measured voice  you have no right to touch me  and you have no right in this camp  you clear out came from andrew felps  i dont want you around another minute  faswig stepped in front of the boys and so did felps and lemon  all three of the men looked ugly and snap and whopper did not know what to do  mr felps began snap after a painful pause i want you to listen to what i have to say  last night our rowboat with our outfit on board disappeared  i dont know if it drifted off or was stolen if it was stolen and we find it out somebody is going to be arrested for the theft  ha do you call me a thief burst out the lumber dealer in a rage  not at all i am only telling you a few plain facts  we have every reason to believe our boat is somewhere around this camp  if it is i want to know if you are going to give it up peaceably or if well have to send down to town for an officer of the law  youyou commenced andrew felps and then looked at giles faswig who had turned slightly pale  this may not be a serious business to you but it is to us continued snap  there are four of us in our party and if you have our boat we can all testify to that fact  three of us can stay here and watch you while the fourth goes for the officer  do you think wed steal a measly rowboat asked vance lemon but he glanced at faswig as he spoke and his tone was an uneasy one  i dont know what youd do  but that boy said something about bringing in a boat last night and i want to know if it is our boat  how do i know whose boat it is growled giles faswig  has it got the name snapper on it asked whopper  i didnt notice  i saw a boat drifting on the lake and hauled it in thats all answered giles faswig curtly  for all i know you are trying to get somebody elses property away from me  you let us see that boat and well soon tell you if it is ours or not said snap  i was out on the shore last night and i saw something drifting by and drew it in explained giles faswig  i hauled it back of yonder bushes  if you can prove it is your property you can take it but not otherwise  well soon find out answered snap and walked over in the direction pointed out  as he did this whopper put his little fingers in the corners of his mouth and gave a piercing whistle  whats that for demanded andrew faswig in alarm  we want our crowd down hereand some others said whopper  some others  who asked faswig and now he was also alarmed  some folks who will give us all the help we want said snap quick to understand the ruse his chum was playing  how many people are up here asked the rich lumber dealer nervously  oh seven or eight answered whopper but did not add that he was counting in felpss own party  behind a thick mass of brushwood rested the snapper as the boys craft had been christened  the boat was very much as the lads had left it but snap was quick to detect that the painter which had before had a frayedout end had been cut by some sharp instrument probably a knife  this is our boat said snap as he looked the craft over  humph can you prove it growled giles faswig  yes and i can prove more if i have to added the leader of the hunting club  what  that the rope has been cut  what does that signify asked andrew felps  it shows that the boat didnt drift away  somebody cut the rope and made off with her  see here began giles faswig and then stopped short  there was a shout and giant and shep burst into view  got the boat eh cried the doctors son  good and then he looked curiously at the men and so did giant  come on and shove the boat out said snap  well talk this over later and before anybody could stop him he was in the craft and pushing out of the bushes  say look here began andrew felps but the boys paid no attention all got on board the snapper and in a moment more the craft was out in the middle of the cove  dont you try to make any trouble for me shouted giles faswig i simply found that boat adrift and brought her in here for safety  and i dont believe a word you say answered snap  i think you visited our camp and stole the boat  and that is what i think added whopper  a wordy war followed lasting fully ten minutes  it was plainly to be seen that giles faswig and his companions were much disturbed thinking the boys would make trouble for them  at last the young hunters rowed away and went back to their own camp  it was now growing quite light  did you ever hear of such meanness was snaps comment  they meant to keep our boat hidden until we had left this vicinity then maybe theyd cast it adrift and say they had nothing to do with taking her  well we found out how mean they were last year so it is nothing new said shep  you were lucky to locate the craft  it was all through that boy returned whopper  i pity him if he has giles faswig for an uncle  i think the best we can do is to leave lake cameron at once said giant  we dont want to run into that crowd again  the others agreed and by eight oclock that morning the tent was taken down and stored away and the journey to firefly lake was begun  it was a clear warm day with bright sunshine overhead  the woods were full of birds that sang sweetly and being so near to natures heart the young hunters soon forgot their troubles  the stream leading from lake cameron to firefly lake was a tortuous and rocky one and more overgrown with bushes than it had been the summer previous  at one point the spring freshets had rolled in a number of big stones and these the boys had to roll out of the way before the rowboat could get through  not wishing to damage the snapper they proceeded with care so by dinner time less than half the distance to the smaller body of water was covered  we wont get to firefly lake until tonight said snap  but who cares  we have plenty of time  all were hungry for a taste of roast duck and so they stopped off long enough to cook a fine dinner  for dessert they had some blackberries which they chanced to find growing near the watercourse and they stopped so long over their midday meal that it was after two oclock before the journey was resumed  do you remember the awful windstorm we once struck up here queried shep as they rowed along  will we ever forget it cried whopper  gosh  i thought i was going to be blown into the next century  say did i ever tell you how it blew my socks inside out he added with a grin  hardly answered giant and laughed  fact and the next morning i had to turn my shoes inside out to accommodate the socks finished whopper  yes that was a wind to remember  hurrah whopper is coming to his own cried snap  whopper what would you do if you couldnt tell stories now and then  why id began whopper and then leaped to his feet  well i never  give me a gun quick  theres a bear     chapter xiv  delayed by a storm   a bear  where is he  let me get my gun  such were some of the exclamations uttered after whopper made his declaration that he had seen a bear  in the meantime the youth who loved to tell big stories had caught up his shotgun and was aiming it to the right of the watercourse where there were several big rocks overgrown with brushwood  he took aim and blazed away  a grunt followed and then came a thrashing in the bushes growing fainter and fainter in the distance  you hit him ejaculated snap  yes but he is running away for all hes worth answered whopper disappointedly  by this time every one of the young hunters had his firearm  the boat was turned to the bank of the creek and then each youth looked at the others  not a trace of the bear was to be seen anywhere  no use of going after him said the doctors son  more than likely hes half a mile away by this time and hell be so shy he wont let us get anywhere near him  if only we could have gotten a shot at him said giant wistfully think of bringing a bear down first lick  and his eyes glistened  we might have crawled up on him only i thought he saw us explained whopper  thats the reason i called for my gun  i guess he kind of scared you said snap  well i admit i was startled  i didnt think wed find a bear along herei thought they hung up in the mountains  they may come down to gather some stuff that grows in this water answered snap  they love to eat certain roots so jed sanborn told me and sometimes they travel a long distance to get them  after a little more talk the journey was resumed and nothing out of the ordinary came to their notice until late in the afternoon  then shep who was in the bow looking forward held up his hand for silence  what is it whispered giant who was next to him  some small animals squatting on yonder rocks replied the doctors son  i dont know what they are  the young hunters stopped rowing and took up their shotguns with care they allowed the boat to drift behind a screen of bushes on the side of the watercourse  then they looked through the bushes with care  i know what they aremuskrats whispered giant  i see two of them added shep  he raised his gun and giant did the same  bang bang went both pieces one directly after the other the muskrats gave a leap upward and fell with a splash into the stream  we hit them thats certain said the doctors son  but they may get away  eagerly the boys rowed up to the spot where the muskrats had sat around the rocks the clear water was churned up into mud  but on the surface floated the two bodies of the creatures  i dont know what we are going to do with them said snap  the skins are not very good this time of year  i couldnt resist bringing one of em down said shep  just the way i felt added giant  they continued on their way and a few minutes later came to something of a cleared spot along the watercourse  here snap leaped up shotgun in hand  heres our chance fellows he whispered  all together  he pointed to some low trees beyond the clearing  the branches were thick with quail  all understood and took up their firearms  ill shoot high shep can shoot low giant to the left and whopper to the right commanded the leader of the club  all ready  yes was the low answer and the four weapons went off almost as one piece  there was a great fluttering in the trees and five quail were seen to drop  then two others flew around in a fashion that told plainly they were seriously wounded  come on we must get them cried giant and leaped forward  as the two wounded birds flew close together he blazed away a second time and the game dropped like a stone  the rest of the quail were now out of sight  seven quail cried snap enthusiastically  i dont call that half bad  i call it very good declared the doctors son tomorrow we can have quail on toast  where are you going to get the toast questioned whopper  well well have quail on crackers then put in giant  stowing the quail away in the bow of the boat they went on through the gathering darkness  the sun had gone down over the hills in the west casting long shadows across the little watercourse  it will be pretty dark by the time we reach firefly lake said snap and he was right  it was cloudy too and a stiff breeze from the east had begun to blow  well have to take care how we pitch our tent tonight was whoppers comment  unless i miss my guess well have rain by tomorrow morning  oh dont say that cried giant  i dont want it to rain yet  it wont hold off for you or anybody else returned snap  whopper is right we must stake our tent well and allow for the water to run offif rain does come  when they at last rounded the final turn and swept into firefly lake it was so dark they could see little or nothing ahead  but they remembered the locality and had little trouble in reaching a spot where they had camped once before  but the snows of the previous winter had played sad havoc with the fireplace they had built and they had to build a fire in the open  while whopper and giant prepared a substantial supper snap and shep put up the tent on a bit of high ground  around the tent they dug a small trench to carry off the water should it storm  we want to make sure that our boat doesnt get away from us again tonight said whopper  here is a covewe can haul her up in that said snap and this was done and the craft was tied fast to two trees  having had but little sleep the night before all the young hunters were tired out and it was not long after getting supper that they crawled into the tent and went to sleep  on account of the wind they did not dare to leave the campfire burning for they knew only too well how easy it is to set a forest on fire through such carelessness  at about two oclock in the morning giant awoke to find the rain coming down steadily on the tent  he crawled to the front of the shelter and looked out  all was pitch dark and somehow the prospect made him shiver  the wind had gone down and only the fall of the rain broke the stillness  this is lonely enough for anybody i guess he mused and crawled back to his corners  shouldnt wonder if we have to stay in came tomorrow  but i dont careit will give us all a chance to rest up  he struck a match to see how the others were faring and as he gazed around he saw a small stream of water coming in through a hole in the tent  the stream was falling close to whoppers head  just then whopper turned and the stream took him directly in the ear  whwow spluttered whopper awakening and squirming around whats the matter here  has niagara falls broke loose or whos playing the hose on me  the noise aroused the others and all sat up  by this time the match had gone out but giant promptly struck another and then lit the camp lantern  whopper gazed at the hole in the tent ruefully  thats too bad said snap  well have to mend that the first chance we get  we cant mend it tonight answered shep  gracious  just listen to it rain  the boys sat up for quite awhile listening to the rain but presently they grew tired again and one after another dropped off to sleep whopper found a dry spot next to giant and thus they rested until daylight  it was certainly a dismal outlook that confronted them when they arose for the day  the rain was coming down steadily and no dry firewood was to be had with which to cook breakfast  we should have put some wood in the tent said snap  well know better next time  it took a deal of coaxing to start a blaze but once it got going to keep it up was easy  they took their time for traveling in such a storm was out of the question  the meal over they washed up the dishes and then huddled down in the tent once more  this is the only drawback to camp life said snap with a sigh a storm knocks everything endways  but there is no help for it and a fellow must take the bitter with the sweet  the storm continued all day and the only thing the lads did was to fish  at this they were very successful and a fine supper of fresh lake trout put them in much better humor  they put in a peaceful night and the next morning the storm having cleared away they set off for lake narsac     chapter xv  lost in the swamp   this is certainly a wilderness  it was snap who uttered the words as he stood in the bow of the rowboat taking in the scene before him  they had left firefly lake five miles behind them and were on the winding stream leading to lake narsac  on one side of the watercourse were rough rocks and on the other a tangled mass of underbrush backed up by rocks and tall cedars  a fellow could never make his way through such a woods as that said whopper nodding in the direction of the forest  why youd tear your clothing all to pieces  i can tell you one thing put in shep  i think there must be plenty of game up hereif only one can get to it  they had taken turns at rowing and poling the craft along  for the most part the poling was better than rowing for the stream was too full of rocks to admit the free use of oars  twice they had bumped on the projections under water once with such violence that giant who had been standing at the time had almost gone overboard  once they had to carry craft and outfit around a sharp bend  the boat had started to leak a little but not enough to cause anxiety  noon found them encamped on a point of land where the stream appeared to divide into two parts one running to the northeast and the other to the northwest  which branch to take to get to lake narsac they did not know  this is a fine howdoyoudo was whoppers comment  i wish we had questioned jed sanborn about it  from what i thought he said i imagined there was but one stream leading to the lake said the doctors son  perhaps there is shep but which is the one  dont ask me  one looks as good as the other  on the map lake narsac is to the northwest of firefly lake came from giant  consequently i should say that we ought to take the stream flowing in that direction  that sounds reasonable answered snap and the others nodded  coming along the watercourse they had managed to shoot several quail of the sort known by many as partridge and also some other birds  shep had likewise brought down two squirrels  they had scared up several rabbits but these had gotten away in the underbrush  let us take a good rest before we go further said shep while he was eating  there is no use of our killing ourselves with rowing when we are only out for fun  the others agreed and as a consequence they took a nap after the meal and did not get started again until three oclock  they soon found the stream they were on broad but shallow and felt sure it would lead to the lake  they kept on steadily until six oclock and then came to a halt at a point where the watercourse narrowed and ran between a series of jagged rocks  we ought to be getting to the lake pretty soon was snaps comment jed sanborn told me we could make the trip from firefly lake in a day if we didnt fool along the way  well dont forget that we stopped for a nap answered whopper perhaps well get there before it gets dark  having passed the rocks they found the stream broadening out once more  the bottom was now muddy and here and there grew large clumps of reeds and cattails  this seems to be more of a swamp than a lake was the comment of the doctors son  from what jed sanborn said i thought it was a narrow stream all the way to the lake  so did i added giant  i begin to feel that we have made a mistake  if we have youre to blame grumbled whopper  oh you were willing enough to come this direction answered giant sharply  if we are wrong you neednt blame me  its your fault  oh dont quarrel about it interposed snap  we were all willing to come this way  if we have made a mistake he did not finish  dont croak until you are sure we are mistaken said shep  a silence followed and they moved on the stream growing broader as they advanced  it was a lonely spot and as it grew darker the loneliness seemed to increase  on all sides were the immense trees and dense brushwood while the stream was dotted with little islands covered with reeds and rushes and small thorny bushes  the sun had gone down and as the darkness increased the boys looked at each other wonderingly  this was not at all what they had expected  if this is narsac lake i dont want to stay here remarked shep why it cant hold a candle to cameron or firefly  no wonder nobody comes here grumbled whopper  its nothing but a swamp  this cant be lake narsac answered snap  dont you remember what we heardthat it is a very deep lake set right in among the mountains  we have made a mistake  i see something ahead said giant who was standing in the bow  it looks to me like a signboard  let us row up to it  a signboard is just what we want said snap and took up the oars  soon they reached the board which was nailed to a post set on one of the reedy islands  the board read as follows  hoopers pond s hooper owner  no campingers allowe  hoopers pond cried snap  we certainly have made a mistake  no campingers allowed read the doctors son  his spelling and grammar are not very strong but he knows what he means  well we dont want to camp here said whopper in disgust  mr s hooper can keep his pond to himself and welcome  i think well have to camp here for tonight said shep  we cant go back to where we took lunch with darkness coming on and i am hungry too  they were all hungry and tired and after a brief talk decided to remain at the pond over night and in the morning retrace their way to where the stream had forked  shall we camp on one of the islands or on the shore questioned shep  the main thing is to find some dry spot answered snap  to me all the ground around here looks spongy and wet  they tried several of the islands but found them soft and uncertain and so rowed over to the shore on the west  here was a little hill covered with dewberries and having cleared a spot they erected their tent and built a campfire  if mr s hooper is around he may chase us away said snap  but well take the chance of his not being in this vicinity  the swamp was full of flies and mosquitoes and they were glad enough to keep near the fire to get rid of the pests  after the cooking was done they built a smudge of wet reeds and this helped to keep the insects away  but it was not a cheerful spot and when the boys went to bed all felt depressed  snap was the first up in the morning and while he was getting breakfast ready giant took his shotgun and went off in quest of game  there ought to be plenty of wild fowl around a swamp like this said the small member of the club  i am going to see what i can bring down before we leave  if you bring down much youll have mr s hooper in your wool answered snap  i dont believe he is around  and another thing i didnt see any fences  nor i  i guess you are safe in bringing down whatever you can hit  but dont stay out too long  giant walked to the other side of the little hill and then along a cove of the big swamp  far ahead he saw some birds resting close to the waters edge  he felt they might be quail or perhaps some wild turkeys  the ground was anything but firm and giant soon had to leap from one dry patch to another  he was half tempted to turn back but now he was almost within gunshot of the game and he hated to give up the quest  ill go back a bit from the water and come around on the other side he reasoned  then he took to another course only to find presently that it was worse than the first  he was now between clumps of reeds and almost before he knew it one of the clumps turned over on him sending him into the water and mud up to his knees  gracious  this wont do he muttered and tried to turn back he found the water and mud very treacherous and in a few seconds he went down again this time to his waist  his feet were in the mud so firmly that he could scarcely budge them  he let out a cry for help  then the mud below the surface commenced to sink and in a few minutes poor giant was up to his armpits  what to do he did not know and it looked as if he would surely be drowned     chapter xvi  the rescue of giant   snap had the breakfast well underway when shep came out of the tent  hello youre at it early remarked the doctors son  why didnt you call me and i would have helped you  oh i didnt want to disturb you shep you were snoozing so comfortably  where is giant  gone off to see if he can get some game before we leave  do you want me to help with breakfast  if you dont ill try for some game myself  go aheadonly come back when i whistle answered the leader of the club  the doctors son was soon on his way with his shotgun trailing in his hand  he too crossed the little hill as giant had done hardly had he done this than he caught sight of a wild turkey and let drive bringing the game down some distance ahead of him  now i am going to have some fun getting that turkey he told himself as he surveyed the mud and water before him  it was no light task to bring in the game and the doctors son got both feet wet  but the turkey was a gobbler and of good size and he was very proud when he had the game over his shoulder in true sportsmans style  guess ill go on a little further and see if i can stir up anything else he thought  if game is plentiful around here maybe it will pay us to stay for a day or two after all  he trudged on and had just caught sight of what looked like some wild ducks when a cry reached his ears  at first he imagined it came from behind him and thought it might be snap calling him to breakfast but then he concluded it came from in front  must be giant he told himself  what can he want  help help me came presently in a fainter voice  it is giant and he is in trouble burst from sheps lips and then without waiting he gave a loud whistle repeated several times  this was the old signal among the young hunters that assistance was wanted immediately  shep broke into a run or rather a series of hops for he hopped from one bunch of reeds to another until he came close to where giant was struggling in the water and mud  the small member of the club was now almost up to his chin and trying with might and main to pull himself from the treacherous mass that held him a prisoner  whats the matter cant you get out asked the doctors son  nno gasped giant  ththe mumud is lilike ggglue  much alarmed shep looked around for something with which to aid his chum  nothing was at hand but not far off he saw a small sapling growing  he made towards it and by a supreme effort pulled the sapling up by the roots  then he ran back and threw the top of the little tree towards the unfortunate young hunter  got hold  yes  shep began to pull and after a mighty effort succeeded in raising giant several inches out of the sticky mud  but try his best he could not budge the small lad further  its no go he gasped  i am going down myself  dodont leleave me shep  leave you  not much giant  ill get you out somehow  but ill have to try some other way  while the doctors son was looking around for some other means to employ in the rescue a shout was heard and snap came running up followed by whopper  whats the matter  how did giant get in that hole  i dont know how he got in but we must get him out returned shep  can you fellows help pull on this tree  wait here is a small rope said snap  i picked it up as i left camp thinking it might be needed  we can tie that to the tree end and stand further back  the rope was speedily adjusted and then the three young hunters were able to brace their feet on ground that was fairly firm  now hold tight giant sang out shep  ill hold as titight as i cacan was the gaspedout answer for the small youth was all but exhausted by his struggles  the others began a steady and strong pull and inch by inch giant came up out of the sticky mud  to make his hold firmer he twined his arms around the slender branches of the sapling  hes coming cried snap  now then one more haul and well have him out  or broken in two panted whopper  the final pull was given and with a sucking sound and a splash the small member of the club came to the top of the water  he fell on the sapling and the others dragged him to a spot where it was comparatively safe  then he got up and looked at himself ruefully he was plastered with mud from his waist down  never mindbe thankful that youre out said shep  ii am thankful was giants answer  bubut i dont want any oof s hoopers mud  he cacan have it all himself  and this was said so dolefully that all the others had to roar  when they got back to the camp giant told how he had chanced to get into the mud  he was thankful that shep had come along just in the nick of time and thankful that the others had come also  luckily he had a change of garments with him and he lost no time when he was rested in putting on clean clothes and in washing out those which were soiled  after this i am going to be careful where i walk he said while he was eating his breakfast  it puts me in mind of the time you and i got in the snow hole last winter said whopper referring to an incident related in detail in guns and snowshoes  yes and i was just as lucky to get out answered giant  after an hours rest and a good breakfast giant declared himself as strong as ever  the tent was packed and soon the young hunters were on their way from hoopers pond  i hope we dont make any more false turns observed snap as they rowed and poled their way along  i am getting a bit anxious to see lake narsac  so were the others and that noon they allowed themselves only half an hour for lunch  during that time some of the boys went fishing in the stream and were lucky enough to catch some trout and several suckers  once whopper got a strong pull but it only proved to be a mud turtle much to his disgust  thought i had a tenpound fish he said  the middle of the afternoon found them on a clear deep stream which broadened out constantly as they advanced  this made them certain that they were nearing lake narsac and they were correspondingly elated  at one point in the stream they came to a beautiful island with elderberry bushes lining the shore and a patch of trees in the center  as they drew closer they saw several rabbits and squirrels but did not get a chance to shoot the game  if we run short of food we can come here observed snap  that game cant get away from the island  shall we stop off now asked whopper  well be sure to get something  no no  let us go on cried giant  we want to make lake narsac by tonight if we can possibly do it  the others agreed with giant and they kept on until the long shadows over the mountain to the westward told them that night was again approaching  looks as if wed have to camp in the woods along this river said the doctors son  oh let us keep on until it is really dark replied giant  id like to see lake narsac i must confess answered snap  but even if we get there inside of the next hour we wont be able to see much  nevertheless they kept on until it was really dark  then by mutual consent they drew up to the bank of the stream leaped from the boat and stretched their limbs  we may be less than a mile from the lake and we may be five times that distance said the leader of the club  i suppose the best thing to do is to camp where we are  so it was decided and once more the tent was hauled forth and preparations were made to start a campfire  whopper and snap went to cut the wood  they had just stepped into the bushes when shep and giant heard several wild cries  a snake  a dozen of them  this is a regular nest  run they are after us  and then both boys came running out of the bushes with all possible speed     chapter xvii  on lake narsac at last   it was true they had struck a regular nest of snakes and in less than a minute the camp seemed to be fairly overrun with the reptiles which were from a foot to three feet in length  now if there was one thing which the young hunters hated worse than anything else it was a snake and consequently there was a lively rush to get out of the way of the reptiles  the snakes were dark brown in color with lighter stripes and what variety the young hunters did not know  they might be poisonous and the youths did not care to run any chances  the snakes seemed to be fearless and the fact that several were speedily killed did not daunt them  whopper cut one in two with his hatchet and snap crushed another with his heel  then as they came close to the tent shep hit a third with a saucepan and giant kicked a fourth into the water  but by this time at least thirty snakes were in sight and not knowing what else to do the young hunters ran for the rowboat and tumbled into that  one snake went with whopper twined around his foot but that youth kicked it loose and sent it squirming into the water  did you ever see the like gasped giant  why the woods must be full of snakes  we must be close to lake narsac answered snap  dont you remember what they said about snakes being plentiful  if they are as plentiful as all this i want to go right back declared whopper firmly  and then he looked up his trouser legs to make certain no reptiles had gone above his ankles  the other boys were also busy scanning the rowboat to clear it of possible visitors  the craft was tied to the shore but had drifted several feet from the bank  they had rushed away so quickly that all of their firearms were in or near the tent which was but partly raised one end flapping idly in the faint breeze that was blowing  the campfire had been started with a few dry twigs and cedar boughs and cast only a faint gleam around in the gathering darkness  i didnt know snakes could be so active in the dark observed the doctors son  we stepped right into their nest answered snap  first whopper went into it and then i followed  that is what made the snakes so mad and made them come right after us  some of them have gone into the tent cried giant  i just saw three of them wriggle under the canvas  and to think all the guns ar ashore murmured whopper  what are we to do  walk ashore and get them suggested snap with a wink  not for a million dollars  you do it  thank you but ierim lame  i guess we are all too lame to go ashore among those snakes said giant with a short laugh  but we have got to do something he added seriously  i move we remain on the boat until morning said shep  even if we clear out some of the snakes now we may not be able to get at all of them  and who wants to go to sleep with snakes around not i  i couldnt sleep if i tried said whopper  id be seeing all kinds of snakes in my dreams and he shuddered  fortunately they had cooked some extra fish that noon and this food had not been taken from the boat  they dined on the fish and some crackers and that was all  by this time it was night and the tiny campfire was a mere glow of hot ashes  we might try the other side of the stream suggested snap  there may be snakes there too said giant  you can do as you please i am going to stay on the boat until daylight  but what are you going to do when you get to the lake  we must camp somewhere  well hunt up a snakeless place in the broad daylight  the snakes cant be everywhere  there seemed to be no help for it and having anchored the rowboat in the middle of the stream the young hunters proceeded to make themselves as comfortable as possible on board  they had the rubber cloth and this they propped up on halfraised oars making a sort of awning  they had to rest on the hard seats with boxes and bundles between and it was anything but comfortable  they were so close together giant said it reminded him of sardines in a tin box a sound sleep was out of the question and they slumbered only by fits and starts  now to clear out those snakes said snap when it was daylight  i wonder what we had best do first  i have an idea said shep  let us go to yonder shore and cut some cedar boughs  we can set them on fire and each take one snakes hate fire and theyll be sure to crawl away if we advance with the burning boughs close to the ground  the suggestion was deemed an excellent one and they lost no time in carrying it out  they got the driest cedar branches possible and set them into a blaze with little trouble  then they went ashore with caution advancing in a semicircle on the places they thought the snakes must be  to their amazement not a reptile was in sight  did you ever see the like ejaculated whopper  is this true or am i dreaming  i know what has happened said snap  the snakes have simply gone back to their nest  well leave them there by all means interposed the doctors son i wouldnt disturb their nap for the world  with caution they moved around the camp and lifted up the ends of the tent and raised their cooking utensils  who wants to stay here for breakfast asked snap dryly  dont all speak at once  thanks but ive engaged a place about a mile from here answered whopper  you can stay if you wishill move on  it did not take them long to get their things aboard the snapper and keeping their eyes open they moved along the stream  they had scarcely covered half a mile when snap who was at the bow gave a shout  the lake  the lake  where came from the others  right around the bend on the left  pull on fellows and well soon be there  whopper and shep bent to the oars and the turn mentioned was soon passed  then all saw before them a clear deep body of water the farther end lost in the distance  on both sides were tall mountains covered with pines and other trees which came down to the waters edge  the surface of the big lake was as smooth as glass and just in front of them they could see the bottom twenty or thirty feet below  what a beautiful lake murmured shep  but how wild and how lonely added giant after a look around  it looks lonely because we are not used to it answered snap  i felt the same way the first time i went up to lake cameron and to firefly lake  thats it put in whopper  after we have tramped along the shore and rowed around the lake a few times it will lose a good deal of its strangeness  as they advanced they noted that the lake grew deeper and they could no more see the bottom  but the water was as clear as crystal and quite cold showing that the water came at least in part from springs  i see a little stretch of sand said giant presently and pointed it out  we might go ashore there for breakfastif there are no snakes  they turned the snapper in the direction mentioned and soon beached the craft  a hasty hunt around revealed no snakes and the young hunters felt easier  they made a campfire and cooked a substantial breakfast for the meager supper the evening previous had left them tremendously hungry  i feel sleepy enough to take a good snooze said shep stretching himself  whats the matter with staying here for today and then hunting a regular camping spot tomorrow  i guess you fellows are as tired as i am  they were tired and the proposal to rest met with instant approval it was decided to roast the wild turkey for dinner and to spend several hours in fishingall after a sleep of several hours  there ought to be some fine pickerel in this lake said snap and he fixed his rod and line for that specimen of the finny tribe and giant did the same  shep and whopper went in for whatever they could catch  the fishing was highly successful and the boys soon had all the fish they would want for several days  might as well give it up said snap when a call from whopper interrupted him  somebody is coming down the lake was the announcement  a very old man in a canoe     chapter xviii  the old hermits tale   all of the young hunters watched the approach of the old man with interest  he was a very tall individual with snowwhite hair and a flowing beard  he was dressed in a suit of rusty black and on his head he wore a widebrimmed straw hat with a big hole in the top  his canoe was of birch bark light and strong and he propelled it with a short broad paddle  ill wager he is a character said snap as the man drew closer  shall i hail him questioned whopper as it looked as if the occupant of the canoe was going to pass without speaking  might as well was the answer and the boys set up a shout  at first the old man paid no attention but presently he turned his craft toward shore and came to a halt directly in front of the camp  how are you said snap cordially  a look told him the stranger was at least seventy or eighty years old  pretty well for an old man was the answer  who are you  we are four boys from fairview  we came up here to go camping who are you  me  dont you know who i am  i am peter peterson  oh exclaimed the boys  they remembered having once heard jed sanborn speak of peter peterson as an old fellow who lived among the hills bordering lake cameron  peterson was a hermit and having been crossed in love when he was a young man he hated the sight of a woman  my name is charley dodge said snap  my father owns a share in the barnaby saw mill and then the leader of the club introduced his chums  in the meantime the old hermit allowed his canoe to drift to shore and he stepped out and sat down on a rock  i know your father he said to snap and i know your folks and he nodded to shep  your father gave me some medicine when i was sick  so you came up here to go camping  yes  you are pretty brave lads to do that  oh weve been out camping before  we came out last summer and also last winter  up here  no to lake cameron and firefly lake  thats different from lake narsac  dont you know this place is haunted  and peter peterson looked at the boys very solemnly  weve heard something about that but we arent afraid said shep  we are more afraid of snakes than we are of ghosts added whopper we met a lot of them just before we reached the lake  to be sure you did the river is full of them and so is the north side of the lake shoreanybody who has camped up here can tell you that  but i dont mind the snakesbut i do mind ghosts and the old hermit shook his head in a manner to prove he meant what he said  i would stay up here to do some fishing and hunting only  only what asked giant  i dont like the ghosts or spirits or whatever you may call them  have you seen any ghosts asked snap  well ive seen something and heard it too  i dont know what it wasbut it didnt suit me answered peter peterson  but maybe i hadnt better tell you about itit might only worry you he continued thoughtfully  but the boys wanted to hear the old mans story and so they invited him to take dinner with them  during the meal he told his tale which was certainly a curious one  the first of it happened day before yesterday said peter peterson i was up to the very end of the lake in a little cove looking for wild turkeys  i was tired out and i rested against a tree and went into a doze  all at once i felt something cross my face  what it was i couldnt make out  i jumped up and just them i heard somebody cry out i am dead  who will bury me or something like that  i thought somebody was fooling me and i called back who is there then as true as i am sitting here i heard somebody in the air laugh at me  i called again who are you and the party or ghost or whatever it was answered they murdered me  who will bury me then i got scared and leaped into my canoe and paddled away when i was out on the lake i looked back into the woods but i could not see a soul  are you sure you werent asleep and dreamed all that asked snap  no i was wide awake  but that isnt all early this morning i was asleep over on the shore yonder just where you can see that blasted pine  it was i think about three oclock and quite dark  i heard a cry and i sat up to listen  then i heard the most hideous laugh you can imagine  then a voice called out again i am dead  come to my grave  he is dead  i am dead  he is dead then i looked out on the lake and i saw something like a ghost only it was yellow instead of white  it moved over the water like a spirit and in a few minutes i couldnt see it any more then i made up my mind i wouldnt stay up here any longer  you can camp here if you want toi am done with lake narsac  the young hunters of the lake looked at each other  what the hermit had to say coincided in many respects with the story told by jed sanborn  certainly there was something queer in these strange calls and in the appearance of the ghost or spirit in yellow  i must say i dont like this said shep after they had questioned the old hermit to ascertain that his story was a straight one there seems to be something supernatural about it dont you think so  perhaps it can be explained answered snap slowly  we promised ourselves not to be afraid of any ghost put in little giant  i for one dont believe in turning back until we have seen and heard these things for ourselves  id like to have my shotgun handy when that yellow ghost shows itself said whopper  id soon find out whether it was real or not  i dont think your shotgun would do you any good answered peter peterson with deep conviction  you cant shoot a spirit  well if i aimed right at it and it wasnt touched id know it was a ghost for sure  thats true but i reckon when you came to fire on that ghost your hand would be so shaky that you couldnt hit the side of a barn answered the old hermit  after i saw that spirit i felt like i had a chill  i am not going to stay up here another nightits bad enough to be here in the daytime  the old hermit remained with the boys two hours and then embarked in his canoe and was soon out of sight down the stream leading to firefly lake  the young hunters watched him out of sight with some regret  he had told them he did not think anybody was now on the lake but themselves  well if we really are here alone we ought not to be troubled by anybody was sheps comment  still it does seem tremendously lonely  just listen to the stillness remarked whopper  you can cut it out in chunks  no use of listeningi can feel it answered giant  but whats the use of acting like that  youll give us all the blues  lets be cheerful and he began to whistle a merry tune and one after another the others joined in  then they started to fix up the tent for the night and cut a quantity of wood for the fire and this put them in better spirits for supper they had some fine fish baking them to a turn on some hot stones in a fashion jed sanborn had taught them  they also had hot biscuitsthe first since leaving home  i think somebody ought to remain on guard after this said shep when it came time to retire  we dont know what to expect in such a place as this  there are the ghosts and the snakes and unknown wild beasts and other things we know nothing of  i am willing answered snap  we can divide the night into watches of two hours and a half each and draw sticks for turns and so it was arranged  it must be confessed that the boys were a trifle timid that night and those that tried to sleep had hard work to close their eyes but no alarm came and when the sun came up all felt relieved  we may stay up here for weeks and never see or hear of that ghost said snap  i dont believe it shows itself very often  oh i dont suppose it appears and disappears by the clock like a cuckoo said whopper  it will most likely lay low and scare us to death when we least expect it  it was the middle of the forenoon before they were ready to embark on a tour of the lake  they decided to skirt the entire shore or at least such a portion of it as looked inviting and then pick out a spot for a regular camp  they proceeded slowly for there was no need to hurry and they did not wish to miss any spot that might be of especial advantage  it was not yet noon when they turned into a little cove bordered by lowhanging bushes  they looked ahead and then shep ordered the others to stop rowing  i just saw something back of yonder bushes he whispered excitedly i am not sure but i think it was a couple of deer     chapter xix  a dangerous deer hunt   deer came from the others  let me get a shot at em added whopper excitedly  thats what i came forto bring down a dozen deer or so  make it two or three dozen whopper answered snap  what would you do with a dozen in this warm weather  send em down to the poor folks of the town  the announcement that deer were in that vicinity thrilled all the young hunters and they at once resolved to go ashore and see if they could not bring down the game  let us go back a bit suggested shep  we dont want this breeze to carry our scent to them  if it does theyll be off like a shot  the others knew that the doctors son spoke the truth and so the snapper was turned around and they went ashore at a point where the trees were thick  snap carried the rifle and the others had their shotguns and all looked to the firearms to be sure they were in condition for immediate use  with great care the four boys started to stalk the deer as it is called  snap led the way and never was an indian hunter more careful of his steps  he knew that the deers ears were wide open for any unusual sound and even the cracking of a dry stick would attract their attention  the journey over the rocks and through the timber was a laborious one  in some spots the undergrowth was so thick that further progress seemed at first impossible  once giant got caught so completely that the others had to help him free himself  hardly a word was uttered and then only in the faintest of whispers  at last snap felt they must be close to where shep had seen the game and he motioned for the doctors son to take the lead  you saw emyou ought to have first chance at em he whispered  i want you all to fire was the reply  an instant later came a faint sound ahead and looking through the trees the four boy hunters saw three deer walking swiftly along one was a beautiful doe not more than half grown  there is our chance cried shep excitedly  now then all together  snap wanted to know what animal he was to fire at but got no chance to ask for just then one of the deer raised its head and sniffed the air suspiciously  then the two large ones began to run with the doe at their heels  crack bang went the rifle and shotguns as the young hunters took hasty aim  when the smoke cleared away they saw the doe stretched on the ground and one of the deer limping forward painfully  the other deer was out of sight  come onwe can get that wounded one cried whopper and ran forward with might and main  as it happened the wounded deer was the mother of the doe and the wound and the loss of its offspring made the animal savage as whopper turned towards it the deer suddenly made for the boy  look out yelled snap but before whopper could turn aside the deer was on him and had knocked him to the ground  then the deer struck out with its hoofs landing on whoppers shoulder and cheek  it was a moment of extreme peril for there could be no doubt but that the deer meant to kill the young hunter  shep raised his shotgun to fire but was afraid to do so for fear of hitting whopper who was trying to rise  hell be killed shrieked giant but just then snap using his rifle as a club struck the mother deer in the side  the creature rolled over  bang went giants shotgun and the report of sheps firearm followed the deer struggled for a moment then gave a final kick and expired  when the boys ran to whoppers side they found his eyes closed  he was breathing faintly and that was all  is hehe dead asked giant hoarsely for whopper was very dear to the small youth  no but he is badly hurt answered snap  shep run and fill your cap with water  ill loosen his coat and collar  the blood was pouring from the sharp cut in whoppers cheek and his coat was torn on the shoulder from the deers hoofs  when the water was brought snap bathed him tenderly and giant fanned him with a cedar branch  in a few minutes he opened his eyes  tatake the dedeer away he murmured  its all right whopper the deer is dead answered snap  oh whopper breathed a sigh of relief  i am glglad of it  youve had a close call of it said shep  i was scared to death  and his still pale face showed that he spoke the truth  it was several minutes before whopper felt like sitting up  he was all of a tremble as he expressed it and standing on his feet was out of the question  you take it easy ordered snap  well bring the boat around to that cove below here and then carry you down  dodont leave me pleaded the hurt one  that other deer may come back  no danger said giant  but ill stay with you whopper while snap and shep get the boat  it was a good half hour before they had the hurt one and the game aboard the snapper  here the doctors son opened up the medicine case which his father had insisted he should take along and whopper was given a little stimulant and the cuts on his cheek and his shoulder were properly plastered up  he was made comfortable on some cushions in the stern and told to take it easy  i had no idea a deer would fight so fiercely he said when the others had resumed their rowing  those hoofs were mighty hard and sharp i can tell you  by one oclock the young hunters reached a spot that looked good enough for a midday camp and going ashore they lit a fire and prepared dinner  they made themselves a pot of rich cocoa and of this whopper partook freely and it seemed to strengthen him wonderfully  i think we ought to stay here until tomorrow said snap  it will give whopper a chance to recover and so it was decided and the tent was gotten out and erected between two small trees which stood handy  that night they treated themselves to venison steak cut from the doe and never was deer meat more tender or sweeter  they also had hot bread made by giant in a little stone oven  in the same oven snap made a pan of baked beans which were put away for future use  the entire afternoon of the next day was spent in rowing around lake narsac  they did not linger around the north shore for it was wild and uninviting and they had no desire to make the acquaintance of the snakes said to swarm there  they spent two hours inspecting a large cove to the westward and finally concluded that this spot offered the best place for a permanent camp  there was a sandy beach where swimming would be good plenty of the right kind of growth for firewood and from the rocks some distance back gushed a spring of cold and pure water  this is good enough for anybody said snap after a careful inspection  we can use the tent if we wish or we can erect a cabin  oh let us put up a cabin cried giant  it is such fun building one  dont you remember the other shelters we built  if you build a cabin youll have to count me out said whopper i think ill be on the retired list for at least a few days more  whopper shall be the general boss cried snap  he took off his cap  in honor of our wounded comrade i move we call this spot camp whopper  all in favor say aye  aye came from shep and giant promptly  camp whopper it is said snap  three cheers for whopper and his namesake and the cheers were given with a will  whopper you ought to make a speech said giant  tell us how grateful you are how you appreciate the deep honor and all thatand then invite us all out to cake lemonade ice cream soda strawberry shortcake cocoanut pie cream puffs and a few more delicacies  ice cream murmured whopper  say some ice cream would be great eh  but we cant have it out here so whats the use of talking about it  as for a speech i havent got anything to say excepting that i appreciate your kindness in naming the camp after yours truly when i am a rich man and retired and own a castle among the thousand islands i shall surely call itlet me seesnapshepgiant villa there now hows that  fine was the cry  hark added shep a moment later  what did you hear questioned the others  i thought i heard somebody calling  there it goes again  listen  all listened and from out of the forest behind them came a cry followed by a bloodcurdling laugh  then they heard as plain as day these words  i am dead  he is dead  who will bury me  i am dead  he is dead  ha  ha     chapter xx  the mysterious voice   the four boy hunters were so astonished that for the moment they did not move or speak  the voice seemed to come from the trees behind the camp and it was so uncanny and ghostlike it made them shiver from head to foot  its ththe ghost whispered giant at last  lelets get out of here and he started for the shore  dont run away answered snap  i dont believe in ghosts and neither do you  after that the boys remained silent for several minutes waiting to hear that mysterious voice again  but only the mournful hum of the breeze through a clump of cedars reached them  i believe ill investigate this said snap arising and reaching for a shotgun  i dont believe in ghosts so there  ill go along put in the doctors son  please dont leave me alone pleaded whopper  i cant go and i dont want to be left behind  giant will you stay with whopper asked the leader of the club  yes but i hope you wont be gone long answered the small youth in a voice he tried in vain to steady  if anything happens whistle or fire a shot added snap and walked slowly to the rear of the camping place with shep by his side  the two young investigators soon found themselves beside the spring and here both stopped for a drink for their throats seemed to be suddenly parched  they looked on all sides with extreme care but saw nothing out of the ordinary  once a bird flew up directly in front of them causing them to jump and raise their guns  but they were not after game just then so the bird got away  we certainly heard that voice just as plain as day said shep what do you make of this snap  i am sure i dont know  can somebody be fooling us  i dont know  its very queer proceedings thats all i have to say  listen  i thought i heard it again  they came to a sudden halt and strained their ears  sure enough there was the voice again apparently coming from no place at all  i am dead  he is dead  go away  go away repeated the voice a dozen times or more and then it grew fainter and fainter and presently died out altogether  it would be hard to tell whether the boys were frightened or not they were much disturbed but they had a strong curiosity to know what the mysterious voice really was  had it been night they might have experienced more fear but it was still daylight although the sun was well over in the west  holding their guns ready to shoot anything on sight they advanced slowly through the forest making a circle first to one side and then to the other  as they advanced they stirred up several birds and also two squirrels but did not fire at them  thus an hour passed and at last they came back to the spring utterly baffled  i cant understand it at all declared snap  there must be some reason for this  its a trick thats what it is and some day somebody will get to the bottom of it added the doctors son  they returned to where they had left whopper and giant  as it grew darker they built a good campfire and resolved to keep it burning brightly all night  maybe if this particular spot is haunted we had better go somewhere else suggested giant  i move we stay right here until we find out what that thing means said snap stubbornly  i agree with snap added the doctors son  we all know well enough there are no such things as ghosts  some day well solve this mystery  both snap and shep spoke so positively that whopper and giant were reassured  the tent was fixed up for the night and whopper was soon fast asleep  the others took turns at standing guard but nothing came to disturb them  in the morning it was decided to begin building a cabin without delay  as whopper could not work he went out to fish but remained within easy calling distance  the young hunters worked all of that week and also monday of the next and during that time nothing came to disturb them  once they sighted a deer up the lake shore and went after the game but without success  whopper spent most of his time fishing and brought in besides trout and perch several good sized maskalonge although no particular fish as large as the maskalonge giant had captured the summer previous  as the days went by and nothing more was heard of the mysterious voice the young hunters grew more confident and almost forgot about the affair  the building of the cabin interested them very much and although the structure was foursquare and plain it was waterproof and fairly comfortable  it had two small windows and the door opened on the lake side  in the rear a small opening was left near the ground and here they constructed a rude fireplace and chimney of such rocks as they found handy smearing the cracks full of clay  their work on the fireplace and chimney might have caused a regular mason to smile but the chimney drew well and that was all they wanted  as soon as the cabin was finished the young hunters moved in and proceeded to make themselves at home  then they cut enough firewood to last for a week or more stacking it up so that it might keep dry even in rainy weather  this done they felt they could now take it easy and fish and hunt whenever it pleased them to do so  a hard rain lasting a day and a night was followed by a clear warm spell and during that time the boys enjoyed themselves to their hearts content  whopper was now practically well although the cut on his cheek still sported several bits of courtplaster every morning the young hunters got up at sunrise and took a dip in the lake following this up by a good rubdown for they had brought the necessary coarse towels with them  this always rendered them wideawake and gave them appetites which could not have been better  they took turns at cooking and baking and at washing dishes and keeping the fire supplied with wood  they were certainly happy and the time seemed to fairly fly as shep expressed it  one afternoon when snap and giant were fishing just below the camp both boys chanced to glance down the lake and saw a large boat hugging the shore  it contained several persons but was too far off for anybody to be recognized  the boat remained in sight several minutes and then disappeared into one of the numerous coves along the shore  more campers was snaps comment  well i suppose they have as much right up here as we have  id like to know who they are answered giant  perhaps theyll come this way later in the day or tomorrow  i always like to know if other hunters are in the woods and i like them to know i am there too went on the leader of the club then there is not so much danger of an accident  i dont want somebody to take me for a deer or a bear and shoot me  if we find they are stopping around this vicinity well have to notify them that we are here answered giant  that day went by and also the next and they saw no more of the strangers  then shep came in with the announcement that he had seen four or five deer up the lake shore  i am sure we can get one or more of them if we hurry declared the doctors son  they were all willing to go after the deer and having shut up the cabin and kicked out the campfire so that it might not set fire to the woods should a stiff breeze spring up they set off on foot taking to a deer trail which ran a short distance back from the waters edge  the walking was by no means good but this the boys did not mind the life in the open was making them strong and able to endure almost anything  their cheeks were full and round and their complexions a healthy tan  all felt like whistling and singing but they knew they must make as little noise as possible  if anybody was nervous it was whopper and the others said nothing when he dragged a little behind  but all kept on steadily until they knew they must be close to the spot where the game had been seen  suppose i go ahead and take a look asked shep and the others nodded  a moment later the doctors son disappeared among the bushes lining the lake shore  when he came back he said the deer were moving up the lake front and as a consequence all hands followed with all possible speed they kept up the chase for nearly an hour and once saw the game but the deer were too far away to take a shot  then the game started to run and speedily disappeared  thats the time we got left grumbled shep  too bad  it cant be helped answered snap  we cant expect to bring down something every time we go out  if we did that there would be no fun in hunting  then the young hunters started back for camp never dreaming of the disagreeable surprise which awaited them     chapter xxi  in which the enemy appears again   on the way back to camp shep brought down a squirrel and whopper knocked over a rabbit so the quest after game was not altogether fruitless  the boys had covered a good stretch of ground and they were pretty well tired out when they came within sight of the cabin  oh fellows look screamed giant suddenly  the cabin is on fire  he pointed ahead and a glance showed his chums that he spoke the truth  all broke into a run and they reached the shelter almost in the time it takes to tell it  smoke was coming out of the door and windows but as yet the fire had gained little headway it was confined to some brushwood which had been thrust inside against one of the log walls  some enemy has done this cried snap angrily  look out i am going to drag this fire outside  with his bare hands snap caught at one end of burning brush and hauled it through the open doorway  as soon as he had done this the doctors son leaped into the cabin and kicked out the rest of the fire  he could stay but a minute for the smoke almost strangled him  then whopper and giant went in and made certain the fire was out  soon the smoke commenced to clear away and the momentary excitement was over  now what does this mean demanded snap and his voice was full of anger  it means that we have been cleaned out answered the doctors son after a hasty glance around  look  he pointed to a shelf in a corner on which they had placed some of their stores and then to the fireplace and to the log that had contained their cups plates and cooking utensils  everything was gone  robbed said whopper laconically  what a shame  and they were going to burn down the cabin on us too added giant bitterly  i wonder if they touched the boat  at this question all ran outside and down to where the snapper had been tied to an overhanging tree  the rowboat had disappeared  well if this isnt the limit groaned shep  boat gone cooking utensils gone supplies goneeverything gone but our firearms  who could have done it  maybe the felps crowd suggested whopper  or ham spinks gang added giant  or the ghost  i dont believe the ghost had anything to do with this said snap i think it was either the felps or the spink crowd  it looks just like some of their dirty work  well this thing was done within the last three hours came from the doctors son  the question is what have they done with the boat and our stuff  of course we must get them back  we ought to have somebody arrested for this put in whopper  perhaps whopper but weve got to catch them first answered the leader of the club  all looked eagerly up and down the lake and across to the other shore  shep imagined he saw a boat pulled up in the bushes on the other side but was by no means sure  if we cant get our things back well have to go home said giant soberly  i am not going home cried snap  weve got our guns and some ammunition and the deer  i wonder if they touched the deer  all rushed back to where the big deer had been left hung up in a cool spot in the forest evidently the enemy had not seen this game and it was untouched looking around near the water front they found a small box of salt a spoon and some scattered cartridges for the rifle  evidently the marauders had left in haste and dropped the things on the way  i am glad we have the salt observed snap  those thieves ought to have the salt down their throats muttered whopper  they are altogether too fresh  the young hunters walked around the camp for half an hour and more they did not know what to do  they were hungry but in no humor for eating  they wanted to get on the track of their stolen belongings but did not know bow to strike out  maybe some tramps came along and did this suggested snap dropping on the ground to rest  some of that class of fellows would think it fine sport to clean us out  one thing is certain said shep and that gives me an idea he added suddenly  the boat must be somewhere on this lake and it cant leave excepting by the river that runs into firefly lake perhaps it would be a good idea for us to go down to the river and set a watch for the thieves  its a long tramp answered giant  and dont forget the snakes down there  if we  giant broke off short as a distant gunshot sounded out  it was followed presently by a second shot  then all became as quiet as before  those shots came from across the lake cried snap  yes and right close to the spot where i thought i saw that boat added the doctors son  fellows i believe there is a camp over there and if we can manage to get across perhaps well learn something about our belongings  how are we to get over without a boat demanded whopper  its too far to swim  the water is so cold a fellow would get cramps before he was half over  we might build a raft suggested snap who had been favorably impressed by sheps words  there are a number of logs lying around that we cut for firewood and i saw some wild grapevines back of the spring which will do very well for ropes  we could take off the most of our clothing so it wouldnt matter if we got wet  the proposal to build a raft was approved by all and they set to work without delay  it had been after four oclock when they got back to the cabin and it was dark by the time the raft was ready for use  it was a clumsy affair made of rough logs spliced together with grapevine shoots and it was barely large enough to carry the four boys  they took off their coats and shoes and socks and rolled their trousers up to the knees  talk about a life on the ocean wave sang out whopper  this steam yacht would take the first prize at any cattle show eh and this quaint remark caused a general laugh  in the center of the raft a small log was set upright not as a mast but as a support for their guns for they did not wish the weapons or their ammunition to get wet  nobody thought of crossing the lake without the firearms  we may have to fight to get our things back was the way snap expressed himself  and our guns may come in mighty handy  let us try to reach a point some distance below where shep thought he saw the boat suggested snap  then we can land and not let the others know what we are doing  we dont want to rush in on any crowd that is too large for us  that would simply make more trouble for us  snaps proposal was considered a wise one  soon the young hunters had poled the raft from shore and then they started to propel it across the lake  two of the boys had rude paddles and the others cedar branches  the progress made was not great but it was sure and they were content  it was pitch dark when the rude raft struck the opposite shore of lake narsac  they came in among some brushwood and landed without great difficulty  they donned their socks and shoes put on their coats and slung their guns across their backs  well tie up the raft said snap  for all we know we may have to come back to it  oh i hope not murmured giant  with extreme caution they picked their way among the trees and bushes and across the rough rocks  once giant rolled over and over down some of the slanting rocks and would have got a ducking in the lake had not snap stopped him just in time  be careful whispered the leader of the club  dont let go of one footing until you are sure of the next  they covered a distance of two hundred yards when snap called a halt  what now questioned shep  i see a small campfirethrough yonder trees  then there is a party here beyond a doubt cried whopper excitedly  you fellows wait here and ill crawl forward and investigate went on snap  it may pay us to go at this as quietly as possible  dont get into trouble warned the doctors son  if i do youll hear of it quick enough answered snap  then with great caution he crawled through the brushwood in the direction of the distant campfire     chapter xxii  a lively time in the dark   slowly but surely snap got closer to the campfire which was built in a little hollow and screened from the lake by a wall of rocks  they built the fire there so that we couldnt see it from across the lake reasoned the young hunter and he was right  presently he was near enough to make out six forms around the fire  then he recognized ham spink carl dudder jack voss and some other of the lads of the town who usually went with ham and carl  one boy named ike akley was a neerdowell who had once set a barn on fire and burned up two cows  for this he had been locked up but his father had procured his release by paying heavy damages  the crowd around the campfire were eating supper and talking in such low tones that snap could not make out what was said  they seemed to be in the best of spirits as if something had happened to please them greatly  between the campfire and the lake a large tent had been erected near the tent on the ground lay portions of a camping outfit and snap wondered if it could be the things belonging to himself and his friends  suddenly the idea struck snap to take a look at what might be near the water and he moved in that direction  he had to pass through a fringe of brushwood and then he gained a tiny cove well screened from the lake proper by a number of overhanging trees  here it was so dark he could see but little  he felt his way along and soon reached a fairsized boat tied to a tree  the craft was not the one belonging to his party and he was a trifle disappointed  then he saw another boat and his heart gave a bound  it must be the snapper he murmured and hurried to the second craft  but this proved to be nothing but a canoe and again his heart sank  maybe weve made a mistake after all he thought dismally but continued to move around the cove  to reach one point he had to push through some more bushes and in the midst of these he fairly tumbled over a third boat piled high with various camping things  he gave a close look and almost uttered a cry of triumph  our boat and all of our things  heres luck at last  as well as he was able in the dark he looked over the articles in the snapper  the things were in great confusion showing they had been thrown in in a hurry  but almost everything appeared to be there and for this he was thankful  snaps next thought was to go back and tell his chums of his discovery but then he reasoned that this would take time and in the meanwhile someone of the other crowd might come down to the boat and take away some of the things  ill take this boat around to where we left the raft he told himself and set to work to shove the snapper into deep water without delay  this was no light task for the outfit on board was heavy and snap had to work like a trojan to accomplish it  the snapper safely floated another idea popped into the young hunters mind and made him grin broadly  tit for tat he murmured and set to work to float out the other rowboat and the canoe  once they were free of the shore he tied both to the stern of the snapper and then settled down to row along the lake shore  hi there came a sudden call out of the darkness  who are you  snap was startled but he did not drop his oars nor did he stop rowing  he was just rounding one of the points of the cove and now he saw somebody running toward the point at top speed  i say who are you continued the party on shore and now snap recognized ham spinks voice  none of your business answered snap gruffly and in as heavy a tone as he could command  you are running away with our boats continued ham in consternation hi fellows come here  somebody is running away with all the boats he bawled  his cries soon reached those around the campfire and a grand rush was made to the waters edge  by this time snap had rounded the point of the cove and was rowing as rapidly as possible in the direction where the raft lay  stop him  he has all the boats  who can he be  must be somebody from that other camp  such were some of the cries uttered  then someone ran for a shotgun but by this time snap was out of sight around a fringe of brushwood he continued to row his best and before very long gained the spot where the raft rested  then he leaped ashore and ran in the direction of the campfire  this way fellows he cried  i have the boat  back to the raft  back to the raft and he gave the wellknown whistle  in a few minutes he encountered giant and whopper and learned that shep had gone forward to find out what the cries at the lake front meant  we must get him to come back he said  you go down to the boats and the raft and get them ready to shove off on short notice  and he ran closer to the campfire  the entire camp was now in wild commotion for each lad present understood that all the boats were gone  ham spink and carl dudder were in a rage  we should have placed somebody on guard cried ham  we were chumps not to do it  i didnt think anybody would be over here so quick answered carl  how could they do it without a boat  maybe they had another boat put in ike akley  we missed it by not looking around a little closer  whoever he is he isnt rowing across the lake said ham  let us run along the shore and see if we cant get at him some way  as there seemed to be nothing else to do this plan was carried out  the crowd however had only gone a short distance when they literally ran into shep who had gone forward as already mentioned  here is one of em now shouted carl dudder as he caught shep by the arm  the next moment he received a blow in the chest that sent him reeling backward  who is it asked several  shep reed  stop himhe is running away  carl was right the doctors son was doing his best to escape  but before he had gone a dozen steps ham spink ike akley and jack voss were on top of him and had borne him to the ground  they did not treat him any too gently and he was kicked in the side and the breath was literally knocked out of him  ststop  dodont kikill mme he gasped when he could speak  what are you doing here shep reed demanded ham angrily  came over after our things  how do you know we have your things  well we thought youd be just mean enough to take our outfityou did something like that before if youll remember  humph  will you let me up  we will if youll promise not to run away answered carl  thats the talklet us make a prisoner of him cried ike akley  you have no right to touch me said shep  you did very wrong to steal our things and to try to burn down our cabin  weerwe didnt steal any thingswe just ran off with them said ham spink  it amounts to the same thing  then your crowd just stole our boat and our canoe put in carl dudder  is your boat gone asked shep for this was the first he knew of it  you know well enough it is  where is our boat and our outfit  didnt you just take that too asked jack voss  oh then snap began the doctors son and broke off short  was that snap dodge in the boat demanded ham  what boat  your boat  i dont know anything about it  but you just said  at that moment came a cry through the dark woods  shep shep where are you  go back to the raft  it is all rightwe have the outfit back  go back to the raft  it was snap who was calling and in another minute he appeared and confronted the crowd that was holding shep a prisoner     chapter xxiii  the loss of the raft   it was so dark under the trees that for the moment snap did not recognize his chum  then he uttered an exclamation of commingled wonder and alarm  let go of him he cried  let go i say and he caught ham spink by the arm  capture him fellows shouted carl dudder and at once several of the spink crowd fell upon snap  but snap was not to be made a prisoner thus easily and hitting out with all his might he sent jack voss reeling to the ground then he hit ike akley in the nose  ouch yelled ike and put up his hand to withdraw it covered with blood  he has broken my nose and he fell back in alarm  a rough and tumble struggle ensued in which blows were given and taken freely  snap was struck in the breast and in the cheek but not seriously hurt  in the melee shep managed to squirm free from those who held him and he quickly ranged up by his chums side  what did you say about our outfit he panted  weve got it answered snap  come we had better be going  dont let them get away yelled ham spink and made a jab for snap  but just then the doctors son hit out desperately and the rich youth received a blow in the mouth that loosened two teeth and caused him to retreat in a hurry  for the moment the enemy were disconcerted and taking advantage of this snap and shep started on a run through the dark forest moving as swiftly as the condition of the ground would permit the spink crowd came after them shouting to them to stop  carl dudder called out that he would shoot if they did not halt  do you think hell do it asked shep uneasily  i guess its a bluffi dont think he has a gun or pistol answered snap and he was right for no shot followed  when at last the two boys reached the spot where the raft had been moored they found everything in readiness for departure whopper and giant had strung all the craft together in a line making quite a flotilla  they are after usweve got to dust out lively cried shep as he and his chum struck the waters edge  you cant get in the snapper explained whopper the outfit is in such a jumble there is no room  you stay where you are ordered snap  ill get in their rowboat and shep can get in the canoe  there will be no hurry once we are away from the shore  there was little time to say more for a crashing in the brushwood told them that the enemy was close at hand  they had missed the trail but now found it again  they came out on the lake shore while yet those on the water were close by  here they are  they have the boat and the canoe  where did that raft come from  goodbye sang out whopper  hope you enjoy yourselves  you can get another boat down to fairview if you want one  you come back here yelled ham spink in great rage  if you dont come back with our boats ill have you arrested put in carl dudder  do so and well have your whole crowd arrested for stealing our outfit came from giant  and for trying to burn down our cabin added shep  i didnt burn down your cabin said ham hastily  well somebody did  it wasnt me said carl and he looked at ike akley as he spoke that boy shifted uneasily but said nothing  while the talking was going on jack voss had quietly slipped off a portion of his clothing  now he made a leap into the lake and swam rapidly for the raft  get back thereunless you want to get hurt cried snap who saw the movement  but voss kept on swimming and soon gained the raft  then he took hold of the rope that connected it with the canoe untied the raft and swam with the end of the rope back towards shore  thats the way to do it sang out ham  bring the rope in and well pull them back  pull pull shouted snap and he and his chums did their best to send the two rowboats and the canoe away from the shore  but the boy in the water had gained a good footing on the rocks and he held fast  come in here and help me he panted and ham and carl prepared to do so  all had a good hold of the rope when something unexpected happened  taking out his pocketknife shep leaned over the rear of the canoe and severed the rope that had been dragging the raft  as the rope parted down went the boys holding on with a loud splash all disappeared beneath the surface of the lake and each came up with his mouth full of water  in the meantime relieved of the weight of the clumsy raft the two rowboats and the canoe shot out into the lake a distance of a hundred feet or more there our friends rested wondering what the enemy would try to do next  in the darkness the water seemed extra cold and the lads who had received a ducking could not help but shiver as they crawled to the shore  they had gained possession of the raft but they did not appear to be very happy over it  are you coming back with our boat or not demanded ham spink after an awkward pause during which our friends remained silent  why should we come back answered snap  you treated us very shabbily  well didnt you deserve it came from carl dudder  you shot off our fireworks on the fourth of july  we heard all about it  didnt you try to steal our clothing when we were in swimming said whopper  it was a mean piece of business to try to burn down our cabin and to run away with all we had said giant  perhaps you wanted to starve us into going home  it was only a bit of fun pleaded ham spink  weerwe were going to return your outfit tomorrow  i dont believe it said the doctors son promptly  aint you going to give us back our boat and the canoe asked ike akley  that depends answered snap  he whispered something to his chums  well let you know tomorrow  its too late to do anything more tonight  then you are going to take the boat and the canoe away asked carl dudder  for the present yes  meet us at this place tomorrow morning at ten oclock and well talk business to you  all rightwell do it answered ham after whispering to his cronies  but dont fail to come he added  well be on hand answered snap and then he and his chums moved further out into the lake with the boats and the canoe and were soon lost to sight in the gloom of the night  well this is the worst yet growled ike akley when he and his cronies were left alone  we thought we were going to have the best of it and now they have turned the tables on us  have they came from ham spink  that remains to be seen  how demanded several of the others  do you think i am going to bed or sit down and suck my thumbs not much  i am going to do something  what are you going to do asked jack voss  go over to their camp and after they have gone to bed take all the boats awayand take whatever else we can get hold of too then i am going to find a new campsome place where they cant locate us very easily  how are you going to get to their camp asked carl with interest  on the raftsame as they got over here  hurrah thats the plan cried another of the party  theyll think we are over here waiting for them to show up at ten oclock tomorrow morning  wont they be surprised when they get up and find the things minus  they may set a guard suggested ike akley  if they do well have to make him a prisoner and gag him  when shall we start asked one of the boys  let us dry ourselves by the campfire first said ham  and we may as well get something to eat too for there is no telling how long well be gone  this suggestion was considered a good one and the whole crowd went back to the camp  while some changed their wet clothes for dry others prepared a meal and this all took time in eating  then all hands went down to the raft and embarked for the other side of the lake     chapter xxiv  out on a sand bar   the stars had gone under a cloud and out on the lake it was so dark that snap and his chums could not see twenty feet in any direction  we are going to have our own troubles finding our camp he said after about a quarter of the distance across lake narsac had been covered  its as black as a stack of cats murmured whopper  has anybody got a lantern  nobody had and even matches were at a premium  the boys rowed and paddled on a short distance further and then came to a halt in a bunch  i must confess i am more or less turned around already said the doctors son  is our shore over there and he pointed with his hand  i think so answered giant  i think it is yonder answered snap and pointed at right angles to the direction shep had mentioned  and i think it is about between the two finished whopper  let us take the course whopper thinks is right said snap  we cant be so very far wrong anyway  anxious to get back to camp and get some rest they pulled with vigor  they kept this up for fully ten minutes and then the forward boat slid up on a bar of sand followed quickly by the second boat and the canoe  here this wont do cried shep  are we near shore questioned whopper  i cant see any land  neither could the others and all were more or less worried  they had struck the sand bar with such force that they had been carried well up on it when they tried to shove the boats off they found the task too much for them  the canoe however came away with little difficulty  shep you paddle around and see if you can locate the shore suggested snap and the doctors son sent the canoe first in one direction and then another  he was not afraid to go out of sight since he could easily hear their voices in the stillness of the night  i dont see any shore he announced after a search of a quarter of an hour  we must be stuck somewhere in the middle of the lake  that cant bethe middle is far too deep for any sand bars answered whopper  well you can hunt around if you want to said the doctors son rather shortly  the paddling had made him very tired  snap and whopper now got into the canoe and they went twice as far as shep had been  at last they struck a point of land in a direction they had imagined was far out in the lake  they followed this up and soon came to the shore but where they did not know  i think we are either above or below our camp said snap  or else on the same side of the lake that we started from said whopper  it would be just our luck to get completely twisted in this teetotal darkness  its worse than a pocket in a coal mine  they paddled back to the others and told them of what they had discovered  then a portion of the outfit was transferred to the empty rowboat and another effort was made to float both craft at last the rowboats slid off the sand bar and then they pulled to the point of land without further mishap  no one could tell where they were but snap giant and whopper imagined the spot must be half a mile or more below their camp they had landed in a wild place and walking along the shore was out of the question  we might as well stay where we are until morning said snap  if we try to move in this darkness we may only fall into more trouble  but the others preferred to get back to camp if possible and whopper volunteered to paddle up the shore while shep rowed in the other direction  if either found the camp he was to whistle or fire a shot as a signal  listen said giant after he and snap had been left alone over a quarter of an hour  i hear voices  both strained their ears and from the lake they heard a confused murmur  then came the splashing of oars or paddles and an exclamation of disgust  it is the spink crowd cried snap  they are on the lake  they must have followed us on the raft  yes and they are stuck on the sand bar just as we were said giant and grinned to himself in the dark  i hope they have to stay there  the talking out on the lake continued but presently it died away in the distance  evidently the party had freed the raft from the sand bar and was paddling in another direction  when whopper came back he said he had located the camp only a short distance away  the others then whistled for shep who soon came in and snap and giant told what they had heard  well get to camp and prepare to give those fellows a hot reception said the leader of the club  and then the two rowboats and the canoe moved off without further delay  the camp gained all of the boats were hauled up into the bushes out of sight and the outfit was taken back to the cabin  this had just been accomplished when giant who was on guard announced that the raft was coming ashore not a great distance away  might as well warn them off said snap  everybody take his gun and well take torches too  this plan was speedily carried out and just as ham spink started to leap to the shore he found himself confronted by the four boy hunters each with a torch in one hand and his gun held out in the other  stop ham spink cried snap  dont you dare to step a foot further  discovered muttered carl dudder in disgust  i told you to be careful  i want to talk to you murmured ham not knowing what else to say  tomorrow morning at ten oclock at your camp answered snap promptly  that was the bargain  but see here  we wont waste words ham  its ten oclock tomorrow and nothing else  we want our boat and our canoe and we want them now cried ike akley  it is not for you to dictate ike akley said shep  we want you to leave and be quick about it  we dont intend to stay up all night fooling with you  let us have our boat and the canoe and well promise not to molest you again said ham quite humbly  tomorrow at ten oclock said snap as firmly as ever  and let me tell you another thing  if you dont leave us alone now perhaps youll not get the boat and the canoe at all  the spink crowd wanted to argue but our friends would not listen one of the boys wanted to fight but the sight of the guns made him hold back  at last those on the raft put off from the shore and disappeared in the darkness  they are as mad as wet hens said giant  do you think theyll come back  possibly answered snap  well have to keep a strict watch  it was decided that only two boys should sleep at a time while the other pair remained on guard one at either side of the camp this plan was carried out but nothing came to disturb the young hunters and all managed to get a fairly good rest after their arduous doing of the early part of the night  at halfpast nine in the morning they started for the other side of lake narsac in their rowboat taking the two other craft with them  they looked for ham spink and his cronies but the camping spot was deserted  what can this mean questioned whopper  is it another trick  maybe they are at our camp this minute cried giant  we ought to have left somebody on guard  but he had hardly spoken when they saw a handkerchief waving from down the lake shore  they pulled in that direction and soon reached a small cleared spot  here the raft was beached and here lay the whole spink outfit in confusion  what brought you fellows here asked shep curiously for he could see that all those on shore were greatly excited  did you see it demanded one of the boys  we are going home declared ike akley and his manner showed that he was frightened almost out of his wits  let us have the boat and the canoe and we wont bother you any more said carl dudder  you can have the whole lake to yourselves  did we see what asked giant of the youth who had first spoken  the ghost was the unexpected reply  it came into our camp last night and we dont want to see it again  we are all going back to lake cameron     chapter xxv  jed sanborn brings news   that the spink crowd was thoroughly frightened there could not be the slightest doubt  even when they told their story many looked behind them as if they expected the ghost to pop out of the woods and clutch them by the shoulder  it seemed that the ghost had appeared shortly after they returned to their camp  it came up over the lake silently a figure in yellow with waving horns of red  it had stopped directly in front of the camp and had waved a menacing arm at the boys  then it had disappeared into the gloom of the night  it uttered some terrible things said carl dudder  it said something about being dead and about being buried  yes and then it uttered a hideous laugh said ike akley  i shall never forget thatit was awful and it seemed to go right through a fellow  why didnt you shoot at it asked snap  that is what i should have done  humph  i guess if you saw that ghost youd be paralyzed said carl dudder  why it was enough to make your hair raise on ends  i thought it was coming ashore and murder the lot of us said jack voss  then you are not going to stay here asked giant  not much  i am going down to lake cameron as quick as i can get there  so am i said another  you had better go down too said a third  no we are going to stay here answered shep  we havent seen the ghost but we have heard those ghostlike voices and we want to find out what it means  oh theres a real ghosti heard about it before i left home said carl dudder  but i didnt think it would visit us  id stay only the rest wont said ham spink thinking he must put on a bold front before snap and his chums  what are you talking about cried ike akley indignantly  why you were the first to propose going home  thats true said another boy  welleri thought perhaps you didnt care to stay stammered ham  anyway i think it is much nicer down to lake cameron he added hastily to change the subject  the snakes are numerous up here and game is scarce  well if you are going you can have your boat and the canoe said snap after a consultation with his chums  but you must give us your solemn promise not to molest us again  the others were perfectly willing to do that and the rowboat and the canoe were turned over to ham spink and his cronies  then our friends rowed out into the lake and hung around until the others loaded their craft and started away  now remember called snap after them  if you come back and molest us youll do it at your peril  we wont come back muttered ham  you can have that ghost all to yourselves added carl  hope it visits your camp tonighti guess youll be leaving in the morning just as we are doing and that was all that was said by the spink crowd  that ghost must have been something awful to look at was sheps remark as he and his chums rowed back to camp  if ever a crowd was scared they were  well if the ghost visits us maybe well be scared too answered giant  i dont believe in bragging until ive experienced a thing  giant doesnt want to be like the man who bragged of what he would do in case of a fire at his house said whopper  he was going to be calm and careful and do things just so  when the fire came he was the most excited fellow on the block and he carried the feather bed downstairs and then went up again and threw himself out of the third story window  the boys were content to take it easy for the rest of the day and for the balance of that week they did little but fish and laze around as giant put it  shep shot several birds and tried his skill at cleaning and stuffing them for he took an interest in taxidermy  snap hung up the deer skin to be cured  on sunday it rained and the storm continued monday and the greater part of tuesday  but the cabin was practically waterproof so they were comfortable  to pass the time they played games and cooked and baked many things which would have caused a chef to throw up his hands in wonder  they even made some rhubarb pie from some wild rhubarb found near the camp and this proved to be really excellent  once giant concocted a new dish made of fish stuffed with beans and flour paste but this was not voted a success  having sufficient sugar they made some candy one evening and this disappeared as if by magic  on wednesday morning whopper who had been outside to bring in some firewood came rushing to the cabin in great excitement  somebody has been at our game  some person or a wild animal  how do you know  the meat is gone  only a few bones remain  then it must have been a wildcat or a bear exclaimed snap  all ran to the spot where the meat had been hung up  the tree was scratched up and there were curious marks in the damp soil under it  a bear or a wildcat sure said snap after an inspection  let us go after itwhatever it is answered the doctors son  maybe the ghost stole it suggested giant but nobody accepted this idea  a hasty breakfast was had and the boys were on the point of going on a hunt when there came a call from the lake  a man in a canoe was paddling toward them  its jed sanborn cried snap and he was right  soon the old hunter had beached his craft and was shaking hands with them  all safe was his first question  all safe was the answer  thet ghost didnt eat ye up then  thought by what ham spink said yed be about dead when i got here and jed sanborn smiled grimly  where did you see ham asked the doctors son  down to fairview  when  day before yesterday  then they didnt remain at lake cameron cried snap  they was agoing to but they got into some sort o a quarrel an that broke the party up explained the old hunter  ham an carl dudder said the ghost came after em something terribul wall i believe itafter what i see myself and jed shook his head slowly  you aint had no trouble  weve heard strange voices thats all answered whopper  we havent seen the ghost  the old hunter soon told his story in detail  it seemed that ham spink and his cronies had told a terrible tale of being pursued by the ghost and of hearing awful groans and cries and this had alarmed mrs caslette very much and also mrs dodge and both ladies had requested the old hunter to visit the lake and make sure the young hunters were in no trouble  this lake is gittin an awful repertation said jed sanborn if it keeps on afore long nobody will come here no more  wed like to settle this ghost business said snap  we feel sure it can be explained in some way or another  well maybe but jed sanborn drew a deep breath  dont you go for to run no unnecessary risks thats all  oh well certainly try to keep out of danger answered the doctors son  your mother wants you to be partickerly careful said jed to giant  she says she wouldnt know what to do if something happened ye  tell her i shall take good care of myself answered the small member of the club  jed sanborn told them that everything was going on at fairview as usual  he had some letters for the lads which they read with interest  he said he would remain with them until the next morning and promised to take back such letters as they might write  if you stay over you might as well go on a hunt with us said snap and then he related how their meat had been stolen  wildcats did that announced jed sanborn after a close examination two on emmost likely mates  it will be a ticklish job trying to track em  oh weve shot wildcats before said whopper  not the kind thats around here my boy  these are the wildest and strongest kind  howsomever we can go after em if you say so when do you want to start  have you had breakfast asked snap  two hours ago  then let us start at once and so it was decided     chapter xxvi  a hunt after wildcats   as my old readers know jed sanborn knew all about wild animals and just how to trail them and the young hunters followed his directions readily  be sure your guns are in prime condition and loaded said jed  and as we may be out until nightfall better take a lunch with you  we have it in our gamebags answered the doctors son  good enough  they were soon on the way along a small trail leading directly away from lake narsac  it was uphill but the old hunter knew just how to turn to make climbing easy so although they covered a mile or more they were not greatly fatigued  i know we came for wildcats but if ye want some wild turkeys heres your chance said the old hunter presently and he pointed to the left of the trail  the boys gazed in that direction but saw nothing unusual and said so  the turkeys are in yonder tree answered jed sanborn  i jest saw two on em movin around on some branches  you certainly have keen eyes answered snap for the distance to the tree was at least a hundred and fifty yards  have to have lad to be a good shot was the reply  not to alarm the game jed sanborn told them to walk with care and led the way in a semicircle through the timber  then he told the boys to spread out around the tree  fire as soon as ye get a good chance but not afore said he  as they crawled closer they saw the wild turkeys quite plainly there was a gobbler and six or seven hens and they were roosting on several limbs close to the ground  must be gittin lazy to be on their perches so late in the morning observed jed  ought to have been scratchin fer a livin hours ago  well this suits us answered whopper  im going to try for the gobbler  ill take the one below him said snap  ill take the hen on the left came from giant  and ill try for the one on the right put in shep  what will you shoot at jed  before the old hunter could answer there was a stir on the tree the gobbler had heard them and he gave the alarm  up and out went the turkeys as fast as they could fly  bang bang went the shotguns and several more shots followed  jed sanborn had also taken aim  there was a great fluttering and down dropped two turkeys like lead  two hens fluttered around and the gobbler remained in the tree caught between two branches and breathing his last  hurrah let us finish them cried snap and ran forward  the next instant he felt one of the wounded turkeys strike his face he caught the game by the legs and then received a peck in the hand that drew blood  before the turkey could do any more harm the young hunter stunned it by a blow against the tree and then finished it  in the meantime the other hen was killed by whopper while jed sanborn took his gun and poked the gobbler out of the tree crotch and despatched him  certainly a good haul boys said the old hunter when the temporary excitement was over  youll have turkey meat enough to last some time  i know what i am going to do with the gobbler if youll let me said whopper  i am going to send him home to my folks if jed will carry him  sure i will my lad and ill carry some more if you wish jed continued looking at the other young hunters  let each of us send a turkey home suggested snap  that will show the folks that we are not starving and so it was agreed  tying the turkeys in a bunch they put them in a safe place on a tree and then continued up the mountainside  the recent rains had cleared the sky and washed the bushes and grass and the view was a most charming one  soon they came to a small clearing and from this could see over a large portion of the lakes surface  it certainly is a wild place was snaps comment  but some day the lumbermen will get in here and then youll see this forest melt like magic  yes and half the charm will be gone added jed sanborn  not much left after a saw mill gets started in a place like this  noon came and found them well up on the mountain  so far they had seen no game but the turkeys nor had they seen a further trace of the wildcats  they sat down in an open spot for lunch and rested for half an hour afterward  when the hunt was resumed jed sanborn turned along the mountainside where there were a series of shelving rocks  he had gone but a short distance when he uttered a cry  a bear a bear  where asked all of the others simultaneously  over on yonder cliff  there he goes  the young hunters looked in the direction indicated and saw a bear leaping swiftly from rock to rock  almost before they knew it he was out of sight  they were too far away to take a shot much to their disappointment  any use of going after him asked whopper  not now answered jed sanborn  hell be on guard all day  you can come back some other day if you want to  but be careful he dont chew ye up  again they went on and now came to a slight hollow on the mountainside  suddenly snap saw something moving cautiously over the rocks close at hand  theres a wildcat he cried and swinging around his gun he fired the wildcat was hit in the side but kept on  then giant fired hitting the beast in the head and it rolled from the rocks to a position almost at their feet  is it dead asked the doctors son  dead as a door nail announced the small youth after an examination  i think that wildcat came from yonder hole in the rocks said snap pointing to the opening in question  if he did there may be more of them there answered whopper how can we find out  might go up ring the doorbell and ask suggested snap with a grin  excuse me i dont want to walk into any wildcats hotel was whoppers answer  i heard of a fellow who did that once and when he came out he was still on the inside  still on the inside repeated jed sanborn  yesinside the wildcats and this answer made the old hunter roar loudly  let us throw rocks into the opening suggested giant and began to do as he had suggested  they heard a growl but no wildcats showed themselves  ill throw a firebrand in said jed sanborn and cut a dry cedar bough  stand ready to shoot if anything shows itself  with interest the boys watched the old hunter prepare his firebrand and light it  then he swung it into a lively blaze let fly and sent it whirling into the hollow among the rocks  hardly had the firebrand disappeared when there came a savage growl and some whines and from the hollow leaped a female wildcat with a little one in her teeth  after the two came another little one  as soon as the big wildcat appeared the boys blazed away and the mother and her offspring were shot dead  then whopper raised his shotgun to kill the other little one but suddenly lowered the weapon  i cant kill such a baby he murmured  i am sorry we killed the other little one added snap soberly  that little wildcat will soon be a big one so there is no use of letting it get away said jed sanborn and he discharged a shot that immediately finished the last of that wildcat family the boys gazed at the small wildcats with interest but did not want to pick them up and carry them away  somehow the killing of the little creatures appeared to put a damper on the whole days outing  when the party got back to the camp they had the turkeys several rabbits and also a number of squirrels to their credit  they retired early that evening and slept soundly  in the morning they thought they would arise early but found jed sanborn up ahead of them  your folks will enjoy them turkeys i know said the old hunter as he prepared to depart after eating a substantial breakfast theyll be proud to know you shot em  well we are proud of having done so answered shep  here are the letters and he handed over various written communications  now mind dont let that ghost carry you off warned jed as he started to paddle away in his canoe  i doubt if we even see the ghost answered snap  but he was mistaken they did see the ghost and that before very long  and the meeting led to a tremendous surprise     chapter xxvii  into a bears den   boys i move we go after that bear  it was snap who spoke on the morning of the second day after jed sanborn had left them  he was eating breakfast and so were his chums  you mean the bear we saw up on the mountain when we were after those wildcats queried giant  yes  somehow i think we can get him if we try hard enough  and it would be a feather in our caps to bring back a bear  all right im with you said shep  even if we dont get the bear we can climb to the top of the mountain and get a good look at the country for miles around  maybe well be able to see fairview  the proposal to go after the bear pleased all the young hunters and they decided to lose no time in getting ready for the trip  as there is no telling what luck we may have on the mountain or when well get back we had better take sufficient food with us to last all day suggested the doctors son  the sky looked a trifle uncertain to them but nobody wanted to stay in camp waiting for it to rain  they started off about nine oclock taking to the trail they had previously pursued  snap led the way with the others following in indian file  the leader of the club had a rifle while the others were provided with shotguns  they carried with them sufficient ammunition to bring down a dozen bears  noon found them well up on the mountain and in the vicinity where the bear had been seen  on the way they had stirred up some quail and giant had taken two shots before the others could stop him bringing down four of the birds  maybe that shot scared away mr bear said whopper  if it did well have our tramp for nothing  i am sorryi fired before i could think answered the small member of the club  ill not do it again  they now advanced in silence knowing that a bear has sharp ears and will run at the first intimation of danger  they kept their eyes and ears on the alert and their firearms ready for immediate use  look said whopper presently in a strained voice  dodge behind the rocks and he literally dragged snap down and the others came after the pair  what did you see asked shep  two bears  two came from the others  where  away up on the mountainside  they were on a shelf of rocks and seemed to be looking at something out on the lake  can we reach them with our guns asked giant  might reach one of em with the rifle  they were a good distance off  let us try to get closer said shep who did not want to miss a chance to aid in bringing down such big game  yes i dont want to have the only shot added snap  we all want a whack at them  with extreme caution one after another of the young hunters looked toward the shelf of rocks whopper pointed out  true enough two bears were there looking down toward lake narsac  as the boys watched the game they turned slowly and walked to the end of the shelf disappearing behind some bushes  i believe we can get at least one of those bears if we are careful said snap  dont you think it would be a good plan to above the bears by taking a roundabout route came from whopper  i think we can shoot down at them better than we can shoot up  besides if we are above them i think well be safer  they can jump down on us easily enough but jumping up is another matter  yes and if we cant kill them with shots perhaps we can knock em over with rocks said giant  as they toiled up the mountainside it grew darker and they noted that the sun had gone behind a mass of angrylooking clouds  far off they heard a rumbling that betokened a thunderstorm  that storm is certainly coming said snap  it wont be any fun to be caught up here either  perhaps it will pass off to the westward returned the doctors son hopefully  the clouds seem to be moving in that direction  they soon gained a point about on a level with the shelf of rocks upon which they had seen the bears but some distance to the southward climbing now became difficult and they had to help one another up the steep places  once whopper took a tumble and would have rolled down a long distance had not shep caught him just in time  you want to be very careful cautioned snap a roll down the mountainside might mean death  by the time they had reached a point about a hundred feet above the shelf of rocks they were so exhausted they had to sit down and rest they were now on another shelf and from this location could look out over the entire surface of lake narsac  not a boat or a person was to be seen  this is certainly a lonely spot was snaps comment  a hermit wouldnt wish for a more choice location  and he could get plenty of fish and game added whopper  and berries too when they were in season  and wild grapes and honey came from giant  but with all that who would want to be a hermit  not i answered snap  an outing like this is all well enough but when our vacation is at an end ill be glad enough to get back home  a few drops of rain were now coming down but to these the young hunters paid no attention  having gotten back their wind they moved along with caution their eyes wide open for another sight of the bears  each wished for the honor of discovering the big game  presently little giant held up his hand for the party to halt  he pointed to a spot a little below and to the right of them  there on a flat rock rested one of the bears gnawing on a bone he held in his forefeet  where is the other asked whopper in a whisper  all looked around but the second bear was nowhere in sight  might as well get one while we have the chance said snap  let us all fire at him at once  well be sure to lay him low  then load up as quickly as you can and well see if we cant stir up the second bear  so it was arranged and the four young hunters took careful aim at the creature on the rocks  it must be admitted that they were somewhat excited for a bear is no mean creature to tackle and will sometimes put up a fierce fight to defend itself  but they steadied their nerves as much as possible and snap gave the order to fire  crack bang went the rifle and the shotguns almost together and as the smoke cleared away they saw the bear leap up turn over and over on the rock and then tumble down the mountainside  weve got him  weve got him yelled giant enthusiastically  dont be so sure of it said snap  oh i am sure we hit him said whopper  why i aimed right for his head  i know we hit him but that isnt saying he is killed said shep although by the way he rolled over i guess he was pretty badly wounded  having reloaded they began to climb down the mountainside in the direction the bear had disappeared  they had gone less than two rods when shep who was in advance let up a yell  look out for the hole  where asked the others but before the doctors son could reply the others saw him sinking down  then they felt themselves going down also  it must be the bears den gasped giant  if it is we had better beware of the other bear came from whopper  down and down slid the four young hunters until they landed on a pile of tree limbs and dead leaves  they had gone down in a hole a dozen feet in diameter and fifteen or more feet deep  this hole opened into a sort of cave and from the cave came a growl that fairly made their hair raise on end  its the bears den sure cried whopper  yes and i hear the second bear gasped shep  get ready to shoot him as soon as he appears  all scrambled to their feet and brought around their weapons ready for use  they looked to ward the cavelike opening and waited anxiously  would the second bear leap out upon them and give them battle     chapter xxviii  the caves in the mountain   one two three minutes passed and still the young hunters stood with their firearms ready for use  but no bear showed itself  the silence was so intense it was positively painful  i am sure i heard him said the doctors son presently  so did i added snap  i think he must be laying for us thinking we are following him  excuse me from going into that cave came from whopper  why if a fellow went in there the bear would be sure to have everything all his own way  and youd come out and still be on the inside said snap with a short laugh  well i dont know about this he continued drawing a long breath  again they waited  then the leader of the club grew a little bolder and approached the mouth of the cave cautiously holding his rifle in front of him  snap be careful warned shep  let us get out of this hole and then throw fire brands into the cavelike we did when we were after the wildcats suggested giant  its going to be no easy matter getting out of this hole answered the doctors son  well the bears must get out  maybe notthat cave may have a back entrance  snap walked slowly to the very mouth of the cave and peered inside nothing was to be seen  he picked up a stone and threw it inside not a sound but the falling of the stone followed  i believe the bear has gone he announced  i cant hear a thing  he may be playing a trick on you snap said giant  no i think he has run away by some back door as you might call it  one after another the young hunters approached the mouth of the cave timidly and peered inside  as their eyes became accustomed to the gloom they made out that the cave was of good size  the other end was lost in the shadows  it had now begun to rain steadily and to keep from getting soaked they stepped into the mouth of the cave taking with them several dry sticks and some dry leaves from the bottom of the outer hole these they lit and used the sticks for torches  they saw at once that the cave was really a bears den for the bones of numerous animals lay scattered over the uneven flooring  but no bears were in sight and this made them bolder and more willing to inspect their surroundings  i believe that bear ran away said snap at last  for all we know well never see him again  well i want to see him but not at too close range answered the doctors son  they soon discovered that the cave was very irregular in shape running around under the mountain in something of the form of a double letter s  in some places the roof was far overhead while in others it came down in sharp rocks that they could readily touch with their hands  a fellow could camp out here if he wanted to said snap as he gazed around in curiosity  providing the bears did not disturb him answered giant  by the way what are you going to do about that bear we shot  oh well go after him later on answered the doctors son  perhaps hell get away  i think we can trail him by his blood said snap  he was certainly wounded quite a bit  i think he is dead  they walked on through the big cave finally reaching the other end  here they saw a small hole through which the rain was falling  thats the way the bear got out cried whopper  just listen to the rain exclaimed shep  i am glad we are under cover  it was now raining furiously while ever and anon they could see a flash of lightning and hear the crack of thunder  all were glad they were not on the mountainside  its dangerous to be in the forest during such lightning said the doctors son  we might be struck or caught by some falling tree  we might as well remain in the cave until the storm lets up said snap  around the small hole they found some more leaves and tree limbs and after several failuresfor the leaves were wetthey succeeded in building a small campfire  around this they huddled and ate their lunch in the meantime keeping on the alert for the possible appearance of the bear or of any other wild beast  the rain continued to come down as heavily as ever after they had finished their brief meal and growing impatient they began to wander around the cave peering into this corner and that  soon shep found an opening which led to a cave still higher up and through this they crawled  this must be the second story said whopper  see any bedrooms  this little joke made them all smile and put them a little more at ease  the upper cave was not as large as that below and from an opening at one end they could look out on the mountainside  but the opening was near the top of a cliff so getting out that way was impossible  i guess well have to climb down again to get out said snap  he had hardly spoken when there came a blinding flash of lightning followed immediately by a thunderbolt that was deafening  the cave was filled with a curious smell and giant and whopper were practically stunned for the moment  gracious that was a crash began snap when he broke off short a crash of another kind outside had reached his ears a big tree standing directly over the cave was coming down split in twain by the lightning stroke  it struck the top of the cave with tremendous force causing a number of loose stones to rattle down on the heads of the young hunters  we must get out of this  the place must be caving in  well be buried alive if we dont get out  the falling of the tree caused some rocks to shift and a moment later one fell close to the opening blocking it completely  then came an other shower of small stones and dirt  bewildered and badly frightened the boys ran to another part of the cave and hugged the big rocks  at that moment they all felt the cave might be their tomb  ii wish we had never cocome in here groaned whopper  id give all i am woworth to be out answered giant  snap and shep said nothing wondering what would happen next  a few more loose stones came down and that was all  i believe the worst is over said the leader of the club at last the lightning knocked down a tree and that loosened those stones thats all  thats all cried whopper  isnt that enough  did you want us to be buried alive  i move we get out of here as soon as we can came from giant  rain or no rain im not going to stay in this cave any longer  and i am with you added whopper  its a question how to get out answered the doctors son  that hole is shut by the rock that fell  well find some other hole or else go below said snap who was as willing as anyone to leave the place  they moved around examining one spot and then another  at two points they saw openings between the rocks but they were mere narrow slits and not one of the lads could get through them  i guess well have to go below said shep at last  i hate to do it too for it will be no easy matter to climb out of that hole where we took the tumble  its the only thing to do answered giant  come on he added staying here is making me nervous  if another tree should come down we might be buried alive  they went back and climbed down to the cave below  they had now but one torch and this was almost burnt out  as quickly as they could they hurried to where they thought the hole was located  only a mass of rocks and dirt met their view  what does this mean cried whopper  we have made a wrong turnthis is not the spot said giant  it looks like the spot to me added the doctors son doubtfully  it is the spot said snap and his voice betrayed his great anxiety  yes but where is the opening questioned the others in concert  it is gone  gone  yes there has been a landslide or something and the hole has been covered up     chapter xxix  visited by the ghost   for the moment after snap made his dismaying announcement none of the young hunters spoke  was it really truewas the hole covered up and were they buried alive under the mountain  it was a truly horrible thought and every one of the lads shivered they looked at the torch now burnt so low it was hard to hold and then gazed at each other  oh snap we must find some way out faltered giant  his voice shook so he could hardly speak  yes let us get out as soon as we can added whopper  they soon saw that what snap had said was truethere had been a heavy landslide and the hole beyond the cave was filled up completely through the loose rocks and dirt the water was trickling and soon formed a fairsized stream that flowed over the cave floor and disappeared into a crevice at one side  well we cant get out this way thats sure said snap after an examination  we must find some other opening  they hurried around bound to do what they could while the torch lasted  but soon the light flickered up and went out leaving them in total darkness  let us keep together said shep  it wont do to get separated  all were willing to follow his advice and they slung their firearms over their backs and took hold of hands  then they moved around the cave with caution  i see a light cried whopper when they had reached a far corner of the cave  look there  he pointed overhead  sure enough there was a small hole  through it ran a tiny stream of water  that hole wont do us any good sighed snap  in the first place it is too small and in the second place it is out of our reach well have to find something better  they moved on and after a long time had passed giant found a slit between two rocks  they made an examination and found one of the rocks loose  they rolled it away and felt a rush of pure wet air  heres an opening cried the small youth enthusiastically  oh if only we can make it large enough  we must make it large enough cried shep and then all went to work with vigor pulling back such rocks as they could move and digging at the dirt with their bare hands  they had to make a regular tunnel ten or more feet long and it took them over an hour to do it  their arms and backs ached from the labor and their hands were scratched and their finger nails torn but to all this they paid no attention  their sole thought was to get out of the cave that looked as if it might become their tomb  at last the opening was large enough to admit of the passage of whoppers body and he passed to the outside  then he dug from that end and presently shep came forth followed by giant and lastly by snap  thank heaven we are out of that murmured the doctors son and his chums echoed his sentiment  never had the outer world appeared so glorious to them  at that instant they were all ready to vow they would never enter a cave again  it was still raining and the day was fast drawing to a close  the lightning and thunder had passed away to the westward but they knew the downfall would last at least an hour or so longer  if we try to get down to our camp now well be soaked said snap as they gathered under the semiprotection of a large hemlock tree  the underbrush is loaded with water and if there is anything i hate it is to have a wet bough slash me in the face or breast  and we dont want to go back without that bear put in shep  no indeed cried giant  it cost us too much trouble to get a shot at him  wonder what became of the other bear mused whopper  oh he ran away said shep  more than likely well never see him again  if we could find a place that was half dry id be in favor of staying on the mountain all night went on the leader of the club we could build a fire and broil those quail giant shot  wed have a bird apiece and that would make a good supper with what is left of the lunch  the thing of it is to find the place put in giant  let us hunt around a little  they moved around with caution for they wanted to keep as dry as possible  at last they reached a low overhanging cliff well sheltered from the rain  here were some dry brushwood and a number of cedar trees and they speedily built a roaring fire and began to broil the birds giant had brought down  it was not a particularly inviting spot but it was better than being out in the open and they made the best of the situation they dried their wet coats and took their time eating supper and none of them thought of retiring until nearly nine oclock  by that time the storm had cleared away completely and the stars were showing themselves in the blue vault of heaven  fearful that some wild beasts might be around the young hunters resolved to take turns at standing guard  the campfire was kept burning for nobody wished to remain in such a locality in utter darkness  whopper remained on guard first and about midnight he was relieved by snap  the leader of the club had just put some fresh wood on the fire when he heard a strange sound some distance from the shelter  then came a mocking laugh  ha  ha  he is dead  i am dead  who will bury me came to his ears  the ghostly voice he muttered to himself  he gave a sudden shiver and then steadied himself  i am going to find out what it means or know the reason why and he gripped his gun tightly  did you speak snap questioned whopper who was just turning in on the pile of dry leaves the leader of the club had vacated  yesnoi dont know  i just heard something was the unsatisfactory reply  what did you hear and now whopper sat up  i heard that ghostlike voice  it wasthere it goes again  both boys listened and heard a hideous laugh  then came the words repeated many times  i am dead  he is dead  who will bury me  see the lights  i am dead  beware of the mountain  he is dead  the mountain will kill you  see the lights  who will bury me  ha ha  and then the strange voice died away in the distance  what on earth can it be gasped whopper  his face was deadly pale  dont ask me answered snap  whats up questioned giant who was a light sleeper and the sound of his voice awoke the doctors son  soon he and the small youth were acquainted with what had occurred  where did the voice go to asked shep  it seemed to fade away in the air  why didnt you take a shot at it  how can you shoot something you dont see demanded snap half indignantly  just let me spot that ghost and ill show you what ill do  let us keep quiet suggested whopper  perhaps it will come back  all sat down around the fire for further sleep was out of the question  thus an hour went by but nothing came to disturb them  looks as if the ghost business was finished for tonight remarked shep glancing around down the mountainside  then he leaped to his feet  oh  what did you see demanded the others leaping up also  the ghost  where  theredown among those tall trees  i dont see anything said snap after a careful look  it is gone now  oh what a looking thing the doctors son was breathing heavily  didnt you imagine it asked giant  no i saw it as plain as day  yellow or white  yellow and it had red horns just as ham spink said  which way was it moving  it seemed to be moving towards us but it disappeared behind some rocks  after this the four boys were silent straining their eyes and ears to see or hear the ghost  there it is fairly shouted whopper a minute later  there was no need to utter the words for the strange apparition was now in full view of all  it resembled the body of a man and glowed with a strange yellow light while the horns of red waved menacingly toward them  away away away came a deep voice  go away from the mountain and the lake and then raising a warning finger and pointing directly at the four young hunters the ghostly figure suddenly moved to one side and vanished     chapter xxx  the secret of the mysterious voice   what do you think of that  such was the question which several of the boys put to each other simultaneously  why didnt somebody shoot at the ghost asked snap  why didnt you shep queried giant  ieri forgot about it  the ghost vanished too quickly said snap  but keep on guardit may come back  if it does it will get something from me sure murmured the doctors son and raised his shotgun  what do you think it was asked whopper after a painful pause of several minutes  a man answered snap promptly  a man cried giant  yes a manand i dont know whether we ought to shoot at him or not continued the leader of the gun club  we certainly dont want to commit murder  but if its a man what is he playing ghost for queried the doctors son  that remains to be found out  your theory is all well enough said whopper but it doesnt account for the ghostlike voice  i know that  nevertheless i think that ghost is a man  the young hunters continued to discuss the situation from all possible points of view  snaps positive declaration that the ghost was a man made all feel less frightened and they were anxious to get better acquainted with the apparition  if its a man id like to capture him and give him a piece of my mind said whopper  what right has he to roam around like this frightening everybody he meets  he ordered us away from the mountain  most likely if it is a man he wants this territory to himself answered giant  thats the way i figure it said snap  he may be crazy and may think he owns the mountains and the lake  it couldnt be that old hermit peter peterson could it queried shep suddenly  thats who it is almost shouted whopper  its a trick of his to keep folks away from here  but why should he come to us with that story of his questioned giant  he told us that just to scare us  he thought we might go away from the lake at once  again there was a lively discussion and the young hunters agreed that if the ghost was indeed a man more than likely it was peterson  a fellow who would play such a trick ought to be tarred and feathered was whoppers comment  if it proves to be peterson well have him driven out of this neighborhood fast enough said snap  another hour went by and as the ghost did not reappear the young hunters grew heavy eyed and one after another took a short nap thus the night passed and at last the sun showed itself over the mountain top to the eastward heralding another day  with the coming of sunlight the boys were inclined to treat the coming of the ghost as a joke  they could not explain the ghostly voice however although snap said he imagined the man playing ghost might be a ventriloquist  some of those ventriloquists are very clever he asserted and they can throw their voices almost anywhere  the sun soon dried the grass and bushes and after eating what was left of the quail and the lunch brought from the camp the young hunters struck off in the direction whence the bear they had shot had disappeared  they traveled with extreme care for none of them wished to risk a tumble down the mountainside  look look yelled snap presently and pointed some distance ahead  wolves and they are at some game returned whopper  i do believe it is our bear  thats just what it is put in giant  what gall  let us open fire on em  the wolves were at least a dozen in number all big and powerful fellows  they had just come on the bear that was dead and were quarreling among themselves over the carcass  with great care the four boy hunters took aim at the wolves and at a command from snap let drive  as the reports died away two of the beasts were seen to be dead and two others were wounded the other wolves turned and retreated a few paces then paused and glared at those who had molested them  they are coming for us shouted whopper and the statement proved true  with wild yelps and snarls the wolves leaped forward  it was a moment of great peril and the young hunters fully realized their critical condition  shoot and jump for the nearest trees yelled snap and then let drive again  the others discharged the remaining loads in their shotguns and three more of the wolves were hit and one killed then one after another the young hunters scrambled up into the nearest trees  the boys thought they would have a hard fight with the remaining wolves but evidently the pack had had enough of the encounter for those that were wounded limped off growling savagely and the others followed leaving the dead where they had fallen  we came up in the nick of time said snap as he reloaded and leaped to the ground followed by his chums  a few minutes later and those beasts would have torn this bear limb from limb  i suppose they thought they were going to have the feast of their lives  the body of the bear was cold and stiff showing that it had died shortly after being shot  it was a goodsized creature and the young hunters felt justly proud of their quarry  i knew wed get plenty of small game but i was afraid we wouldnt get a bear said whopper  a bear always tops off a hunt said snap  that or a moose put in giant  id like to get a crack at a good big moose  i am afraid you want too much in this life answered snap with a laugh  the problem of how to get the carcass down to their camp was a serious one  they did not want to cut the bear up just yet nor did they want to spoil the skin by dragging it over the rocks  let us make a good strong drag of tree limbs suggested whopper we can bind the limbs together closely so the skin of the beast wont touch the ground after we have tied the bear on top  then we can all haul it down between the trees  maybe the bear will go down quicker than we anticipate said snap  but i reckon your suggestion is as good as anything  it took the best part of the morning to make a drag that was satisfactory and pry the big bear on it then the carcass was bound down with vines and cords  now everybody be careful cautioned snap  some of these rocks are very loose and it will be the easiest thing in the world to take a tumble and break an ankle or your neck  then the trip down the mountainside began  it was truly hard work for the drag caught on some rocks and slid altogether too fast over others  then at one point they came close to running into a nest of hornets  one of the wicked creatures stung whopper on the hand and another stung shep on the neck and there followed a wild dancing and yelling while the boys allowed the drag to tumble over and over down the rocks and ran for safety  look out for the hornets  well be stung to death  did you ever see the match groaned whopper after the excitement was over  just gaze on that handas big as a baseball mitt  and look at my neck came dolefully from the doctors son  a few of the hornets were buzzing around the fallen carcass of the bear and the young hunters did not dare to approach until the pests had departed  then the drag was righted and the journey down the mountainside was continued  who ever thought so many things would happen on this trip was snaps comment  first we shot the bear then we tumbled into the hole then we were buried alive next the ghost came along and then followed the wolves and the hornets  yes and we are not back to camp yet sighed giant  i think ill rest for a week after this  we ought to send this bear down to town said whopper  id like to put it on exhibition just to show ham spink and some other folks what we can do  well we might send it down in some way answered snap  but come on i am getting hungry and were a long way still from the lake shore  we are coming to a cliff of some sort announced giant who was in advance  take it easy now or the drag will drag you where you dont want to go  they advanced with caution and presently saw the cliff  below were some thick cedar trees the tops reaching just above the cliff  listen cried snap and put up his hand for silence  for a full minute they heard nothing and the others were just going to ask the leader what he had heard when there came a shrill laugh from the cedars  ha ha  i am dead  he is dead said a ghostly voice  who will bury me  see the lights  i am dead  he is dead  ha ha  the ghost gasped giant and made a movement as if to retreat  dont run commanded snap  it is broad daylight  let us investigate this matter  i am dead  he is dead  ha ha came the voice again and then followed a laugh that chilled them to the backbone  by this time all of the young hunters had their firearms around in front of them ready for use  well if this isnt the queerest began shep when there was a fluttering in the tops of the cedars and a big bird flew directly over their heads  as quick as a wink snap took aim with his rifle and let drive  the bird uttered a shrill cry almost human and fluttered down at their feet  then shep struck at it with his gun barrel and it fell over lifeless  a parrot  yes and hes the one who made the ghostly sounds  did you ever see the beat  no wonder we couldnt locate that voice in the dark  such were some of the comments of the young hunters as they gathered around the dead parrot  snap picked the creature up made certain it was dead and opened its mouth  yes he was a talker right enough he said  but id like to know who taught him to say such awful things and nothing else  most likely the fellow who is playing ghost answered whopper  yes and that fellow must be close by ejaculated giant  he and the parrot probably traveled together  in that case let us try to find mr ghost said the doctors son  now the mystery of the ghostly voice was explained he was no longer afraid  what will we do with the bear asked snap  it was voted to leave the carcass where it was and this decided upon the young hunters looked around for some way of getting down the cliff  heres a rope ladder cried snap  boys do you know what i think he added  what  i think we are near to where that ghost lives  then let us pay him a visit and ask him what he means by his outrageous conduct answered the doctors son  then all commenced to descend the rope ladder which led to the bottom of the cliff     chapter xxxi  the last of the ghostconclusion   it was a strong ladder and put up with care so the young hunters had no fear of falling  at the foot they discovered a welldefined trail running along the base of the cliff to where gushed forth a small stream of pure cold water  near the spring was an empty can evidently used as a drinking cup  the boys were thirsty and all took a drink  then they continued on the trail until they came in sight of a small log hut almost hidden among the trees and bushes  perhaps that is where mr ghost lives suggested whopper trying to speak as lightly as he could although his voice trembled slightly  we can knock on the door and ask answered snap  beware came suddenly from the vicinity of the hut  come not a step nearer if you value your lives  and then they saw the ghost like figure in yellow with the dangling red horns moving among the bushes  for just one moment the young hunters were badly frightened and inclined to run  then they gazed at each other questioningly and stood their ground  we want to talk to you cried snap  we know you are a humbug  yes and we know all about your parrot added the doctors son he did not deem it wise to mention that they had killed the talking bird  go away  go away answered the figure in yellow  this forest is mine  the lake is mine  go away ere it is too late  i believe that man is crazy whispered whopper  maybe he thinks he owns the earth  he is certainly no ghost answered snap  but if he is crazy well have to be careful how we approach him  he may try to shoot us  see here sir shouted the doctors son kindly  wont you come and talk with us  we dont want to hurt you or take your property away from you  ha ha i know you  you want to rob me of everything cried the man in yellow harshly  they now saw that what looked like horns was simply a yellow cap with two stuffed red appendages on top the man had his face smeared with yellow clay  well not harm you in the least said giant and now attracted by something in the strange mans appearance he went several steps closer  when the small youth of the club spoke the man turned to him  a moment later he started and throw up his hands in surprise  who are you boy  speak quickly he demanded  i am will caslette  ha where do you come from  i come from fairview on the rocky river  and youryour mother the man in yellow was now greatly agitated  my mother is a widow giant had now come closer still and was looking the man over carefully  what is your name  my name  ha ha i have no name  i am a wanderer  but you had a name oncewhat was it  my namei cannot remember  yes i had one once when i was in france fair france the belle of all countries  but the name is gonegone like the great history i was writing  yes and it will never come back never and the man in yellow threw up his hands despairingly  was not your name pierre dunrot asked giant quickly  the strange man staggered back as if shot  pierre dunrot  pierre dunrot he repeated slowly  yes yes that was my name  howhow did you know it  because you are my uncle gasped giant coming to the strange mans side  you are pierre dunrot my longlost uncle  your uncle  yes my uncle  do you not remember my mother kate caslette and do you not remember meyour little guillaume the boy you used to ride on your knee went on giant earnestly and looking the man straight in the eyes  yes yes  i remember now cried the man and now his eyes searched the small youths face  you are my little guillaume indeed he took giant by the hand  but how is thismy mind is in a whirl  i do not understand and he gazed from giant to the others in simpleminded perplexity  you ran away from home answered giant  it was after the storm when the lightning had burnt up the manuscript of your beloved history  yes yes yes  my beloved history  that is true  oh it was cruel cruel  after i had worked so many years and so faithfully my beloved history  it is gone never to return  and the tears ran down the cheeks of the man  uncle pierre you must give up your lonely life here said giant after a pause  you must come home with me  at this suggestion the hermit for the man was nothing less shook his head vigorously  he was certainly queertalking sometimes quite rationally and at others in a rambling fashion  he told how he had come to make his home in the mountains how he had once visited a large city and purchased three parrots and brought them to the wilderness and how one parrot had died and another had been shot  the third is still with me he continued  but i am tired of himhe is driving me crazy  he shall never bother you againif only you will come home with me said giant  you must come homemother wants to see you all your books are there  dont you remember how you used to love those books uncle pierre  yes yes the mans eyes began to glisten  and so you want me to go home  you look like a good boy guillaume  why does he call giant guillaume whispered whopper to snap  its the french for william answered the leader of the club say but doesnt this beat the dutch  if giant can get this uncle of his to go home perhaps theyll be able to get possession of that fortune of one hundred thousand francs was sheps comment  i hope they can get it for mrs caslette certainly deserves the money and needs it  giant continued to talk to the hermit and gradually the other boys joined in the conversation  the young hunters soon saw that pierre dunrots mind was very hazy on some matters while clear on others  since running away from the caslette home he had lived in the mountains near the lake and he had taken every precaution to keep other folks away from him  he had taught his parrots to scare newcomers and had played ghost by rubbing phosphorus and other shining substances on his clothing and cap  he said he owned several canoes hidden along the lake shore and in these he sometimes went fishing usually at night  well this solves the mystery of the ghost anyway said snap wont folks around fairview be astonished when they hear of it  i dont believe we ought to let folks know all the details answered the doctors son  it would hurt giants feelings and also his mothers  we can simply say we caught the ghost and he proved to be a harmless old man with a talking parrot and that we shot the parrot and the man left the vicinity of the lake after his parrot was dead  and so it was agreed  of course the boys parents heard the real story but that was as far as the tale circulated  the boys went into the log hut and there saw how the hermit had been living in his primitive way  in a corner he had a box filled with ammunition for his gun and also a large collection of hooks and lines  he had a plate a cup and a kettle and pan and that was all  he ate from a block of wood and slept on a heap of cedar boughs  his clothing was almost worn to rags  it took a great deal of talking to get him to consent to return to civilization but finally giant accomplished his purpose then the young hunters told about the dead bear and the hermit showed them how to get the carcass down to the lake front without much trouble  once at the camp pierre dunrot was given some clean garments and before donning them he took a bath in the lake when he had put on the clean clothing he looked like a different individual  of course giant was anxious to get home at once and his chums could not blame him  the others wanted to take the bear to town and so it was decided that the return home should begin the next morning  the journey to fairview took three days the boys pushing along as rapidly as circumstances would permit  the companionship of the lads appeared to brighten pierre dunrots mind wonderfully and it was only now and then that he relapsed into his former simpleness  fairview reached giant lost no time in hurrying his uncle to his home  mrs caslette was sitting by a window sewing when the pair appeared  why will she called out and arose  then she looked at the man  can it be possible  pierre and she stood still staring at her relative  yes it is really uncle pierre cried giant  the next moment the man and the woman were kissing each other  mrs caslette was bewildered and it took some time for giant to tell his story  then pierre dunrot had his say  he was greatly excited over coming back and that night had to be placed in a physicians care  dr reed attended him and came to see the former hermit for a week  pierre dunrot had quite a severe spell of sickness mostly due to his weak brain but when he got over it he was clearerminded than he had been for years  the past is like some awful dream he said  i do not understand how i came to run away  later on he spoke of the fortune that was coming to mrs caslette and himself  he remembered all the details and through the efforts of a lawyer the hundred thousand francs at last came into possession of the rightful owners  the bringing in of the big bear by the boy hunters caused something of a sensation in fairview  the bear was put on exhibition for a day at one of the stores and then cut up and the meat distributed the skin was properly cured and today forms a rug in the reed parlor  how the doctor came to gain possession of it will be told in another story  of course ham spink and his cronies were very envious of the young hunters luck and they tried to circulate a story that snap and his friends had bought the dead bear from some old hunter but nobody would listen to the yarn  we know they can hunt said one man  they are the best shots in this town and his opinion was the opinion of the majority  shall we go back to the lake and the woods asked snap one day remember the vacation is not yet half over  my father wants us to go back answered the doctors son  hes got a plan he would like us to carry out  and then shep told what the plan was  the others instantly agreed to it and what they did will be related in the next volume of this series to be entitled out with gun and camera or the boy hunters in the mountains taking photographs of wild animals is both exciting and dangerous and in the new book we shall learn much concerning this new fad  well we had a dandy time observed snap  yes and we cleared up the mystery of the ghost in great shape replied shep  id like to bring down a few more bears put in whopper  and id like to get a shot at a moose came from giant  all in good time answered snap  for the time we were out i think we got our full share of game  we certainly did cried the others  the end
