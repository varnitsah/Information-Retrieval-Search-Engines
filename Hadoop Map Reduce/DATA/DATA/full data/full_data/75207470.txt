                 1908  the following collection of verses written at various times and places principally after the author’s final departure from england in 1887 was sent home by him for publication some months before his death  he had tried them in several different orders and under several different titles as “songs and notes of travel” “posthumous poems” etc and in the end left their naming and arrangement to the present editor with the suggestion that they should be added as book iii to future editions of “underwoods”  this suggestion it is proposed to carry out but in the meantime for the benefit of those who possess “underwoods” in its original form it has been thought desirable to publish them separately in the present volume  they have already been included in the edinburgh edition of the author’s works                                                                     s c                                   contents             i  the vagabond—give to me the life i love

duskier lustre       whose favour still i wear    the snow be in her kirtle       the rose be in her hair     the hue of highland rivers       careering full and cool    from sable on to golden       from rapid on to pool—    the hue of heatherhoney       the hue of honeybees    shall tinge her golden shoulder       shall gild her tawny knees     ix      let beauty awake in the morn from beautiful dreams          beauty awake from rest          let beauty awake          for beauty’s sake    in the hour when the birds awake in the brake          and the stars are bright in the west     let beauty awake in the eve from the slumber of day          awake in the crimson eve          in the day’s dusk end          when the shades ascend    let her wake to the kiss of a tender friend

me    of green days in forests and blue days at sea     i will make my kitchen and you shall keep your room    where white flows the river and bright blows the broom    and you shall wash your linen and keep your body white    in rainfall at morning and dewfall at night     and this shall be for music when no one else is near    the fine song for singing the rare song to hear    that only i remember that only you admire    of the broad road that stretches and the roadside fire     xii—we have loved of yore to an air of diabelli      berried brake and reedy island       heaven below and only heaven above    through the sky’s inverted azure       softly swam the boat that bore our love          bright were your eyes as the day          bright ran the stream          bright hung the sky above    days of april airs of eden       how the glory died through golden hours    and the shining moon arising       how the boat drew homeward filled with flowers          bright were your eyes in the night          we have lived my love—          o we have loved my love     frost has bound our flowing river       snow has whitened all our island brake    and beside the winter fagot       joan and darby doze and dream and wake          still in the river of dreams          swims the boat of love—          hark chimes the falling oar    and again in winter evens       when on firelight dreaming fancy feeds    in those ears of agèd lovers       love’s own river warbles in the reeds          love still the past o my love          we have lived of yore          o we have loved of yore     xiii—mater triumphans      son of my woman’s body you go to the drum and fife    to taste the colour of love and the other side of life—    from out of the dainty the rude the strong from out of the frail    eternally through the ages from the female comes the male     the ten fingers and toes and the shelllike nail on each    the eyes blind as gems and the tongue attempting speech    impotent hands in my bosom and yet they shall wield the sword    drugged with slumber and milk you wait the day of the lord     infant bridegroom uncrowned king unanointed priest    soldier lover explorer i see you nuzzle the breast    you that grope in my bosom shall load the ladies with rings    you that came forth through the doors shall burst the doors of    kings     xiv      bright is the ring of words       when the right man rings them    fair the fall of songs       when the singer sings them    still they are carolled and said—       on wings they are carried—    after the singer is dead       and the maker buried     low as the singer lies       in the field of heather    songs of his fashion bring       the swains together    and when the west is red       with the sunset embers    the lover lingers and sings       and the maid remembers     xv      in the highlands in the country places    where the old plain men have rosy faces    and the young fair maidens    quiet eyes    where essential silence cheers and blesses    and for ever in the hillrecesses    her more lovely music    broods and dies     o to mount again where erst i haunted    where the old red hills are birdenchanted    and the low green meadows    bright with sward    and when even dies the milliontinted    and the night has come and planets glinted    lo the valley hollow    lampbestarred     o to dream o to awake and wander    there and with delight to take and render    through the trance of silence    quiet breath    lo for there among the flowers and grasses    only the mightier movement sounds and passes    only winds and rivers    life and death     xvi to the tune of wandering willie      home no more home to me whither must i wander       hunger my driver i go where i

draws     when all the snowy hill    and the bare woods are still    when snipes are silent in the frozen bogs    and all the garden garth is whelmed in mire    lo by the hearth the laughter of the logs—    more fair than roses lo the flowers of fire  saranac lake     xviii      the stormy evening closes now in vain    loud wails the wind and beats the driving rain          while here in sheltered house          with fireypainted walls          i hear the wind abroad          i hark the calling squalls—    ‘blow blow’ i cry ‘you burst your cheeks in vain    blow blow’ i cry ‘my love is home again’     yon ship you chase perchance but yesternight    bore still the precious freight of my delight          that here in sheltered house          with fireypainted walls          now hears the wind abroad          now harks the calling squalls    ‘blow blow’ i cry ‘in vain you rouse the sea    my rescued sailor shares the fire with me’     xix—to dr hake on receiving a copy of verses      in the belovèd hour that ushers day    in the pure dew under the breaking grey    one bird ere yet the woodland quires awake    with brief réveillé summons all the brake    chirp chirp it goes nor waits an answer long    and that small signal fills the grove with song     thus on my pipe i breathed a strain or two    it scarce was music but ’twas all i knew    it was not music for i lacked the art    yet what but frozen music filled my heart     chirp chirp i went nor hoped a nobler strain    but heaven decreed i should not pipe in vain    for lo not far from there in secret dale    all silent sat an ancient nightingale    my sparrow notes he heard thereat awoke    and with a tide of song his silence broke     xx—to       i knew thee strong and quiet like the hills    i knew thee apt to pity brave to endure    in peace or war a roman full equipt    and just i knew thee like the fabled kings    who by the loud seashore gave judgment forth    from dawn to eve bearded and few of words    what what was i to honour thee  a child    a youth in ardour but a child in strength    who after virtue’s golden chariotwheels    runs ever panting nor attains the goal    so thought i and was sorrowful at heart     since then my steps have visited that flood    along whose shore the numerous footfalls cease    the voices and the tears of life expire    thither the prints go down the hero’s way    trod large upon the sand the trembling maid’s    nimrod that wound his trumpet in the wood    and the poor dreaming child hunter of flowers    that here his hunting closes with the great    so one and all go down nor aught returns     for thee for us the sacred river waits    for me the unworthy thee the perfect friend    there blame desists there his unfaltering dogs    he from the chase recalls and homeward rides    yet praise and love pass over and go in    so when beside that margin i discard    my more than mortal weakness and with thee    through that still land unfearing i advance    if then at all we keep the touch of joy    thou shalt rejoice to find me altered—i    o felix to behold thee still unchanged     xxi      the morning drumcall on my eager ear    thrills unforgotten yet the morning dew    lies yet undried along my field of noon     but now i pause at whiles in what i do    and count the bell and tremble lest i hear    my work untrimmed the sunset gun too soon     xxii      i have trod the upward and the downward slope    i have endured and done in days before    i have longed for all and bid farewell to hope    and i have lived and loved and closed the door     xxiii      he hears with gladdened heart the thunder       peal and loves the falling dew    he knows the earth above and under—       sits and is content to view     he sits beside the dying ember       god for hope and man for friend    content to see glad to remember       expectant of the certain end     xxiv      farewell fair day and fading light    the clayborn here with westward sight    marks the huge sun now downward soar    farewell  we twain shall meet no more     farewell  i watch with bursting sigh    my late contemned occasion die    i linger useless in my tent    farewell fair day so foully spent     farewell fair day  if any god    at all consider this poor clod    he who the fair occasion sent    prepared and placed the impediment     let him diviner vengeance take—    give me to sleep give me to wake    girded and shod and bid me play    the hero in the coming day     xxv—if this were faith      god if this were enough    that i see things bare to the buff    and up to the buttocks in mire    that i ask nor hope nor hire    nut in the husk    nor dawn beyond the dusk    nor life beyond death    god if this were faith     having felt thy wind in my face    spit sorrow and disgrace    having seen thine evil doom    in golgotha and khartoum    and the brutes the work of thine hands    fill with injustice lands    and stain with blood the sea    if still in my veins the glee    of the black night and the sun    and the lost battle run    if an adept    the iniquitous lists i still accept    with joy and joy to endure and be withstood    and still to battle and perish for a dream of good    god if that were enough     if to feel in the ink of the slough    and the sink of the mire    veins of glory and fire    run through and transpierce and transpire    and a secret purpose of glory in every part    and the answering glory of battle fill my heart    to thrill with the joy of girded men    to go on for ever and fail and go on again    and be mauled to the earth and arise    and contend for the shade of a word and a thing not seen with the    eyes    with the half of a broken hope for a pillow at night    that somehow the right is the right    and the smooth shall bloom from the rough    lord if that were enough     xxvi—my wife      trusty dusky vivid true    with eyes of gold and brambledew    steeltrue

fancy filled    hence the long roads my home i made    tossed much in ships have often laid    below the uncurtained sky my head    raindeluged and windbuffeted    and many a thousand hills i crossed    and corners turned—love’s labour lost    till lady to your isle of sun    i came not hoping and like one    snatched out of blindness rubbed my eyes    and hailed my promised land with cries     yes

look to either hand    and knew i was in fairyland    and yet one point of being so    i lacked  for lady as you know    whoever by his might of hand    won entrance into fairyland    found always

this page it will be like a weed gathered and pressed at home and she will remember her own islands and the shadow of the mighty tree and she will hear the peacocks screaming in the dusk and the wind blowing in the palms and she will think of her father sitting there alone—r l s     forth from her land to mine she goes    the island maid the island rose    light of heart and bright of face    the

entry of the lane—    the wild lane with the bramble and the brier    the yearold carttracks perfect in the mire    the wayside smoke perchance the dwarfish huts    and ramblers’ donkey drinking from the ruts—    long ere you trace how deviously it leads    back from man’s chimneys and the bleating meads    to the woodland shadow to the sylvan hush    when but the brooklet chuckles in the brush—    back from the sun and bustle of the vale    to where the great voice of the nightingale    fills all the forest like a single room    and all the banks smell of the golden broom    so wander on until the eve descends    and back returning to your firelit friends    you see the rosy sun despoiled of light    hung caught in thickets like a schoolboy’s kite     here from the sea the unfruitful sun

scowling town    we gloomed and shivered sorrowed sobbed and feared    the belching winter wind the missile rain    the rare and welcome silence of the snows    the laggard morn the haggard day the night    the grimy spell of the nocturnal town    do you remember—ah could one forget     as when the fevered sick that all night long    listed the wind intone and hear at last    the everwelcome voice of chanticleer    sing in the bitter hour before the dawn—    with sudden ardour these desire the day    so sang in the gloom of youth the bird of hope    so we exulting hearkened and desired    for lo as in the palace porch of life    we huddled with chimeras from within—    how sweet to hear—the music swelled and fell    and through the breach of the revolving doors    what dreams of splendour blinded us and fled     i have since then contended and rejoiced    amid the glories of the house of life    profoundly entered and the shrine beheld    yet when the lamp from my expiring eyes    shall dwindle and recede the voice of love    fall insignificant on my closing ears    what sound shall come but the old cry of the wind    in our inclement city what return    but the image of the emptiness of youth    filled with the sound of footsteps and that voice    of discontent and rapture and despair    so as in darkness from the magic lamp    the momentary pictures gleam and fade    and perish and the night resurges—these    shall i remember and then all forget  apemama     xxxv      the tropics vanish and meseems that i    from halkerside from topmost allermuir    or
