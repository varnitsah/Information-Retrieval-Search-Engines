28590715	the battle and the breeze by rm ballantyne   in this shortish book we have a description of the battle of the nile in which the naval forces of admiral nelson fought and defeated the french the story is made more human by recounting tales of the life of a british seaman bill bowls along with incidents involving his friends ben bolter and tom riggles   the battle and the breeze by rm ballantyne    chapter one  touches on our heros early life experiences and adventures  bill bowls was the most amiable gentle kindly and modest fellow that ever trod the deck of a manofwar  he was also one of the most lionhearted men in the navy  when bill was a babya roundfaced largeeyed fatlegged baby as unlike to the bronzed whiskered strapping seaman who went by the name of fighting bill as a jackdaw is to a marlinespikewhen bill was a baby his father used to say he was just cut out for a sailor and he was right for the urchin was overflowing with vigour and muscular energy  he was utterly reckless and very earnestwe might almost say desperately earnest  whatever he undertook to do he did with a will  he spoke with a will listened with a will laughed yelled ate slept wrought and fought with a will  in short he was a splendid little fellow and therefore as his father wisely said was just cut out for a sailor  bill seemed to hold the same opinion for he took to the water quite naturally from the very commencement of life  he laughed with glee when his mother used to put him into the washtub and howled with rage when she took him out  dancing bareheaded under heavy rain was his delight wading in ponds and rivers was his common practice and tumbling into deep pools was his most ordinary mishap  no wonder then that bill learned at an early age to swim and also to fear nothing whatever except a blowingup from his father  he feared that but he did not often get it because although full of mischief as an egg is full of meat he was goodhumoured and bidable and like all lionhearted fellows he had little or no malice in him  he began his professional career very early in life  when in after years he talked to his comrades on this subject he used to say  yes mates i did begin to study navigation wen i was about two foot highmore or lessan i tell e what it is theres nothin like takin old father time by the forelock  i was about four year old when i took my first start in the nautical way and praps ye wont believe it but its a fact i launched my first ship myself owned her commanded and navigated her and was wrecked on my first voyage  it happened this way my father was a millwright he was and lived near a small lake where i used to splutter about a good deal  one day i got hold of a big plank launched it after half an hour o the hardest work i ever had got on it with a bit of broken palm for an oar an shoved off into deep water  it was a splendid burst  away i went with my heart in my mouth and my feet in the water tryin to steady myself but as ill luck would have it just as i had got my ship on an even keel an was beginnin to dip my oar with great caution a squall came down the lake caught me on the starboard quarter and threw me on my beamends of coorse i went sowse into the water and had only time to give out one awful yell when the water shut me up  fortnitly my father heard me jumped in and pulled me out but instead of kicking me or blowin me up he told me that i should have kept my weathereye open an met the squall head to wind  then he got hold of the plank and made me try it again and didnt leave me till i was able to paddle about on that plank almost as well as any eskimo in his skin canoe  my good old dad finished the lesson by tellin me to keep always in shoal water till i could swim and to look out for squalls in future  it was lucky for me that i had learned to obey him for many a time i was capsized after that when nobody was near me but bein always in shoal water i managed to scramble ashore  as bill bowls began life so he continued it  he went to sea in good earnest when quite a boy and spent his first years in the coasting trade in which rough service he became a thorough seaman and was wrecked several times on various parts of our stormy shores  on reaching mans estate he turned a longing eye to foreign lands and in course of time visited some of the most distant parts of the globe so that he may be said to have been a great traveller before his whiskers were darker than a ladys eyebrows  during these voyages as a matter of course he experienced great variety of fortune  he had faced the wildest of storms and bathed in the beams of the brightest sunshine  he was as familiar with wreck as with rations every species of nautical disaster had befallen him typhoons cyclones and simooms had done their worst to him but they could not kill him for bill bore a sort of charmed life and invariably turned up again no matter how many of his shipmates went down  despite the rough experiences of his career he was as fresh and goodlooking a young fellow as one would wish to see  before proceeding with the narrative of his life we shall give just one specimen of his experiences while he was in the merchant service  having joined a ship bound for china he set sail with the proverbial light heart and light pair of breeches to which we may add light pockets  his heart soon became somewhat heavier when he discovered that his captain was a tyrant whose chief joy appeared to consist in making other people miserable  bill bowlss nature however was adaptable so that although his spirits were a little subdued they were not crushed he was wont to console himself and his comrades with the remark that this state of things couldnt last for ever that the voyage would come to an end some time or other and that men should never say die as long as there remained a shot in the locker  that voyage did come to an end much sooner than he or the tyrannical captain expected  one evening our hero stood near the binnacle talking to the steersman a sturdy middleaged sailor whose breadth appeared to be nearly equal to his length  tom riggles said bill somewhat abruptly were goin to have dirty weather  thats so lad im not goin to deny it replied tom as he turned the wheel a little to windward  most landsmen would have supposed that bills remark should have been we have got dirty weather for at the time he spoke the good ship was bending down before a stiff breeze which caused the dark sea to dash over her bulwarks and sweep the decks continually while thick clouds the colour of peasoup were scudding across the sky but seafaring men spoke of it as a capful of wind and bills remark was founded on the fact that for an hour past the gale had been increasing and the appearance of sea and sky was becoming more threatening  that night the captain stood for hours holding on to the weathershrouds of the mizzenmast without uttering a word to any one except that now and then at long intervals he asked the steersman how the ships head lay  dark although the sky was it did not seem so threatening as did the countenance of the man who commanded the vessel  already the ship was scudding before the wind with only the smallest rag of canvas hoisted yet she rose on the great waves and plunged madly into the hollows between with a violence that almost tore the masts out of her  the chiefmate stood by the wheel assisting the steersman the crew clustered on the starboard side of the forecastle casting uneasy glances now at the chaos of foaming water ahead and then at the face of their captain which was occasionally seen in the pale light of a stray moonbeam  in ordinary circumstances these men would have smiled at the storm but they had unusual cause for anxiety at that time for they knew that the captain was a drunkard and from the short experience they had already had of him they feared that he was not capable of managing the ship  had we not better keep her a point more to the southard sir said the mate to the captain respectfully touching his cap reefs are said to be numerous here about  no mister wilson answered the captain with the gruff air of a man who assumes and asserts that he knows what he is about and does not want advice  keep her a point to the west he added turning to the steersman  there was a cry at that momenta cry such as might have chilled the blood in the stoutest heart  rocks ahead  port port hardaport shouted the men  their hoarse voices rose above the gale but not above the terrible roar of the surf which now mingled with the din of the storm  the order was repeated by the mate who sprang to the wheel and assisted in obeying it  round came the gallant ship with a magnificent sweep and in another moment she would have been head to wind when a sudden squall burst upon her broadside and threw her on her beamends  when this happened the mate sprang to the companionhatch to get an axe intending to cut the weathershrouds so that the masts might go overboard and allow the ship to right herself for as she then lay the water was pouring into her  tom riggles was when she heeled over thrown violently against the mate and both men rolled to leeward  this accident was the means of saving them for the time for just then the mizzen rigging gave way the mast snapped across and the captain and some of the men who had been hastening aft were swept with the wreck into the sea  a few minutes elapsed ere tom and the mate gained a place of partial security on the poop  the scene that met their gaze there was terrible beyond description  not far ahead the sea roared in irresistible fury on a reef of rocks towards which the ship was slowly drifting  the light of the moon was just sufficient to show that a few of the men were still clinging to the rail of the forecastle and that the rigging of the main and foremasts still held fast  have you got the hatchet yet asked tom of the mate who clung to a belayingpin close behind him  ay but what matters it whether we strike the rocks on our beamends or an even keel  the mate spoke in the tones of a man who desperately dares the fate which he cannot avoid  here let me have it cried tom  he seized the hatchet as he spoke and clambered to the gangway  a few strokes sufficed to cut the overstrained ropes and the mainmast snapped off with a loud report and the ship slowly righted  hold on shouted tom to a man who appeared to be slipping off the bulwarks into the sea  as no reply was given the sailor boldly leapt forward caught the man by the collar and dragged him into a position of safety  why bill my boy ist you exclaimed the worthy man in a tone of surprise as he looked at the face of our hero who lay on the deck at his feet but poor bill made no reply and it was not until a glass of rum had been poured down his throat by his deliverer that he began to recover  several of the crew who had clung to different parts of the wreck now came aft one by one until most of the survivors were grouped together near the wheel awaiting in silence the shock which they knew must inevitably take place in the course of a few minutes for the ship having righted now drifted with greater rapidity to her doom  it was an awful moment for these miserable men  if they could have only vented their feelings in vigorous action it would have been some relief but this was impossible for wave after wave washed over the stern and swept the decks obliging them to hold on for their lives  at last the shock came  with a terrible crash the good ship struck and recoiled quivering in every plank  on the back of another wave she was lifted up and again cast on the cruel rocks  there was a sound of rending wood and snapping cordage and next moment the foremast was in the sea tossing violently and beating against the ships side to which it was still attached by part of the rigging  three of the men who had clung to the shrouds of the foremast were swept overboard and drowned  once more the wreck recoiled rose again on a towering billow and was launched on the rocks with such violence that she was forced forward and upwards several yards and remained fixed  slight although this change was for the better it sufficed to infuse hope into the hearts of the hitherto despairing sailors  the dread of being instantly dashed to pieces was removed and with one consent they scrambled to the bow to see if there was any chance of reaching the shore  clinging to the forepart of the ship they found the cook a negro whose right arm supported the insensible form of a womanthe only woman on board that ship  she was the wife of the carpenter  her husband had been among the first of those who were swept overboard and drowned  hold on to her massa exclaimed the cook my arm amost brok  the mate to whom he appealed at once grasped the woman and was about to attempt to drag her under the lee of the caboose when the vessel slipped off the rocks into the sea parted amidships and was instantly overwhelmed  for some minutes bill bowls struggled powerfully to gain the shore but the force of the boiling water was such that he was as helpless as if he had been a mere infant his strength great though it was began to fail several severe blows that he received from portions of the wreck nearly stunned him and he felt the stupor that preceded death overpowering him when he was providentially cast upon a ledge of rock against the same ledge most of his shipmates were dashed by the waves and killed but he was thrown upon it softly  retaining sufficient reason to realise his position he clambered further up the rocks and uttered an earnest thank god as he fell down exhausted beyond the reach of the angry waves  soon however his energies began to revive and his first impulse when thought and strength returned was to rise and stagger down to the rocks to assist if possible any of his shipmates who might have been cast ashore  he found only one who was lying in a state of insensibility on a little strip of sand  the waves had just cast him there and another towering billow approached which would infallibly have washed him away had not bill rushed forward and dragged him out of danger  it proved to be his friend tom riggles  finding that he was not quite dead bill set to work with all his energy to revive him and was so successful that in halfanhour the sturdy seaman was enabled to sit up and gaze round him with the stupid expression of a tipsy man  come cheer up said bill clapping him on the back youll be all right in a short while  wots to do said tom staring at his rescuer  youre all right repeated bill  one good turn deserves another tom  you saved my life a few minutes ago and now ive hauled you out o the water old boy  the sailors faculties seemed to return quickly on hearing this  he endeavoured to rise exclaiming  any more saved  i fear not answered bill sadly shaking his head  lets go see cried tom staggering along the beach in search of his shipmates but none were found all had perished and their bodies were swept away far from the spot where the ship had met her doom  at daybreak it was discovered that the ship had struck on a low rocky islet on which there was little or no vegetation  here for three weeks the two shipwrecked sailors lived in great privation exposed to the inclemency of the weather and subsisting chiefly on shellfish  they had almost given way to despair when a passing vessel observed them took them off and conveyed them in safety to their native land  such was one of the incidents in our heros career    chapter two  commences the story  about the beginning of the present century during the height of the war with france the little fishing village of fairway was thrown into a state of considerable alarm by the appearance of a ship of war off the coast and the landing therefrom of a body of bluejackets  at that time it was the barbarous custom to impress men willing or not willing into the royal navy  the more effective and at the same time just method of enrolling men in a naval reserve force had not occurred to our rulers and as a natural consequence the inhabitants of seaport towns and fishing villages were on the constant lookout for the pressgang  at the time when the manofwars boat rowed alongside of the little jetty of fairway an interesting couple chanced to be seated in a bower at the back of a very small but particularly neat cottage near the shore  the bower was in keeping with its surroundings being the half of an old boat set up on end  roses and honeysuckle were trained up the sides of it and these mingling their fragrance with the smell of tar diffused an agreeable odour around  the couple referred to sat very close to each other and appeared to be engaged in conversation of a confidential nature  one was a fair and rather pretty girl of the fishing community  the other was a stout and uncommonly handsome man of fiveandtwenty apparently belonging to the same class but there was more of the regular sailor than the fisherman in his costume and appearance  in regard to their conversation it may be well perhaps to let them speak for themselves  i tell ee wot it is nelly blyth said the man in a somewhat stern tone of voice it wont suit me to dillydally in this here fashion any longer  youve kept me hanging off and on until i have lost my chance of gettin to be mate of a noocastle collier an here i am now with nothin to do yawin about like a dutchman in a heavy swell an feelin ashamed of myself  dont be so hasty bill replied the girl glancing up at her lovers face with an arch smile what would you have  what would i have repeated the sailor in a tone of mingled surprise and exasperation  well i neverno i never did see nothin like you women for bamboozlin men  it seems to me youre like ships without helms  one moment youre beatin as hard as you can to windard the next you fall off all of a sudden and scud away right before the breeze or whew round you come into the winds eye an lay to as if youd bin caught in the heaviest gale that ever blowd since admiral noah cast anchor on mount ararat  didnt you say not three weeks gone by that youd be my wife and now you ask me as cool as an iceberg what i would have  why nelly i would have our weddingday fixed our cottage looked after our boat and nets bought in fact our home and business set agoin  and why not at once nelly  surely you have not repented  no bill bowls said nelly blushing and laying her hand on the arm of her companion i have not repented and never will repent of having accepted the best man that ever came to fairway but  the girl paused and looked down  there you go cried the sailor the old story  i knew you would come to that but and that youd stick there  why dont you go on  if i thought that you wanted to wait a year or two i could easily find work in these times for admiral nelson is glad to get men to follow him to the wars an tom riggles and i have been talkin about goin off together  dont speak of that bill said the girl earnestly  i dread the thought of you going to the wars butbutthe truth is i cannot make up my mind to quit my mother  you dont need to quit her said bill bring her with you  ill be glad to have her at my fireside for your sake nell  but she wont leave the old house  hm well that difficulty may be got over by my comin to the old house since the old ooman wont come to the noo one  i can rent it from her and buy up the furniture as it stands so that there will be no occasion for her to move out of her chairwhy whats the objection to that plan he added on observing that nelly shook her head  she would never consent to sell the thingsnot even to you bill and she has been so long the head of the house that i dont think she would like toto  to play second fiddle put in the sailor  very good but i wont ask to play first fiddle  in fact she may have first second and third and double bass and trombone all to herself as far as i am concerned come nelly dont let us have any more buts just name the day and ill bear down on the parson this very afternoon  leaving them to continue the discussion of this interesting point we will turn into the cottage and visit the old woman who stood so much in the way of our heros wishes  mrs blyth was one of those unfortunates who although not very old have been by illhealth reduced to the appearance of extreme old age nevertheless she had been blessed with that christian spirit of calm gentle resignation which is frequently seen in aged invalids enabling them to bear up cheerfully under heavy griefs and sufferings  she was very little very thin very lame very oldlooking ninety at least in appearance very tremulous very subdued and very sweet  even that termagant gossip mrs hardsoul who dwelt alone in a tumbledown hut near the quay was heard upon one occasion to speak of her as dear old mrs blyth  beside mrs blyth on a stool engaged in peeling potatoes sat a young woman who was in all respects her opposite  bessy blunt was tall broad muscular plainlooking masculine and remarkably unsubdued she was a sort of maidofallwork and companion to the old woman  mrs blyth lived in the hope of subduing her attendantwho was also her nieceby means of kindness  who came into the garden just now asked mrs blyth in a meek voice  who would it be but william bowls sure he comes twice every day sometimes oftener replied bessy but whats the use nothing comes of it  something may come of it bessy said mrs blyth if william settles down steadily to work but i am anxious about him for he seems to me hasty in temper  surely bessy you would not like to see our nell married to an angry man  i dont know about that replied the girl testily as she cut a potato in two halves with unnecessary violence all i know is that i would like to see her married to bill bowls  hes an able handsome man indeed i would gladly marry him myself if he asked me  mrs blyth smiled a little at this  bessy frowned at a potato and said humph sternly  now it happened just at that moment that the pressgang before referred to arrived in front of the cottage  bessy chanced to look through the window and saw them pass  instantly she ran to the back door and screamed pressgang as a warning to bill to get out of the way and hide himself as quickly as possible then hastening back she seized one of old mrs blyths crutches ran to the front door and slammed it to just as the leader of the gang came forward  meanwhile william bowls knowing that if he did not make his escape his hopes of being married speedily would be blasted turned to leap over the garden wall but the leader of the pressgang had taken care to guard against such a contingency by sending a detachment round to the rear  its all up with me cried bill with a look of chagrin on observing the men  come hide in the kitchen quick  i will show you where cried nelly seizing his hand and leading him into the house the back door of which she locked and barred  there get in cried the girl opening a low door in the wall which revealed the coalhole of the establishment  bills brow flushed  he drew back with a proud stern look and hesitated  oh do for my sake implored nell  a thundering rap on the front door resounded through the cottage the sailor put his pride in his pocket stooped low and darted in  nelly shut the door and leaned a bakingboard against it  let us in said a deep voice outside  never replied bessy stamping her foot  you had better dear replied the voice in a conciliatory tone we wont do you any harm  go along with youbrutes said the girl  well have to force the door if you dont open it my dear  youd better not cried bessy through the keyhole  at the same time she applied her eye to that orifice and instantly started back for she saw the leader of the gang retire a few paces preparatory to making a rush  there was short time for action nevertheless bessy was quick enough to fling down a large stool in front of the door and place herself in an attitude of defence  next moment the door flew open with a crash and a sailor sprang in cutlass in hand  as a matter of course he tripped over the stool and fell prostrate at bessys feet and the man who followed received such a welldelivered blow from the crutch that he fell on the top of his comrade  while the heroine was in the act of receiving the third she felt both her ankles seized by the man who had fallen first  a piercing yell followed  in attempting to free herself she staggered back and fell the crutch was wrenched from her grasp and the whole gang poured over her into the kitchen where they were met by their comrades who had just burst in the back door  search close cried one of these theres a big fellow in the house we saw him run into it  you may save yourselves the trouble theres no man in this house cried bessy who had risen and followed her conquerors and who now stood with dishevelled locks flushed countenance and gleaming eyes vowing summary vengeance on the first man she caught off his guard  as the men believed her they took care to keep well on their guard while engaged in the search  poor old mrs blyth looked absolutely horrorstricken at this invasion of her cottage and nelly stood beside her pale as marble and trembling with anxiety  every hole and corner of the house was searched without success the floors were examined for trapdoors and even the ceilings were carefully looked over but there was no sign of any secret door and the careless manner in which the bakeboard had been leaned against the wall as well as its small size prevented suspicion being awakened in that direction  this being the case the leader of the gang called two of his men aside and engaged in a whispered conversation  its quite certain that he is here said one but where they have stowed him is the puzzle  well it is indeed a puzzle replied the leader but ive thought of a plan  he may be the father or brother or cousin of the household dye see and it strikes me if we were to pretend to insult the women that would draw him out  but i dont half like that notion said one of the men  why not asked the other who wore a huge pair of whiskers its only pretence you know  come ill try it  saying this he went towards old mrs blyth and whispered to nellydont be frightened my ducky were only agoin to try a dodge dye see  stand by we wont do you no harm  the man winked solemnly several times with the view of reassuring nelly and then raising his voice to a loud pitch exclaimed  come now old ooman its quite plain that theres a feller in this here house an as we cant find him nowheres weve come to the conclusion he must be under your big chair  in coorse we must ask you to git up an as ye dont seem to be able to do that very well well have to lift you  so here goes  the man seized the old womans chair and shuffled with his feet as though he were about to lift it  nelly screamed  bessy uttered a howl of indignation and rushed upon the foe with teeth and nails ready but being arrested by a powerful man in the rear she vented her wrath in a hideous yell  the success of the scheme was greatmuch greater indeed than had been anticipated  the bakeboard fell flat down the door of the coalhole burst open and our hero springing out planted a blow on the nose of the bigwhiskered man that laid him flat on the floor  another blow overturned the man who restrained bessy and a third was about to be delivered when a general rush was made and bill bowls being overpowered by numbers was finally secured  now my fine fellow said the leader of the gang you may as well go with us quietly for ye see resistance is useless an it only frightens the old woman  this latter part of the remark had more effect on the unfortunate bill than the former  he at once resigned himself into the hands of his captors  as he was about to be led away he turned towards mrs blyth intending to speak but the poor old woman had fainted and nellys fears for her lover were lost for the moment in her anxiety about her mother  it was not until the party had left the room that the poor girl became fully aware of what was going on  uttering a loud cry she rushed towards the outer door  bill heard the cry and exerting himself to the utmost almost succeeded in overturning the five men who held him  make your mind easy said one of them no harm will come to the women  we aint housebreakers or thieves  all fair an above board we aretrueblue british tars as would rather swing at the yardarm than hurt the feelins of a woman pretty or ugly young or old  its all in the way of dooty dye see  the kings orders young man so belay heavin about like that else well heave ye on your beamends lash you hand and futt to a handspike and carry you aboord like a dead pig  hold on cried the man with the big whiskers who after having been knocked down had become emphatically the man with the big nose ill go back an comfort them a bit dont you take on so  i know all about itsee through it like a double patent hextromogriphal spyglass only goin on a short cruise dye see  come back soon with lots o prizemoney get spliced right off buy a noo gown with big flowers all over it for the old mother pension off the stout gal wi the crutch all straight thats the thing aint it  dont dont entreated bill earnestly dont go for toto  no fear young man replied the sailor seeing that bill hesitated ben bolter aint the man to do anything that would bring discredit on his majestys service and i bear you no grudge for this he added pointing to his swelled nose it was given in a good cause and received in the reglar way o business  saying this ben bolter ran back to the cottage where he tried to comfort the women to the best of his power  how he accomplished his mission does not remain on record but it is certain that he rejoined his party in little more than five minutes with sundry new marks of violence on his huge honest face and he was afterwards heard to remark that some creatures of the tiger species must have been born women by mistake and that stout young females who had a tendency to use crutches had better be pensioned offor drownded if possible  thus was william bowls impressed into the royal navy  on hearing that his old shipmate had been caught tom riggles at once volunteered into the service and they were both sent on board a manofwar and carried off to fight the battles of their country    chapter three  bill is initiated into the duties of his new station  at the time of which we write englands battles and troubles were crowding pretty thick upon one another  about this period republican france besides subduing and robbing switzerland italy sardinia and other states was busily engaged in making preparation for the invasion of englandnapoleon bonaparte being in readiness to take command of what was styled the army of england  of course great preparations had to be made in this country to meet the invading foe  the british lion was awakened and although not easily alarmed or stirred up he uttered a few deeptoned growls which showed pretty clearly what the frenchmen might expect if they should venture to cross the channel  from john o groats to the lands end the people rose in arms and in the course of a few weeks 150000 volunteers were embodied and their training begun  not satisfied with threatening invasion the directory of france sought by every means to corrupt the irish  they sent emissaries into the land and succeeded so well that in may 1798 the rebellion broke out troops supplies and munitions of war were poured into ireland by france but the troops were conquered and the rebellion crushed  finding at length that the invasion of england could not be carried out this pet projection was abandoned and napoleon advised the directory to endeavour to cripple her resources in the east  for the accomplishment of this purpose he recommended the establishment on the banks of the nile of a french colony which besides opening a channel for french commerce with africa arabia and syria might form a grand military depot whence an army of 60000 men could be pushed forward to the indus rouse the mahrattas to a revolt and excite against the british the whole population of those vast countries  to an expedition on so grand a scale the directory objected at first but the masterspirit who advised them was beginning to feel and exert that power which ultimately carried him to the throne of the empire  he overcame their objections and the expedition to egypt was agreed to  with characteristic energy and promptitude napoleon began to carry out his plans and great britain seeing the storm that was brewing commenced with equal energy to thwart him  accordingly the great sir horatio nelson at that time rearadmiral was employed with a squadron to watch the movements and preparations of the french in the mediterranean  such was the state of matters when our hero bill bowls was conveyed on board the waterwitch a seventyfour gun frigate and set to work at once to learn his duty  bill was a sensible fellow  he knew that escape from the service except in a dishonourable manner was impossible so he made up his mind to do his duty like a man and return home at the end of the war which he hoped would be a short one and marry nelly blyth  poor fellow he little imagined what he had to go through beforebut hold we must not anticipate the story  well it so happened that bill was placed in the same mess with the man whose nose he had treated so unceremoniously on the day of his capture he was annoyed at this but the first time he chanced to be alone with him he changed his mind and the two became fast friends  it happened thus  they were standing on the weatherside of the forecastle in the evening looking over the side at the setting sun  you dont appear to be easy in your mind observed ben bolter after a prolonged silence  you wouldnt be if you had left a bride behind you answered bill shortly  how dye know that said ben praps i have left one behind me anyhow ive left an old mother  thats nothin uncommon replied bill a bride may change her mind and become another mans wife but your mother cant become your aunt or your sister by any mental operation that i knows of  im not so sure o that now replied ben knitting his brows and gazing earnestly at the forebrace which happened to be conveniently in front of his eyes see here spose for the sake of argiment that youve got a mothers an she marries a second timewhich some mothers is apt to do you knowand her noo husband has got a pretty niece nothin more natral than that you should fall in love with her and get spliced  well wot then why your mother is her aunt by vartue of her marriage with her uncle and so your mother is your aunt in consikence of your marriage with the niecedye see  bill laughed and said he didnt quite see it but he was willing to take it on credit as he was not in a humour for discussion just then  very well said ben but to return to the pintwhich is if i may so say a pint of distinkshun between topers an argifiers for topers are always returnin to the pint an argifiers are for ever departin from itto return to it i say youve no notion of the pecoolier sirkumstances in which i left my poor old mother  it weighs heavy on my heart i assure ye for its only three months since i was pressed myself an the feelins aint had time to heal yet  come ill tell e how it was  you owe me some compensation for that crack on the nose you gave me so stand still and listen  bill who was becoming interested in his messmate in spite of himself smiled and nodded his head as though to say go on  well you must know my old mother is just turned eighty an im thirtysix so as them that knows the rule o three would tell ye she was just fortyfour when i began to trouble her life  i was a most awful wicked child it seems  so they say at least but ive no remembrance of it myself  howsever when i growed up and ran away to sea and got back again an repentedmainly because i didnt like the seai tuk to mendin my ways a bit an tried to make up to the old ooman for my prewious wickedness  i do believe i succeeded too for i got to like her in a way i never did before and when i used to come home from a cruisefor of course i soon went to sea againi always had somethin for her from furrin parts  an she was greatly pleased at my attentions an presentsall except once when i brought her the head of a mummy from egypt  she couldnt stand that at allto my great disappointment an what made it wuss was that after a few days they had put it too near the fire an the skin it busted an the stuffin began to come out so i took it out to the backgarden an gave it decent burial behind the pump  howsever as i wos goin to say just at the time i was nabbed by the pressgang was my mothers birthday an as i happened to be flush o cash i thought id give her a treat an a surprise so off i goes to buy her some things when before i got well into the towna seaport it wasdown comed the pressgang an nabbed me  i showed fight of course just as you did an floored four of em but they was too many for me an before i knowed where i was they had me into a boat and aboord this here ship where ive bin ever since  im used to it now an rather like it as no doubt you will come for to like it too but it was hard on my old mother  i begged an prayed them to let me go back an bid her goodbye an swore i would return but they only laughed at me so i was obliged to write her a letter to keep her mind easy  of all the jobs i ever did have the writin of that letter was the wust nothin but dooty would iver indooce me to try it again for you see i didnt get much in the way of edication an writin never came handy to me  howsever continued ben i took so kindly to his majestys service that they almost look upon me as an old hand an actooally gave me leave to be the leader o the gang that was sent to fairway to take you so that i might have a chance o sayin adoo to my old mother  what exclaimed bowls is your mother the old woman who stops at the end o cow lane where mrs blyth lives who talks so much about her bigwhiskered ben  that same replied ben with a smile she was always proud o me specially after my whiskers comed  i thought that praps ye might have knowed her  i knows her by hearsay from nelly blyth but not bein a native of fairway of course i dont know much about the peoplehallo  riggles whats wrong with e today said bill as his friend tom came towards him with a very perplexed expression on his honest face not repenting of havin joined the sarvice already i hope  no i aint troubled about that answered riggles scratching his chin and knitting his brows but ive got a brother dye see  nothin uncommon in that said bolter as the other paused  praps not continued tom riggles but then you see my brothers such a preeplexin sort o feller i dont know wot to make of him  let him alone then suggested ben bolter  that wont do neither for hes got into trouble but its a long story an i dessay you wont care to hear about it  youre out there tom said bowls come sit down here and lets have it all  the three men sat down on the combings of the forehatch and tom riggles began by telling them that it was of no use bothering them with an account of his brother sams early life  not unless theres somethin partikler about it said bolter  well there aint nothin very partikler about it xcept that sam was partiklerly noisy as a baby and wild as a boy besides bein uncommon partikler about his wittles specially in the matter o havin plenty of em  moreover he ran away to sea when he was twelve years old an was partiklerly quiet after that for a long time for nobody knowd where hed gone to till one fine mornin my mother she gets a letter from him sayin he was in china drivin a great trade in the opium line  we niver felt quite sure about that for sam wornt over partikler about truth  he was a kindly sort o feller howsever an continued to write once or twice a year for a long time  in these letters he said that his life was pretty wariable as no doubt it was for he wrote from all parts o the world  first he was clerk he said to the british counsel in penang or some sich name though where that is i dont know then he told us hed joined a manowar an took to clearin the pirates out o the china seas  he found it a tough job appariently an got wounded in the head with a grapeshot and half choked by a stinkpot after which we heard no more of him for a long time when a letter turns up from californy sayin he was there shippin hides on the coast and after that he went through texas an the states where he got married though he hadnt nothin wotever as i knows of to keep a wife upon  but he may have had somethin for all you didnt know it suggested bill bowls  well praps he had  howsever the next we heard was that hed gone to canada an tuk a small farm there which was all well enough but now weve got a letter from him sayin that hes in trouble an dont see his way out of it very clear  hes got the farm a wife an a sarvant to support an nothin to do it with  moreover the sarvant is a boy what a gentleman took from a reformationhouse or somethin o that sort where they put little thieves as has only bin in quod for the fust time  they say that many of em is saved and turns out well but this feller dont seem to have bin a crack specimen for sams remarks about him aint complimentary  heres the letter mates continued riggles drawing a soiled epistle from his pocket itll give e a better notion than i can wot sort of a fix hes in will you read it bill bowls  no thankee said bill read it yerself an for any sake dont spell the words if ye can help it  thus admonished tom began to read the following letter from his wild brother interrupting himself occasionally to explain and comment thereon and sometimes despite the adjuration of bill bowls to spell we give the letter in the writers own words  my dear mother its to mother dye see he always writes to her an she sends the letters to memy dear mother here we are all alive and kicking  my sweet wife is worth her weight in gold though she does not possess more of that precious metal than the weddingring on her fingermores the pity for we are sadly in want of it just now  the baby too is splendid  fat as a prize pig capable of roaring like a mad bull and it is said uncommonly like his father  we all send our kind love to you and father and tom  by the way where is tom  you did not mention him in your last  i fear he is one of these roving fellows whom the scotch very appropriately style neerdoweels  a bad lot they are  humph youre one of em mister sam if ever there was an my only hope of ye is that youve got some soft places in your heart  go on tom said ben bolter dont cut in like that on the thread of any mans story  well continued riggles reading with great difficulty sam goes on for to say  we thank you for your good wishes and trust to be able to send you a good account of our proceedings ere long  you see sam was always of a cheery hopeful natur he was we have now been on the place fifteen days but have not yet begun the house as we can get no money  two builders have however got the plans and we are waiting for their spspif oh spiflication why wot can that be  it aint spiflication anyhow said bolter  spell it right through  oh  ive got him its specification cried riggles well  specification  many things will cost more than we anticipated  we had to turn the family out who had squatted here at two days notice as we could not afford to live at kinmondaythats the nearest town i spose  how they managed to live in the log cabin i do not know as when it rainedand it has done so twice since we came furiouslythe whole place was deluged and we had to put an umbrella up in bed  we have had the roof raised and newly shingled and are as comfortable as can be expected  indeed the hut is admirably adapted for summer weather as we can shake hands between the logs  the weather is very hot although there has been much more rain this season than usual  there can be no doubt that this is a splendid country both as regards soil and climate and it seems a pity to see such land lying waste and unimproved for so many years  it far surpasses my expectations both in natural beauty and capabilities  we have a deal of work to do in the way of fencing for at present everybodys livestock is running over a large part of our land but we havent got money to buy fencing  then we ought to have two horses for the boy that was sent to me from the reformatory can plough but again we havent a rap wherewith to buy them  one reason of this is that in a new place a fellow is not trusted at first and the last two hundred dollars we had went in tools household furniture utensils etcetera we have been living on credit for an occasional chicken or duck from our neighbours which makes but a poor meal for threenot to mention baby being very smalland george thats the boy having a tremendous appetite  i walked into town twice to try to get some meat but although there are ostensibly two butchers i failed to get any  they actually wanted payment for it  heigho how i wish that money grew on the treesor bread  by the way that reminds me that there are breadfruit trees in the south sea islands  i think ill sell the farm and go there  one day i had the good luck to rescue a fine young chicken from the talons of a big hawk upon which we all made a good meal  i really dont know what we should have done had it not been for the great abundance of blackberries here  they are fine and large and so plentiful that i can gather a bucketful in an hour  we have made them into jam and pies and are now drying them for winter use  we have also hazelnuts and plums by the cartload and crabapples in numbers almost beyond the power of figures to express  there is also a fruit about the size of a lime which they call here the may apple but which i have named omnifruct as it combines the flavour of apples pears peaches pineapples gooseberries strawberries raspsin fact it is hard to tell what it does not resemble  but after all this is rather light food and although very edenlike livingminus the felicityit does not quite satisfy people who have been used most part of their lives to beefsteak and stout  george came to me a week ago  the little rascal would have been here sooner but first of all the stagecoach upset and then he fell asleep and was carried ten miles beyond our clearing and had to walk back as best he could with a big bundle on his shoulder  he is an uncommonly silent individual  we can hardly get him to utter a word  he does what he is told but i have first to show him how and generally end by doing it myself  he appears to be a remarkably dead boy but my excellent wife has taken him in hand and will certainly strike some fire out of him if she cant put it into him  she has just gone into town on a foraging expedition and i fondly hope she may succeed in making a raise of some edibles  i have distinguished myself lately by manufacturing a sideboard and dresser as well as a table and bench for the female authority and expect to accomplish a henhouse and a gate next week  you see we work in hope  i fervently wish we could live on the same  however im pretty jolly despite a severe attack of rheumatism which has not been improved by my getting up in the night and rushing out in my shirt to chase away trespassing cows and pigs as we have not got a watchdog yet  when my wife shuts her eyes at night her dreams are of one invariable subjectblackberries  she cannot get rid of the impression and i have serious fears that we shall all break out in brambles  there are not so many mosquitoes here as i had expected just enough to keep us lively how i shall rejoice when we have got a cow  it will be a great saving in butter and milk to our neighbours who at present supply us with such things on credit  we can raise here wheat oats indian corn etcetera the only difficulties are the want of seed and money  but it is unkind in me writing to you mother in this strain seeing that you cant help me in my difficulties  however dont take on about me  my motto is never give in  give our love to father also to tom  hes a goodhearted fellow is tom though i fear hell never come to much goodbelieve me your affectionate son sam riggles  there said tom folding up the letter what dye think o that mates  tom did not at that time get an answer to his question for just as he spoke the order was given to beat to quarters for exercise and in a few minutes the decks were cleared and every man at his post  but the order which had been given to engage in mimic warfare for the sake of training the new hands was suddenly changed into the command to clear for action in earnest when the lookout reported a french vessel on the weatherbow  sail was immediately crowded on the waterwitch and all was enthusiasm and expectation as they gave chase to the enemy    chapter four  our hero and his friends see service  the waterwitch was commanded at this time by captain ward a man possessed of great energy and judgment united to heroic courage  he had received orders to join that portion of the british fleet which under nelson was engaged in searching for the french in the mediterranean and had passed cape st vincent on his way thither when he fell in with the french vessel  during the morning a thick fog had obscured the horizon concealing the enemy from view  when the rising sun dispersed it he was suddenly revealed  hence the abrupt order on board the waterwitch to prepare for action  as the fog lifted still more another french vessel was revealed and it was soon found that the english frigate had two frenchmen of fortyfour guns each to cope with  just as it should be remarked captain ward when this was ascertained  there would have been no glory in conquering one frenchman equal to my own ship in size  the waterwitch was immediately steered towards the ship that was nearest in the expectation that she would show fight at once but the french commander probably wishing to delay the engagement until his other vessel could join him made sail and bore down on her  captain ward on perceiving the intention put on a press of canvas and endeavoured to frustrate the enemys design  in this he was only partially successful  surely said bill bowls to his friend ben bolter with whom he was stationed at one of the starboard guns on the main deck surely we are near enough now to give em a shot  no we aint said tom riggles who was also stationed at the same gun an depend on it capn ward is not the man to throw away his shot for nothin  ben bolter and some of the other men at the gun agreed with this opinion so our hero whose fighting propensities were beginning to rouse up had to content himself with gazing through the porthole at the flying enemy and restrained his impatience as he best could  at last the order was given to fire and for an hour after that a running fight was maintained but without much effect  when however the two ships of the enemy succeeded in drawing sufficiently near to each other they hove to and awaited the advance of the waterwitch plying her vigorously with shot as she came on  captain ward only replied with his bow chasers at first  he walked the deck with his hands behind his back without speaking and as far as his countenance expressed his feelings he might have been waiting for a summons to dinner instead of hastening to engage in an unequal contest  capn ward niver growls much before he bites said patrick flinn an irishman who belonged to bowlss mess  he minds me of a spalpeen of a dog i wance had as was uncommon fond o fightin but niver even showed his teeth till he was within half a yard of his inemy but och he gripped him then an no mistake  youll see messmates that we wont give em a broadside till were within half pistolshot  dont take on ye the dooties of a prophet paddy said ben bolter for the last time ye tried it ye was wrong  when was that demanded flinn  why no longer ago than suppertime last night when ye said ye had eaten such a lot that ye wouldnt be able to taste another bite for a month to come an didnt i see ye pitchin into the wittles this mornin as if ye had bin starvin for a week past  git along wid ye retorted flinn yer jokes is as heavy as yerself an worth about as much  an how much may that be asked ben with a grin  faix its not aisy to tell  i would need to work it out in a algibrabical calkilation but if ye divide the half o what ye know by the double o what ye dont know an add the quarter o what ye might have knowdredoocin the whole to nothin by means of a compound o the rule o three and sharp practice praps youll  flinns calculation was cut short at that moment by the entrance of a round shot which pierced the ships side just above his head and sent splinters flying in all directions one of which killed a man at the next gun and another struck bill bowls on the left arm wounding him slightly  the exclamations and comments of the men at the gun were stopped abruptly by the orders to let the ship fall off and fire a broadside  the waterwitch trembled under the discharge and then a loud cheer arose for the immediate result was that the vessel of the enemy which had hit them was partially disabledher foretopmast and flying jibboom having been shot away  the waterwitch instantly resumed her course and while bill bowls was busily employed in assisting to reload his gun he could see that the two frenchmen were close on their lee bow  passing to windward of the two frigates which were named respectively la gloire and the st denis captain ward received a broadside from the latter without replying to it until he had crossed her bow within musket range when he delivered a broadside which raked her from stem to stern  he then wore ship and passing between the two fired his starboard broadside into the gloire and almost immediately after his port broadside into the st denis  the effect on the two ships was tremendous  their sails and rigging were terribly cut up and several of the yards came rattling down on their decks  the gloire in particular had her rudder damaged  seeing this and knowing that in her crippled state she could do him no further damage captain ward passed on sailed round the stern of the st denis and when within six yards of her sent a broadside right in at her cabin windows  then he ranged alongside and kept up a tremendous fire  the frenchmen stuck to their guns admirably but the british fired quicker  at such close quarters every shot told on both sides  the din and crash of such heavy artillery was terrific and it soon became almost impossible to see what was going on for smoke  up to this point although many of the men in the waterwitch had been killed or wounded only one of those who manned the gun at which bill bowls served had been hit  its too hot to last long observed flinn as he thrust home a ball and drew out the ramrod run her out boys  the men obeyed and were in the act of pulling at the tackle when a shot from the enemy struck the gun on the muzzle tore it from its fastenings and hurled it to the other side of the deck  strange to say only one of the men who worked it was hurt by the gun but in its passage across the deck it knocked down and killed three men and jammed one of the guns on the other side in such a way that it became for a time unserviceable  ben bolter and his comrades were making desperate efforts to clear the wreck when they heard a shout on deck for the boarders  the bowsprit of the waterwitch had by that time been shot away her rigging was dreadfully cut up and her wheel smashed and captain ward felt that if the st denis were to get away he could not pursue her  he therefore resolved to board  come along lads cried tom riggles on hearing the order lets jine em  he seized his cutlass as he spoke and dashed towards the ladder followed by bowls bolter flinn and others but it was so crowded with men carrying the wounded down to the cockpit that they had to pause at the foot  at that moment a handsome young midshipman was carried past apparently badly wounded  och exclaimed flinn in a tone of deep anxiety its not mister cleveland is it  ah dont say hes kilt  not quite answered the midshipman rousing himself and looking round with flashing eyes as he endeavoured to wave his hand in the air  ill live to fight the french yet  the poor boy almost fainted from loss of blood as he spoke and the irishman uttering a wild shout ran towards the stern intending to gain the deck by the companionhatch and wreak his vengeance on the french  bill bowls and ben bolter followed him  as they passed the cabin door bowls said hastily to bolter i say ben here follow me ill show ye a dodge  he ran into the cabin as he spoke and leaped out upon the quarter gallery which by that time was so close to the quarter of the st denis that it was possible to jump from one to the other  without a moments hesitation he sprang across dashed in one of the windows and went head foremost into the enemys cabin followed by bolter  finding no one to oppose them there they rushed upon deck and into the midst of a body of marines who were near the afterhatchway  down with the frogeaters cried ben bolter discharging his pistol in the face of a marine with one hand and cleaving down another with his cutlass  the frogeaters however were by no means despicable men for one of them clubbed his musket and therewith hit ben such a blow on the head that he fell flat on the deck  seeing this bill bowls bestrode his prostrate comrade and defended him for a few seconds with the utmost fury  captain ward who had leaped into the mizzen chains of the enemy leading the boarders beheld with amazement two of his own men on the quarterdeck of the st denis attacking the enemy in rear  almost at the same moment he observed the fall of one of them  his men also saw this and giving an enthusiastic cheer they sprang upon the foe and beat them back  bill bowls was borne down in the rush by his friends but he quickly regained his legs  ben bolter also recovered and jumped up  in five minutes more they were masters of the shiphauled down the colours and hoisted the union jack at the frenchmans peak  during the whole course of this action the gloire which had drifted within range kept up a galling fire of musketry from her tops on the deck of the waterwitch  just as the st denis was captured a ball struck captain ward on the forehead and he fell dead without a groan  the first lieutenant who was standing by his side at the moment after hastily calling several men to convey their commander below ordered the starboard guns of the prize to be fired into the gloire  this was done with such effect that it was not found necessary to repeat the dose  the frenchman immediately hauled down his colours and the fight was at an end  it need scarcely be said that the satisfaction with which this victory was hailed was greatly modified by the loss of brave captain ward who was a favourite with his men and one who would in all probability have risen to the highest position in the service had he lived  he fell while his sun was in the zenith and was buried in the ocean that wide and insatiable grave which has received too many of our brave seamen in the prime of life  the first lieutenant on whom the command temporarily devolved immediately set about repairing damages and putting a prize crew into each of the french ships sailed with them to the nearest friendly port  the night after the action bill bowls ben bolter and tom riggles sat down on the heel of the bowsprit to have a chat  not badly hit asked ben of bill who was examining the bandage on his left arm  nothin to speak of said bill only a scratch  im lucky to have got off with so little but i say ben how does your head feel  that mounseer had a handy way o usin the handspike  i do believe he would have cracked any mans skull but your own which must be as thick as the head of an elephant  i seed it comin but couldnt help ye howsever i saved ye from a second dose  it wos pritty hardish said ben with a smile an made the stars sparkle in my brain for all the world like the rory borailis as ive seed so often in the northern skies but its all in the way o trade so i dont grumble the only thing as bothers me is that i cant git my hat rightly on by reason of the bump  youve no cause to complainneither of ye said tom riggles whose left hand was tied up and in a sling for youve lost nothin but a little blood an a bit o skin whereas ive lost the small finger o my right hand  not much to boast of that said ben bolter contemptuously why just think of poor ned summers havin lost an arm and edwards a legnot to mention the poor fellows that have lost their lives  a finger is bad enough growled tom  well so it is said bowls  by the way i would advise you to try a little of that wonderful salve invented by a yankee for such cases  wot salve wos that asked tom gruffly for the pain of his wound was evidently pretty severe  why the growin salve to be sure replied bill  everybody must have heard of it  i never did said tom  did you ben  no never wot is it  its a salve for growin on lost limbs said bill  the yankee tried it on a dog that had got its tail cut off  he rubbed a little of the salve on the end of the dog and a noo tail growd on next mornin  gammon ejaculated tom riggles  true i assure ye as was proved by the fact that he afterwards rubbed a little of the salve on the end of the tail and a noo dog growed on it in less than a week  hm  i wonder said tom if he was to rub some of it inside o your skull whether he could grow you a noo set o brains  i say bill interposed ben bolter did you hear the first lieutenant say where he intended to steer to  i heard somethin about gibraltar but dont know that he said we was goin there  its clear howsever that we must go somewhere to refit before we can be of any use  ay how poor captain ward would have chafed under this delay said bill bowls sadly  he would have been like a caged tiger  thats the worst of war it cuts off good and bad men alike  theres not a captain in the fleet like the one we have lost nelson alone excepted  well i dont know as to that said ben bolter but theres no doubt that admiral nelson is the man to lick the french and i only hope that he may find their fleet and that i may be there to lend a hand  ditto said bill bowls  do added tom riggles  having thus expressed their sentiments the three friends separated not long afterwards the waterwitch sailed with her prizes into gibraltar  here was found a portion of the fleet which had been forwarded by earl st vincent to reinforce nelson  it was about to set sail and as there was every probability that the waterwitch would require a considerable time to refit some of her men were drafted into other ships  among others our friends bill bowls ben bolter and tom riggles were sent on board the majestic a seventyfour gun ship of the line commanded by captain westcott one of englands most noted captains  this vessel with ten lineofbattle ships set sail to join nelson and assist him in the difficult duty of watching the french fleet    chapter five  nelson hunts the french  at this time sir horatio nelson had been despatched to the mediterranean with a small squadron to ascertain the object of the great expedition which was fitting out under napoleon bonaparte at toulon  nelson had for a long time past been displaying in a series of complicated and difficult operations in the mediterranean those splendid qualities which had already won for him unusual honours and fame and which were about to raise him to that proud pinnacle which he ultimately attained as englands greatest naval hero  his address and success in matters of diplomacy had filled his superiors and the government with sentiments of respect his moral courage in risking reputation and position with unflinching resolution by disobeying orders when by so doing the good and credit of his country could be advanced made him an object of dread to some of admiration to others while his lionlike animal courage and amiability endeared him to his officers and men  sailors had begun to feel that where nelson led the way victory was certain and those who were ordered to join his fleet esteemed themselves most fortunate  the defeat of the french armament was considered by the english government a matter of so great importance that earl st vincent then engaged in blockading the spanish fleet was directed if he thought it necessary to draw off his entire fleet for the purpose and relinquish the blockade  he was however told that if he thought a detachment sufficient he was to place it under the command of sir horatio nelson the earl did consider a detachment sufficient and had already made up his mind to give the command to nelson being thoroughly alive to his great talents and other good qualities  he accordingly sent him to the mediterranean with three ships of the line four frigates and a sloop of war  this force was now by the addition to which we have referred augmented so largely that nelson found himself in possession of a fleet with which he might not only watch the enemy but if occasion should offer attack him  he was refitting after a storm in the sardinian harbour of st pietro when the reinforcements hove in sight  as soon as the ships were seen from the masthead of the admirals vessel nelson immediately signalled that they should put to sea  accordingly the united fleet set sail and began a vigorous search for the french armament which had left toulon a short time before  the search was for some time unsuccessful  no tidings could be obtained of the destination of the enemy for some time but at length it was learned that he had surprised malta  although his fleet was inferior in size to that of the french nelson and indeed all his officers and menlonged to meet with and engage them  the admiral therefore formed a plan to attack them while at anchor at gozo but he received information that the french had left that island the day after their arrival  holding very strongly the opinion that they were bound for egypt he set sail at once in pursuit and arrived off alexandria on the 28th of june 1798  there to his intense disappointment he found that nothing had been seen or heard of the enemy  nelsons great desire was to meet with napoleon bonaparte and fight him on the sea  but this wish was not to be gratified  he found however that the governor of alexandria was endeavouring to put the city in a state of defence for he had received information from leghorn that the french expedition intended to proceed against egypt after having taken malta  leaving alexandria nelson proceeded in various directions in search of the french carrying a press of sail night and day in his anxiety to fall in with them but being baffled in his search he was compelled to return to sicily to obtain fresh supplies in order to continue the pursuit  of course nelson was blamed in england for his want of success in this expedition and earl st vincent was severely censured for having sent so young an officer on a service so important  anticipating the objection that he ought not to have made so long a voyage without more certain information nelson said in vindication of his conduct  who was i to get such information from  the governments of naples and sicily either knew not or chose to keep me in ignorance  was i to wait patiently until i heard certain accounts  if egypt were their object before i could hear of them they would have been in india  to do nothing was disgraceful therefore i made use of my understanding  i am before your lordships judgment and if under all circumstances it is decided that i am wrong i ought for the sake of our country to be superseded for at this moment when i know the french are not in alexandria i hold the same opinion as off cape passarothat under all circumstances i was right in steering for alexandria and by that opinion i must stand or fall  it was ere long proved that nelson was right and that earl st vincent had made no mistake in sending him on a service so important for we now know that in all the british fleet there was not another man so admirably adapted for the duty which was assigned to him of finding fighting and conquering the french in reference to whom he wrote to the first lord of the admiralty be they bound to the antipodes your lordship may rely that i will not lose a moment in bringing them to action  revictualled and watered the british fleet set sail on the 25th of july from syracuse  on the 28th intelligence was received that the enemy had been seen about four weeks before steering to the south east from candia  with characteristic disregard of the possible consequences to his own fame and interest in his determination to do the right nelson at once resolved to return to alexandria  accordingly with all sail set the fleet stood once more towards the coast of egypt  perseverance was at length rewarded  on the 1st of august 1798 about ten in the morning they sighted alexandria and saw with inexpressible delight that the port was crowded with the ships of france  and here we venture to say that we sympathise with the joy of the british on this occasion and shall explain why we do so  not every battle that is foughthowever brilliant in military or naval tactics it may be or in exhibitions of personal prowessdeserves our sympathy  only that war which is waged against oppression is entitled to respect and this we hold applies to the war in which the british were engaged at that time  france under the directory had commenced a career of unwarrantable conquest for the simple purpose of selfaggrandisement and her great general bonaparte had begun that course of successful warfare in which he displayed those brilliant talents which won for him an empire constituted him in the ordinary acceptation of the word a hero and advanced france to a high position of tyrannical power  but brilliant talents and success could not free him from the charge of being a wholesale murderer  to oppose such pretentions and practices was a bounden duty on the part of those who loved justice just as much as it is the duty of every one who has the power to thwart the designs of and forcibly overcome a highwayman or a pirate  observe reader that we do not intend here to imply an invidious comparison  we have no sympathy with those who hold that england was and always is in favour of fair play while france was bent on tyranny on the contrary we believe that england has in some instances been guilty of the sin which we now condemn and that on the other hand many frenchmen of the present day would disapprove of the policy of france in the time of napoleon the first  neither do we sympathise with the famous saying of nelson that one englishman is equal to three frenchmen  the tendency to praise onesself has always been regarded among christian nations as a despicable or at least a pitiable quality and we confess that we cannot see much difference between a boastful man and a boastful nation  frenchmen have always displayed chivalrous courage not a whit inferior to the british and history proves that in war they have been eminently successful  the question whether they could beat us or we could beat them if tested in a fair standup fight with equal numbers besides being an unprofitable one is not now before us  all that we are concerned about at present is that in the war now under consideration the british did beat the french and we rejoice to record the fact solely on the ground that we fought in a righteous cause  with these remarks we proceed to give an account of one of the greatest naval victories ever achieved by british arms    chapter six  the battle of the nile  after napoleon bonaparte had effected his landing in egypt the french fleet was permitted to remain at alexandria for some time and thus afforded nelson the opportunity he had sought for so long  for many previous days he had been almost unable from anxiety to take sleep or food but now he ordered dinner to be served while preparations were being made for battle and when his officers rose to leave the table he said to them  before this time tomorrow i shall have gained a peerage or westminster abbey  the french had found it impossible to enter the neglected and ruined port of alexandria  admiral brueys had by command of napoleon offered a reward of 10000 livres to any native pilot who would safely convey the squadron in but not one was found who would venture to take charge of a single vessel that drew more than twenty feet  the gallant admiral was compelled therefore to anchor in aboukir bay and chose the strongest position that was possible in the circumstances  he ranged his ships in a compact line of battle in such a manner that the leading vessel lay close to a shoal while the remainder of the fleet formed a curve along the line of deep water so that it was thought to be impossible to turn it by any means in a south westerly direction and some of the french who were best able to judge said that they held a position so strong that they could bid defiance to a force more than double their own  the presumption was not unreasonable for the french had the advantage of the english in ships guns and men but they had omitted to take into their calculations the fact that the english fleet was commanded by one whose promptitude in action readiness and eccentricity of resource and utter disregard of consequences when what he deemed the path to victory lay before him might have been equalled but certainly could not have been surpassed by bonaparte himself  the french force consisted of thirteen ships of the line and four frigates carrying in all 1196 guns and 11230 men  the english had thirteen ships of the line and a fiftygun ship carrying in all 1012 guns and 8068 men  all the english lineofbattle ships were seventyfours  three of the french ships carried eightyeight guns and one lorient was a monster threedecker with 120 guns  in order to give the reader a better idea of the forces engaged on both sides we give the following list of ships  it is right however to add that one of those belonging to the english the culloden ran aground on a shoal when about to go into action and took no part in the fight  english ships   Ý   Ýnames

engage in deadly conflict on the 1st of august 1798 with not only national but worldwide interest pending on the issue for the battle of the nile was one of the leading battles of the world  when nelson perceived the position of the enemy his fertile and active mind at once evolved a characteristic course of action  where there was room he said for an enemys ship to swing there was room for one of his to anchor  he therefore at once formed the plan of doubling on the french ships stationing one of his ships on the bow and another on the quarter of each of the enemy  nelson immediately explained his intended course to his officers  it had been his custom during the whole time he was engaged in searching for the french fleet to have his captains as frequently as possible on board the vanguard when he explained to them his opinions as to the best mode of attack in all the various positions in which it was possible or probable that the enemy might be found  hence they knew their commanders tactics so well that when the hour for action arrived no time was lost in the tedious operation of signalling orders he had such confidence in all his officers that after thoroughly explaining his intended plan of attack he merely said to them form as is most convenient for mutual support and anchor by the stern  first gain the victory and then make the best use of it you can  when captain berry perceiving the boldness of the plan said if we succeed what will the world say  nelson replied there is no if in the case that we shall succeed is certain who may live to tell the story is a very different question  nelson possessed in an eminent degree the power of infusing into his men the irresistible confidence that animated his own bosom  there was probably not a man in the british fleet who did not sail into aboukir bay on that memorable day with a feeling of certainty that the battle was as good as gained before it was begun  the cool quiet selfpossessed manner in which the british tars went to work at the beginning must have been very impressive to the enemy for as they advanced they did not even condescend to fire a shot in reply to the storm of shot and shell to which the leading ships were treated by the batteries on an island in the bay and by the broadsides of the whole french fleet at half gunshotrange the men being too busily engaged in furling the sails aloft attending to the braces below and preparing to cast anchor  nelsons fleet did not all enter the bay at once but each vessel lost no time in taking up position as it arrived and as one after another they bore down on the enemy anchored close alongside and opened fire the thunder of the french fleet was quickly and increasingly augmented by the british until the full tide of battle was reached and the shores of egypt trembled under the incessant rolling roar of dreadful war while sheets of flame shot forth and rent the thick clouds which enwrapped the contending fleets and hung incumbent over the bay  an attempt was made by a french brig to decoy the english ships towards a shoal before they entered aboukir bay but it failed because nelson either knew the danger or saw through the device  it seemed as if the zealous captain hood was to have the honour of commencing the action but captain foley passed her in the goliath and successfully accomplished that feat which the french had deemed impossible and had done their best to guard against  instead of attacking the leading shipthe guerrieroutside he sailed round her bows passed between her and the shore and cast anchor  before he could bring up however he had drifted down to the second ship of the enemys linethe conquerantand opened fire  it had been rightly conjectured that the landward guns of the enemy would not be manned or even ready for action  the goliath therefore made short and sharp work of her foe  in ten minutes the masts of the conquerant were shot away  the zealous was laid alongside the guerrier and in twelve minutes that vessel was totally disabled  next came the orion sir j saumarez which went into action in splendid style  perceiving that a frigate lying farther inshore was annoying the goliath she sailed towards her giving the guerrier a taste of her larboard guns as long as they would bear upon her then dismasted and sunk the frigate hauled round towards the french line and anchoring between the franklin and the souverain peuple received and returned the fire of both  in like manner the audacious captain gould justified her name by attacking the guerrier and conquerant at once and when the latter struck passed on to the souverain peuple  the unfortunate guerrier was also worthy of her title for she bore the brunt of the battle  every ship that passed her appeared to deem it a duty to give her a broadside before settling down to its particular place in the line and finding its own special antagonist or antagonistsfor several of the english ships engaged two of the enemy at once  the theseus captain miller after bringing down the main and mizzenmasts of the guerrier anchored inside the spartiate and engaged her  meanwhile on the other side of this vessel nelsons ship the vanguard bore down on the foe with six flags flying in different parts of the rigging to guard against the possibility of his colours being shot away  she opened a tremendous fire on the spartiate at half pistolrange  the muscular british tars wrought with heroic energy at the guns  in a few minutes six of these guns which stood on the forepart of the vanguards deck were left without a man and three times afterwards were these six guns cleared of menso terrific was the fire of the enemy  other four of the british vessels sailed ahead of the vanguard and got into action  one of thesethe bellerophon captain darbyengaged the gigantic lorient which was so disproportionately large that the weight of ball from her lower deck alone exceeded that from the whole broadside of her assailant  the result was that the bellerophon was overpowered 200 of her men were killed or wounded all her masts and cables were shot away and she drifted out of the line  her place however was taken by the swiftsure which not only assailed the lorient on the bow but at the same time opened a steady fire on the quarter of the franklin  before this time however the shades of night had fallen on the scene the battle began at halfpast six in the eveninghalfanhour afterwards daylight was gone and the deadly fight was lighted only by the lurid and fitful flashing of the guns  those vessels of the english squadron which happened to be in rear were some leagues astern when the fight began and it was so dark when they entered that extreme difficulty was experienced in getting in  one of thesethe culloden captain trowbridgesounded carefully as she went but got aground where she remained helpless during the action despite the efforts of the leander and la mutine brig to get her off  she served however as a beacon to the alexander and swiftsure  the latter ship on entering the bay fell in with the drifting and disabled bellerophon which was at first supposed to be one of the enemy because she did not show the signal ordered by nelson to be hoisted by his ships at the mizzen peak  this arose of course from the masts having been shot away  captain hallowell wisely refrained from firing on her saying that if she was an enemy she was too much disabled to escape  he passed on therefore and as we have said took the station and the duty from which the other had been driven  the huge lorient was now surrounded  captain ball in the alexander anchored on her larboard quarter and besides raking her with his guns kept up a steady fire of musketry on her decks  captain thomson also in the leander took up such a position that he could fire into her and the franklin at the same time  standing in the midst of death and destruction the hero of the nile did not escape scathless  he remained unhurt however until he knew that victory was certain  the first and second ships of the enemys line were disabled as we have said at the commencement of the action and the third fourth and fifth were taken between eight and nine so that nelson could not have much if any doubt as to the issue of the battle  suddenly he received a wound on the head from a piece of langridge shot and fell into the arms of captain berry  a large flap of skin was cut from the bone and fell over his sound eyethe other having been lost in a previous engagement  the flow of blood was very great and being thus totally blinded he thought that he had received a mortal wound he was immediately carried down to the cockpit  the cockpit of a manofwar lies in that part of the ship which is below water and is never visited by the light of day  being safe also from the visitation of shot or shell it has been selected as the place to which the wounded are conveyed during an action to have their wounds dressed and limbs amputated by the surgeonswhose hands at such seasons are as may easily be supposed much too full  no pen can describe adequately the horrors of that dimlylighted place with its flickering lights glittering knives bloody tables and decks and mangled men whose groans of agony burst forth in spite of their utmost efforts to repress them  here in the midst of dead dying and suffering men the great admiral sat down to wait his turn  the surgeon was engaged in dressing the wounds of a sailor when he was brought down  on learning who it was that required his services he quitted the man who was under his hands  no said nelson refusing his proffered assistance no i will take my turn with my brave fellows  accordingly there he remained persistently refusing aid until every man who had been previously wounded had been attended to when his turn came it was found that his wound was merely superficial and heartfelt was the joy expressed by the wounded men and the crew of the vanguard when this was made known  but before this had been ascertained and while he believed himself to be dying nelson called the chaplain and gave him his last remembrance to lady nelson appointed a successor to captain berry who was to go to england with the news of the victory and made other arrangements in anticipation of his death  but his hour had not yet come  when the surgeon pronounced his hurt to be superficial he refused to take the rest which was recommended and at once sent for his secretary to write despatches  while he was thus engaged a cry was heard which rose above the din of battle proclaiming that the lorient was on fire  in the confusion that followed nelson found his way upon deck unassisted and to the astonishment of every one appeared on the quarterdeck and gave orders to lower the boats and send relief to the enemy  but before describing the scene that followed we shall turn aside for a little to watch more closely the proceedings of captain westcott in the majestic and the personal deeds of bill bowls and his messmates    chapter seven  battle of the nilecontinued  the majestic was one of the four ships which sailed into action in the wake of the admiral  our hero bill bowls and his friend ben bolter were stationed at one of the guns on the larboard side of the main deck flinders stood near them  everything was prepared for action  the guns were loaded the men stripped to the waist stood ready and the matches were lighted but as yet no order had been given to fire  the men on the larboard side of the ship stood gazing anxiously through the portholes at the furious strife in which they were about to engage  ah then but its hot work is goin on said flinders turning to ben bolter just after a crash of artillery somewhat louder than usual  its hotter work yell see soon when the admiral gits into action said ben  true for ye answered flinders hes a broth of a boy for fightin its an irishman he should have been born  hooroo my hearties look out  this latter exclamation was drawn forth by the crashing of a stray shot which entered the ship close to the spot where they stood and passed out on the starboard side sending splinters of wood flying in all directions without hurting any one  there goes the first said bill bowls looking up at the ragged hole that was left  faix but its not the last cried flinders as another stray shot hit the ship wounding one of the men and sending a splinter so close past the irishman that it grazed his cheek  hooroo boys come on the more the merrier  sure its death or victory well be havin in halfanhour  at this moment of intense excitement and expectation when every mans nerves tingled to be called into vigorous action ben bolter saw fit to give flinders a lecture  ye shouldnt ought to speak misrespectful of death boy said he gravely  hes a rough customer when he gits hold of e an is sartin sure to have the upper hand  its my opinion that hell pay this ship a pretty stiff visit tonight so youd better treat him with respect an belay yer jokinof which yer countrymen are over fond  to this flinders listened with a humorous expression about the corners of his eyes while he stroked his chin and awaited a pause in order to make a suitable reply but an exclamation from bill bowls changed the subject abruptly  ho boys he cried there goes the admiral  a tremendous crash followed his words and the vanguard was seen to pour a broadside into the spartiateas before related  the men of the majestic gazed eagerly at the admirals ship which was almost enveloped in thick smoke as they passed ahead but an order from captain westcott to be ready for action called the attention of every man on his duty  whatever might have been at that moment the thoughts of the hundreds of men on board the majestic the whole soul and body of every man appeared to be concentrated on his own gun as he awaited in stern silence the order to act  it came at last but somewhat differently from what had been expected a sudden and peculiar motion was felt in the ship and it was found that she had got entangled with the main rigging of one of the french vessels astern of the lorient  instantly men were sent aloft to cut clear but before this could be accomplished a perfect storm of shot and shell was sent into them from the towering sides of the threedecker  men fell on all sides before they had an opportunity of firing a shot again and again the crushing shower of metal came spars and masts fell the rigging was cut up terribly and in a short time the majestic would certainly have been sunk had she not fortunately managed to swing clear a moment afterwards captain westcott finding himself close alongside the heureuxthe ninth ship of the enemys linegave the word to open fire and bill bowls had at last the satisfaction of being allowed to apply a light to the touchhole of his gun  seventyfour men had for some time past felt their fingers itching with an almost irresistible desire to do this and now upwards of thirty of them were allowed to gratify their wish  instantly the good ship received a shock that caused her to quiver from the trucks to the keel as her broadside went crashing into the heureux  no longer was there impatient inaction on board the majestic for not only did the heureux reply vigorously but the tonnantthe eighth of the enemys lineopened fire on their other side  the majestic therefore fought on both sides  throughout the whole ship the stalwart halfnaked men heaved at the huge guns  everywhere from stem to stern was exhibited in full swing the active processes of sponging out passing along powder and ball ramming home the charges running out working the handspikes stepping aside to avoid the recoiland the whole operation of working the guns as only british seamen know how to work them  all this was done in the midst of smoke flame crashing shot and flying splinters while the decks were slippery with human blood and strewn with dead men from amongst whom the wounded were raised as tenderly as the desperate circumstances in which they were placed would admit of and carried below  many of those who were thus raised never reached the cockpit but again fell along with those who bore them  one of the men at the gun where bill bowls was at work was in the act of handing a round shot to bill when a ball entered the porthole and hit him on the head scattering his brains over the gun  bill sprang forward to catch him in his arms but slipped on the bloody deck and fell  that fall saved his life for at the same moment a musket ball entered the port and passed close over his head shattering the arm of a poor boyone of those brave little fellows called powdermonkeyswho was in the act of carrying a cartridge to ben bolter  ben could not delay the loading of the piece to assist the little fellow who used his remaining strength to stagger forward and deliver the cartridge before he fell but he shouted hastily to a passing shipmate  here davis carry this poor little chap to the cockpit  davis turned and took the boy in his arms  he had almost reached the main hatchway when a shell entered the ship and burst close to him  one fragment killed the boy and another almost cut davis in two  they fell and died together  for a long time this terrible firing at short range went on and many men fell on both sides  among others captain westcott was killed  he was the only captain who fell in that battle and was one who had his life been spared would certainly have risen to the highest rank in the service  he had risen from the ranks having been the son of a baker in devonshire and gained the honourable station in which he lost his life solely through his conspicuous abilities and courage  up to this point none of those who are principally concerned in this tale had received any hurt beyond a few insignificant scratches but soon after the death of the little boy tom riggles received a severe wound in the leg from a splinter  he was carried below by bill and ben  its all over with me he said in a desponding tone as they went slowly down the ladders i knows itll be a case o ampitation  dont you go for to git downhearted tom said ben earnestly youre too tough to be killed easy  well i is tough but wotll toughness do for a feller agin iron shot  i feels just now as if a redhot skewer wos rumblin about among the marrow of my backbone an ive got no feelin in my leg at all depend upon it messmates its a bad case  his comrades did not reply because they had reached the gloomy place where the surgeons were engaged at their dreadful work  they laid tom down on a locker  goodbye lads said tom as they were about to turn away praps ill not see ye again so give us a shake o yer flippers  bill and ben silently squeezed their comrades hand being unable to speak and then hastened back to their stations  it was about this time that the lorient caught fire and when bill and his friend reached the deck sheets of flame were already leaping out at the portholes of the gigantic ship  the sides of the lorient had been recently painted and the paintbuckets and oiljars which stood on the poop soon caught and added brilliancy to the great conflagration which speedily followed the first outbreak of fire  it was about nine oclock when the fire was first observed  before this the gallant french admiral had perished  although three times wounded brueys refused to quit his post  at length a shot almost cut him in two but still he refused to go below and desired to be left to die on his quarterdeck  he was spared the pain of witnessing the destruction of his vessel  soon the flames got the mastery and blazing upward like a mighty torch threw a strong and appropriate light over the scene of battle  the greater part of the crew of the lorient displayed a degree of courage which could not be surpassed for they stuck to their guns to the very last continuing to fire from the lower deck while the fire was raging above them although they knew full well the dire and instantaneous destruction that must ensue when the fire reached the magazine  the position and flags of the two fleets were now clearly seen for it was almost as light as day and the fight went on with unabated fury until about ten oclock when with a terrific explosion the lorient blew up  so tremendous was the shock that it seemed to paralyse the combatants for a little for both fleets ceased to fire and there ensued a profound silence which continued for some time  the first sound that broke the solemn stillness was the splash of the falling spars of the giant ship as they descended from the immense height to which they had been shot  of the hundreds of human beings who manned that ship scarcely a tithe were saved  about seventy were rescued by english boats  the scattered and burning fragments fell around like rain and there was much fear lest these should set some of the neighbouring vessels on fire  two large pieces of burning wreck fell into the swiftsure and a port fire into the alexander but these were quickly extinguished  on board the majestic also some portions of burning material fell while these were being extinguished one of the boats was ordered out to do all that was possible to save the drowning frenchmen  among the first to jump into this boat were bill bowls and ben bolter  bill took the bow oar ben the second and in a few moments they were pulling cautiously amid the debris of the wreck helping to haul on board such poor fellows as they could get hold of  the work was difficult because comparative darkness followed the explosion and as the fight was soon resumed the thunder of heavy guns together with the plunging of ball exploding of shell and whizzing of chainshot overhead rendered the service one of danger as well as difficulty  it was observed by the men of the majestics boat that several french boats were moving about on the same errand of mercy with themselves and it was a strange as well as interesting sight to see those who a few minutes before had been bent on taking each others lives now as earnestly engaged in the work of saving life  back your starboard oars shouted ben just as they passed one of the french boats theres a man swimming on the port bowthats it steady lend a hand bill now then in with him  a man was hoisted over the gunwale as he spoke and the boat passed onward  just then a round shot from one of the more distant ships of the fleetwhether english or french they could not tellstruck the water a few yards from them sending a column of spray high into the air  instead of sinking the shot ricochetted from the water and carried away the bow of the boat in passing whirling it round and almost overturning it  at the same moment the sea rushed in and swamped it leaving the crew in the water  our hero made an involuntary grasp at the thing that happened to be nearest him  this was the head of his friend ben bolter who had been seated on the thwart in front of him  ben returned the grasp promptly and having somehow in the confusion of the plunge taken it into his head that he was in the grasp of a frenchman he endeavoured to throttle bill  bill not being easily throttled forthwith proceeded to choke ben and a struggle ensued which might have ended fatally for both had not a piece of wreck fortunately touched ben on the shoulder  he seized hold of it bill did the same and then they set about the fight with more precision  come on ye puddockeater cried ben again seizing bill by the throat  hallo ben  why wotist you bill  well now if i didnt take e for a mounseer  before more could be said a boat was observed rowing close past them ben hailed it  ho cried a voice as the men rested on their oars and listened  lend a hand shipmates cried ben on yer port bow  the oars were dipped at once the boat ranged up and the two men were assisted into it  its all well as ends well as ive heerd the playactors say observed ben bolter as he shook the water from his garments  i say lads what ship do you belong to  ve has de honair to blong to le guillaume tell replied one of the men  hallo bill whispered ben its a french boat an were nabbed prisoners o war as sure as my names bb  wots to be done  ill make a bolt sink or swim whispered our hero  you vill sit still said the man who had already spoken to them laying a hand on bills shoulder  bill jumped up and made a desperate attempt to leap overboard but two men seized him  ben sprang to the rescue instantly but he also was overpowered by numbers and the hands of both were tied behind their backs  a few minutes later and they were handed up the side of the french ship  when day broke on the morning of the 2nd of august the firing still continued but it was comparatively feeble for nearly every ship of the french fleet had been taken  only the guillaume tell and the genereuxthe two rear ships of the enemyhad their colours flying  these with two frigates cut their cables and stood out to sea  the zealous pursued but as there was no other british ship in a fit state to support her she was recalled the four vessels therefore escaped at that time but they were captured not long afterwards  thus ended the famous battle of the nile in regard to which nelson said that it was a conquest rather than a victory  of thirteen sail of the line nine were taken and two burnt and two of their four frigates were burnt  the british loss in killed and wounded amounted to 896 that of the french was estimated at 2000  the victory was most complete  the french fleet was annihilated  as might be supposed the hero of the nile was after this almost worshipped as a demigod  it is worthy of remark here that nelson as soon as the conquest was completed sent orders through the fleet that thanksgiving should be returned in every ship to almighty god for the victory with which he had blessed his majestys arms    chapter eight  our hero and his messmate get into trouble  on the night after the battle bill bowls and ben bolter were sent on board a french transport ship  as they sat beside each other in irons and securely lodged under hatches these stout men of war lamented their hard fate thus  i say bill this is wot i calls a fix  thats so bena bad fix  there was silence for a few minutes then ben resumed  now dye see this here war may go on for ever so longyears it may bean here we are on our way to a french prison where well have the pleasure mayhap of spendin our youth in twirlin our thumbs or bangin our heads agin the bars of our cage  there aint a prison in france asll hold me said bill bowls resolutely  no how dye xpect to git outseein that the walls and doors aint made o butter nor yet o turnips inquired ben  ill go up the chimbley said bill savagely for his mind had reverted to nelly blyth and he could not bear to think of prolonged imprisonment  but wot if theyve got no chimbleys  ill try the winders  but if the winders is tight barred wot then  why then ill bust em or ill bust myself thats all  humph ejaculated ben  again there was a prolonged silence during which the friends moodily meditated on the dark prospects before them  if we could only have bin killed in action said bill that would have been some comfort  not so sure o that messmate said ben  theres no sayin wot may turn up  praps the war will end soon an thats not onlikely for weve whipped the mounseers on sea an it wont be difficult for our lobsters to lick em on land  praps therell be an exchange of prisoners an we may have a chance of another brush with them one o these days  if the wust comes to the wust we can try to break out o jail and run a muck for our lives  never say die is my motto  bill bowls did not assent to these sentiments in words but he clenched his fettered hands set his teeth together and gave his comrade a look which assured him that whatever might be attempted he would act a vigorous part  a few days later the transport entered a harbour and a guard came on board to take charge of the prisoners of whom there were about twenty as they were being led to the jail of the town bill whispered to his comrade  look out sharp as ye go along ben an keep as close to me as ye can  all right my lad muttered ben as he followed the soldiers who specially guarded himself  ben did not suppose that bill intended then and there to make a sudden struggle for freedom because he knew that with fettered wrists in a strange port the very name of which they did not know and surrounded by armed enemies such an attempt would be utterly hopeless he therefore concluded correctly that his companion wished him to take the bearings as he expressed it of the port and of the streets through which they should pass  accordingly he kept his weathereye open  the french soldiers who conducted the seamen to prison although stout athletic fellows and doubtless capable of fighting like heroes were short of stature so that the british tars looked down on them with a patronising expression of countenance and one or two even ventured on a few facetious remarks  bill bowls and ben bolter who both measured above six feet in their stockings towered above the crowd like two giants  its a purty place intirely said an irish sailor with a smiling countenance looking round upon the houses and nodding to a group of pretty girls who were regarding the prisoners with looks of pity  what may be the name of it av i may make bowld to inquire  the question was addressed to the soldier on his right but the man paid no attention  so the irishman repeated it but without drawing forth a reply  sure yer a paltry thing that cant give a civil answer to a civil question  he dont understand irish pat try him with english said ben bolter  ah then said pat yed better try that yersilf only yer so high up there he wont be able to hear ye  before ben had an opportunity of trying the experiment however they had arrived at the jail  after they had passed in the heavy door was shut with a clang and bolted and barred behind them  it is probable that not one of the poor fellows who heard the sound escaped a sensation of sinking at the heart but certain it is that not one condescended to show his feelings in his looks  they were all put into a large empty room the window of which looked into a stone passage which was itself lighted from the roof the door was shut locked bolted and barred and they were left to their meditations  they had not remained long there however when the bolts and bars were heard moving again  what say e to a rush lads whispered one of the men eagerly  agreed said bill bowls starting forward ill lead you boys  no man can fight with his hands tied growled one of the others youll only be spoilin a better chance mayhap  at that moment the last bolt was withdrawn and the door swung open revealing several files of soldiers with muskets and bayonets fixed in the passage  this sight decided the question of a rush  four of the soldiers entered with the turnkey  the latter going up to bill bowls and ben bolter said to them in broken english  you follows de soldat  much surprised but in silence they obeyed the command  as they were going out one of their comrades said goodbye mates its plain theyve taken ye for admirals on account o yer size  niver a taste said the irishman before mentioned tis bein led they are to exekooshion  the remainder of this consolatory suggestion was cut off by the shutting of the door  after traversing several passages the turnkey stopped before a small door studded with iron nails and selecting one of his huge keys opened it while the soldiers ranged up on either side  the turnkey who was a tall powerful man stepped back and looking at bill pointed to the cell with his finger as much as to say go in  bill looked at him and at the soldiers for a moment clenched his fists and drew his breath short but as one of the guard quietly brought his musket to the charge he heaved a sigh bent his head and passing under the low doorway entered the cell  are we to stop long here mister turnkey asked ben as he was about to follow  the man vouchsafed no reply but again pointed to the cell  ive always heered ye wos a purlite nation said ben as he followed his messmate but theres room for improvement  the door was shut and the two friends stood for a few minutes in the centre of their cell gazing in silence around the blank walls  the appearance of their prison was undoubtedly depressing for there was nothing whatever in it to arrest the eye except a wooden bench in one corner and the small grated window which was situated near the top of one of the walls  what dye think o this asked ben after some time sitting down on the bench  i think i wont be able to stand it said bill flinging himself recklessly down beside his friend and thrusting his hands deep into his trouser pockets  dont take on so bad messmate said ben in a reproving tone gittin sulky with fate aint no manner o use  as our messmate flinders used to say be aisy an if ye cant be aisy be as aisy as ye can  theres wot i calls sound wisdom in that  very true ben nevertheless the sound wisdom in that wont avail to get us out o this  no doubt but itll help us to bear this with equablenimity while were here an set our minds free to think about the best way o makin our escape  at this bill made an effort to throw off the desperate humour which had taken possession of him and he so far succeeded that he was enabled to converse earnestly with his friend  wot are we to do asked bill gloomily  to see first of all what lies outside o that there porthole answered ben  git on my shoulders bill an see if ye can reach it  ben stood against the wall and his friend climbed on his shoulders but so high was the window that he could not reach to within a foot of it they overcame this difficulty however by dragging the bench to the wall and standing upon it  i see nothin said bill but the sky an the sea an the prisonyard which appears to me to be fifty or sixty feet below us  thats not comfortin observed ben as he replaced the bench in its corner  whats your advice now asked bill  that we remain on our good behaviour a bit replied ben an see wot they means to do with us an whether a chance o some sort wont turn up  well thats a good plananyhow its an easy one to begin withso well try it for a day or two  in accordance with this resolve the two sailors called into play all the patience prudence and philosophy of which they were possessed and during the three days that followed their incarceration presented such a meek gentle resigned aspect that the stoniest heart of the most ironmoulded turnkey ought to have been melted but the particular turnkey of that prison was made of something more or less than mortal mould for he declined to answer questionsdeclined even to open his lips or look as if he heard the voices of his prisoners and took no notice of them farther than to fetch their food at regular intervals and take away the empty plates  he however removed their manacles but whether of his own goodwill or by order they did not know  now ben said bill on the evening of the third day as they sat beside each other twirling their thumbs this here sort o thing will never do  i mean for to make a dash when the turnkey comes in the mornin will you help me  im yer man said ben but how dye mean to set about it  well somewhat in this fashionwenever he opens the door ill clap my hand on his mouth to stop his pipe and youll slip behind him throw yer arms about him and hold on till i tie a handkerchief over his mouth  arter that well tie his hands and feet with whatever we can git hold ofhis own necktie mayhaptake the keys from him and git out the best way we can  hm but wot if we dont know the right turnins to take an run straight into the jaws of other turnkeys praps or find other doors an gates that his bunch o keys wont open  why then well just fail thats all an if they should scrag us for it no matter  its a bad lookout but ill try said ben  next morning this plan was put in execution  when the turnkey entered the cell bill seized him and clapped his hand on his mouth  the man struggled powerfully but ben held him in a grasp so tight that he was as helpless as an infant  keep yer mind easy mounseer we wont hurt e said ben while his comrade was busy gagging him  now then lift him into the corner whispered bill  ben and he carried the turnkey whom they had tied hand and foot with handkerchiefs and neckties into the interior of the cell left him there locked the door on him and immediately ran along the passage turned a corner and came in sight of an iron grating on the other side of which sat a man in a dress similar to that of the turnkey they had left behind them  they at once drew back and tried to conceal themselves but the man had caught sight of them and gave the alarm  seeing that their case was desperate bill rushed at the grating with all his force and threw himself heavily against it  the whole building appeared to quiver with the shock but the caged tiger has a better chance of smashing his iron bars than poor bill bowls had  twice he flung his whole weight against the barrier and the second time ben helped him but their efforts were in vain  a moment later and a party of soldiers marched up to the grating on the outside  at the same time a noise was heard at the other end of the passage  turning round the sailors observed that another gate had been opened and a party of armed men admitted who advanced with levelled muskets  seeing this bill burst into a bitter laugh and flung down the keys with a force that caused the long passage to echo again as he exclaimed  its all up with us ben  we may as well give in at once  thats so said ben sadly as he suffered himself to be handcuffed after which he and his companion in misfortune were conducted back to their cell    chapter nine  bill and ben set their brains to steep with unconquerable perseverance  in its slow but steady revolution the wheel of fortune had now apparently brought bill bowls and ben bolter to the lowest possible point and the former of these worthies consoled himself with the reflection that as things could scarcely get worse with them it was probable they would get better  his friend disputed this point  its all very well said ben crossing his legs and clasping his hands over his knees as he swayed himself to and fro to talk about havin come to the wust but weve not got to that pint by a long way  why suppose that instead o bein here sound in wind and limb though summat unfortnate in regard to the matter o libertysuppose i say that we wos lyin in hospital with our right legs an mayhap our left arms took off with a round shot  oh if you go for to supposin said bill you may suppose anything  why not suppose at once that we was lyin in hospital with both legs and arms took off by round shot an both eyes put out with canister an our heads an trunks carried away by grapeshot  i didnt suppose that said ben quietly because that would be the best instead o the wust state we could come to seein that wed know an care nothin about it  howsever here we are low enough an havin made an assault on the turnkey its not likely well get much favour at the hands of the mounseers so it comes to this that we must set our brains to steep an see if we cant hit upon some dodge or other to escape  thats what we must do assented bill bowls knitting his brows and gazing abstractedly at the blank wall opposite  to git out o this here stone jug is what ive set my heart on so the sooner we set about it the better  just so said ben  well then lets begin  wot dye propose fust  to this bill replied that he must think over it  accordingly he did think over it and his comrade assisted him for the space of three calendar months without any satisfactory result  but the curious thing about it was that while these men revolved in their minds every conceivable plan with unflagging eagerness and were compelled to give up each after brooding over it for a considerable time finding that it was unworkable they were not dispirited but rather became more intense in their meditations and ingenious as well as hopeful in their devisings  if we could only git hold of a file to cut a bar o the winder with an a rope to let ourselves down with i think we could manage to git over the walls somehow  if we was to tear our jackets trousers vests and shirts into strips an make a rope of em it might be long enough suggested bill  thats so boy but as we would be stark naked before we got it finished i fear the turnkey would suspec there wos somethin wrong somehow  ben bolter sighed deeply as he spoke because at that moment a ray of sunshine shot through the little window and brought the free fresh air and the broad blue sea vividly to his remembrance  for the first time he experienced a deep sinking of the heart and he looked at his comrade with an expression of something like despair  cheer up said bill observing and thoroughly understanding the look never say die as long as theres ashotin  he was too much depressed and listless to finish the sentence  i wonder resumed ben if the mounseers treat all their prisoners of war as bad as they treat us  dont think they do replied bill  ive no doubt its cause we sarved em as we did when they first put us in quod  oh if they would only give us summat to do exclaimed ben with sudden vehemence  it seemed as if the poor fellows prayer were directly answered for at that moment the door opened and the governor or some other official of the prison entered the cell  you must vork he said going up to bill  well be only too glad to work yer honour if youll give us work to do  ver good fat can you vork  we can turn handy to amost anything yer honour said ben eagerly  it turned out however after a considerable amount of talk that beyond steering a ship reefing topsails splicing ropes tying every species of complex knot and other nautical matters the two seamen could not claim to be professionally acquainted with any sort of handicraft  somewhat discomfited ben at last said with a perplexed air  well yer honour well try anything ye choose to put us at  i had a brother once who was a sort of tinker to trade an great at mendin pots pans old umbrellas and the like  i wos used to help him when a boy  praps if yer honour now has got a old umbrella as wants refittin i might try my hand on that  the governor smiled  vell i do tink i have von old omberilla  you sall try for to mend him  next day saw bill and ben surrounded by tools scraps of wood and whalebone bits of brass and tin etcetera busy as bees and as happy as any two children who have invented a new game  ben mended the umbrella admirably  at the same time bill fashioned and carved two or three paperknives of wood with great neatness  but when it was discovered that they could sew sailcloth expeditiously and well a quantity of that material was given to them and they were ordered to make sacks  they set to work accordingly and made sack after sack until they grew so wearied of the monotonous work that ben said it made him wish to sit down in sackcloth and ashes whereupon bill remarked that if the mounseers would only give them the sack altogether it would be very much to their credit  soon the imprisoned mariners began again to plot and plan their escape of course they thought of making ropes of the sailcloth and twine with which they wrought but as the turnkey took the material away every night and brought it back every morning they gave up this idea as they had given up many other ideas before  at last one afternoon bill looked up from his work hit his thigh a slap which produced a pistolshot crack that echoed up into the high ceiling of the cell as he exclaimed ive got it  i hope youll give us a bit of it then said ben if its worth havin  ill give you the benefit of it anyhow said bill throwing down his tools and eagerly beginning to expound the new plan which had struck him and caused him to strike his thigh  it was to this effect  that they should beg the turnkey to let them have another old umbrella to work at by way of recreation as the sackmaking was rather monotonous that if they should be successful in prevailing on him to grant their request they should work at the umbrella very slowly so as to give them time to carry out their plan which was to form a sort of parachute by adding sailcloth round the margin of the umbrella so as to extend it to twice its circumference  after it should be finished they were to seize a fitting opportunity cut the bars of their window and with the machine leap down into the yard below  wot exclaimed ben jump together  ay why not ben  sink or swim together boy  very true but ive got my doubts about flyin together  better do it one at a time and send the umbrella up by means of a piece of twine  well we might do it in that way said bill but what dye think o the plan  fuss rate said ben well try it at once  in accordance with this resolution ben made his petition that night very humbly to the turnkey who at first turned a deaf ear to him but was finally prevailed on to fetch them one of his own umbrellas to be repaired  it happened to be a very large one of the good old stout and bulgy make and in this respect was the better suited to their purpose all the tools necessary for the work of repair were supplied except a file  this however was brought to them when ben pointed out with much earnestness that if he had such an implement he could clean up and beautify the ivory handle to such an extent that its owner would not recognise it  this device of improving the ivory handle turned out to be a happy hit for it enabled ben to keep the umbrella much longer by him than would otherwise have been possible for the purpose of covering it with elaborate and really beautiful carving the progress of which was watched by the turnkey with much interest from day to day  having gained their end the sailors wrought with indefatigable zeal and resolutely overcame the difficulties that met them from time to time each day they dragged the bench under the window  ben got upon it and bill climbed on his shoulders by which means he could just reach the iron grating of the window and there for halfanhour at a time he cautiously used the file  they thought this enough of time to bestow on the work because the bars could be easily filed through before the parachute was ready  in the preparation of the umbrella the first difficulty that met them was how they were to conceal their private work when the turnkey came in the evenings to take away their materials for sackmaking  after some examination they discovered a plank in the floor in the corner where they were wont to sleep which was loose and easily forced up with one of bills unfinished paperknives which he made very strong for this special purpose  beneath there was sufficient room to stow away the cloth with which they fashioned the additional breadth to the umbrella to have cabbaged at one time all the sailcloth that was required would have risked discovery they therefore appropriated small scraps each day and sewed these neatly together until they had enough  soon they had a ring of canvas formed into the centre of which the umbrella fitted exactly and this ring was so cut and sewn in gores that it formed a continuation of the umbrella which was thus made to spread out and cover a space of about nine or ten feet in diameter  all round the extremity or margin of the ring cords of twisted twine were fixed at intervals of about six inches  there were about sixty of these cords or stays all of which met and were fastened at the end of the handle  a stout line made of fourply twine was fastened at the top of the umbrella and passing through a small hole in it was tied round the whalebones inside and twisted down the stick to the handle to which it was firmly secured  by this means the whole machine was as it were bound together  all these additionals and fixings had however to be so constructed that they could be removed or affixed with some rapidity for there was always before the sailors the chance that the turnkey might look in to observe how their work was progressing  indeed one afternoon they were almost discovered at work on the parachute  the turnkey was heard coming along the passage when ben was in the act of fitting on the new appendages and the key was actually in the door before the last shred of them was thrust into the hole in the floor and the loose plank shut down  ben immediately flung several of the sacks over the place and then turning suddenly round on his comrade began to pommel him soundly by way of accounting for the flushed condition of his countenance  thus taken by surprise bill returned the blows with interest and the combatants were separated by the turnkey when in a rather breathless condition  if you do so more agin you sall go separate said the turnkey  the mere thought of separation at such a moment struck like a chill to the hearts of the sailors who forthwith shook hands and vowed earnestly that they would never do it again  in order to conciliate the man ben took up the umbrella and pointing to the beautifully carved handle said  you see its all but finished and im very anxious to git it done so if youll let me keep it by me all tonight ill work as long as i can see and be at it the first thing in the morning  the man pleased at the unusual interest which ben took in the wornout piece of goods agreed to let him keep it by him  after carrying away all the other materials and looking round to see that all was right he locked them up for the night  left to themselves they at once began to prepare for action  they drew forth all the different parts of the parachute for such it really was although the machine so named had never been seen but only heard of by the seamen and disposed them in such a manner beside the hole in the floor as to be ready at a moments notice either to be fitted on to the umbrella or thrust back into the place of concealment  their manacles had been taken off at the time they began to work so that these were no longer impediments in the way  now bill are the bars sure to give way dye think  sartin sure said bill theyre holdin by nothin thicker than a pin  very good then lets go to work  in an hour or so it will be dark enough to try our flyin machine and then goodbye to franceor to the world  its neck or nothin dye see  all right answered bill  they sat down to work in good earnest  the spreading rim of canvas instead of being tagged on as on former occasions was now sewn securely to the umbrella and when the latter was expanded the canvas hung down all round it and the numerous stays hung quite loose  ben expected that the rapidity of the descent would suddenly expand this appendage and check the speed  the ends of the loose cords were gathered up and fastened to the handle as was also the bindingcord before referred toall of which was done with that thoroughness of workmanship for which sailors are celebrated  then a stout cord was fastened to one of the stanchions of the window which had been left uncut for the purpose  when everything was ready the adventurous sailors began to experience all the anxiety which is inseparable from an action involving much danger liability to frustration and requiring the utmost caution combined with energy  they waited until they thought the night was at its darkest  when all sounds around them had ceased they took off their shoes and carefully lifted the bench to the wall under the window  ben went up first by mounting on bills shoulders  with one powerful wrench he pulled the iron framework of the window into the room and handed it down to bill who stooped a little and placed it gently against the wall  his comrade then thrust his head and shoulders out at the window and while in that awkward position spread his jacket over the sill  this was intended to protect the cord which was fastened to the top of the umbrella and by which it was to be drawn up after his descent  when this was done bill clambered up by the cord which hung from the uncut stanchion and pushed the umbrella past bens body until he got hold of the end of it and drew it out altogether  bill then descended into the cell having the small cord in his hand and watched the motions of his comrade with intense anxiety  the window was so small that ben could barely get his head and shoulders through it  there was no possibility of his getting on his feet or his knees to make a leap  the only course that remained for him therefore was to expand the umbrella hold on tight and then wriggle out until he should lose his balance and fall head foremost  it was an awful position  bold though the seaman was and desperate the circumstances his strong frame quivered when he gazed down and felt himself gradually toppling  the height he knew to be little short of sixty feet but in the dark night it appeared an abyss of horrible profundity  a cold sweat broke out upon him and for one moment he felt an almost irresistible tendency to let go the umbrella and clutch the windowsill but he was too late  like lightning he shot down for a couple of yards then the parachute expanded and checked him with such violence as he swung round that he nearly lost his hold and was thrown into a horizontal positionfirst on one side then on the other  finally he reached the ground with a shock that almost took away his breath  he sat still for a moment or two then rose slowly and shook himself to ascertain whether he were still alive and sound  immediately after he examined the parachute found it all right and gave his comrade the signala couple of tugs at the cordto haul up  bill was scarcely less agitated than his friend  he had seen bens legs disappear with a suddenness that told eloquently of his having taken flight and stood in the cell above listening intently while large drops of perspiration coursed down his face  on feeling the tug at the string a mountain appeared to be lifted off his chest  carefully he pulled up the umbrella  when it showed its point above the windowsill he clambered up and went through the same terrible ordeal  he was not however so fortunate as his friend for when he jumped three of the stays gave way which had the effect of slightly deranging the motion of the umbrella and he came to the ground with such violence that he lay stunned and motionless leading his horrified comrade to fear that he was killed  in a few minutes however he revived and on examination found that no bones had been broken  now ben what next said bill getting up and giving himself a shake  the wall said ben cant be far from where we stand  if there wos only a bit of moonshine it would help us  better as it is whispered bill groping about for the night was so intensely dark that it was scarcely possible to see a yard  i knows the way to the harbour if we only manage to get outah heres the wall but its an oncommon high one  this was indeed too true  the top of the wall was faintly visible like a black line across the dark sky and when ben mounted on bills shoulders it was found that he could only reach to within three feet of the bristling iron spikes with which it was surmounted  for halfanhour they groped about and made the discovery that they were in a small enclosure with bare walls of fifteen feet in height around them and not a projection of any kind large enough for a mouse to lay hold of  in these circumstances many men would have given way to despair but that was a condition of mind which neither of our tars ever thought of falling into  in the course of their explorations they came against each other and immediately began an animated conversation in whispers the result of which was that they groped for the umbrella and having found it cut off all the cords about it with which they proceeded to plait a rope strong enough to bear their weight  they sat down in silence to the work leaning against the prison wall and wrought for a full hour with the diligence of men whose freedom depends on their efforts  when finished the rope was found to be about a yard too short for their purpose but this defect was remedied by means of the canvas of their parachute which they tore up into strips twisted into an additional piece of rope and spliced it to the other  a large loop was made on the end of it  going once more to the wall ben mounted on bills shoulders and threw the loop over the top of the wall it caught as had been expected on one of the iron spikes  ben then easily hauled himself up hand over hand and getting hold of two spikes raised himself so that he could see over the wall  immediately after he descended  i sees nothin bill so we must just go over and take our chance  bill agreed  ben folded his coat and ascending again spread it over the spikes so that he could lean on them with his chest without being pierced  having reascended bill followed the rope was then hauled up and lowered on the other side  in another moment they slipped down and stood on the ground  now the question is where are we whispered bill  praps were only in another yard after all  the sound of footsteps pacing slowly towards them was heard at that moment  i do believe whispered bill in an excited tone that weve got into the street an thats the sentry  lets bolt  we cant bolt said ben cause if i took my bearins right hes between us an the shore an it would be of no manner o use boltin into the country to be hunted down like a couple of foxes  then well floor him to begin with whispered bill  thats so said ben  the sentry approached and the sailors drew up close against the wall presently his dark form became faintly visible  bill rushed at him at once and delivered a blow that might have felled an ox at the spot where he supposed his chest was sending the man back almost heels over head while his arms rattled on the pavement  instantly there were heard the sounds of opening locks bolts and bars  the two friends fled and shouts were heard behind them while lights flashed in various directions  this way bill cried ben turning down a narrow lane to avoid a lamp which came in sight when they turned a corner  a couple of belated and drunken french fishermen happened to observe them and gave chase hold on ben lets drop and trip em up said bill  all right replied ben down with e  they stopped suddenly and squatted as low as possible  the lane was very narrow the fishermen were close behind they tumbled right over them and fell heavily on their faces  while they were rising our heroes knocked them both insensible and hastily appropriating their coats and red caps put them on as they ran  by this time a crowd of fishermen sailors and others among whom were a few soldiers and turnkeys with lanterns were pursuing the fugitives as fast as was possible in so dark a night  bill suggested that they should turn into a dark corner and dodge them  the suggestion was acted on at once they dashed round the first corner they came to and then instead of continuing their flight turned sharp to the left and hid in a doorway the pursuers came pouring round the corner shouting wildly  when the thickest of the crowd was opposite their place of concealment bill and ben rushed into the midst of them with a shout imitating the tones of the frenchmen as nearly as possible but taking care to avoid the use of word and thus they joined in the pursuit  gradually they fell behind as if outrun and when they found themselves in rear turned about and made off in the opposite direction then diverging to the left they headed again towards the shore ran down to the beach and leaped into the first boat they came to  it happened to be a very small onea sort of dinghy  ben thought it was too small and was about to leap out and search for a larger when lights suddenly appeared and the shouts of the pursuerswho had discovered the rusewere heard as they approached  shove off ben  hurrah my hearties cried the seaman with a stentorian shout as he seized an oar  next moment the little boat was flying over the smooth water of the port the silence of which was now broken by exclamations and cries from the shipping in reply to those from the shore while the splashing of oars were heard in all directions as men leaped into boats and rowed about at random  darkness favoured the englishmen but it also proved the cause of their being very nearly recaptured for they were within two yards of the battery at the mouth of the harbour before they observed it and swerved aside just in time to avoid a collision  but they had been seen and a random discharge of musketry followed  this was succeeded by the sudden blaze of a blue light which revealed the whole port swarming with boats and armed mena sight which acted so powerfully on the warlike spirits of the sailors that they started up simultaneously flung their red caps into the air and gave vent to a hearty british cheer which ben bolter followed up as they resumed the oars with old england for ever farewell mounseers  the blue light went out and left everything in darkness thicker than ever but not before a rapid though ineffective discharge of musketry had been made from the battery  another blue light however showed that the fugitives were getting rapidly out to sea beyond the range of musketry and that boats were leaving the port in chase  before the light expired a cloud of smoke burst from the battery and the roar of a heavy gun rushed over the sea  an instant later and the water was torn up by grapeshot all round the little boat but not a ball touched them save one which struck bill bowls on the left hand and cut off his thumb  i think theres a mast and sail in the bottom of the boat and here comes a breeze said ben give me your oar and try to hoist it bill  without mentioning his wound our hero did as he was bid and not until the boat was leaping over the ruffled sea did he condescend to bind up the wounded hand with his necktie  soon they were beyond the range of blue lights and artillery  have e any notion what course were steerin inquired bill  none wotsomediver answered ben  soon after that however the sky cleared a little and bill got sight of part of the constellation of the great bear  although the polestar was not visible he guessed pretty nearly its position and thus ascertained that the breeze came from the southwest  trimming the lugsail accordingly the tars turned the prow of the little craft to the northward and steered for the shores of old england    about a year after this stirring incident a remarkably noisy party was assembled at tea in the prim little parlour of mrs blyths cottage in fairway  besides the meek old soul herself there were present on that occasion our old friends ben bolter and tom riggles the latter of whom flourished a wooden stump instead of a right leg and wore the garb of a greenwich pensioner  his change of circumstances did not appear to have decreased his love for tobacco  ben had obtained leave of absence from his ship for a day or two and after having delighted the heart of his old mother by a visit had called at the cottage to pay his respects to his old messmate little thinking that he would find tom riggles there before him  miss bessy blunt was also present and it was plain from the expression of her speaking countenance that she had not forgiven ben but tolerated him under protest  our hero and sweet nelly blyth were not of the party however because they happened just then to prefer a quiet chat in the summerhouse in the backgarden  we will not presume to detail much of the conversation that passed between them one or two of the concluding sentences must suffice  yes bill said nelly in reply to something that her companion had whispered in her ear you know well enough that i am glad tomorrow is our weddingday  i have told you so already fifty times at least  only thrice nell if so often said bill  well that was the luckiest shot the frenchmen ever fired at me for if i hadnt had my thumb took off i couldnt have left the sarvice dye see and that would have delayed my marriage with you nell  but now as the old song says    no more ill roam   away from home   across the stormy sea   ill anchor here   my nelly dear   and live for love and thee
