28324467	zane grey  the last trail  mcmix     chapter i  twilight of a certain summer day many years ago shaded softly down over the wild ohio valley bringing keen anxiety to a traveler on the lonely river trail he had expected to reach fort henry with his party on this night thus putting a welcome end to the long rough hazardous journey through the wilderness but the swift oncoming dusk made it imperative to halt the narrow forestskirted trail difficult to follow in broad daylight apparently led into gloomy aisles in the woods his guide had abandoned him that morning making excuse that his services were no longer needed his teamster was new to the frontier and altogether the situation caused him much uneasiness  i wouldnt so much mind another night in camp if the guide had not left us he said in a low tone to the teamster  that worthy shook his shaggy head and growled while he began unhitching the horses  uncle said a young man who had clambered out from the wagon we must be within a few miles of fort henry  how dye know were near the fort interrupted the teamster or safe either fer thet matter i dont know this country  the guide assured me we could easily make fort henry by sundown  thet guide i tell ye mr sheppard  not so loud do not alarm my daughter cautioned the man who had been called sheppard  did ye notice anythin queer about thet guide asked the teamster lowering his voice did ye see how oneasy he was last night did it strike ye he left us in a hurry kind of excited like in spite of his offhand manner  yes he acted odd or so it seemed to me replied sheppard how about you will  now that i think of it i believe he was queer he behaved like a man who expected somebody or feared something might happen i fancied however that it was simply the manner of a woodsman  wal i hev my opinion said the teamster in a gruff whisper ye was in a hurry to be agoin an wouldnt take no advice the furtrader at fort pitt didnt give this guide jenks no good send off said he wasnt wellknown round pitt cept he could handle a knife some  what is your opinion asked sheppard as the teamster paused  wal the valley below pitt is full of renegades outlaws an hossthieves the redskins aint so bad as they used to be but these white fellers are wussern ever this guide jenks might be in with them thats all mebbe im wrong i hope so the way he left us looks bad  we wont borrow trouble if we have come all this way without seeing either indian or outlawin fact without incidenti feel certain we can perform the remainder of the journey in safety then mr sheppard raised his voice here helen you lazy girl come out of that wagon we want some supper will you gather some firewood and well soon give this gloomy little glen a more cheerful aspect  as mr sheppard turned toward the canvascovered wagon a girl leaped lightly down beside him she was nearly as tall as he  is this fort henry she asked cheerily beginning to dance around him wheres the inn im so hungry how glad i am to get out of that wagon id like to run isnt this a lonesome lovely spot  a campfire soon crackled with hiss and sputter and fragrant woodsmoke filled the air steaming kettle and savory steaks of venison cheered the hungry travelers making them forget for the time the desertion of their guide and the fact that they might be lost the last glow faded entirely out of the western sky night enveloped the forest and the little glade was a bright spot in the gloom  the flickering light showed mr sheppard to be a wellpreserved old man with gray hair and ruddy kindly face the nephew had a boyish frank expression the girl was a splendid specimen of womanhood her large laughing eyes were as dark as the shadows beneath the trees  suddenly a quick start on helens part interrupted the merry flow of conversation she sat bolt upright with halfaverted face  cousin what is the matter asked will quickly  helen remained motionless  my dear said mr sheppard sharply  i heard a footstep she whispered pointing with trembling finger toward the impenetrable blackness beyond the campfire  all could hear a soft patter on the leaves then distinct footfalls broke the silence  the tired teamster raised his shaggy head and glanced fearfully around the glade mr sheppard and will gazed doubtfully toward the foliage but helen did not change her position the travelers appeared stricken by the silence and solitude of the place the faint hum of insects and the low moan of the night wind seemed accentuated by the almost painful stillness  a panther most likely suggested sheppard in a voice which he intended should be reassuring i saw one today slinking along the trail  id better get my gun from the wagon said will  how dark and wild it is here exclaimed helen nervously i believe i was frightened perhaps i fancied itthere againlisten ah  two tall figures emerged from the darkness into the circle of light and with swift supple steps gained the campfire before any of the travelers had time to move they were indians and the brandishing of their tomahawks proclaimed that they were hostile  ugh grunted the taller savage as he looked down upon the defenseless frightened group  as the menacing figures stood in the glare of the fire gazing at the party with shifty eyes they presented a frightful appearance fierce lineaments all the more so because of bars of paint the hideous shaven heads adorned with tufts of hair holding a single feather sinewy coppercolored limbs suggestive of action and endurance the general aspect of untamed ferocity appalled the travelers and chilled their blood  grunts and chuckles manifested the satisfaction with which the indians fell upon the halffinished supper they caused it to vanish with astonishing celerity and resembled wolves rather than human beings in their greediness  helen looked timidly around as if hoping to see those who would aid and the savages regarded her with ill humor a movement on the part of any member of the group caused muscular hands to steal toward the tomahawks  suddenly the larger savage clutched his companions knee then lifting his hatchet shook it with a significant gesture in sheppards face at the same time putting a finger on his lips to enjoin silence both indians became statuesque in their immobility they crouched in an attitude of listening with heads bent on one side nostrils dilated and mouths open  one two three moments passed the silence of the forest appeared to be unbroken but ears as keen as those of a deer had detected some sound the larger savage dropped noiselessly to the ground where he lay stretched out with his ear to the ground the other remained immovable only his beady eyes gave signs of life and these covered every point  finally the big savage rose silently pointed down the dark trail and strode out of the circle of light his companion followed close at his heels the two disappeared in the black shadows like specters as silently as they had come  well breathed helen  i am immensely relieved exclaimed will  what do you make of such strange behavior sheppard asked of the teamster  ispect they got wind of somebody most likely thet guide anll be back again if they aint its because they got switched off by some signs or tokens skeered perhaps by the scent of the wind  hardly had he ceased speaking when again the circle of light was invaded by stalking forms  i thought so here comes the skulkin varmints whispered the teamster  but he was wrong a deep calm voice spoke the single word friends  two men in the brown garb of woodsmen approached one approached the travelers the other remained in the background leaning upon a long black rifle  thus exposed to the glare of the flames the foremost woodsman presented a singularly picturesque figure his costume was the fringed buckskins of the border fully six feet tall this lithelimbed young giant had something of the wild free grace of the indian in his posture  he surveyed the wondering travelers with dark grave eyes  did the reddys do any mischief he asked  no they didnt harm us replied sheppard they ate our supper and slipped off into the woods without so much as touching one of us but indeed sir we are mighty glad to see you  will echoed this sentiment and helens big eyes were fastened upon the stranger in welcome and wonder  we saw your fire blazin through the twilight an came up just in time to see the injuns make off  might they not hide in the bushes and shoot us asked will who had listened to many a border story at fort pitt it seems as if wed make good targets in this light  the gravity of the woodsmans face relaxed  you will pursue them asked helen  theyve melted into the nightshadows long ago he replied who was your guide  i hired him at fort pitt he left us suddenly this morning a big man with black beard and bushy eyebrows a bit of his ear had been shot or cut out sheppard replied  jenks one of bing leggets borderhawks  you have his name right and who may bing legget be  hes an outlaw jenks has been tryin to lead you into a trap likely he expected those injuns to show up a day or two ago somethin went wrong with the plan i reckon mebbe he was waitin for five shawnees an mebbe hell never see three of em again  something suggestive cold and grim in the last words did not escape the listeners  how far are we from fort henry asked sheppard  eighteen miles as a crow flies longer by trail  treachery exclaimed the old man we were no more than that this morning it is indeed fortunate that you found us i take it you are from fort henry and will guide us there i am an old friend of colonel zanes he will appreciate any kindness you may show us of course you know him  i am jonathan zane  sheppard suddenly realized that he was facing the most celebrated scout on the border in revolutionary times zanes fame had extended even to the far atlantic colonies  and your companion asked sheppard with keen interest he guessed what might be told border lore coupled jonathan zane with a strange and terrible character a border nemesis a mysterious shadowy elusive man whom few pioneers ever saw but of whom all knew  wetzel answered zane  with one accord the travelers gazed curiously at zanes silent companion in the dim background of the glow cast by the fire he stood a gigantic figure dark quiet and yet with something intangible in his shadowy outline  suddenly he appeared to merge into the gloom as if he really were a phantom a warning hist came from the bushes  with one swift kick zane scattered the campfire  the travelers waited with bated breaths they could hear nothing save the beating of their own hearts they could not even see each other  better go to sleep came in zanes calm voice what a relief it was well keep watch an at daybreak guide you to fort henry     chapter ii  colonel zane a rugged stalwart pioneer with a strong dark face sat listening to his old friends dramatic story at its close a genial smile twinkled in his fine dark eyes  well well sheppard no doubt it was a thrilling adventure to you he said it might have been a little more interesting and doubtless would had i not sent wetzel and jonathan to look you up  you did how on earth did you know i was on the border i counted much on the surprise i should give you  my indian runners leave fort pitt ahead of any travelers and acquaint me with particulars  i remembered a fleetlooking indian who seemed to be asking for information about us when we arrived at fort pitt i am sorry i did not take the furtraders advice in regard to the guide but i was in such a hurry to come and didnt feel able to bear the expense of a raft or boat that we might come by river my nephew brought considerable gold and i all my earthly possessions  alls well that ends well replied colonel zane cheerily but we must thank providence that wetzel and jonathan came up in the nick of time  indeed yes im not likely to forget those fierce savages how they slipped off into the darkness i wonder if wetzel pursued them he disappeared last night and we did not see him again in fact we hardly had a fair look at him i question if i should recognize him now unless by his great stature  he was ahead of jonathan on the trail that is wetzels way in times of danger he is seldom seen yet is always near but come let us go out and look around i am running up a log cabin which will come in handy for you  they passed out into the shade of pine and maples a winding path led down a gentle slope on the hillside under a spreading tree a throng of bearded pioneers clad in faded buckskins and wearing whiteringed coonskin caps were erecting a log cabin  life here on the border is keen hard invigorating said colonel zane i tell you george sheppard in spite of your gray hair and your pretty daughter you have come out west because you want to live among men who do things  colonel i wont gainsay ive still got hot blood replied sheppard but i came to fort henry for land my old home in williamsburg has fallen into ruin together with the fortunes of my family i brought my daughter and my nephew because i wanted them to take root in new soil  well george right glad we are to have you where are your sons i remember them though tis sixteen long years since i left old williamsburg  gone the revolution took my sons helen is the last of the family  well well indeed thats hard independence has cost you colonists as big a price as borderfreedom has us pioneers come old friend forget the past a new life begins for you here and it will be one which gives you much see up goes a cabin that will soon be your home  sheppards eye marked the sturdy pioneers and a fast diminishing pile of whiteoak logs  hoheave cried a brawny foreman  a dozen stout shoulders sagged beneath a welltrimmed log  hoheave yelled the foreman  see up she goes cried the colonel and tomorrow night shell shed rain  they walked down a sandy lane bounded on the right by a wide green clearing and on the left by a line of chestnuts and maples outposts of the thick forests beyond  yours is a fine site for a house observed sheppard taking in the cleantrimmed field that extended up the hillside a brook that splashed clear and noisy over the stones to tarry in a little grassbound lake which forced water through halfhollowed logs into a spring house  i think so this is the fourth time ive put up a cabin on this land replied the colonel  hows that  the redskins are keen to burn things  sheppard laughed at the pioneers reply its not difficult colonel zane to understand why fort henry has stood all these years with you as its leader certainly the location for your cabin is the finest in the settlement what a view  high upon a bluff overhanging the majestic slowwinding ohio the colonels cabin afforded a commanding position from which to view the picturesque valley sheppards eye first caught the outline of the huge bold timeblackened fort which frowned protectingly over surrounding logcabins then he saw the widesweeping river with its verdant islands golden sandy bars and willowbordered shores while beyond rolling pastures of wavy grass merging into green forests that swept upward with slow swell until lost in the dim purple of distant mountains  sixteen years ago i came out of the thicket upon yonder bluff and saw this valley i was deeply impressed by its beauty but more by its wonderful promise  were you alone  i and my dog there had been a few white men before me on the river but i was the first to see this glorious valley from the bluff now george ill let you have a hundred acres of wellcleared land the soil is so rich you can raise two crops in one season with some stock and a few good hands youll soon be a busy man  i didnt expect so much land i cant well afford to pay for it  talk to me of payment when the farm yields an income is this young nephew of yours strong and willing  he is and has gold enough to buy a big farm  let him keep his money and make a comfortable home for some good lass we marry our young people early out here and your daughter george is she fitted for this hard border life  never fear for helen  the brunt of this pioneer work falls on our women god bless them how heroic theyve been the life here is rough for a man let alone a woman but it is a mans game we need girls girls who will bear strong men yet i am always saddened when i see one come out on the border  i think i knew what i was bringing helen to and she didnt flinch said sheppard somewhat surprised at the tone in which the colonel spoke  no one knows until he has lived on the border well well all this is discouraging to you ah here is miss helen with my sister  the colonels fine dark face lost its sternness and brightened with a smile  i hope you rested well after your long ride  i am seldom tired and i have been made most comfortable i thank you and your sister replied the girl giving colonel zane her hand and including both him and his sister in her grateful glance  the colonels sister was a slender handsome young woman whose dark beauty showed to most effective advantage by the contrast with her companions fair skin golden hair and blue eyes  beautiful as was helen sheppard it was her eyes that held colonel zane irresistibly they were unusually large of a dark purpleblue that changed shaded shadowed with her every thought  come let us walk colonel zane said abruptly and with mr sheppard followed the girls down the path he escorted them to the fort showed a long room with little squares cut in the roughhewn logs many bullet holes firecharred timbers and dark stains terribly suggestive of the pain and heroism which the defense of that rude structure had cost  under helens eager questioning colonel zane yielded to his weakness for storytelling and recited the history of the last siege of fort henry how the renegade girty swooped down upon the settlement with hundreds of indians and british soldiers how for three days of whistling bullets flaming arrows screeching demons fire smoke and attack following attack the brave defenders stood at their posts there to die before yielding  grand breathed helen and her eyes glowed it was then betty zane ran with the powder oh ive heard the story  let my sister tell you of that said the colonel smiling  you was it you and helens eyes glowed brighter with the light of youths glory in great deeds  my sister has been wedded and widowed since then said colonel zane reading in helens earnest scrutiny of his sisters calm sad face a wonder if this quiet woman could be the fearless and famed elizabeth zane  impulsively helens hand closed softly over her companions out of the girlish sympathetic action a warm friendship was born  i imagine things do happen here said mr sheppard hoping to hear more from colonel zane  the colonel smiled grimly  every summer during fifteen years has been a bloody one on the border the sieges of fort henry and crawfords defeat the biggest things we ever knew out here are matters of history of course you are familiar with them but the numberless indian forays and attacks the women who have been carried into captivity by renegades the murdered farmers in fact ceaseless war never long directed at any point but carried on the entire length of the river are matters known only to the pioneers within five miles of fort henry i can show you where the laurel bushes grow three feet high over the ashes of two settlements and many a clearing where some unfortunate pioneer had staked his claim and thrown up a log cabin only to die fighting for his wife and children between here and fort pitt there is only one settlement yellow creek and most of its inhabitants are survivors of abandoned villages farther up the river last summer we had the moravian massacre the blackest most inhuman deed ever committed since then simon girty and his bloody redskins have lain low  you must always have had a big force said sheppard  weve managed always to be strong enough though there never were a large number of men here during the last siege i had only forty in the fort counting men women and boys but i had pioneers and women who could handle a rifle and the best bordermen on the frontier  do you make a distinction between pioneers and bordermen asked sheppard  indeed yes i am a pioneer a borderman is an indian hunter or scout for years my cabins housed andrew zane sam and john mccollock bill metzar and john and martin wetzel all of whom are dead not one saved his scalp fort henry is growing it has pioneers rivermen soldiers but only two bordermen wetzel and jonathan are the only ones we have left of those great men  they must be old mused helen with a dreamy glow still in her eyes  well miss helen not in years as you mean life here is old in experience few pioneers and no bordermen live to a great age wetzel is about forty and my brother jonathan still a young man but both are old in border lore  earnestly as a man who loves his subject colonel zane told his listeners of these two most prominent characters of the border sixteen years previously when but boys in years they had cast in their lot with his and journeyed over the virginian mountains wetzel to devote his life to the vengeful calling he had chosen and jonathan to give rein to an adventurous spirit and love of the wilds by some wonderful chance by cunning woodcraft or daring both men had lived through the years of border warfare which had brought to a close the careers of all their contemporaries  for many years wetzel preferred solitude to companionship he roamed the wilderness in pursuit of indians his lifelong foes and seldom appeared at the settlement except to bring news of an intended raid of the savages jonathan also spent much time alone in the woods or scouting along the river but of late years a friendship had ripened between the two bordermen mutual interest had brought them together on the trail of a noted renegade and when after many long days of patient watching and persistent tracking the outlaw paid an awful penalty for his bloody deeds these lone and silent men were friends  powerful in build fleet as deer fearless and tireless wetzels peculiar bloodhound sagacity ferocity and implacability balanced by jonathans keen intelligence and judgment caused these bordermen to become the bane of redmen and renegades their fame increased with each succeeding summer until now the people of the settlement looked upon wonderful deeds of strength and of woodcraft as a matter of course rejoicing in the power and skill with which these men were endowed  by common consent the pioneers attributed any mysterious deed from the finding of a fat turkey on a cabin doorstep to the discovery of a savage scalped and pulled from his ambush near a settlers spring to wetzel and jonathan all the more did they feel sure of this conclusion because the bordermen never spoke of their deeds sometimes a pioneer living on the outskirts of the settlement would be awakened in the morning by a single rifle shot and on peering out would see a dead indian lying almost across his doorstep while beyond in the dim gray mist a tall figure stealing away often in the twilight on a summer evening while fondling his children and enjoying his smoke after a hard days labor in the fields this same settler would see the tall dark figure of jonathan zane step noiselessly out of a thicket and learn that he must take his family and flee at once to the fort for safety when a settler was murdered his children carried into captivity by indians and the wife given over to the power of some brutal renegade tragedies wofully frequent on the border wetzel and jonathan took the trail alone many a white woman was returned alive and sometimes unharmed to her relatives more than one maiden lived to be captured rescued and returned to her lover while almost numberless were the bones of brutal redmen lying in the deep and gloomy woods or bleaching on the plains silent ghastly reminders of the stern justice meted out by these two heroes  such are my two bordermen miss sheppard the fort there and all these cabins would be only black ashes save for them and as for us our wives and childrengod only knows  havent they wives and children too asked helen  no answered colonel zane with his genial smile such joys are not for bordermen  why not fine men like them deserve happiness declared helen  it is necessary we have such said the colonel simply and they cannot be bordermen unless free as the air blows wetzel and jonathan have never had sweethearts i believe wetzel loved a lass once but he was an indiankiller whose hands were red with blood he silenced his heart and kept to his chosen lonely life jonathan does not seem to realize that women exist to charm to please to be loved and married once we twitted him about his brothers doing their duty by the border whereupon he flashed out my life is the borders my sweetheart is the north star  helen dreamily watched the dancing dimpling waves that broke on the stones of the river shore all unconscious of the powerful impression the colonels recital had made upon her she was feeling the greatness of the lives of these bordermen and the glory it would now be for her to share with others the pride in their protection  say sheppard look here said colonel zane on the return to his cabin that girl of yours has a pair of eyes i cant forget the way they flashed theyll cause more trouble here among my garrison than would a swarm of redskins  no you dont mean it out here in this wilderness queried sheppard doubtfully  well i do  o lord what a time ive had with that girl there was one man especially back home who made our lives miserable he was rich and well born but helen would have none of him he got around me old fool that i am practically stole what was left of my estate and gambled it away when helen said shed die before giving herself to him it was partly on his account that i brought her away then there were a lot of mooneyed beggars after her all the time and shes young and full of fire i hoped id marry her to some farmer out here and end my days in peace  peace with eyes like those never on this green earth and colonel zane laughed as he slapped his friend on the shoulder dont worry old fellow you cant help her having those changing darkblue eyes any more than you can help being proud of them they have won me already susceptible old backwoodsman ill help you with this spirited young lady ive had experience sheppard and dont you forget it first my sister a zane all through which is saying enough then as sweet and fiery a little indian princess as ever stepped in a beaded moccasin and since more than one beautiful impulsive creature being in authority i suppose its natural that all the work from keeping the garrison ready against an attack to straightening out love affairs should fall upon me ill take the care off your shoulders ill keep these young daredevils from killing each other over miss helens favors i certainlyhello there are strangers at the gate somethings up  half a dozen roughlooking men had appeared from round the corner of the cabin and halted at the gate  bill elsing and some of his men from yellow creek said colonel zane as he went toward the group  hullo kurnel was the greeting of the foremost evidently the leader weve lost six head of hosses over our way an are out lookin em up  the deuce you have say this horsestealing business is getting interesting what did you come in for  wal we meets jonathan on the ridge about sunup an he sent us back licketycut said he had two of the hosses corralled an mebbe wetzel could git the others  thats strange replied colonel zane thoughtfully  pears to me jack and wetzel hev some redskins treed an didnt want us to spile the fun mebbe there wasnt scalps enough to go round anyway we come in an well hang up here today  bill whos doing this horsestealing  damn if i know its a mighty pert piece of work ive a mind its some slick white fellar with injuns backin him  helen noted when she was once more indoors that colonel zanes wife appeared worried her usual placid expression was gone she put off the playful overtures of her two bright boys with unusual indifference and turned to her husband with anxious questioning as to whether the strangers brought news of indians upon being assured that such was not the case she looked relieved and explained to helen that she had seen armed men come so often to consult the colonel regarding dangerous missions and expeditions that the sight of a stranger caused her unspeakable dread  i am accustomed to danger yet i can never control my fears for my husband and children said mrs zane the older i grow the more of a coward i am oh this border life is sad for women only a little while ago my brother samuel mccolloch was shot and scalped right here on the river bank he was going to the spring for a bucket of water i lost another brother in almost the same way every day during the summer a husband and a father fall victim to some murderous indian my husband will go in the same way some day the border claims them all  bessie you must not show your fears to our new friend and miss helen dont believe shes the coward she would make out said the colonels sister smilingly  betty is right bess dont frighten her said colonel zane im afraid i talked too much today but miss helen you were so interested and are such a good listener that i couldnt refrain once for all let me say that you will no doubt see stirring life here but there is little danger of its affecting you to be sure i think youll have troubles but not with indians or outlaws  he winked at his wife and sister at first helen did not understand his sally but then she blushed red all over her fair face  some time after that while unpacking her belongings she heard the clatter of horses hoofs on the rocky road accompanied by loud voices running to the window she saw a group of men at the gate  miss sheppard will you come out called colonel zanes sister from the door my brother jonathan has returned  helen joined betty at the door and looked over her shoulder  wal jack ye got two on em anyways drawled a voice which she recognized as that of elsings  a man lithe and supple slipped from the back of one of the horses and giving the halter to elsing with a single word turned and entered the gate colonel zane met him there  well jonathan whats up  theres hell to pay was the reply and the speakers voice rang clear and sharp  colonel zane laid his hand on his brothers shoulder and thus they stood for a moment singularly alike and yet the sturdy pioneer was somehow far different from the darkhaired borderman  i thought wed trouble in store from the look on your face said the colonel calmly i hope you havent very bad news on the first day for our old friends from virginia  jonathan cried betty when he did not answer the colonel at her call he half turned and his dark eyes steady strained like those of a watching deer sought his sisters face  betty old jake lane was murdered by horse thieves yesterday and mabel lane is gone  oh gasped betty but she said nothing more  colonel zane cursed inaudibly  you know eb i tried to keep lane in the settlement for mabels sake but he wanted to work that farm i believe horsestealing wasnt as much of an object as the girl pretty women are bad for the border or any other place i guess wetzel has taken the trail and i came in because ive serious suspicionsill explain to you alone  the borderman bowed gravely to helen with a natural grace and yet a manner that sat awkwardly upon him the girl slightly flushed and somewhat confused by this meeting with the man around whom her romantic imagination had already woven a story stood in the doorway after giving him a fleeting glance the fairest sweetest picture of girlish beauty ever seen  the men went into the house but their voices came distinctly through the door  eb if bing legget or girty ever see that bigeyed lass theyll have her even if fort henry has to be burned an in case they do get her wetzel an ill have taken our last trail     chapter iii  supper over colonel zane led his guests to a side porch where they were soon joined by mrs zane and betty the hosts two boys noah and sammy who had preceded them were now astride the porchrail and to judge by their antics were riding wild indian mustangs  its quite cool said colonel zane but i want you to see the sunset in the valley a good many of your future neighbors may come over tonight for a word of welcome its the border custom  he was about to seat himself by the side of mr sheppard on a rustic bench when a negro maid appeared in the doorway carrying a smiling blackeyed baby colonel zane took the child and holding it aloft said with fatherly pride  this is rebecca zane the first girl baby born to the zanes and destined to be the belle of the border  may i have her asked helen softly holding out her arms she took the child and placed it upon her knee where its look of solemnity soon changed to one of infantile delight  here come nell and jim said mrs zane pointing toward the fort  yes and there comes my brother silas with his wife too added colonel zane the first couple are james douns our young minister and nell his wife they came out here a year or so ago james had a brother joe the finest young fellow who ever caught the border fever he was killed by one of the girtys his was a wonderful story and some day you shall hear about the parson and his wife  whats the border fever asked mr sheppard  its what brought you out here replied colonel zane with a hearty laugh  helen gazed with interest at the couple now coming into the yard and when they gained the porch she saw that the man was big and tall with a frank manly bearing while his wife was a slender little woman with bright sunny hair and a sweet smiling face they greeted helen and her father cordially  next came silas zane a typical bronzed and bearded pioneer with his buxom wife presently a little group of villagers joined the party they were rugged men clad in faded buckskins and soberfaced women who wore dresses of plain gray linsey they welcomed the newcomers with simple homely courtesy then six young frontiersmen appeared from around a corner of the cabin advancing hesitatingly to helen they all looked alike tall awkward with brown faces and big hands when colonel zane cheerily cried out to them they stumbled forward with evident embarrassment each literally crushing helens hand in his horny palm afterward they leaned on the rail and stole glances at her  soon a large number of villagers were on the porch or in the yard after paying their respects to helen and her father they took part in a general conversation two or three girls the latest callers were surrounded by half a dozen young fellows and their laughter sounded high above the hum of voices  helen gazed upon this company with mingled feelings of relief and pleasure she had been more concerned regarding the young people with whom her lot might be cast than the dangers of which others had told she knew that on the border there was no distinction of rank though she came of an old family and during her girlhood had been surrounded by refinement even luxury she had accepted cheerfully the reverses of fortune and was determined to curb the pride which had been hers it was necessary she should have friends warmhearted impulsive and loving she needed to have around her those in whom she could confide therefore it was with sincere pleasure she understood how groundless were her fears and knew that if she did not find good true friends the fault would be her own she saw at a glance that the colonels widowed sister was her equal perhaps her superior in education and breeding while nellie douns was as wellbred and gracious a little lady as she had ever met then the other girls too were charming with frank wholesomeness and freedom  concerning the young men of whom there were about a dozen helen had hardly arrived at a conclusion she liked the ruggedness the signs of honest worth which clung to them despite her youth she had been much sought after because of her personal attractions and had thus added experience to the natural keen intuition all women possess the glances of several of the men particularly the bold regard of one roger brandt whom colonel zane introduced she had seen before and learned to dislike on the whole however she was delighted with the prospect of new friends and future prosperity and she felt even greater pleasure in the certainty that her father shared her gratification  suddenly she became aware that the conversation had ceased she looked up to see the tall lithe form of jonathan zane as he strode across the porch she could see that a certain constraint had momentarily fallen upon the company it was an involuntary acknowledgment of the bordermans presence of a presence that worked on all alike with a subtle strong magnetism  ah jonathan come out to see the sunset its unusually fine tonight said colonel zane  with hardly more than a perceptible bow to those present the borderman took a seat near the rail and leaning upon it directed his gaze westward  helen sat so near she could have touched him she was conscious of the same strange feeling and impelling sense of power which had come upon her so strongly at first sight of him more than that a lively interest had been aroused in her this borderman was to her a new and novel character she was amused at learning that here was a young man absolutely indifferent to the charms of the opposite sex and although hardly admitting such a thing she believed it would be possible to win him from his indifference on raising her eyelids it was with the unconcern which a woman feigns when suspecting she is being regarded with admiring eyes but jonathan zane might not have known of her presence for all the attention he paid her therefore having a good opportunity to gaze at this borderman of daring deeds helen regarded him closely  he was clad from head to foot in smooth soft buckskin which fitted well his powerful frame beaded moccasins leggings bound high above the knees hunting coat laced and fringed all had the neat tidy appearance due to good care he wore no weapons his hair fell in a raven mass over his shoulders his profile was regular with a long straight nose strong chin and eyes black as night they were now fixed intently on the valley the whole face gave an impression of serenity of calmness  helen was wondering if the sad almost stern tranquility of that face ever changed when the baby cooed and held out its chubby little hands jonathans smile which came quickly accompanied by a warm light in the eyes relieved helen of an unaccountable repugnance she had begun to feel toward the borderman that smile brief as a flash showed his gentle kindness and told that he was not a creature who had set himself apart from human life and love  as he took little rebecca one of his hands touched helens if he had taken heed of the contact as any ordinary man might well have she would perhaps have thought nothing about it but because he did not appear to realize that her hand had been almost inclosed in his she could not help again feeling his singular personality she saw that this man had absolutely no thought of her at the moment this did not awaken resentment for with all her fire and pride she was not vain but amusement gave place to a respect which came involuntarily  little rebecca presently manifested the faithlessness peculiar to her sex and had no sooner been taken upon jonathans knee than she cried out to go back to helen  girls are uncommon coy critters said he with a grave smile in his eyes he handed back the child and once more was absorbed in the setting sun  helen looked down the valley to behold the most beautiful spectacle she had ever seen between the hills far to the west the sky flamed with a red and gold light the sun was poised above the river and the shimmering waters merged into a ruddy horizon long rays of crimson fire crossed the smooth waters a few purple clouds above caught the refulgence until aided by the delicate rose and blue space beyond they became many hued ships sailing on a rainbow sea each second saw a gorgeous transformation slowly the sun dipped into the golden flood one by one the clouds changed from crimson to gold from gold to rose and then to gray slowly all the tints faded until as the sun slipped out of sight the brilliance gave way to the soft afterglow of warm lights these in turn slowly toned down into gray twilight  helen retired to her room soon afterward and being unusually thoughtful sat down by the window she reviewed the events of this first day of her new life on the border her impressions had been so many so varied that she wanted to distinguish them first she felt glad with a sweet warm thankfulness that her father seemed so happy so encouraged by the outlook breaking old ties had been she knew no childs play for him she realized also that it had been done solely because there had been nothing left to offer her in the old home and in a new one were hope and possibilities then she was relieved at getting away from the attentions of a man whose persistence had been most annoying to her from thoughts of her father and the old life she came to her new friends of the present she was so grateful for their kindness she certainly would do all in her power to win and keep their esteem  somewhat of a surprise was it to her that she reserved for jonathan zane the last and most prominent place in her meditations she suddenly asked herself how she regarded this fighting borderman she recalled her unbounded enthusiasm for the man as colonel zane had told of him then her first glimpse and her surprise and admiration at the lithelimbed young giant then incredulity amusement and respect followed in swift order after which an unaccountable coldness that was almost resentment helen was forced to admit that she did not know how to regard him but surely he was a man throughout every inch of his superb frame and one who took life seriously with neither thought nor time for the opposite sex and this last brought a blush to her cheek for she distinctly remembered she had expected if not admiration more than passing notice from this hero of the border  presently she took a little mirror from a table near where she sat holding it to catch the fastfading light she studied her face seriously  helen sheppard i think on the occasion of your arrival in a new country a little plain talk will be wholesome somehow or other perhaps because of a crowd of idle men back there in the colonies possibly from your own misguided fancy you imagined you were fair to look at it is well to be undeceived  scorn spoke in helens voice she was angry because of having been interested in a man and allowed that interest to betray her into a girlish expectation that he would treat her as all other men had the mirror even in the dim light spoke more truly than she for it caught the golden tints of her luxuriant hair the thousand beautiful shadows in her great dark eyes the white glory of a face fair as a star and the swelling outline of neck and shoulders  with a sudden fiery impetuosity she flung the glass to the floor where it was broken into several pieces  how foolish of me what a temper i have she exclaimed repentantly im glad i have another glass wouldnt mr jonathan zane borderman indian fighter hero of a hundred battles and never a sweetheart be flattered no most decidedly he wouldnt he never looked at me i dont think i expected that im sure i didnt want it but still he might haveoh what am i thinking and he a stranger  before helen lost herself in slumber on that eventful evening she vowed to ignore the borderman assured herself that she did not want to see him again and rather inconsistently that she would cure him of his indifference                                       when colonel zanes guests had retired and the villagers were gone to their homes he was free to consult with jonathan  well jack he said im ready to hear about the horse thieves  wetzel makes it out the man whos runnin this hossstealin is located right here in fort henry answered the borderman  the colonel had lived too long on the frontier to show surprise he hummed a tune while the genial expression faded slowly from his face  last count there were one hundred and ten men at the fort he replied thoughtfully i know over a hundred and can trust them there are some new fellows on the boats and several strangers hanging round metzars  pears to lew an me that this fellar is a slick customer an one whos been here long enough to know our hosses an where we keep them  i see like miller who fooled us all even betty when he stole our powder and then sold us to girty rejoined colonel zane grimly  exactly only this fellar is slicker an more desperate than miller  right you are jack for the man who is trusted and betrays us must be desperate does he realize what hell get if we ever find out or is he underrating us  he knows all right an is matchin his cunnin against ourn  tell me what you and wetzel learned  the borderman proceeded to relate the events that had occurred during a recent tramp in the forest with wetzel while returning from a hunt in a swamp several miles over the ridge back of fort henry they ran across the trail of three indians they followed this until darkness set in when both laid down to rest and wait for the early dawn that time most propitious for taking the savage by surprise on resuming the trail they found that other indians had joined the party they were tracking to the bordermen this was significant of some unusual activity directed toward the settlement unable to learn anything definite from the moccasin traces they hurried up on the trail to find that the indians had halted  wetzel and jonathan saw from their covert that the savages had a woman prisoner a singular feature about it all was that the indians remained in the same place all day did not light a campfire and kept a sharp lookout the bordermen crept up as close as safe and remained on watch during the day and night  early next morning when the air was fading from black to gray the silence was broken by the snapping of twigs and a tremor of the ground the bordermen believed another company of indians was approaching but they soon saw it was a single white man leading a number of horses he departed before daybreak wetzel and jonathan could not get a clear view of him owing to the dim light but they heard his voice and afterwards found the imprint of his moccasins they did however recognize the six horses as belonging to settlers in yellow creek  while jonathan and wetzel were consulting as to what it was best to do the party of indians divided four going directly west and the others north wetzel immediately took the trail of the larger party with the prisoner and four of the horses jonathan caught two of the animals which the indians had turned loose and tied them in the forest he then started after the three indians who had gone northward  well colonel zane said impatiently when jonathan hesitated in his story  one got away he said reluctantly i barked him as he was runnin like a streak through the bushes an judged that he was hard hit i got the hosses an turned back on the trail of the white man  where did it end  in that hardpacked path near the blacksmith shop an the fellar steps as light as an injun  hes here then sure as youre born weve lost no horses yet but last week old sam heard a noise in the barn and on going there found bettys mare out of her stall  some one as knows the lay of the land had been after her suggested jonathan  you can bet on that weve got to find him before we lose all the fine horseflesh we own where do these stolen animals go indians would steal any kind but this thief takes only the best  im to meet wetzel on the ridge soon an then well know for hes goin to find out where the hosses are taken  thatll help some on the way back you found where the white girl had been taken from murdered father burned cabin the usual deviltry  exactly  poor mabel do you think this white thief had anything to do with carrying her away  no wetzel says thats bing leggets work the shawnees were members of his gang  well jack whatll i do  keep quiet an wait was the bordermans answer  colonel zane old pioneer and frontiersman though he was shuddered as he went to his room his brothers dark look and his deadly calmness were significant     chapter iv  to those few who saw jonathan zane in the village it seemed as if he was in his usual quiet and dreamy state the people were accustomed to his silence and long since learned that what little time he spent in the settlement was not given to sociability in the morning he sometimes lay with colonel zanes dog chief by the side of a spring under an elm tree and in the afternoon strolled aimlessly along the river bluff or on the hillside at night he sat on his brothers porch smoking a long indian pipe since that day now a week past when he had returned with the stolen horses his movements and habits were precisely what would have been expected of an unsuspicious borderman  in reality however jonathan was not what he seemed he knew all that was going on in the settlement hardly a bird could have entered the clearing unobserved  at night after all the villagers were in bed he stole cautiously about the stockade silencing with familiar word the bristling watchhounds and went from barn to barn ending his stealthy tramp at the corral where colonel zane kept his thoroughbreds  but all this scouting by night availed nothing no unusual event occurred not even the barking of a dog a suspicious rustling among the thickets or whistling of a nighthawk had been heard  vainly the borderman strained ears to catch some low nightsignal given by waiting indians to the white traitor within the settlement by day there was even less to attract the sharpeyed watcher the clumsy river boats half raft half sawn lumber drifted down the ohio on their first and last voyage discharged their cargoes of grain liquor or merchandise and were broken up their crews came back on the long overland journey to fort pitt there to man another craft the garrison at the fort performed their customary duties the pioneers tilled the fields the blacksmith scattered sparks the wheelwright worked industriously at his bench and the housewives attended to their many cares no strangers arrived at fort henry the quiet life of the village was uninterrupted  near sunset of a long day jonathan strolled down the sandy welltrodden path toward metzars inn he did not drink and consequently seldom visited the rude dark illsmelling barroom when occasion demanded his presence there he was evidently not welcome the original owner a sturdy soldier and pioneer came to fort henry when colonel zane founded the settlement and had been killed during girtys last attack his successor another metzar was according to jonathans belief as bad as the whiskey he dispensed more than one murder had been committed at the inn countless fatal knife and tomahawk fights had stained red the hard clay floor and more than one desperate character had been harbored there once colonel zane sent wetzel there to invite a thief and outlaw to quit the settlement with the not unexpected result that it became necessary the robber be carried out  jonathan thought of the bad name the place bore all over the frontier and wondered if metzar could tell anything about the horsethieves when the borderman bent his tall frame to enter the lowstudded door he fancied he saw a dark figure disappear into a room just behind the bar a roughlyclad heavilybearded man turned hastily at the same moment  hullo he said gruffly  h are you metzar i just dropped in to see if i could make a trade for your sorrel mare replied jonathan being well aware that the innkeeper would not part with his horse the borderman had made this announcement as his reason for entering the barroom  nope ill allow you cant replied metzar  as he turned to go jonathans eyes roamed around the barroom several strangers of shiftless aspect bleared at him  they wouldnt steal a pumpkin muttered jonathan to himself as he left the inn then he added suspiciously metzar was talkin to some one an peared uneasy i never liked metzar hell bear watchin  the borderman passed on down the path thinking of what he had heard against metzar the colonel had said that the man was prosperous for an innkeeper who took pelts grain or meat in exchange for rum the village gossips disliked him because he was unmarried taciturn and did not care for their company jonathan reflected also on the fact that indians were frequently coming to the inn and this made him distrustful of the proprietor it was true that colonel zane had redskinned visitors but there was always good reason for their coming jonathan had seen during the revolution more than one trusted man proven to be a traitor and the conviction settled upon him that some quiet scouting would show up the innkeeper as aiding the horsethieves if not actually in league with them  good evening jonathan zane  this greeting in a womans clear voice brought jonathan out from his reveries he glanced up to see helen sheppard standing in the doorway of her fathers cabin  evenin miss he said with a bow and would have passed on  wait she cried and stepped out of the door  he waited by the gate with a manner which showed that such a summons was novel to him  helen piqued at his curt greeting had asked him to wait without any idea of what she would say coming slowly down the path she felt again a subtle awe of this borderman regretting her impulsiveness she lost confidence  gaining the gate she looked up intending to speak but was unable to do so as she saw how cold and grave was his face and how piercing were his eyes she flushed slightly and then conscious of an embarrassment new and strange to her blushed rosy red making as it seemed to her a stupid remark about the sunset when he took her words literally and said the sunset was fine she felt guilty of deceitfulness whatever helens faults and they were many she was honest and because of not having looked at the sunset but only wanting him to see her as did other men the innocent ruse suddenly appeared mean and trifling  then with a womans quick intuition she understood that coquetries were lost on this borderman and with a smile got the better of her embarrassment and humiliation by telling the truth  i wanted to ask a favor of you and im a little afraid  she spoke with girlish shyness which increased as he stared at her  whywhy do you look at me so  theres a lake over yonder which the shawnees say is haunted by a woman they killed he replied quietly youd do for her spirit so white an beautiful in the silver moonlight  so my white dress makes me look ghostly she answered lightly though deeply conscious of surprise and pleasure at such an unexpected reply from him this borderman might be full of surprises such a time as i had bringing my dresses out here i dont know when i can wear them this is the simplest one  an its mighty new an bewilderin for the border he replied with a smile in his eyes  when these are gone ill get no more except linsey ones she said brightly yet her eyes shone with a wistful uncertainty of the future  will you be happy here  i am happy i have always wanted to be of some use in the world i assure you master zane i am not the butterfly i seem i have worked hard all day that is until your sister betty came over all the girls have helped me fix up the cabin until its more comfortable than i ever dreamed one could be on the frontier father is well content here and that makes me happy i havent had time for forebodings the young men of fort henry have beenwell attentive in fact theyve been here all the time  she laughed a little at this last remark and looked demurely at him  its a frontier custom he said  oh indeed do all the young men call often and stay late  they do  you didnt she retorted youre the only one who hasnt been to see me  i do not wait on the girls he replied with a grave smile  oh you dont do you expect them to wait on you she asked feeling now she had made this silent man talk once more at her ease  i am a borderman replied jonathan there was a certain dignity or sadness in his answer which reminded helen of colonel zanes portrayal of a bordermans life it struck her keenly here was this young giant standing erect and handsome before her as rugged as one of the ash trees of his beloved forest who could tell when his strong life might be ended by an indians hatchet  for you then is there no such thing as friendship she asked  on the border men are serious  this recalled his sisters conversation regarding the attentions of the young men that they would follow her fight for her and give her absolutely no peace until one of them had carried her to his cabin a bride  she could not carry on the usual conventional conversation with this borderman but remained silent for a time she realized more keenly than ever before how different he was from other men and watched closely as he stood gazing out over the river perhaps something she had said caused him to think of the many pleasures and joys he missed but she could not be certain what was in his mind she was not accustomed to impassive faces and cold eyes with unlit fires in their dark depths more likely he was thinking of matters nearer to his wild free life of his companion wetzel somewhere out beyond those frowning hills then she remembered that the colonel had told her of his brothers love for nature in all its forms how he watched the shades of evening fall lost himself in contemplation of the last copper glow flushing the western sky or became absorbed in the bright stars possibly he had forgotten her presence darkness was rapidly stealing down upon them the evening tranquil and gray crept over them with all its mystery he was a part of it she could not hope to understand him but saw clearly that his was no common personality she wanted to speak to voice a sympathy strong within her but she did not know what to say to this borderman  if what your sister tells me of the border is true i may soon need a friend she said after weighing well her words she faced him modestly yet bravely and looked him straight in the eyes because he did not reply she spoke again  i mean such a friend as you or wetzel  you may count on both he replied  thank you she said softly giving him her hand i shall not forget one more thing will you break a bordermans custom for my sake  how  come to see me when you are in the settlement  helen said this in a low voice with just a sob in her breath but she met his gaze fairly her big eyes were all aglow alight with girlish appeal and yet proud with a womans honest demand for fair exchange promise was there too could he but read it of wonderful possibilities  no he answered gently  helen was not prepared for such a rebuff she was interested in him and not ashamed to show it she feared only that he might misunderstand her but to refuse her proffered friendship that was indeed unexpected rude she thought it was while from brow to curving throat her fair skin crimsoned then her face grew pale as the moonlight hard on her resentment had surged the swell of some new emotion strong and sweet he refused her friendship because he did not dare accept it because his life was not his own because he was a borderman  while they stood thus jonathan looking perplexed and troubled feeling he had hurt her but knowing not what to say and helen with a warm softness in her eyes the stalwart figure of a man loomed out of the gathering darkness  ah miss helen good evening he said  is it you mr brandt asked helen of course you know mr zane  brandt acknowledged jonathans bow with an awkwardness which had certainly been absent in his greeting to helen he started slightly when she spoke the bordermans name  a brief pause ensued  good night said jonathan and left them  he had noticed brandts gesture of surprise slight though it was and was thinking about it as he walked away brandt may have been astonished at finding a borderman talking to a girl and certainly as far as jonathan was concerned the incident was without precedent but on the other hand brandt may have had another reason and jonathan tried to study out what it might be  he gave but little thought to helen that she might like him exceedingly well did not come into his mind he remembered his sister bettys gossip regarding helen and her admirers and particularly roger brandt but felt no great concern he had no curiosity to know more of her he admired helen because she was beautiful yet the feeling was much the same he might have experienced for a graceful deer a fullfoliaged tree or a dark mossystoned bend in a murmuring brook the girls face and figure perfect and alluring as they were had not awakened him from his indifference  on arriving at his brothers home he found the colonel and betty sitting on the porch  eb who is this brandt he asked  roger brandt hes a frenchcanadian came here from detroit a year ago why do you ask  i want to know more about him  colonel zane reflected a moment first as to this unusual request from jonathan and secondly in regard to what little he really did know of roger brandt  well jack i cant tell you much nothing of him before he showed up here he says he has been a pioneer hunter scout soldier tradereverything when he came to the fort we needed men it was just after girtys siege and all the cabins had been burned brandt seemed honest and was a good fellow besides he had gold he started the river barges which came from fort pitt he has surely done the settlement good service and has prospered i never talked a dozen times to him and even then not for long he appears to like the young people which is only natural thats all i know betty might tell you more for he tried to be attentive to her  did he betty jonathan asked  he followed me until i showed him i didnt care for company answered betty  what kind of a man is he  jack i know nothing against him although i never fancied him hes better educated than the majority of frontiersmen hes goodnatured and agreeable and the people like him  why dont you  betty looked surprised at his blunt question and then said with a laugh i never tried to reason why but since you have spoken i believe my dislike was instinctive  after betty had retired to her room the brothers remained on the porch smoking  bettys pretty keen jack i never knew her to misjudge a man why this sudden interest in roger brandt  the borderman puffed his pipe in silence  say jack colonel zane said suddenly do you connect brandt in any way with this horsestealing  no more than some an less than others replied jonathan curtly  nothing more was said for a time to the brothers this hour of early dusk brought the same fullness of peace from gray twilight to gloomy dusk quiet reigned the insects of night chirped and chorused with low incessant hum from out the darkness came the peeping of frogs  suddenly the borderman straightened up and removing the pipe from his mouth turned his ear to the faint breeze while at the same time one hand closed on the colonels knee with a warning clutch  colonel zane knew what that clutch signified some faint noise too low for ordinary ears had roused the borderman the colonel listened but heard nothing save the familiar evening sounds  jack whatd you hear he whispered  somethin back of the barn replied jonathan slipping noiselessly off the steps lying at full length with his ear close to the ground wheres the dog he asked  chief must have gone with sam the old nigger sometimes goes at this hour to see his daughter  jonathan lay on the grass several moments then suddenly he arose much as a bent sapling springs to place  i hear footsteps get the rifles he said in a fierce whisper  damn there is some one in the barn  no theyre outside hurry but softly  colonel zane had but just risen to his feet when mrs zane came to the door and called him by name  instantly from somewhere in the darkness overhanging the road came a low warning whistle  a signal exclaimed colonel zane  quick eb look toward metzars light one two three shadowsinjuns  by the lord harry now theyre gone but i couldnt mistake those round heads and bristling feathers  shawnees said the borderman and his teeth shut hard like steel on flint  jack they were after the horses and some one was on the lookout by god right under our noses  hurry cried jonathan pulling his brother off the porch  colonel zane followed the borderman out of the yard into the road and across the grassy square  we might find the one who gave the signal said the colonel he was near at hand and couldnt have passed the house  colonel zane was correct for whoever had whistled would be forced to take one of two ways of escape either down the straight road ahead or over the high stockade fence of the fort  there he goes whispered jonathan  where i cant see a blamed thing  go across the square run around the fort an head him off on the road dont try to stop him for hell have weapons just find out who he is  i see him now replied colonel zane as he hurried off into the darkness  during a few moments jonathan kept in view the shadow he had seen first come out of the gloom by the stockade and thence pass swiftly down the road he followed swiftly silently presently a light beyond threw a glare across the road he thought he was approaching a yard where there was a fire and the flames proved to be from pine cones burning in the yard of helen sheppard he remembered then that she was entertaining some of the young people  the figure he was pursuing did not pass the glare jonathan made certain it disappeared before reaching the light and he knew his eyesight too well not to trust to it absolutely advancing nearer the yard he heard the murmur of voices in gay conversation and soon saw figures moving about under the trees  no doubt was in his mind but that the man who gave the signal to warn the indians was one of helen sheppards guests  jonathan had walked across the street then down the path before he saw the colonel coming from the opposite direction halting under a maple he waited for his brother to approach  i didnt meet any one did you lose him whispered colonel zane breathlessly  no hes in there  thats sheppards place do you mean hes hiding there  no  colonel zane swore as was his habit when exasperated kind and generous man that he was it went hard with him to believe in the guilt of any of the young men he had trusted but jonathan had said there was a traitor among them and colonel zane did not question this assertion he knew the borderman during years full of strife and war and blood had he lived beside this silent man who said little but that little was the truth therefore colonel zane gave way to anger  well im not so damned surprised whats to be done  find out what men are there  thats easy ill go to see george and soon have the truth  wont do said the borderman decisively go back to the barn an look after the hosses  when colonel zane had obeyed jonathan dropped to his hands and knees and swiftly with the agile movements of an indian gained a corner of the sheppard yard he crouched in the shade of a big plum tree then at a favorable opportunity vaulted the fence and disappeared under a clump of lilac bushes  the evening wore away no more tediously to the borderman than to those young frontiersmen who were whispering tender or playful words to their partners time and patience were the same to jonathan zane he lay hidden under the fragrant lilacs his eyes accustomed to the dark from long practice losing no movement of the guests finally it became evident that the party was at an end one couple took the initiative and said good night to their hostess  tom bennet i hope its not you whispered the borderman to himself as he recognized the young fellow  a general movement followed until the merry party were assembled about helen near the front gate  jim morrison ill bet its not you was jonathans comment that soldier williams is doubtful hart an johnson being strangers are unknown quantities around here an then comes brandt  all departed except brandt who remained talking to helen in low earnest tones jonathan lay very quietly trying to decide what should be his next move in the unraveling of the mystery he paid little attention to the young couple but could not help overhearing their conversation  indeed mr brandt you frontiersmen are not backward helen was saying in her clear voice i am surprised to learn that you love me upon such short acquaintance and am sorry too for i hardly know whether i even so much as like you  i love you we men of the border do things rapidly he replied earnestly  so it seems she said with a soft laugh  wont you care for me he pleaded  nothing is surer than that i never know what i am going to do helen replied lightly  all these fellows are in love with you they cant help it any more than i you are the most glorious creature please give me hope  mr brandt let go my hand im afraid i dont like such impulsive men  please let me hold your hand  certainly not  but i will hold it and if you look at me like that again ill do more he said  what bold sir frontiersman she returned lightly still but in a voice which rang with a deeper note  ill kiss you he cried desperately  you wouldnt dare  wouldnt i though you dont know us border fellows yet you come here with your wonderful beauty and smile at us with that light in your eyes which makes men mad oh youll pay for it  the borderman listened to all this lovemaking half disgusted until he began to grow interested brandts back was turned to him and helen stood so that the light from the pine cones shone on her face her eyes were brilliant otherwise she seemed a woman perfectly selfpossessed brandt held her hand despite the repeated efforts she made to free it but she did not struggle violently or make an outcry  suddenly brandt grasped her other hand pulling her toward him  these other fellows will kiss you and im going to be the first he declared passionately  helen drew back now thoroughly alarmed by the mans fierce energy she had been warned against this very boldness in frontiersmen but had felt secure in her own pride and dignity her blood boiled at the thought that she must exert strength to escape insult she struggled violently when brandt bent his head almost sick with fear she had determined to call for help when a violent wrench almost toppled her over at the same instant her wrists were freed she heard a fierce cry a resounding blow and then the sodden thud of a heavy body falling recovering her balance she saw a tall figure beside her and a man in the act of rising from the ground  you whispered helen recognizing the tall figure as jonathans  the borderman did not answer he stepped forward slipping his hand inside his hunting frock brandt sprang nimbly to his feet and with a face which even in the dim light could be seen distorted with fury bent forward to look at the stranger he too had his hand within his coat as if grasping a weapon but he did not draw it  zane a lighter blow would have been easier to forget he cried his voice clear and cutting then he turned to the girl miss helen i got what i deserved i crave your forgiveness and ask you to understand a man who was once a gentleman if i am one no longer the frontier is to blame i was mad to treat you as i did  thus speaking he bowed low with the grace of a man sometimes used to the society of ladies and then went out of the gate  where did you come from asked helen looking up at jonathan  he pointed under the lilac bushes  were you there she asked wonderingly did you hear all  i couldnt help hearin  it was fortunate for me but whywhy were you there  helen came a step nearer and regarded him curiously with her great eyes now black with excitement  the borderman was silent  helens softened mood changed instantly there was nothing in his cold face which might have betrayed in him a sentiment similar to that of her admirers  did you spy on me she asked quickly after a moments thought  no replied jonathan calmly  helen gazed in perplexity at this strange man she did not know how to explain it she was irritated but did her best to conceal it he had no interest in her yet had hidden under the lilacs in her yard she was grateful because he had saved her from annoyance yet could not fathom his reason for being so near  did you come here to see me she asked forgetting her vexation  no  what for then  i reckon i wont say was the quiet deliberate refusal  helen stamped her foot in exasperation  be careful that i do not put a wrong construction on your strange action said she coldly if you have reasons you might trust me if you are only  shssh he breathed grasping her wrist and holding it firmly in his powerful hand the whole attitude of the man had altered swiftly subtly the listlessness was gone his lithe body became rigid as he leaned forward his head toward the ground and turned slightly in a manner that betokened intent listening  helen trembled as she felt his powerful frame quiver whatever had thus changed him gave her another glimpse of his complex personality it seemed to her incredible that with one whispered exclamation this man could change from cold indifference to a fire and force so strong as to dominate her  statuelike she remained listening but hearing no sound and thrillingly conscious of the hand on her arm  far up on the hillside an owl hooted dismally and an instant later faint and far away came an answer so low as to be almost indistinct  the borderman raised himself erect as he released her  its only an owl she said in relief  his eyes gleamed like stars  its wetzel an it means injuns  then he was gone into the darkness     chapter v  in the misty morning twilight colonel zane fully armed paced to and fro before his cabin on guard all night he had maintained a watch he had not considered it necessary to send his family into the fort to which they had often been compelled to flee on the previous night jonathan had come swiftly back to the cabin and speaking but two words seized his weapons and vanished into the black night the words were injuns wetzel and there were none others with more power to affect hearers on the border the colonel believed that wetzel had signaled to jonathan  on the west a deep gully with precipitous sides separated the settlement from a high wooded bluff wetzel often returned from his journeying by this difficult route he had no doubt seen indian signs and had communicated the intelligence to jonathan by their system of nightbird calls the nearness of the mighty hunter reassured colonel zane  when the colonel returned from his chase of the previous night he went directly to the stable there to find that the indians had made off with a thoroughbred and bettys pony colonel zane was furious not on account of the value of the horses but because bess was his favorite bay and betty loved nothing more than her pony madcap to have such a march stolen on him after he had heard and seen the thieves was indeed hard high time it was that these horse thieves be run to earth no indian had planned these marauding expeditions an intelligent white man was at the bottom of the thieving and he should pay for his treachery  the colonels temper however soon cooled he realized after thinking over the matter that he was fortunate it passed off without bloodshed very likely the intent had been to get all his horses perhaps his neighbors as well and it had been partly frustrated by jonathans keen sagacity these shawnees white leader or not would never again run such risks  its like a skulking shawnee muttered colonel zane to slip down here under cover of early dusk when no one but an indian hunter could detect him i didnt look for trouble especially so soon after the lesson we gave girty and his damned english and redskins its lucky jonathan was here ill go back to the old plan of stationing scouts at the outposts until snow flies  while colonel zane talked to himself and paced the path he had selected to patrol the white mists cleared and a rosy hue followed the brightening in the east the birds ceased twittering to break into gay songs and the cock in the barnyard gave one final clarionvoiced salute to the dawn the rose in the east deepened into rich red and then the sun peeped over the eastern hilltops to drench the valley with glad golden light  a blue smoke curling lazily from the stone chimney of his cabin showed that sam had made the kitchen fire and a little later a rich savory odor gave pleasing evidence that his wife was cooking breakfast  any sign of jack a voice called from the open door and betty appeared  nary sign  of the indians then  well betts they left you a token of their regard and colonel zane smiled as he took a broken halter from the fence  madcap cried betty  yes theyve taken madcap and bess  oh the villains poor pony exclaimed betty indignantly eb ill coax wetzel to fetch the pony home if he has to kill every shawnee in the valley  now youre talking betts colonel zane replied if you could get lew to do that much youd be blessed from one end of the border to the other  he walked up the road then back keeping a sharp lookout on all sides and bestowing a particularly keen glance at the hillside across the ravine but could see no sign of the bordermen as it was now broad daylight he felt convinced that further watch was unnecessary and went in to breakfast when he came out again the villagers were astir the sharp strokes of axes rang out on the clear morning air and a mellow anvilclang pealed up from the blacksmith shop colonel zane found his brother silas and jim douns near the gate  morning boys he cried cheerily  any glimpse of jack or lew asked silas  no but im expecting one of em any moment  how about the indians asked douns silas roused me out last night but didnt stay long enough to say more than indians  i dont know much more than silas i saw several of the red devils who stole the horses but how many where theyve gone or what were to expect i cant say weve got to wait for jack or lew silas keep the garrison in readiness at the fort and dont allow a man soldier or farmer to leave the clearing until further orders perhaps there were only three of those shawnees and then again the woods might have been full of them i take it somethings amiss or jack and lew would be in by now  here come sheppard and his girl said silas pointing down the lane pears george is some excited  colonel zane had much the same idea as he saw sheppard and his daughter the old man appeared in a hurry which was sufficient reason to believe him anxious or alarmed and helen looked pale  ebenezer whats this i hear about indians sheppard asked excitedly what with helens story about the fort being besieged and this brother of yours routing honest people from their beds i havent had a wink of sleep whats up where are the redskins  now george be easy said colonel zane calmly and you helen mustnt be frightened theres no danger we did have a visit from indians last night but they hurt no one and got only two horses  oh im so relieved that its not worse said helen  its bad enough helen betty cried her black eyes flashing my pony madcap is gone  colonel zane come here quick cried douns who stood near the gate  with one leap colonel zane was at the gate and following with his eyes the direction indicated by douns trembling finger he saw two tall brown figures striding down the lane one carried two rifles and the other a long bundle wrapped in a blanket  its jack and wetzel whispered colonel zane to jim theyve got the girl and by god from the way that bundle hangs i think shes dead here he added speaking loudly you women get into the house  mrs zane betty and helen stared  go into the house he cried authoritatively  without a protest the three women obeyed  at that moment nellie douns came across the lane sam shuffled out from the backyard and sheppard arose from his seat on the steps they joined colonel zane silas and jim at the gate  i wondered what kept you so late colonel zane said to jonathan as he and his companion came up youve fetched mabel and shes the good man could say no more if he should live an hundred years on the border amid savage murderers he would still be tenderhearted just now he believed the giant borderman by the side of jonathan held a dead girl one whom he had danced when a child upon his knee  mabel an jest alive replied jonathan  by god im glad exclaimed colonel zane here lew give her to me  wetzel relinquished his burden to the colonel  lew any bad indian sign asked colonel zane as he turned to go into the house  the borderman shook his head  wait for me added the colonel  he carried the girl to that apartment in the cabin which served the purpose of a sittingroom and laid her on a couch he gently removed the folds of the blanket disclosing to view a fragile whitefaced girl  bess hurry hurry he screamed to his wife and as she came running in followed no less hurriedly by betty helen and nellie he continued heres mabel lane alive poor child but in sore need of help first see whether she has any bodily injury if a bullet must be cut out or a knifewound sewed up its better she remained unconscious betty run for besss instruments and bring brandy and water lively now then he gave vent to an oath and left the room  helen her heart throbbing wildly went to the side of mrs zane who was kneeling by the couch she saw a delicate girl not over eighteen years old with a face that would have been beautiful but for the set lips the closed eyelids and an expression of intense pain  oh oh breathed helen  nell hand me the scissors said mrs zane and help me take off this dress why its wet but thank goodness tis not with blood i know that slippery touch too well there thats right betty give me a spoonful of brandy now heat a blanket and get one of your linsey gowns for this poor child  helen watched mrs zane as if fascinated the colonels wife continued to talk while with deft fingers she forced a few drops of brandy between the girls closed teeth then with the adroitness of a skilled surgeon she made the examination helen had heard of this pioneer womans skill in setting broken bones and treating injuries and when she looked from the calm face to the steady fingers she had no doubt as to the truth of what had been told  neither bullet wound cut bruise nor broken bone said mrs zane its fear starvation and the terrible shock  she rubbed mabels hands while gazing at her pale face then she forced more brandy between the tightlyclosed lips she was rewarded by ever so faint a color tinging the wan cheeks to be followed by a fluttering of the eyelids then the eyes opened wide they were large soft dark and humid with agony  helen could not bear their gaze she saw the shadow of death and of worse than death she looked away while in her heart rose a storm of passionate fury at the brutes who had made of this tender girl a wreck  the room was full of women now soberfaced matrons and graveeyed girls yet all wore the same expression not alone of anger nor fear nor pity but of all combined  helen instinctively felt that this was one of the trials of border endurance and she knew from the sterner faces of the maturer women that such a trial was familiar despite all she had been told the shock and pain were too great and she went out of the room sobbing  she almost fell over the broad back of jonathan zane who was sitting on the steps near him stood colonel zane talking with a tall man clad in faded buckskin  lass you shouldnt have stayed said colonel zane kindly  itshurtmehere said helen placing her hand over her heart  yes i know i know of course it has he replied taking her hand but be brave helen bear up bear up oh this border is a stern place do not think of that poor girl come let me introduce jonathans friend wetzel  helen looked up and held out her hand she saw a very tall man with extremely broad shoulders a mass of ravenblack hair and a white face he stepped forward and took her hand in his huge horny palm pressing it he stepped back without speaking colonel zane talked to her in a soothing voice but she failed to hear what he said this wetzel this indianhunter whom she had heard called deathwind of the border this companion guide teacher of jonathan zane this borderman of wonderful deeds stood before her  helen saw a cold face deathly in its pallor lighted by eyes sloeblack but like glinting steel striking as were these features they failed to fascinate as did the strange tracings which apparently showed through the white drawn skin this first repelled then drew her with wonderful force suffering of fire and frost and iron was written there and stronger than all so potent as to cause fear could be read the terrible purpose of this mans tragic life  you avenged her oh i know you did cried helen her whole heart leaping with a blaze to her eyes  she was answered by a smile but such a smile kindly it broke over the stern face giving a glimpse of a heart still warm beneath that steely cold behind it too there was something fateful something deadly  helen knew though the borderman spoke not that somewhere among the grasses of the broad plains or on the moss of the wooded hills lay dead the perpetrators of this outrage their still faces bearing the ghastly stamp of deathwind     chapter vi  happier days than she had hoped for dawned upon helen after the first touch of border sorrow mabel lane did not die helen and betty nursed the stricken girl tenderly weeping for very joy when signs of improvement appeared she had remained silent for several days always with that haunting fear in her eyes and then gradually came a change tender care and nursing had due effect in banishing the dark shadow one morning after a long sleep she awakened with a bright smile and from that time her improvement was rapid  helen wanted mabel to live with her the girls position was pitiable homeless fatherless with not a relative on the border yet so brave so patient that she aroused all the sympathy in helens breast village gossip was in substance that mabel had given her love to a young frontiersman by name alex bennet who had an affection for her so it was said but as yet had made no choice between her and the other lasses of the settlement what effect mabels terrible experience might have on this lukewarm lover helen could not even guess but she was not hopeful as to the future colonel zane and betty approved of helens plan to persuade mabel to live with her and the latters faint protestations they silenced by claiming she could be of great assistance in the management of the house therefore it was settled  finally the day came when mabel was ready to go with helen betty had given her a generous supply of clothing for all her belongings had been destroyed when the cabin was burned with helens strong young arm around her she voiced her gratitude to betty and mrs zane and started toward the sheppard home  from the green square where the ground was highest an unobstructed view could be had of the valley mabel gazed down the river to where her home formerly stood only a faint dark spot like a blur on the green landscape could be seen her soft eyes filled with tears but she spoke no word  shes game and thats why she didnt go under colonel zane said to himself as he mused on the strength and spirit of borderwomen to their heroism more than any other thing he attributed the establishing of homes in this wilderness  in the days that ensued as mabel grew stronger the girls became very fond of each other helen would have been happy at any time with such a sweet companion but just then when the poor girls mind was so sorely disturbed she was doubly glad for several days after mabel was out of danger helens thoughts had dwelt on a subject which caused extreme vexation she had begun to suspect that she encouraged too many admirers for whom she did not care and thought too much of a man who did not reciprocate she was gay and moody in turn during the moody hours she suspected herself and in her gay ones scorned the idea that she might ever care for a man who was indifferent but that thought once admitted had a trick of returning at odd moments clouding her cheerful moods  one sunshiny morning while the may flowers smiled under the hedge when dew sparkled on the leaves and the locustblossoms shone creamywhite amid the soft green of the trees the girls set about their muchplanned flower gardening helen was passionately fond of plants and had brought a jar of seeds of her favorites all the way from her eastern home  well plant the morningglories so theyll run up the porch and the dahlias in this long row and the nasturtiums in this round bed helen said  you have some trailing arbutus added mabel and must have clematis wild honeysuckle and goldenglow for they are all sweet flowers  this arbutus is so fresh so dewy so fragrant said helen bending aside a lilac bush to see the pale creeping flowers i never saw anything so beautiful i grow more and more in love with my new home and friends i have such a pretty garden to look into and i never tire of the view beyond  helen gazed with pleasure and pride at the garden with its fresh green and lavendercrested lilacs at the whiteblossomed trees and the vinecovered log cabins with blue smoke curling from their stone chimneys beyond the great bulk of the fort stood guard above the willowskirted river and far away over the winding stream the dark hills defiant kept their secrets  if it werent for that threatening fort one could imagine this little hamlet nestling under the great bluff as quiet and secure as it is beautiful said helen but that charred stockade fence with its scarred bastions and these lowering portholes always keep me alive to the reality  it wasnt very quiet when girty was here mabel replied thoughtfully  were you in the fort then asked helen breathlessly  oh yes i cooled the rifles for the men replied mabel calmly  tell me all about it  helen listened again to a story she had heard many times but told by new lips it always gained in vivid interest she never tired of hearing how the notorious renegade girty rode around the fort on his white horse giving the defenders an hour in which to surrender she learned again of the attack when the british soldiers remained silent on an adjoining hillside while the indians yelled exultantly and ran about in fiendish glee when wetzel began the battle by shooting an indian chieftain who had ventured within range of his ever fatal rifle and when it came to the heroic deeds of that memorable siege helen could not contain her enthusiasm she shed tears over little harry bennets death at the south bastion where though riddled with bullets he stuck to his post until relieved clarks race across the roof of the fort to extinguish a burning arrow she applauded with clapping hands her great eyes glowed and burned but she was silent when hearing how wetzel ran alone to a break in the stockade and there with an ax the terrible borderman held at bay the whole infuriated indian mob until the breach was closed lastly betty zanes nevertobeforgotten run with the powder to the relief of the garrison and the saving of the fort was something not to cry over or applaud but to dream of and to glorify  down that slope from colonel zanes cabin is where betty ran with the powder said mabel pointing  did you see her asked helen  yes i looked out of a porthole the indians stopped firing at the fort in their eagerness to shoot betty oh the banging of guns and yelling of savages was one fearful dreadful roar through all that hail of bullets betty ran swift as the wind  i almost wish girty would come again said helen  dont he might  how long has bettys husband mr clarke been dead inquired helen  i dont remember exactly he didnt live long after the siege some say he inhaled the flames while fighting fire inside the stockade  how sad  yes it was it nearly killed betty but we border girls do not give up easily we must not replied mabel an unquenchable spirit showing through the sadness of her eyes  merry voices interrupted them and they turned to see betty and nell entering the gate with nells bright chatter and bettys wit the conversation became indeed vivacious running from gossip to gowns and then to that old and ever new theme love shortly afterward the colonel entered the gate with swinging step and genial smile  well now if here arent four handsome lasses he said with an admiring glance  eb i believe if you were single any girl might well suspect you of being a flirt said betty  no girl ever did i tell you i was a ladykiller in my day replied colonel zane straightening his fine form he was indeed handsome with his stalwart frame dark bronzed face and rugged manly bearing  bess said you were but that it didnt last long after you saw her cried betty mischief gleaming in her dark eye  well thats so replied the colonel looking a trifle crestfallen but you know every dog has his day then advancing to the porch he looked at mabel with a more serious gaze as he asked how are you today  thank you colonel zane i am getting quite strong  look up the valley theres a raft coming down the river said he softly  far up the broad ohio a square patch showed dark against the green water  colonel zane saw mabel start and a dark red flush came over her pale face for an instant she gazed with an expression of appeal almost fear he knew the reason alex bennet was on that raft  i came over to ask if i can be of any service  tell him she answered simply  i say betts colonel zane cried has helens cousin cast any more such sheep eyes at you  oh eb what nonsense exclaimed betty blushing furiously  well if he didnt look sweet at you im an old fool  youre one anyway and youre horrid said betty tears of anger glistening in her eyes  colonel zane whistled softly as he walked down the lane he went into the wheelwrights shop to see about some repairs he was having made on a wagon and then strolled on down to the river two indians were sitting on the rude log wharf together with several frontiersmen and rivermen all waiting for the raft he conversed with the indians who were friendly chippewas until the raft was tied up the first person to leap on shore was a sturdy young fellow with a shock of yellow hair and a warm ruddy skin  hello alex did you have a good trip asked colonel zane of the youth  hare ye colonel zane yes firstrate trip replied young bennet say ive a word for you come aside and drawing colonel zane out of earshot of the others he continued i heard this by accident not that i didnt spy a bit when i got interested for i did but the way it came about was all chance briefly theres a man evidently an englishman at fort pitt whom i overheard say he was out on the border after a sheppard girl i happened to hear from one of brandts men who rode into pitt just before we left that you had new friends here by that name this fellow was a handsome chap no common sort but lordly dissipated and reckless as the devil he had a servant traveling with him a sailor by his gab who was about the toughest customer ive met in many a day he cut a fellow in bad shape at pitt these two will be on the next boat due here in a day or so according to river and weather conditions an i thought considerin how unusual the thing was id better tell ye  well well said colonel zane reflectively he recalled sheppards talk about an englishman alex you did well to tell me was the man drunk when he said he came west after a woman  sure he was replied alex but not when he spoke the name ye see i got suspicious an asked about him its this way jake wentz the trader told me the fellow asked for the sheppards when he got off the wagontrain when i first seen him he was drunk and i heard jeff lynn say as how the border was a bad place to come after a woman thats what made me prick up my ears then the englishman said it is eh by god id go to hell after a woman i wanted an colonel he looked it too  colonel zane remained thoughtful while alex made up a bundle and forced the haft of an ax under the string but as the young man started away the colonel suddenly remembered his errand down to the wharf  alex come back here he said and wondered if the lad had good stuff in him the boatmans face was plain but not evil and a close scrutiny of it rather prepossessed the colonel  alex ive some bad news for you and then bluntly with his keen gaze fastened on the young mans face he told of old lanes murder of mabels abduction and of her rescue by wetzel  alex began to curse and swear vengeance  stow all that said the colonel sharply wetzel followed four indians who had mabel and some stolen horses the redskins quarreled over the girl and two took the horses leaving mabel to the others wetzel went after these last tomahawked them and brought mabel home she was in a bad way but is now getting over the shock  say whatd we do here without wetzel alex said huskily unmindful of the tears that streamed from his eyes and ran over his brown cheeks poor old jake poor mabel damn me its my fault if id a done right an married her as i should as i wanted to she wouldnt have had to suffer but ill marry her yet if shell have me it was only because i had no farm no stock an only that little cabin as is full now that i waited  alex you know me said colonel zane in kindly tones look there down the clearing half a mile see that green strip of land along the river with the big chestnut in the middle and a cabin beyond theres as fine farming land as can be found on the border eighty acres well watered the day you marry mabel that farm is yours  alex grew red stammered and vainly tried to express his gratitude  come along the sooner you tell mabel the better said the colonel with glowing face he was a good matchmaker he derived more pleasure from a little charity bestowed upon a deserving person than from a seasons crops  when they arrived at the sheppard house the girls were still on the porch mabel rose when she saw alex standing white and still he poor fellow was embarrassed by the others who regarded him with steady eyes  colonel zane pushed alex up on the porch and said in a low voice mabel ive just arranged something youre to give alex its a nice little farm and itll be a wedding present  mabel looked in a bewildered manner from colonel zanes happy face to the girls and then at the red joyous features of her lover only then did she understand and uttering a strange little cry put her trembling hands to her bosom as she swayed to and fro  but she did not fall for alex quick at the last leaped forward and caught her in his arms                                       that evening helen denied herself to mr brandt and several other callers she sat on the porch with her father while he smoked his pipe  wheres will she asked  gone after snipe so he said replied her father  snipe how funny imagine will hunting hes surely catching the wild fever colonel zane told us about  he surely is  then came a time of silence mr sheppard accustomed to helens gladsome spirit and propensity to gay chatter noted how quiet she was and wondered  why are you so still  im a little homesick helen replied reluctantly  no well i declare this is a glorious country but not for such as you dear who love music and gaiety i often fear youll not be happy here and then i long for the old home which reminds me of your mother  dearest forget what i said cried helen earnestly im only a little blue today perhaps not at all homesick  indeed you always seemed happy  father i am happy its onlyonly a girls foolish sentiment  ive got something to tell you helen and it has bothered me since colonel zane spoke of it tonight mordaunt is coming to fort henry  mordaunt oh impossible who said so how did you learn  i fear tis true my dear colonel zane told me he had heard of an englishman at fort pitt who asked after us moreover the fellow answers the description of mordaunt i am afraid it is he and come after you  suppose he haswho cares we owe him nothing he cannot hurt us  but helen hes a desperate man arent you afraid of him  not i cried helen laughing in scorn hed better have a care he cant run things with a high hand out here on the border i told him i would have none of him and that ended it  im much relieved i didnt want to tell you but it seemed necessary well child good night ill go to bed  long after mr sheppard had retired helen sat thinking memories of the past and of the unwelcome suitor mordaunt thronged upon her thick and fast she could see him now with his pale handsome face and distinguished bearing she had liked him as she had other men until he involved her father with himself in financial ruin and had made his attention to her unpleasantly persistent then he had followed the fall of fortune with wild dissipation and became a gambler and a drunkard but he did not desist in his mad wooing he became like her shadow and life grew to be unendurable until her father planned to emigrate west when she hailed the news with joy and now mordaunt had tracked her to her new home she was sick with disgust then her spirit always strong and now freer for this new wild life of the frontier rose within her and she dismissed all thoughts of this man and his passion  the old life was dead and buried she was going to be happy here as for the present it was enough to think of the little border village now her home of her girl friends of the quiet borderman and for the moment that the twilight was somber and beautiful  high up on the wooded bluff rising so gloomily over the village she saw among the trees something silverbright she watched it rise slowly from behind the trees now hidden now white through rifts in the foliage until it soared lovely and grand above the black horizon the ebony shadows of night seemed to lift as might a sable mantle moved by invisible hands but dark shadows safe from the moonrays lay under the trees and a pale misty vapor hung below the brow of the bluff  mysterious as had grown the night before darkness yielded to the moon this pale white light flooding the still valley was even more soft and strange to one of helens temperament no thought was needed to see was enough yet her mind was active she felt with haunting power the beauty of all before her in fancy transporting herself far to those silvertipped clouds and peopling the dells and shady nooks under the hills with spirits and fairies maidens and valiant knights to her the day was as a faroff dream the great watch stars grew wan before the radiant moon it reigned alone the immensity of the world with its glimmering rivers pensive valleys and deep gloomy forests lay revealed under the glory of the clear light  absorbed in this contemplation helen remained a long time gazing with dreamy ecstasy at the moonlit valley until a slight chill disturbed her happy thoughts she knew she was not alone trembling she stood up to see easily recognizable in the moonlight the tall buckskingarbed figure of jonathan zane  well sir she called sharply yet with a tremor in her voice  the borderman came forward and stood in front of her somehow he appeared changed the long black rifle the dull glinting weapons made her shudder wilder and more untamable he looked than ever the very silence of the forest clung to him the fragrance of the grassy plains came faintly from his buckskin garments  evenin lass he said in his slow cool manner  how did you get here asked helen presently because he made no effort to explain his presence at such a late hour  i was able to walk  helen observed with a vaulting spirit one ever ready to rise in arms that master zane was disposed to add humor to his penetrating mysteriousness she flushed hot and then paled this borderman certainly possessed the power to vex her and reluctantly she admitted to chill her soul and rouse her fear she strove to keep back sharp words because she had learned that this singular individual always gave good reason for his odd actions  i think in kindness to me she said choosing her words carefully you might tell me why you appear so suddenly as if you had sprung out of the ground  are you alone  yes father is in bed so is mabel and will has not yet come home why  has no one else been here  mr brandt came as did some others but wishing to be alone i did not see them replied helen in perplexity  have you seen brandt since  since when  the night i watched by the lilac bush  yes several times replied helen something in his tone made her ashamed i couldnt very well escape when he called are you surprised because after he insulted me id see him  yes  helen felt more ashamed  you dont love him he continued  helen was so surprised she could only look into the dark face above her then she dropped her gaze abashed by his searching eyes but thinking of his question she subdued the vague stirrings of pleasure in her breast and answered coldly  no i do not but for the service you rendered me i should never have answered such a question  im glad an hope you care as little for the other five men who were here that night  i declare master zane you seem exceedingly interested in the affairs of a young woman whom you wont visit except as you have come tonight  he looked at her with his piercing eyes  you spied upon my guests she said in no wise abashed now that her temper was high did you care so very much  care he asked slowly  yes you were interested to know how many of my admirers were here what they did and what they said you even hint disparagingly of them  true i wanted to know he replied but i dont hint about any man  you are so interested you wouldnt call on me when i invited you said helen with poorly veiled sarcasm it was this that made her bitter she could never forget that she had asked this man to come to see her and he had refused  i reckon youve mistook me he said calmly  why did you come why do you shadow my friends this is twice you have done it goodness knows how many times youve been here tell me  the borderman remained silent  answer me commanded helen her eyes blazing she actually stamped her foot borderman or not you have no right to pry into my affairs if you are a gentleman tell me why you came here  the eyes jonathan turned on helen stilled all the angry throbbing of her blood  i come here to learn which of your lovers is the dastard who plotted the abduction of mabel lane an the thief who stole our hosses when i find the villain i reckon wetzel an ill swing him to some tree  the bordermans voice rang sharp and cold and when he ceased speaking she sank back upon the step shocked speechless to gaze up at him with staring eyes  dont look so lass dont be frightened he said his voice gentle and kind as it had been hard he took her hand in his you nettled me into replyin you have a sharp tongue lass and when i spoke i was thinkin of him im sorry  a horsethief and worse than murderer among my friends murmured helen shuddering yet she never thought to doubt his word  i followed him here the night of your company  do you know which one  no  he still held her hand unconsciously but helen knew it well a sense of his strength came with the warm pressure and comforted her she would need that powerful hand surely in the evil days which seemed to darken the horizon  what shall i do she whispered shuddering again  keep this secret between you an me  how can i how can i  you must his voice was deep and low if you tell your father or any one i might lose the chance to find this man for lass hes desperate cunnin then hed go free to rob others an mebbe help make off with other poor girls lass keep my secret  but he might try to carry me away said helen in fearful perplexity  most likely he might replied the borderman with the smile that came so rarely  oh knowing all this how can i meet any of these men again id betray myself  no youve got too much pluck it so happens you are the one to help me an wetzel rid the border of these hellhounds an you wont fail i know a woman when it comes to that  ii help you and wetzel  exactly  gracious cried helen halflaughing halfcrying and poor me with more trouble coming on the next boat  lass the colonel told me about the englishman itll be bad for him to annoy you  helen thrilled with the depth of meaning in the low voice fate surely was weaving a bond between her and this borderman she felt it in his steady piercing gaze in her own tingling blood  then as her natural courage dispelled all girlish fears she faced him white resolute with a look in her eyes that matched his own  i will do what i can she said     chapter vii  westward from fort henry far above the eddying river jonathan zane slowly climbed a narrow hazelbordered mountain trail from time to time he stopped in an open patch among the thickets and breathed deep of the fresh woodscented air while his keen gaze swept over the glades near by along the wooded hillsides and above at the timberstrewn woodland  this june morning in the wild forest was significant of natures brightness and joy broadleaved poplars dense foliaged oaks and vinecovered maples shaded cool mossy banks while between the trees the sunshine streamed in bright spots it shone silver on the glancing silverleaf and gold on the colored leaves of the butternut tree dewdrops glistened on the ferns ripples sparkled in the brooks spiderwebs glowed with wondrous rainbow hues and the flower of the forest the sweet palefaced daisy rose above the green like a white star  yellow birds flitted among the hazel bushes caroling joyously and catbirds sang gaily robins called bluejays screeched in the tall white oaks woodpeckers hammered in the dead hardwoods and crows cawed overhead squirrels chattered everywhere ruffed grouse rose with great bustle and a whirr flitting like brown flakes through the leaves from far above came the shrill cry of a hawk followed by the wilder scream of an eagle  wilderness music such as all this fell harmoniously on the bordermans ear it betokened the gladsome spirit of his wild friends happy in the warm sunshine above or in the cool depths beneath the fluttering leaves and everywhere in those lonely haunts unalarmed and free  familiar to jonathan almost as the footpath near his home was this winding trail on the height above was a safe rendezvous much frequented by him and wetzel every lichencovered stone mossy bank noisy brook and giant oak on the way up this mountainside could have told had they spoken their secrets stories of the bordermen the fragile ferns and slenderbladed grasses peeping from the gray and amber mosses and the flowers that hung from craggy ledges had wisdom to impart a borderman lived under the green treetops and therefore all the nodding branches of sassafras and laurel the grassy slopes and rocky cliffs the stately ash trees kingly oaks and dark mystic pines together with the creatures that dwelt among them save his deadly redskinned foes he loved other affection as close and true as this he had not known hearkening thus with single heart to natures teachings he learned her secrets certain it was therefore that the many hours he passed in the woods apart from savage pursuits were happy and fruitful  slowly he pressed on up the ascent at length coming into open light upon a small plateau marked by huge rugged weatherchipped stones on the eastern side was a rocky promontory and close to the edge of this cliff an hundred feet in sheer descent rose a gnarled time and tempesttwisted chestnut tree here the borderman laid down his rifle and knapsack and halfreclining against the tree settled himself to rest and wait  this craggy point was the lonely watchtower of eagles here on the highest headland for miles around where the bordermen were wont to meet the outlook was farreaching and grand  below the gray splintered cliffs sheered down to meet the waving treetops and then hill after hill slope after slope waved and rolled far far down to the green river open grassy patches bright little islands in that ocean of dark green shone on the hillsides the rounded ridges ran straight curved or zigzag but shaped their graceful lines in the descent to make the valley long purplehued shadowy depressions in the wide expanse of foliage marked deep clefts between ridges where dark cool streams bounded on to meet the river lower where the land was level in open spaces could be seen a broad trail yellow in the sunlight winding along with the curves of the watercourse on a swampy meadow blue in the distance a herd of buffalo browsed beyond the river high over the green island fort henry lay peaceful and solitary the only token of the works of man in all that vast panorama  jonathan zane was as much alone as if one thousand miles instead of five intervened between him and the settlement loneliness was to him a passion other men loved home the light of womans eyes the rattle of dice or the lust of hoarding but to him this wild remote promontory with its limitless view stretching away to the dim hazy horizon was more than all the aching joys of civilization  hours here or in the shady valley recompensed him for the loss of home comforts the soft touch of womans hands the kiss of baby lips and also for all he suffered in his pitiless pursuits the hard fare the steel and blood of a bordermans life  soon the sun shone straight overhead dwarfing the shadow of the chestnut on the rock  during such a time it was rare that any connected thought came into the bordermans mind his dark eyes now strangely luminous strayed lingeringly over those purple undulating slopes this intense watchfulness had no object neither had his listening he watched nothing he hearkened to the silence undoubtedly in this state of rapt absorption his perceptions were acutely alert but without thought as were those of the savage in the valley below or the eagle in the sky above  yet so perfectly trained were these perceptions that the least unnatural sound or sight brought him wary and watchful from his dreamy trance  the slight snapping of a twig in the thicket caused him to sit erect and reach out toward his rifle his eyes moved among the dark openings in the thicket in another moment a tall figure pressed the bushes apart jonathan let fall his rifle and sank back against the tree once more wetzel stepped over the rocks toward him  come from blue pond asked jonathan as the newcomer took a seat beside him  wetzel nodded as he carefully laid aside his long black rifle  any injun sign continued jonathan pushing toward his companion the knapsack of eatables he had brought from the settlement  nary shawnee track west of this divide answered wetzel helping himself to bread and cheese  lew we must go eastward over bing leggets way to find the trail of the stolen horses  likely an itll be a long hard tramp  whos in leggets gang now beside old horse the

horses go overland to detroit  i calkilate youve hit the mark  whatll we do asked jonathan  wait thats best weve no call to hurry we must know the truth before makin a move an as yet were only suspicious this lassll find out more in a week than we could in a year but jack have a care she dont fall into any snare brandt aint any too honest a lookin chap an them renegades is hell for women the scars you wear prove that well enough shes a rare sweet bloomin lass too i never seen her equal i remember how her eyes flashed when she said she knew id avenged mabel jack theyre wonderful eyes an that girl however sweet an good as she must be is chainlightnin wrapped up in a beautiful form arent the boys at the fort runnin arter her  like mad itd make you laugh to see em replied jonathan calmly  therell be some fights before shes settled for an mebbe arter thet have a care for her jack an see that she dont ketch you  no more danger than for you  i was ketched onct replied wetzel  jonathan zane looked up at his companion wetzels head was bowed but there was no merriment in the serious face exposed to the bordermans scrutiny  lew youre jokin  not me some day when youre ketched good an i have to go back to the lonely trail as i did afore you an me become friends mebbe then when im the last borderman ill tell you  lew cordin to the way settlers are comin in a few more years there wont be any need for a borderman when the injuns are all gone wherell be our work  taint likely either of usll ever see them times said wetzel an i dont want to wal jack im off now an ill meet you here every other day  wetzel shouldered his long rifle and soon passed out of sight down the mountainside  jonathan arose shook himself as a big dog might have done and went down into the valley only once did he pause in his descent and that was when a crackling twig warned him some heavy body was moving near silently he sank into the bushes bordering the trail he listened with his ear close to the ground presently he heard a noise as of two hard substances striking together he resumed his walk having recognized the grating noise of a deerhoof striking a rock farther down he espied a pair grazing the buck ran into the thicket but the doe eyed him curiously  less than an hours rapid walking brought him to the river here he plunged into a thicket of willows and emerged on a sandy strip of shore he carefully surveyed the river bank and then pulled a small birchbark canoe from among the foliage he launched the frail craft paddled across the river and beached it under a reedy overhanging bank  the distance from this point in a straight line to his destination was only a mile but a rocky bluff and a ravine necessitated his making a wide detour while lightly leaping over a brook his keen eye fell on an imprint in the sandy loam instantly he was on his knees the footprint was small evidently a womans and what was more unusual instead of the flat round moccasintrack it was pointed with a sharp square heel such shoes were not worn by border girls true betty and nell had them but they never went into the woods without moccasins  jonathans experienced eye saw that this imprint was not an hour old he gazed up at the light the day was growing short already shadows lay in the glens he would not long have light enough to follow the trail but he hurried on hoping to find the person who made it before darkness came he had not traveled many paces before learning that the one who made it was lost the uncertainty in those hasty steps was as plain to the bordermans eyes as if it had been written in words on the sand the course led along the brook avoiding the rough places and leading into the open glades and glens but it drew no nearer to the settlement a quarter of an hour of rapid trailing enabled jonathan to discern a dark figure moving among the trees abandoning the trail he cut across a ridge to head off the lost woman stepping out of a sassafras thicket he came face to face with helen sheppard  oh she cried in alarm and then the expression of terror gave place to one of extreme relief and gladness oh thank goodness youve found me im lost  i reckon answered jonathan grimly the settlements only five hundred yards over that hill  i was going the wrong way oh suppose you hadnt come exclaimed helen sinking on a log and looking up at him with warm glad eyes  how did you lose your way jonathan asked he saw neither the warmth in her eyes nor the gladness  i went up the hillside only a little way after flowers keeping the fort in sight all the time then i saw some lovely violets down a little hill and thought i might venture i found such loads of them i forgot everything else and i must have walked on a little way on turning to go back i couldnt find the little hill i have hunted in vain for the clearing it seems as if i have been wandering about for hours im so glad youve found me  werent you told to stay in the settlement inside the clearing demanded jonathan  yes replied helen with her head up  why didnt you  because i didnt choose  you ought to have better sense  it seems i hadnt helen said quietly but her eyes belied that calm voice  youre a headstrong child jonathan added curtly  mr zane cried helen with pale face  i suppose youve always had your own sweet will but out here on the border you ought to think a little of others if not of yourself  helen maintained a proud silence  you might have run right into prowlin shawnees  that dreadful disaster would not have caused you any sorrow she flashed out  of course it would i might have lost my scalp tryin to get you back home said jonathan beginning to hesitate plainly he did not know what to make of this remarkable young woman  such a pity to have lost all your fine hair she answered with a touch of scorn  jonathan flushed perhaps for the first time in his life if there was anything he was proud of it was his long glossy hair  miss helen im a poor hand at words he said with a pale grave face i was only speakin for your own good  you are exceedingly kind but need not trouble yourself  say jonathan hesitated looking halfvexed at the lovely angry face then an idea occurred to him well i wont trouble find your way home yourself  abruptly he turned and walked slowly away he had no idea of allowing her to go home alone but believed it might be well for her to think so if she did not call him back he would remain near at hand and when she showed signs of anxiety or fear he could go to her  helen determined she would die in the woods or be captured by shawnees before calling him back but she watched him slowly the tall strong figure with its graceful springy stride went down the glade he would be lost to view in a moment and then she would be alone how dark it had suddenly become the gray cloak of twilight was spread over the forest and in the hollows night already had settled down a breathless silence pervaded the woods how lonely thought helen with a shiver surely it would be dark before she could find the settlement what hill hid the settlement from view she did not know could not remember which he had pointed out suddenly she began to tremble she had been so frightened before he had found her and so relieved afterward and now he was going away  mr zane she cried with a great effort come back  jonathan kept slowly on  come back jonathan please  the borderman retraced his steps  please take me home she said lifting a fair face all flushed tearstained and marked with traces of storm i was foolish and silly to come into the woods and so glad to see you but you spoke to meinin a way no one ever used before im sure i deserved it please take me home papa will be worried  softer eyes and voice than hers never entreated man  come he said gently and taking her by the hand he led her up the ridge  thus they passed through the darkening forest hand in hand like a dusky redman and his bride he helped her over stones and logs but still held her hand when there was no need of it she looked up to see him walking so dark and calm beside her his eyes ever roving among the trees deepest remorse came upon her because of what she had said there was no sentiment for him in this walk under the dark canopy of the leaves he realized the responsibility any tree might hide a treacherous foe she would atone for her sarcasm she promised herself while walking ever conscious of her hand in his her bosom heaving with the sweet undeniable emotion which came knocking at her heart  soon they were out of the thicket and on the dusty lane a few moments of rapid walking brought them within sight of the twinkling lights of the village and a moment later they were at the lane leading to helens home releasing her hand she stopped him with a light touch and said  please dont tell papa or colonel zane  child i ought some one should make you stay at home  ill stay please dont tell it will worry papa  jonathan zane looked down into her great dark wonderful eyes with an unaccountable feeling he really did not hear what she asked something about that upturned face brought to his mind a rare and perfect flower which grew in faroff rocky fastnesses the feeling he had was intangible like no more than a breath of fragrant western wind faint with tidings of some beautiful field  promise me you wont tell  well lass have it your own way replied jonathan wonderingly conscious that it was the first pledge ever asked of him by a woman  thank you now we have two secrets havent we she laughed with eyes like stars  run home now lass be careful hereafter i do fear for you with such spirit an temper id rather be scalped by shawnees than have bing legget so much as set eyes on you  you would why her voice was like low soft music  why he mused itd seem like a buzzard about to light on a doe  goodnight said helen abruptly and wheeling she hurried down the lane     chapter viii  jack said colonel zane to his brother next morning today is saturday and all the men will be in there was high jinks over at metzars place yesterday and im looking for more today the two fellows alex bennet told me about came on daybeforeyesterdays boat sure enough ones a lordly englishman and the other the cussedestlooking little chap i ever saw they started trouble immediately the englishman his name is mordaunt hunted up the sheppards and as near as i can make out from georges story helen spoke her mind very plainly mordaunt and case thats his servant the little cuss got drunk and raised hell down at metzars where theyre staying brandt and williams are drinking hard too which is something unusual for brandt they got chummy at once with the englishman who seems to have plenty of gold and is fond of gambling this mordaunt is a gentleman or i never saw one i feel sorry for him he appears to be a ruined man if he lasts a week out here ill be surprised case looks ugly as if he were spoiling to cut somebody i want you to keep your eye peeled the day may pass off as many other days of drinking bouts have without anything serious and on the other hand theres liable to be trouble  jonathans preparations were characteristic of the borderman he laid aside his rifle and removing his short coat buckled on a second belt containing a heavier tomahawk and knife than those he had been wearing then he put on his hunting frock or shirt and wore it loose with the belts underneath instead of on the outside unfastened the frock was rather full and gave him the appearance of a man unarmed and careless  jonathan zane was not so reckless as to court danger nor like many frontiersmen fond of fighting for its own sake colonel zane was commandant of the fort and in a land where there was no law tried to maintain a semblance of it for years he had kept thieves renegades and outlaws away from his little settlement by dealing out stern justice his word was law and his bordermen executed it as such therefore jonathan and wetzel made it their duty to have a keen eye on all that was happening they kept the colonel posted and never interfered in any case without orders  the morning passed quietly jonathan strolled here or loitered there but saw none of the roisterers he believed they were sleeping off the effects of their orgy on the previous evening after dinner he smoked his pipe betty and helen passed and helen smiled it struck him suddenly that she had never looked at him in such a way before there was meaning in that warm radiant flash a little sense of vexation the source of which he did not understand stirred in him against this girl but with it came the realization that her white face and big dark eyes had risen before him often since the night before he wished for the first time that he could understand women better  everything quiet asked colonel zane coming out on the steps  all quiet answered jonathan  theyll open up later i suspect im going over to sheppards for a while and later will drop into metzars ill make him haul in a yard or two i dont like things i hear about his selling the youngsters rum id like you to be within call  the borderman strolled down the bluff and along the path which overhung the river he disliked metzar more than his brother suspected and with more weighty reason than that of selling rum to minors jonathan threw himself at length on the ground and mused over the situation  we never had any peace in this settlement an never will in our day eb is hopeful an looks at the bright side always expectin tomorrow will be different what have the past sixteen years been one long bloody fight an the next sixteen wont be any better i make out that well have a mixup soon metzar an brandt with their allies whoever they are will be in it an if bing leggets in the gang weve got as wetzel said a long hard trail which may be our last moren that therell be trouble about this chainlightnin girl as wetzel predicted women make trouble anyways an when theyre winsome an pretty they cause more but if theyre beautiful an fiery bent on havin their way as this new lass is all hell couldnt hold a candle to them we dont need the shawnees an girtys an hoss thieves round this here settlement to stir up excitin times now weve got this darkeyed lass an yet any fool could see shes sweet an good an true as gold  toward the middle of the afternoon jonathan sauntered in the direction of metzars inn it lay on the front of the bluff with its main doors looking into the road a long onestory log structure with two doors answered as a barroom the inn proper was a building more pretentious and joined the smaller one at its western end several horses were hitched outside and two great oxen yoked to a cumbersome mudcrusted wagon stood patiently by  jonathan bent his tall head as he entered the noisy barroom the dingy place reeked with tobacco smoke and the fumes of vile liquor it was crowded with men the lawlessness of the time and place was evident gaunt redfaced frontiersmen reeled to and fro across the sawdust floor hunters and furtraders raftsmen and farmers swelled the motley crowd young men honestfaced but flushed and wild with drink hung over the bar a group of sullenvisaged serpenteyed indians held one corner the blackbearded proprietor dealt out the rum  from beyond the barroom through a door entering upon the back porch came the rattling of dice jonathan crossed the barroom apparently oblivious to the keen glance metzar shot at him and went out upon the porch this also was crowded but there was more room because of greater space at one table sat some pioneers drinking and laughing at another were three men playing with dice colonel zane silas and sheppard were among the lookerson at the game jonathan joined them and gazed at the gamesters  brandt he knew well enough he had seen that set wolfish expression in the rivermans face before he observed however that the man had flushed cheeks and trembling hands indications of hard drinking the player sitting next to brandt was williams one of the garrison and a goodnatured fellow but garrulous and wickedly disposed when drunk the remaining player jonathan at once saw was the englishman mordaunt he was a handsome man with fair skin and long silken blond mustache heavy lines and purple shades under his blue eyes were die unmistakable stamp of dissipation reckless dissolute bad as he looked there yet clung something favorable about the man perhaps it was his cool devilmaycare way as he pushed over gold piece after gold piece from the fast diminishing pile before him his velvet frock and silken doublet had once been elegant but were now sadly the worse for border roughing  behind the englishmans chair jonathan saw a short man with a face resembling that of a jackal the grizzled stubbly beard the protruding vicious mouth the broad flat nose and deepset small glittering eyes made a bad impression on the observer this man jonathan concluded was the servant case who was so eager with his knife the borderman made the reflection that if knifeplay was the little mans pastime he was not likely to go short of sport in that vicinity  colonel zane attracted jonathans attention at this moment the pioneers had vacated the other table and silas and sheppard now sat by it the colonel wanted his brother to join them  here johnny bring drinks he said to the serving boy tell metzar who theyre for then turning to sheppard he continued he keeps good whiskey but few of these poor devils ever see it at the same time colonel zane pressed his foot upon that of jonathans  the borderman understood that the signal was intended to call attention to brandt the latter had leaned forward as jonathan passed by to take a seat with his brother and said something in a low tone to mordaunt and case jonathan knew by the way the englishman and his man quickly glanced up at him that he had been the subject of the remark  suddenly williams jumped to his feet with an oath  im cleaned out he cried  shall we play alone asked brandt of mordaunt  as you like replied the englishman in a tone which showed he cared not a whit whether he played or not  ive got work to do lets have some more drinks and play another time said brandt  the liquor was served and drank brandt pocketed his pile of spanish and english gold and rose to his feet he was a trifle unsteady but not drunk  will you gentlemen have a glass with me mordaunt asked of colonel zanes party  thank you some other time with pleasure we have our drink now colonel zane said courteously  meantime brandt had been whispering in cases ear the little man laughed at something the riverman said then he shuffled from behind the table he was short his compact build gave promise of unusual strength and agility  what are you going to do now asked mordaunt rising also he looked hard at case  shiver my sides capn if i dont need another drink replied the sailor  you have had enough come upstairs with me said mordaunt  easy with your hatch capn grinned case i want to drink with that ther injun killer ive had drinks with buccaneers and bad men all over the world and im not going to miss this chance  come on you will get into trouble you must not annoy these gentlemen said mordaunt  trouble is the name of my ship and shes a trim fast craft replied the man  his loud voice had put an end to the convention men began to crowd in from the barroom metzar himself came to see what had caused the excitement  the little man threw up his cap whooped and addressed himself to jonathan  injunkiller bad man of the border will you drink with a jolly old tar from england  suddenly a silence reigned like that in the depths of the forest to those who knew the borderman and few did not know him the invitation was nothing less than an insult but it did not appear to them as to him like a prearranged plot to provoke a fight  will you drink redskinhunter bawled the sailor  no said jonathan in his quiet voice  maybe you mean that against old england demanded case fiercely  the borderman eyed him steadily inscrutable as to feeling or intent and was silent  go out there and ill see the color of your insides quicker than id take a drink hissed the sailor with his brickred face distorted and hideous to look upon he pointed with a longbladed knife that no one had seen him draw to the green sward beyond the porch  the borderman neither spoke nor relaxed a muscle  ho ho my brave pirate of the plains cried case and he leered with braggart sneer into the faces of jonathan and his companions  it so happened that sheppard sat nearest to him and got the full effect of the sailors hot rumsoaked breath he arose with a pale face  colonel i cant stand this he said hastily lets get away from that drunken ruffian  whos a drunken ruffian yelled case more angry than ever im not drunk but im going to be and cut some of you whitelivered border mates here you old masthead drink this to my health damn you  the ruffian had seized a tumbler of liquor from the table and held it toward sheppard while he brandished his long knife  white as snow sheppard backed against the wall but did not take the drink  the sailor had the floor no one save him spoke a word the action had been so rapid that there had hardly been time colonel zane and silas were as quiet and tense as the borderman  drink hoarsely cried the sailor advancing his knife toward sheppards body  when the sharp point all but pressed against the old man a bright object twinkled through the air it struck cases wrist knocked the knife from his fingers and bounding against the wall fell upon the floor it was a tomahawk  the borderman sprang over the table like a huge catamount and with movement equally quick knocked case with a crash against the wall closed on him before he could move a hand and flung him like a sack of meal over the bluff  the tension relieved some of the crowd laughed others looked over the embankment to see how case had fared and others remarked that for some reason he had gotten off better than they expected  the borderman remained silent he leaned against a post with broad breast gently heaving but his eyes sparkled as they watched brandt williams mordaunt and metzar the englishman alone spoke  handily done he said cool and suave sir yours is an iron hand i apologize for this unpleasant affair my man is quarrelsome when under the influence of liquor  metzar a word with you cried colonel zane curtly  come inside kunnel said the innkeeper plainly ill at ease  no listen here ill speak to the point youve got to stop running this kind of a place no words now youve got to stop understand you know as well as i perhaps better the character of your socalled inn youll get but one more chance  wal kunnel this is a free country growled metzar i cant help these fellars comin here lookin fer blood i runs an honest place the men want to drink an gamble whats law here what can you do  you know me metzar colonel zane said grimly i dont waste words to hell with law so you say i can say that too remember the next drunken boy i see or shady deal or gambling spree out you go for good  metzar lowered his shaggy head and left the porch brandt and his friends with serious faces withdrew into the barroom  the borderman walked around the corner of the inn and up the lane the colonel with silas and sheppard followed in more leisurely fashion at a shout from some one they turned to see a dusty bloody figure with ragged clothes stagger up from the bluff  theres that blamed sailor now said sheppard hes a tough nut my what a knock on the head jonathan gave him strikes me too that tomahawk came almost at the right time to save me a whole skin  i was furious but not at all alarmed rejoined colonel zane  i wondered what made you so quiet  i was waiting jonathan never acts until the right moment and thenwell you saw him the little villain deserved killing i could have shot him with pleasure do you know sheppard jonathans aversion to shedding blood is a singular thing hed never kill the worst kind of a white man until driven to it  thats commendable how about wetzel  well lew is different replied colonel zane with a shudder if i told him to take an ax and clean out metzars placegod what a wreck hed make of it maybe ill have to tell him and if i do youll see something you can never forget     chapter ix  on sunday morning under the bright warm sun the little hamlet of fort henry lay peacefully quiet as if no storms had ever rolled and thundered overhead no roistering ever disturbed its stillness and no indians yell ever horribly broke the quiet  tis a fine morning said colonel zane joining his sister on the porch well how nice you look all in white for the first time sincewell you do look charming youre going to church of course  yes i invited helen and her cousin to go ive persuaded her to teach my sundayschool class and ill take another of older children replied betty  thats well the youngsters dont have much chance to learn out here but weve made one great stride a church and a preacher means very much to young people next shall come the village school  helen and i might teach our classes an hour or two every afternoon  it would be a grand thing if you did fancy these tots growing up unable to read or write i hate to think of it but the lord knows ive done my best ive had my troubles in keeping them alive  helen suggested the day school she takes the greatest interest in everything and everybody her energy is remarkable she simply must move must do something she overflows with kindness and sympathy yesterday she cried with happiness when mabel told her alex was eager to be married very soon i tell you eb helen is a fine character  yes good as she is pretty which is saying some mused the colonel i wonder wholl be the lucky fellow to win her  its hard to say not that englishman surely she hates him jonathan might you should see her eyes when he is mentioned  say betts you dont mean it eagerly asked her brother  yes i do returned betty nodding her head positively im not easily deceived about those things helens completely fascinated with jack she might be only a sixteenyearold girl for the way she betrays herself to me  betty i have a beautiful plan  no doubt youre full of them  we can do it betty we can you and i he said as he squeezed her arm  my dear old matchmaking brother returned betty laughing it takes two to make a bargain jack must be considered  bosh exclaimed the colonel snapping his fingers you neednt tell me any young manany man could resist that glorious girl  perhaps not i couldnt if i were a man but jacks not like other people hed never realize that she cared for him besides hes a borderman  i know and thats the only serious obstacle but he could scout around the fort even if he was married these long lonely terrible journeys taken by him and wetzel are mostly unnecessary a sweet wife could soon make him see that the border will be civilized in a few years and because of that hed better give over hunting for indians id like to see him married and settled down like all the rest of us even isaac you know jacks the last of the zanes that is the old zanes the difficulty arising from his extreme modesty and bashfulness can easily be overcome  how most wonderful brother  easy as pie tell jack that helen is dying of love for him and tell her that jack loves  but dear eb that latter part is not true interposed betty  true of course its true or would be in any man who wasnt as blind as a bat well tell her jack cares for her but he is a borderman with stern ideas of duty and so slow and backward hed never tell his love even if he had overcome his tricks of ranging that would settle it with any girl worth her salt and this one will fetch jack in ten days or less  eb youre a devil said betty gaily and then she added in a more sober vein i understand eb your idea is prompted by love of jack and its all right i never see him go out of the clearing but i think it may be for the last time even as on that day so long ago when brother andrew waved his cap to us and never came back jack is the best man in the world and i too want to see him happy with a wife and babies and a settled occupation in life i think we might weave a pretty little romance shall we try  try well do it now betts you explain it to both you can do it smoother than i and telling them is really the finest point of our little plot ill help the good work along afterwards hell be out presently nail him at once  jonathan all unconscious of the deeplaid scheme to make him happy soon came out on the porch and stretched his long arms as he breathed freely of the morning air  hello jack where are you bound asked betty clasping one of his powerful buckskinclad knees with her arm  i reckon ill go over to the spring he replied patting her dark glossy head  do you know i want to tell you something jack and its quite serious she said blushing a little at her guilt but resolute to carry out her part of the plot  well dear he asked as she hesitated  do you like helen  that is a question jonathan replied after a moment  never mind tell me she persisted  he made no answer  well jack shesshes wildly in love with you  the borderman stood very still for several moments then with one step he gained the lawn and turned to confront her  whats that you say  betty trembled a little he spoke so sharply his eyes were bent on her so keenly and he looked so strong so forceful that she was almost afraid but remembering that she had said only what to her mind was absolutely true she raised her eyes and repeated the words  helen is wildlyin love with you  betty you wouldnt joke about such a thing you wouldnt lie to me i know you wouldnt  no jack dear  she saw his powerful frame tremble even as she had seen more than one man tremble during the siege under the impact of a bullet  without speaking he walked rapidly down the path toward the spring  colonel zane came out of his hidingplace behind the porch and with a face positively electrifying in its glowing pleasure beamed upon his sister  gee didnt he stalk off like an indian chief he said chuckling with satisfaction by george betts you must have got in a great piece of work i never in my life saw jack look like that  colonel zane sat down by bettys side and laughed softly but heartily  well fix him all right the lonely hillclimber why he hasnt a ghost of a chance wait until she sees him after hearing your story i tell you bettywhydamme youre crying  he had turned to find her head lowered while she shaded her face with her hand  now betty just a little innocent deceit like thatwhat harm he said taking her hand he was as tender as a woman  oh eb it wasnt that i didnt mind telling him only the flash in his eyes reminded me ofof alfred  surely it did why not almost everything brings up a tender memory for some one weve loved and lost but dont cry betty  she laughed a little and raised a face with its dark cheeks flushed and tearstained  im silly i suppose but i cant help it i cry at least once every day  brace up here come helen and will dont let them see you grieved my helen in pure white too this is a conspiracy to ruin the peace of the masculine portion of fort henry  betty went forward to meet her friends while colonel zane continued talking but now to himself what a fatal beauty she has his eyes swept over helen with the pleasure of an artist the fair richness of her skin the perfect lips the wavy shiny hair the wondrous darkblue changing eyes the tall figure slender but strong and swelling with gracious womanhood made a picture he delighted in and loved to have near him the girl did not possess for him any of that magnetism so commonly felt by most of her admirers but he did feel how subtly full she was of something which for want of a better term he described in wetzels characteristic expression as chainlightning  he reflected that as he was so much older that she although always winsome and earnest showed nothing of the tormenting bewildering coquetry of her nature colonel zane prided himself on his discernment and he had already observed that helen had different sides of character for different persons to betty mabel nell and the children she was frank girlish full of fun and always lovable to her elders quiet and earnestly solicitous to please to the young men cold but with a penetrating mocking promise haunting that coldness and sometimes sweetly agreeable often wilful and changeable as april winds at last the colonel concluded that she needed as did all other spirited young women the taming influence of a man whom she loved a home to care for and children to soften and temper her spirit  well young friends i see you count on keeping the sabbath he said cheerily for my part will i dont see how jim douns can preach this morning before this laurel blossom and that damask rose  how poetical which is which asked betty  flatterer laughed helen shaking her finger  and a married man too continued betty  well being married has not affected my poetical sentiment nor impaired my eyesight  but it has seriously inconvenienced your old propensity of making love to the girls not that you wouldnt if you dared replied betty with mischief in her eye  now will what do you think of that isnt it real sisterly regard come well go and look at my thoroughbreds said colonel zane  where is jonathan helen asked presently something happened at metzars yesterday papa wouldnt tell me and i want to ask jonathan  jack is down by the spring he spends a great deal of his time there its shady and cool and the water babbles over the stones  how much alone he is said helen  betty took her former position on the steps but did not raise her eyes while she continued speaking yes hes more alone than ever lately and quieter too he hardly ever speaks now there must be something on his mind more serious than horsethieves  what helen asked quickly  id better not tellyou  a long moment passed before helen spoke  please tell me  well helen we think eb and i that jack is in love for the first time in his life and with you you adorable creature but jacks a borderman he is stern in his principles thinks he is wedded to his border life and he knows that he has both red and white blood on his hands hed die before hed speak of his love because he cannot understand that would do any good even if you loved him which is of course preposterous  loves me breathed helen softly  she sat down rather beside betty and turned her face away she still held the young womans hand which she squeezed so tightly as to make its owner wince betty stole a look at her and saw the rich red blood mantling her cheeks and her full bosom heave  helen turned presently with no trace of emotion except a singular brilliance of the eyes she was so slow to speak again that colonel zane and will returned from the corral before she found her voice  colonel zane please tell me about last night when papa came home to supper he was pale and very nervous i knew something had happened but he would not explain which made me all the more anxious wont you please tell me  colonel zane glanced again at her and knew what had happened despite her selfpossession those telltale eyes told her secret everchanging and shadowing with a bounding rapturous light they were indeed the windows of her soul all the emotion of a womans heart shone there fear beauty wondering appeal trembling joy and timid hope  tell you indeed i will replied colonel zane softened and a little remorseful under those wonderful eyes  no one liked to tell a story better than colonel zane briefly and graphically he related the circumstances of the affair leading to the attack on helens father and as the tale progressed he became quite excited speaking with animated face and forceful gestures  just as the knifepoint touched your father a swiftlyflying object knocked the weapon to the floor it was jonathans tomahawk what followed was so sudden i hardly saw it like lightning and flexible as steel jonathan jumped over the table smashed case against the wall pulled him up and threw him over the bank i tell you helen it was a beautiful piece of action but not of course for a womans eyes now thats all your father was not even hurt  he saved papas life murmured helen standing like a statue  she wheeled suddenly with that swift birdlike motion habitual to her and went quickly down the path leading to the spring                                       jonathan zane solitary dreamer of dreams as he was had never been in as strange and beautiful a reverie as that which possessed him on this sabbath morning  deep into his heart had sunk bettys words the wonder of it the sweetness that alone was all he felt the glory of this girl had begun days past to spread its glamour round him swept irresistibly away now he soared aloft in a dreamcastle of fancy with its painted windows and golden walls  for the first time in his life on the border he had entered the little glade and had no eye for the crystal water flowing over the pebbles and mossy stones or the plot of grassy ground inclosed by tall dark trees and shaded by a canopy of fresh green and azure blue nor did he hear the music of the soft rushing water the warbling birds or the gentle sighing breeze moving the leaves  gone vanished lost today was that sweet companionship of nature that indefinable and unutterable spirit which flowed so peacefully to him from his beloved woods that something more than merely affecting his senses which existed for him in the stony cliffs and breathed with life through the lonely aisles of the forest had fled before the fateful power of a womans love and beauty  a long time that seemed only a moment passed while he leaned against a stone a light step sounded on the path  a vision in pure white entered the glade two little hands pressed his and two darkblue eyes of misty beauty shed their light on him  jonathan i am come to thank you  sweet and tremulous the voice sounded far away  thank me for what  you saved papas life oh how can i thank you  no voice answered for him  i have nothing to give but this  a flowerlike face was held up to him hands light as thistledown touched his shoulders darkblue eyes glowed upon him with all tenderness  may i thank youso  soft lips met his full and lingeringly  then came a rush as of wind a flash of white and the patter of flying feet he was alone in the glade     chapter x  june passed july opened with unusually warm weather and fort henry had no visits from indians or horsethieves nor any inconvenience except the hot sun it was the warmest weather for many years and seriously dwarfed the settlers growing corn nearly all the springs were dry and a drouth menaced the farmers  the weather gave helen an excuse which she was not slow to adopt her pale face and languid air perplexed and worried her father and her friends she explained to them that the heat affected her disagreeably  long days had passed since that sunday morning when she kissed the borderman what transports of sweet hope and fear were hers then how shame had scorched her happiness yet still she gloried in the act by that kiss had she awakened to a full consciousness of her love with insidious stealth and everincreasing power this flood had increased to full tide and bursting its bonds surged over her with irresistible strength  during the first days after the dawning of her passion she lived in its sweetness hearing only melodious sounds chiming in her soul the hours following that sunday were like long dreams but as all things reach fruition so this girlish period passed leaving her a thoughtful woman she began to gather up the threads of her life where love had broken them to plan nobly and to hope and wait  weeks passed however and her lover did not come betty told her that jonathan made flying trips at break of day to hold council with colonel zane that he and wetzel were on the trail of shawnees with stolen horses and both bordermen were in their dark vengeful terrible moods in these later days helen passed through many stages of feeling after the exalting mood of hot young love came reaction she fell into the depths of despair sorrow paled her face thinned her cheeks and lent another shadow a mournful one to her great eyes the constant repression of emotion the strain of trying to seem cheerful when she was miserable threatened even her magnificent health she answered the solicitude of her friends by evasion and then by that innocent falsehood in which a sensitive soul hides its secrets shame was only natural because since the borderman came not nor sent her a word pride whispered that she had wooed him forgetting modesty  pride anger shame despair however finally fled before affection she loved this wild borderman and knew he loved her in return although he might not understand it himself his simplicity his lack of experience with women his hazardous life and stern duty regarding it pleaded for him and for her love for the lack of a little understanding she would never live unhappy and alone while she was loved better give a thousand times more than she had sacrificed he would return to the village some day when the indians and the thieves were run down and would be his own calm gentle self then she would win him break down his allegiance to this fearful border life and make him happy in her love  while helen was going through one of the fires of life to come out sweeter and purer if a little pensive and sad time which waits not for love nor life nor death was hastening onward and soon the golden fields of grain were stored september came with its fruitful promise fulfilled  helen entered once more into the quiet social life of the little settlement taught her class on sundays did all her own work and even found time to bring a ray of sunshine to more than one sick childs bed yet she did not forget her compact with jonathan and bent all her intelligence to find some clew that might aid in the capture of the horsethief she was still groping in the darkness she could not however banish the belief that the traitor was brandt she blamed herself for this because of having no good reasons for suspicion but the conviction was there fixed by intuition because a mans eyes were steely gray sharp like those of a cats and capable of the same contraction and enlargement there was no reason to believe their owner was a criminal but that helen acknowledged with a smile was the only argument she had to be sure brandt had looked capable of anything the night jonathan knocked him down she knew he had incited case to begin the trouble at metzars and had seemed worried since that time he had not left the settlement on short journeys as had been his custom before the affair in the barroom and not a horse had disappeared from fort henry since that time  brandt had not discontinued his attentions to her if they were less ardent it was because she had given him absolutely to understand that she could be his friend only and she would not have allowed even so much except for jonathans plan she fancied it was possible to see behind brandts courtesy the real subtle threatening man stripped of his kindliness an assumed virtue the iron man stood revealed cold calculating cruel  mordaunt she never saw but once and then shocking and pitiful he lay dead drunk in the grass by the side of the road his pale weary handsome face exposed to the pitiless rays of the sun she ran home weeping over this wreck of what had once been so fine a gentleman ah the curse of rum he had learned his soft speech and courtly bearing in the refinement of a home where a proud mother adored and gentle sisters loved him and now far from the kindred he had disgraced he lay in the road like a log how it hurt her she almost wished she could have loved him if love might have redeemed she was more kind to her other admirers more tolerant of brandt and could forgive the englishman because the pangs she had suffered through love had softened her spirit  during this long period the growing friendship of her cousin for betty had been a source of infinite pleasure to helen she hoped and believed a romance would develop between the young widow and will and did all in her power slyly abetted by the matchmaking colonel to bring the two together  one afternoon when the sky was clear with that intense blue peculiar to bright days in early autumn helen started out toward bettys intending to remind that young lady she had promised to hunt for clematis and other fall flowers  about halfway to bettys home she met brandt he came swinging round a corner with his quick firm step she had not seen him for several days and somehow he seemed different a brightness a flash as of daring expectation was in his face the poise too of the man had changed  well i am fortunate i was just going to your home he said cheerily wont you come for a walk with me  you may walk with me to bettys helen answered  no not that come up the hillside well get some goldenrod id like to have a chat with you i may go awayi mean im thinking of making a short trip he added hurriedly  please come  i promised to go to bettys  you wont come his voice trembled with mingled disappointment and resentment  no helen replied in slight surprise  you have gone with the other fellows why not with me he was white now and evidently laboring under powerful feelings that must have had their origin in some thought or plan which hinged on the acceptance of his invitation  because i choose not to helen replied coldly meeting his glance fully  a dark red flush swelled brandts face and neck his gray eyes gleamed balefully with wolfish glare his teeth were clenched he breathed hard and trembled with anger then by a powerful effort he conquered himself the villainous expression left his face the storm of rage subsided great incentive there must have been for him thus to repress his emotions so quickly he looked long at her with sinister intent regard then with the laugh of a desperado a laugh which might have indicated contempt for the failure of his suit and which was fraught with a world of meaning of menace he left her without so much as a salute  helen pondered over this sudden change and felt relieved because she need make no further pretense of friendship he had shown himself to be what she had instinctively believed she hurried on toward bettys hoping to find colonel zane at home and with jonathan for brandts hint of leaving fort henry and his evident chagrin at such a slip of speech had made her suspicious she was informed by mrs zane that the colonel had gone to a lograising jonathan had not been in for several days and betty went away with will  where did they go asked helen  im not sure i think down to the spring  helen followed the familiar path through the grove of oaks into the glade it was quite deserted sitting on the stone against which jonathan had leaned the day she kissed him she gave way to tender reflection suddenly she was disturbed by the sound of rapid footsteps and looking up saw the hulking form of metzar the innkeeper coming down the path he carried a bucket and meant evidently to get water helen did not desire to be seen and thinking he would stay only a moment slipped into a thicket of willows behind the stone she could see plainly through the foliage metzar came into the glade peered around in the manner of a man expecting to see some one and then filling his bucket at the spring sat down on the stone  not a minute elapsed before soft rapid footsteps sounded in the distance the bushes parted disclosing the white set face and gray eyes of roger brandt with a light spring he cleared the brook and approached metzar  before speaking he glanced around the glade with the fugitive distrustful glance of a man who suspects even the trees then satisfied by the scrutiny he opened his hunting frock taking forth a long object which he thrust toward metzar  it was an indian arrow  metzars dull gaze traveled from this to the ominous face of brandt  see there you look at this arrow shot by the best indian on the border into the window of my room i hadnt been there a minute when it came from the island god but it was a great shot  hell gasped metzar his dull face quickening with some awful thought  i guess it is hell replied brandt his face growing whiter and wilder  our games up questioned metzar with haggard cheek  up man we havent a day maybe less to shake fort henry  what does it mean asked metzar he was the calmer of the two  its a signal the shawnees who were in hiding with the horses over by blueberry swamp have been flushed by those bordermen some of them have escaped at least one for no one but ashbow could shoot that arrow across the river  suppose he hadnt come whispered metzar hoarsely  brandt answered him with a dark shuddering gaze  a twig snapped in the thicket like foxes at the click of a trap these men whirled with fearsome glances  ugh came a low guttural voice from the bushes and an indian of magnificent proportions and somber swarthy features entered the glade     chapter xi  the savage had just emerged from the river for his graceful coppercolored body and scanty clothing were dripping with water he carried a long bow and a quiver of arrows  brandt uttered an exclamation of surprise and metzar a curse as the lithe indian leaped the brook he was not young his swarthy face was lined seamed and terrible with a dark impassiveness  palefacebrothergetarrow he said in halting english as his eyes flashed upon brandt chiefwantmakesure  the white man leaned forward grasped the indians arm and addressed him in an indian language this questioning was evidently in regard to his signal the whereabouts of others of the party and why he took such fearful risks almost in the village the indian answered with one english word  deathwind  brandt drew back with drawn white face while a whistling breath escaped him  i knew it metz wetzel he exclaimed in a husky voice  the blood slowly receded from metzars evil murky face leaving it haggard  deathwindonchiefstrailupeagle rock continued the indian deathwindfoolednotforlong chiefwaitpalefacebrothers at two islands  the indian stepped into the brook parted the willows and was gone as he had come silently  we know what to expect said brandt in calmer tone as the daring cast of countenance returned to him theres an indian for you he got away doubled like an old fox on his trail and ran in here to give us a chance at escape now you know why bing legget cant be caught  lets dig at once replied metzar with no show of returning courage such as characterized his companion  brandt walked to and fro with bent brows like one in deep thought suddenly he turned upon metzar eyes which were brightly hard and reckless with resolve  by heaven ill do it listen wetzel has gone to the top of eagle mountain where he and zane have a rendezvous even he wont suspect the cunning of this indian anyway itll be after daylight tomorrow before he strikes the trail ive got twentyfour hours and more to get this girl and ill do it  bad move to have weight like her on a march said metzar  bah the things easy as for you go on push ahead after were started all i ask is that you stay by me until the time to cut loose  i aint agoin to crawfish now growled metzar strikes me too im losin moren you  you wont be a loser if you can get back to detroit with your scalp ill pay you in horses and gold once we reach leggets place were safe  whats yer plan about gittin the gal asked metzar  brandt leaned forward and spoke eagerly but in a low tone  git away on hossback questioned metzar visibly brightening wal thats some sense kin ye trust ther other party  im sure i can rejoined brandt  itll be a good job a good job an all done in daylight too bing legget couldnt plan better metzar said rubbing his hands  weve fooled these zanes and their fruitraising farmers for a year and our time is about up brandt muttered one more job and weve done once with legget were safe and then well work slowly back towards detroit lets get out of here now for some one may come at any moment  the plotters separated brandt going through the grove and metzar down the path by which he had come                                       helen trembling with horror of what she had heard raised herself cautiously from the willows where she had lain and watched the innkeepers retreating figure when it had disappeared she gave a little gasp of relief free now to run home there to plan what course must be pursued she conquered her fear and weakness and hurried from the glade luckily so far as she was able to tell no one saw her return she resolved that she would be cool deliberate clever worthy of the bordermans confidence  first she tried to determine the purport of this interview between brandt and metzar she recalled to mind all that was said and supplied what she thought had been suggested brandt and metzar were horsethieves aids of bing legget they had repaired to the glade to plan the indian had been a surprise wetzel had routed the shawnees and was now on the trail of this chieftain the indian warned them to leave fort henry and to meet him at a place called two islands brandts plan presumably somewhat changed by the advent of the redman was to steal horses abduct a girl in broad daylight and before tomorrows sunset escape to join the ruffian legget  i am the girl murmured helen shudderingly as she relapsed momentarily into girlish fears but at once she rose above selfish feelings  secondly while it was easy to determine what the outlaws meant the wisest course was difficult to conceive she had promised the borderman to help him and not speak of anything she learned to any but himself she could not be true to him if she asked advice the point was clear either she must remain in the settlement hoping for jonathans return in time to frustrate brandts villainous scheme or find the borderman suddenly she remembered metzars allusion to a second person whom brandt felt certain he could trust this meant another traitor in fort henry another horsethief another desperado willing to make off with helpless women  helens spirit rose in arms she had their secret and could ruin them she would find the borderman  wetzel was on the trail at eagle rock what for trailing an indian who was then five miles east of that rock not wetzel he was on that track to meet jonathan otherwise with the redskins near the river he would have been closer to them he would meet jonathan there at sunset today helen decided  she paced the room trying to still her throbbing heart and trembling hands  i must be calm she said sternly time is precious i have not a moment to lose i will find him ive watched that mountain many a time and can find the trail and the rock i am in more danger here than out there in the forest with wetzel and jonathan on the mountain side the indians have fled it but what about the savage who warned brandt let me think yes hell avoid the river hell go round south of the settlement and therefore cant see me cross how fortunate that i have paddled a canoe many times across the river how glad that i made colonel zane describe the course up the mountains  her resolution fixed helen changed her skirt for one of buckskin putting on leggings and moccasins of the same serviceable material she filled the pockets of a short rainproof jacket with biscuits and thus equipped sallied forth with a spirit and exultation she could not subdue only one thing she feared which was that brandt or metzar might see her cross the river she launched her canoe and paddled down stream under cover of the bluff to a point opposite the end of the island then straight across keeping the island between her and the settlement gaining the other shore helen pulled the canoe into the willows and mounted the bank a thicket of willow and alder made progress up the steep incline difficult but once out of it she faced a long stretch of grassy meadowland a mile beyond began the green billowy rise of that mountain which she intended to climb  helens whole soul was thrown into the adventure she felt her strong young limbs in accord with her heart  now mr brandt horsethief and girlsnatcher well see she said with scornful lips if i cant beat you now im not fit to be betty zanes friend and am unworthy of a bordermans trust  she traversed the whole length of meadowland close under the shadow of the fringed bank and gained the forest here she hesitated all was so wild and still no definite course through the woods seemed to invite and yet all was open trees trees dark immovable trees everywhere the violent trembling of poplar and aspen leaves when all others were so calm struck her strangely and the fearful stillness awed her drawing a deep breath she started forward up the gently rising ground  as she advanced the open forest became darker and of wilder aspect the trees were larger and closer together still she made fair progress without deviating from the course she had determined upon before her rose a ridge with a ravine on either side reaching nearly to the summit of the mountain here the underbrush was scanty the fallen trees had slipped down the side and the rocks were not so numerous all of which gave her reason to be proud so far of her judgment  helen pressing onward and upward forgot time and danger while she reveled in the wonder of the forestland birds and squirrels fled before her whistling and wheezing of alarm or heavy crashings in the bushes told of frightened wild beasts a dull faint roar like a distant wind suggested tumbling waters a single birch tree gleaming white among the black trees enlivened the gloomy forest patches of sunlight brightened the shade giant ferns just tinging with autumn colors waved tips of sculptured perfection most wonderful of all were the colored leaves as they floated downward with a sad gentle rustle  helen was brought to a realization of her hazardous undertaking by a sudden roar of water and the abrupt termination of the ridge in a deep gorge grasping a tree she leaned over to look down it was fully an hundred feet deep with impassable walls greenstained and damp at the bottom of which a brawling brown brook rushed on its way fully twenty feet wide it presented an insurmountable barrier to further progress in that direction  but helen looked upon it merely as a difficulty to be overcome she studied the situation and decided to go to the left because higher ground was to be seen that way abandoning the ridge she pressed on keeping as close to the gorge as she dared and came presently to a fallen tree lying across the dark cleft without a seconds hesitation for she knew such would be fatal she stepped upon the tree and started across looking at nothing but the log under her feet while she tried to imagine herself walking across the watergate at home in virginia  she accomplished the venture without a misstep when safely on the ground once more she felt her knees tremble and a queer light feeling came into her head she laughed however as she rested a moment it would take more than a gorge to discourage her she resolved with set lips as once again she made her way along the rising ground  perilous if not desperate work was ahead of her broken rocky ground matted thicket and seemingly impenetrable forest rose darkly in advance but she was not even tired and climbed crawled twisted and turned on her way upward she surmounted a rocky ledge to face a higher ridge covered with splintered uneven stones and the fallen trees of many storms once she slipped and fell spraining her wrist at length this uphill labor began to weary her to breathe caused a pain in her side and she was compelled to rest  already the gray light of coming night shrouded the forest she was surprised at seeing the trees become indistinct because the shadows hovered over the thickets and noted that the dark dim outline of the ridges was fading into obscurity  she struggled on up the uneven slope with a tightening at her heart which was not all exhaustion for the first time she doubted herself but it was too late she could not turn back suddenly she felt that she was on a smoother easier course not to strike a stone or break a twig seemed unusual it might be a path worn by deer going to a spring then into her troubled mind flashed the joyful thought she had found a trail  soft wiry grass springing from a wet soil rose under her feet a little rill trickled alongside the trail mossy softcushioned stones lay imbedded here and there young maples and hickories grew breasthigh on either side and the way wound in and out under the lowering shade of forest monarchs  swiftly ascending this path she came at length to a point where it was possible to see some distance ahead the ascent became hardly noticeable then as she turned a bend of the trail the light grew brighter and brighter until presently all was open and clear an oval space covered with stones lay before her a big blasted chestnut stood near by beyond was the dim purple haze of distance above the pale blue sky just faintly rosetinted by the setting sun far to her left the scraggly trees of a low hill were tipped with orange and russet shades she had reached the summit  desolate and lonely was this little plateau helen felt immeasurably far away from home yet she could see in the blue distance the glancing river the dark fort and that cluster of cabins which marked the location of fort henry sitting upon the roots of the big chestnut tree she gazed around there were the remains of a small campfire beyond a hollow under a shelving rock a bed of dry leaves lay packed in this shelter some one had been here and she doubted not that it was the borderman  she was so tired and her wrist pained so severely that she lay back against the treetrunk closed her eyes and rested a weariness the apathy of utter exhaustion came over her she wished the bordermen would hurry and come before she went to sleep  drowsily she was sinking into slumber when a long low rumble aroused her how dark it had suddenly become a sheet of pale light flared across the overcast heavens  a storm exclaimed helen alone on this mountaintop with a storm coming am i frightened i dont believe it at least im safe from that ruffian brandt oh if my borderman would only come  helen changed her position from beside the tree to the hollow under the stone it was high enough to permit of her sitting upright and offered a safe retreat from the storm the bed of leaves was soft and comfortable she sat there peering out at the darkening heavens  all beneath her southward and westward was gray twilight the settlement faded from sight the river grew wan and shadowy the ruddy light in the west was fast succumbing to the rolling clouds darker and darker it became until only one break in the overspreading vapors admitted the last crimson gleam of sunshine over hills and valley brightening the river until it resembled a stream of fire then the light failed the glow faded the intense blackness of night prevailed  out of the ebon west came presently another flare of light a quick spreading flush like a flicker from a monster candle it was followed by a long low rumbling roll  helen felt in those intervals of unutterably vast silence that she must shriek aloud the thunder was a friend she prayed for the storm to break she had withstood danger and toilsome effort with fortitude but could not brave this awful boding wilderness stillness  flashes of lightning now revealed the rolling pushing turbulent clouds and peals of thunder sounded nearer and louder  a long swelling moan sad low like the uneasy sigh of the sea breathed far in the west it was the wind the ominous warning of the storm sheets of light were now mingled with long straggling ropes of fire and the rumblings were often broken by louder quicker detonations  then a period longer than usual of inky blackness succeeded the sharp flaring of light a faint breeze ruffled the leaves of the thicket and fanned helens hot cheek the moan of the wind became more distinct then louder and in another instant like the faroff roar of a rushing river the storm was upon her helen shrank closer against the stone and pulled her jacket tighter around her trembling form  a sudden intense dazzling blinding white light enveloped her the rocky promontory the weird giant chestnut tree the open plateau and beyond the stormy heavens were all luridly clear in the flash of lightning she fancied it was possible to see a tall dark figure emerging from the thicket as the thunderclap rolled and pealed overhead she strained her eyes into the blackness waiting for the next lightning flash  it came with brilliant dazing splendor the whole plateau and thicket were as light as in the day close by the stone where she lay crept the tall dark figure of an indian with starting eyes she saw the fringed clothing the long flying hair and supple body peculiar to the savage he was creeping upon her  helens blood ran cold terror held her voiceless she felt herself sinking slowly down upon the leaves     chapter xii  the sun had begun to cast long shadows the afternoon of helens hunt for jonathan when the borderman accompanied by wetzel led a string of horses along the base of the very mountain she had ascended  last nights job was a good one i aint gainsayin but the redskin i wanted got away wetzel said gloomily  hes safe now as a squirrel in a hole i saw him dartin among the trees with his white eagle feathers stickin up like a bucks flag replied jonathan he can run if id only had my rifle loaded but im not sure he was that arrowshootin shawnee  it was him i saw his bow we oughter taken more time an picked

low as cunnin buck i calkilate once over the mountain hes made a beeline east well go on with the hosses an then strike across country to find his trail  it pears to me lew that weve taken a long time in makin a show against these hossthieves said jonathan  i aint sayin much but ive felt it replied wetzel  all summer an nothin done it was more luck than sense that we run into those injuns with the hosses we only got three out of four an let the best redskin give us the slip here fall is nigh on us with winter comin soon an still we dont know whos the white traitor in the settlement  i said its

brighteyed lass for that  i havent seen her lately an allow shed left me word if she learned anythin  wal mebbe its as well you haint seen so much of her in silence they traveled and arriving at the edge of the meadow were about to mount two of the horses when wetzel said in a sharp tone  look  he pointed to a small welldefined moccasin track in the black earth on the margin of a rill  lew its a womans sures youre born declared jonathan  wetzel knelt and closely examined the footprint yes a womans an no injun  what jonathan exclaimed as he knelt to scrutinize the imprint  this aint half a day old added wetzel an not a redskins moccasin near what dyou reckon  a white girl alone replied jonathan as he followed the trail a short distance along the brook see shes makin upland wetzel these tracks could hardly be my sisters an theres only one other girl on the border whose feet will match em helen sheppard has passed here on her way up the mountain to find you or me  i like your reckonin  shes suddenly discovered somethin injuns hossthieves the fort henry traitor or mebbe an most likely some plottin bein bound to secrecy by me shes not told my brother an it must be call for hurry she

lass could climb there if not come back in the mornin hunt her trail out an find her im thinkin jack well find the shawnee had somethin to do with this whatever happens after i get back to the fort ill expect you hard on my trail  jonathan bounded across the brook and with an easy lope began the gradual ascent soon he came upon a winding path he ran along this for perhaps a quarter of an hour until it became too steep for rapid traveling when he settled down to a rapid walk the forest was already dark a slight rustling of the leaves beneath his feet was the only sound except at long intervals the distant rumbling of thunder  the mere possibility of helens being alone on that mountain seeking him made jonathans heart beat as it never had before for weeks he had avoided her almost forgot her he had conquered the strange yearning weakness which assailed him after that memorable sunday and once more the silent shaded glens the mystery of the woods the breath of his wild free life had claimed him but now as this evidence of her spirit her recklessness was before him and he remembered bettys avowal a pain which was almost physical tore at his heart how terrible it would be if she came to her death through him he pictured the big alluring eyes the perfect lips the haunting face cold in death and he shuddered  the dim gloom of the woods soon darkened into blackness the flashes of lightning momentarily streaking the foliage or sweeping overhead in pale yellow sheets aided jonathan in keeping the trail  he gained the plateau just as a great flash illumined it and distinctly saw the dark hollow where he had taken refuge in many a storm and where he now hoped to find the girl picking his way carefully over the sharp loose stones he at last put his hand on the huge rock another bluewhite dazzling flash enveloped the scene  under the rock he saw a dark form huddled and a face as white as snow with wide horrified eyes  lass he said when the thunder had rumbled away he received no answer and called again kneeling he groped about until touching helens dress he spoke again but she did not reply  jonathan crawled under the ledge beside the quiet figure he touched her hands they were very cold bending over he was relieved to hear her heart beating he called her name but still she made no reply dipping his hand into a little rill that ran beside the stone he bathed her face soon she stirred uneasily moaned and suddenly sat up  tis jonathan he said quickly dont be scared  another illuminating flare of lightning brightened the plateau  oh thank heaven cried helen i thought you were an indian  helen sank trembling against the borderman who enfolded her in his long arms her relief and thankfulness were so great that she could not speak her hands clasped and unclasped round his strong fingers her tears flowed freely  the storm broke with terrific fury a seething torrent of rain and hail came with the rushing wind great heavenbroad sheets of lightning played across the black dome overhead zigzag ropes steelblue in color shot downward crash and crack and boom the thunder split and rolled the clouds above the lightning flashes showed the fall of rain in columns like white waterfalls borne on the irresistible wind  the grandeur of the storm awed and stilled helens emotion she sat there watching the lightning listening to the peals of thunder and thrilling with the wonder of the situation  gradually the roar abated the flashes became less frequent the thunder decreased as the storm wore out its strength in passing the wind and rain ceased on the mountaintop almost as quickly as they had begun and the roar died slowly away in the distance far to the eastward flashes of light illumined scowling clouds and brightened many a dark wooded hill and valley  lass how ist i find you here asked jonathan gravely  with many a pause and broken phrase helen told the story of what she had seen and heard at the spring  child why didnt you go to my brother asked jonathan you dont know what you undertook  i thought of everything but i wanted to find you myself besides i was just as safe alone on this mountain as in the village  i dont know but youre right replied jonathan thoughtfully so brandt planned to make off with you tomorrow  yes and when i heard it i wanted to run away from the village  youve done a wondrous clever thing lass this brandt is a bad man an hard to match but if he hasnt shaken fort henry by now his careerll end mighty sudden an his bad trails stop short on the hillside among the graves for eb will always give outlaws or injuns decent burial  what will the colonel or anyone think has become of me  wetzel knows lass for he found your trail below  then hell tell papa you came after me oh poor papa i forgot him shall we stay here until daylight  wed gain nothin by startin now the brooks are full an in the dark wed make little distance youre dry here an comfortable whats more lass youre safe  i feel perfectly safe with you helen said softly  arent you tired lass  tired im nearly dead my feet are cut and bruised my wrist is sprained and i ache all over but jonathan i dont care i am so happy to have my wild venture turn out successfully  you can lie here an sleep while i keep watch  jonathan made a move to withdraw his arm which was still between helen and the rock but had dropped from her waist  i am very comfortable ill sit here with you watching for daybreak my how dark it is i cannot see my hand before my eyes  helen settled herself back upon the stone leaned a very little against his shoulder and tried to think over her adventure but her mind refused to entertain any ideas except those of the present mingled with the dreamy lassitude that grew stronger every moment was a sense of delight in her situation she was alone on a wild mountain in the night with this borderman the one she loved by chance and her own foolhardiness this had come about yet she was fortunate to have it tend to some good beyond her own happiness all she would suffer from her perilous climb would be aching bones and perhaps a scolding from her father what she might gain was more than she had dared hope the breaking up of the horsethief gang would be a boon to the harassed settlement how proudly colonel zane would smile her name would go on that long roll of border honor and heroism that was not however one thousandth part so pleasing as to be alone with her borderman  with a sigh of mingled weariness and content helen leaned her head on jonathans shoulder and fell asleep  the borderman trembled the sudden nestling of her head against him the light caress of her fragrant hair across his cheek revived a sweet almostconquered almostforgotten emotion he felt an inexplicable thrill vibrate through him no untrodden ambushed wild no perilous trail no dark and bloody encounter had ever made him feel fear as had the kiss of this maiden he had sternly silenced faint unfamiliar yet tender voices whispering in his heart and now his rigorous discipline was as if it were not for at her touch he trembled still he did not move away he knew she had succumbed to weariness and was fast asleep he could gently without awakening her have laid her head upon the pillow of leaves indeed he thought of doing it but made no effort a womans head softly lying against him was a thing novel strange wonderful for all the power he had then each tumbling lock of her hair might as well have been a chain linking him fast to the mountain  with the memory of his former yearning unsatisfied moods and the unrest and pain his awakening tenderness had caused him came a determination to look things fairly in the face to be just in thought toward this innocent impulsive girl and be honest with himself  duty commanded that he resist all charm other than that pertaining to his life in the woods years ago he had accepted a bordermans destiny well content to be recompensed by its untamed freedom from restraint to be always under the trees he loved so well to lend his cunning and woodcraft in the pioneers cause to haunt the savage trails to live from day to day a menace to the foes of civilization that was the life he had chosen it was all he could ever have  in view of this justice demanded that he allow no friendship to spring up between himself and this girl if his sisters belief was really true if helen really was interested in him it must be a romantic infatuation which not encouraged would wear itself out what was he to win the love of any girl an unlettered borderman who knew only the woods whose life was hard and cruel whose hands were red with indian blood whose vengeance had not spared men even of his own race he could not believe she really loved him wildly impulsive as girls were at times she had kissed him she had been grateful carried away by a generous feeling for him as the protector of her father when she did not see him for a long time as he vowed should be the case after he had carried her safely home she would forget  then honesty demanded that he probe his own feelings sternly as if judging a renegade he searched out in his simple way the truth this bigeyed lass with her nameless charm would bewitch even a borderman unless he avoided her so much he had not admitted until now love he had never believed could be possible for him when she fell asleep her hand had slipped from his arm to his fingers and now rested there lightly as a leaf the contact was delight the gentle night breeze blew a tress of hair across his lips he trembled her rounded shoulder pressed against him until he could feel her slow deep breathing he almost held his own breath lest he disturb her rest  no he was no longer indifferent as surely as those pale stars blinked far above he knew the delight of a womans presence it moved him to study the emotion as he studied all things which was the habit of his bordermans life did it come from knowledge of her beauty matchless as that of the mountainlaurel he recalled the dark glance of her challenging eyes her tall supple figure and the bewildering excitation and magnetism of her presence beauty was wonderful but not everything beauty belonged to her but she would have been irresistible without it was it not because she was a woman that was the secret she was a woman with all a womans charm to bewitch to twine round the strength of men as the ivy encircles the oak with all a womans weakness to pity and to guard with all a womans wilful burning love and with all a womans mystery  at last so much of life was intelligible to him the renegade committed his worst crimes because even in his outlawed homeless state he could not exist without the companionship if not the love of a woman the pioneers toil and privation were for a woman and the joy of loving her and living for her the indian brave when not on the warpath walked hand in hand with a dusky softeyed maiden and sang to her of moonlit lakes and western winds even the birds and beasts mated the robins returned to their old nest the eagles paired once and were constant in life and death the buck followed the doe through the forest all nature sang that love made life worth living love then was everything  the borderman sat out the long vigil of the night watching the stars and trying to decide that love was not for him if wetzel had locked a secret within his breast and never in all these years spoke of it to his companion then surely that companion could as well live without love stern dark deadly work must stain and blot all tenderness from his life else it would be unutterably barren the joy of living of unharassed freedom he had always known if a fair face and dark mournful eyes were to haunt him on every lonely trail then it were better an indian should end his existence  the darkest hour before dawn as well as the darkest of doubt and longing in jonathans life passed away a gray gloom obscured the pale winking stars the east slowly whitened then brightened and at length day broke misty and fresh  the borderman rose to stretch his cramped limbs when he turned to the little cavern the girls eyes were wide open all the darkness the shadow the beauty and the thought of the past night lay in their blue depths he looked away across the valley where the sky was reddening and a pale rim of gold appeared above the hilltops  well if i havent been asleep exclaimed helen with a low soft laugh  youre rested i hope said jonathan with averted eyes he dared not look at her  oh yes indeed i am ready to start at once how gray how beautiful the morning is shall we be long i hope papa knows  in silence the borderman led the way across the rocky plateau and into the winding narrow trail his pale slightly drawn and stern face did not invite conversation therefore helen followed silently in his footsteps the way was steep and at times he was forced to lend her aid she put her hand in his and jumped lightly as a fawn presently a brawling brook overcrowding its banks impeded further progress  ill have to carry you across said jonathan  im very heavy replied helen with a smile in her eyes  she flushed as the borderman put his right arm around her waist then a clasp as of steel enclosed her she felt herself swinging easily into the air and over the muddy brook  farther down the mountain this troublesome brook again crossed the trail this time much wider and more formidable helen looked with some vexation and embarrassment into the bordermans face it was always the same stern almost cold  perhaps id better wade she said hesitatingly  why the waters deep an cold youd better not get wet  helen flushed but did not answer with downcast eyes she let herself be carried on his powerful arm  the wading was difficult this time the water foamed furiously around his knees once he slipped on a stone and nearly lost his balance uttering a little scream helen grasped at him wildly and her arm encircled his neck what was still more trying when he put her on her feet again it was found that her hair had become entangled in the porcupine quills on his huntingcoat  she stood before him while with clumsy fingers he endeavored to untangle the shimmering strands but in vain helen unwound the snarl of wavy hair most alluring she was then with a certain softness on her face and light and laughter and something warm in her eyes  the borderman felt that he breathed a subtle exhilaration which emanated from her glowing gracious beauty she radiated with the gladness of life with an uncontainable sweetness and joy but giving no token of his feeling he turned to march on down through the woods  from this point the trail broadened descending at an easier angle jonathans stride lengthened until helen was forced to walk rapidly and sometimes run in order to keep close behind him a quick journey home was expedient and in order to accomplish this she would gladly have exerted herself to a greater extent when they reached the end of the trail where the forest opened clear of brush finally to merge into the broad verdant plain the sun had chased the mistclouds from the eastern hilltops and was gloriously brightening the valley  with the touch of sentiment natural to her helen gazed backward for one more view of the mountaintop the wall of rugged rock she had so often admired from her window at home which henceforth would ever hold a tender place of remembrance in her heart rose out of a grayblue bank of mist the long swelling slope lay clear to the sunshine with the rays of the sun gleaming and glistening upon the variegated foliage and upon the shiny rolling haze above a beautiful picture of autumn splendor was before her tall pines here and there towered high and lonely over the surrounding trees their dark green graceful heads stood in bold relief above the gold and yellow crests beneath maples tinged from faintest pink to deepest rose added warm color to the scene and chestnuts with their brownwhite burrs lent fresher beauty to the undulating slope  the remaining distance to the settlement was short jonathan spoke only once to helen then questioning her as to where she had left her canoe they traversed the meadow found the boat in the thicket of willows and were soon under the frowning bluff of fort henry ascending the steep path they followed the road leading to colonel zanes cabin  a crowd of boys men and women loitering near the bluff arrested helens attention struck by this unusual occurrence she wondered what was the cause of such idleness among the busy pioneer people they were standing in little groups some made vehement gestures others conversed earnestly and yet more were silent on seeing jonathan a number shouted and pointed toward the inn the borderman hurried helen along the path giving no heed to the throng  but helen had seen the cause of all this excitement at first glance she thought metzars inn had been burned but a second later it could be seen that the smoke came from a smoldering heap of rubbish in the road the inn nevertheless had been wrecked windows stared with that vacantness peculiar to deserted houses the doors were broken from their hinges a pile of furniture rude tables chairs beds and other articles were heaped beside the smoking rubbish scattered around lay barrels and kegs all with gaping sides and broken heads liquor had stained the road where it had been soaked up by the thirsty dust  upon a shattered cellardoor lay a figure covered with a piece of rag carpet when helens quick eyes took in this last she turned away in horror that motionless form might be brandts remorse and womanly sympathy surged over her for bad as the man had shown himself he had loved her  she followed the borderman trying to compose herself as they neared colonel zanes cabin she saw her father will the colonel betty nell mrs zane silas zane and others whom she did not recognize they were all looking at her helens throat swelled and her eyes filled when she got near enough to see her fathers haggard eager face the others were grave she wondered guiltily if she had done much wrong  in another moment she was among them tears fell as her father extended his trembling hands to clasp her and as she hid her burning face on his breast he cried my dear dear child then betty gave her a great hug and nell flew about them like a happy bird colonel zanes face was pale and wore a clouded stern expression she smiled timidly at him through her tears well well well he mused while his gaze softened that was all he said but he took her hand and held it while he turned to jonathan  the borderman leaned on his long rifle regarding him with expectant eyes  well jack you missed a little scrimmage this morning wetzel got in at daybreak the storm and horses held him up on the other side of the river until daylight he told me of your suspicions with the additional news that hed found a fresh indian trail on the island just across from the inn we went down not expecting to find any one awake but metzar was hurriedly packing some of his traps half a dozen men were there having probably stayed all night that little english cuss was one of them and another an ugly fellow a stranger to us but evidently a woodsman things looked bad metzar told a decidedly conflicting story wetzel and i went outside to talk over the situation with the result that i ordered him to clean out the place  here colonel zane paused to indulge in a grim meaning laugh  well he cleaned out the place all right the ugly stranger got rattlesnakemad and yanked out a big knife sam is hitching up the team now to haul whats left of him up on the hillside metzar resisted arrest and got badly hurt hes in the guardhouse case who has been drunk for a week got in wetzels way and was kicked into the middle of next week hes been spitting blood for the last hour but i guess hes not much hurt brandt flew the coop last night wetzel found this hid in his room  colonel zane took a long feathered arrow from where it lay on a bench and held it out to jonathan  the shawnee signal wetzel had it right muttered the borderman  exactly lew found where the arrow struck in the wall of brandts room it was shot from the island at the exact spot where lew came to an end of the indians trail in the water  that shawnee got away from us  so lew said well hes gone now so is brandt were well rid of the gang if only we never hear of them again  the borderman shook his head during the colonels recital his face changed the dark eyes had become deadly the square jaw was shut the lines of the cheek had grown tense and over his usually expressive countenance had settled a chill lowering shade  lew thinks brandts in with bing legget well d his black traitor heart hes a good man for the worst and strongest gang that ever tracked the border  the borderman was silent but the furtive restless shifting of his eyes over the river and island hill and valley spoke more plainly than words  youre to take his trail at once added colonel zane i had bess put you up some bread meat and parched corn no doubt youll have a long hard tramp good luck  the borderman went into the cabin presently emerging with a buckskin knapsack strapped to his shoulder he set off eastward with a long swinging stride  the women had taken helen within the house where no doubt they could discuss with greater freedom the events of the previous day  sheppard said colonel zane turning with a sparkle in his eyes brandt was after helen sure as a bad weed grows fast and certain as death jonathan and wetzel will see him cold and quiet back in the woods thats a border saying and it means a good deal i never saw wetzel so implacable nor jonathan so fatally cold but once and that was when miller another traitor much like brandt tried to make away with betty it would have chilled your blood to see wetzel go at that fool this morning why did he want to pull a knife on the borderman it was a sad sight well these things are justifiable we must protect ourselves and above all our women weve had bad men and a bad man out here is something you cannot yet appreciate come here and slip into the life of the settlement because on the border you can never tell what a man is until he proves himself there have been scores of criminals spread over the frontier and some better men like simon girty who were driven to outlaw life simon must not be confounded with jim girty absolutely the most fiendish desperado who ever lived why even the indians feared jim so much that after his death his skeleton remained unmolested in the glade where he was killed the place is believed to be haunted now by all indians and many white hunters and i believe the bones stand there yet  stand asked sheppard deeply interested  yes it stands where girty stood and died upright against a tree pinned pinned there by a big knife  heavens man who did it sheppard cried in horror  again colonel zanes laugh almost metallic broke grimly from his lips  who why wetzel of course lew hunted jim girty five long years when he caught himgod ill tell you some other time jonathan saw wetzel handle jim and his pal deering as if they were mere boys well as i said the border has had and still has its bad men simon girty took mckee and elliott the tories from fort pitt when he deserted and ten men besides theyre all except those who are dead outlaws of the worst type the other bad men drifted out here from lord only knows where theyre scattered all over simon girty since his crowning black deed the massacre of the christian indians is in hiding bing legget now has the field hes a hard nut a cunning woodsman and capable leader who surrounds himself with only the most desperate indians and renegades brandt is an agent of leggets and ill bet well hear from him again     chapter xiii  jonathan traveled toward the east straight as a crow flies wetzels trail as he pursued brandt had been left designedly plain branches of young maples had been broken by the borderman they were glaring evidences of his passage on open ground or through swampy meadows he had contrived to leave other means to facilitate his comrades progress bits of sumach lay strewn along the way every red leafy branch a bright marker of the course crimson maple leaves served their turn and even longbladed ferns were scattered at intervals  ten miles east of fort henry at a point where two islands lay opposite each other wetzel had crossed the ohio jonathan removed his clothing and tying these together with his knapsack to the rifle held them above the water while he swam the three narrow channels he took up the trail again finding here as he expected where brandt had joined the waiting shawnee chief the borderman pressed on harder to the eastward  about the middle of the afternoon signs betokened that wetzel and his quarry were not far in advance fresh imprints in the grass crushed asters and moss broken branches with unwithered leaves and plots of grassy ground where jonathan saw that the blades of grass were yet springing back to their original position proved to the bordermans practiced eye that he was close upon wetzel  in time he came to a grove of yellow birch trees the ground was nearly free from brush beautifully carpeted with flowers and ferns and except where bushy windfalls obstructed the way was singularly open to the gaze for several hundred yards ahead  upon entering this wood wetzels plain intentional markings became manifest then wavered and finally disappeared jonathan pondered a moment he concluded that the way was so open and clear with nothing but grass and moss to mark a trail that wetzel had simply considered it waste of time for perhaps the short length of this grove  jonathan knew he was wrong after taking a dozen steps more wetzels trail known so well to him as never to be mistaken sheered abruptly off to the left and after a few yards the distance between the footsteps widened perceptibly then came a point where they were so far apart that they could only have been made by long leaps  on the instant the borderman knew that some unforeseen peril or urgent cause had put wetzel to flight and he now bent piercing eyes around the grove retracing his steps to where he had found the break in the trail he followed up brandts tracks for several rods not one hundred paces beyond where wetzel had quit the pursuit were the remains of a camp fire the embers still smoldering and moccasin tracks of a small band of indians the trail of brandt and his shawnee guide met the others at almost right angles  the indian either by accident or design had guided brandt to a band of his fellows and thus led wetzel almost into an ambush  evidence was not clear however that the indians had discovered the keen tracker who had run almost into their midst  while studying the forest ahead jonathans mind was running over the possibilities how close was wetzel was he still in flight had the savages an inkling of his pursuit or was he now working out one of his cunning tricks of woodcraft the borderman had no other idea than that of following the trail to learn all this taking the desperate chances warranted under the circumstances he walked boldly forward in his comrades footsteps  deep and gloomy was the forest adjoining the birch grove it was a heavy growth of hardwood trees interspersed with slender ash and maples which with their scanty foliage resembled a labyrinth of green and yellow network like filmy dotted lace hung on the taller darker oaks jonathan felt safer in this deep wood he could still see several rods in advance following the trail he was relieved to see that wetzels leaps had become shorter and shorter until they once again were about the length of a long stride the borderman was moreover swinging in a curve to the northeast this was proof that the borderman had not been pursued but was making a wide detour to get ahead of the enemy five hundred yards farther on the trail turned sharply toward the birch grove in the rear  the trail was fresh wetzel was possibly within signal call surely within sound of a rifle shot but even more stirring was the certainty that brandt and his indians were inside the circle wetzel had made  once again in sight of the more open woodland jonathan crawled on his hands and knees keeping close to the cluster of ferns until well within the eastern end of the grove he lay for some minutes listening a threatening silence like the hush before a storm permeated the wilderness he peered out from his covert but owing to its location in a little hollow he could not see far crawling to the nearest tree he rose to his feet slowly cautiously  no unnatural sight or sound arrested his attention repeatedly with the acute unsatisfied gaze of the borderman who knew that every tree every patch of ferns every tangled brushheap might harbor a foe he searched the grove with his eyes but the curlybarked birches the clumps of colored ferns the bushy windfalls kept their secrets  for the borderman however the whole aspect of the birchgrove had changed over the forest was a deep calm a gentle barely perceptible wind sighed among the leaves like rustling silk the faroff drowsy drum of a grouse intruded on the vast stillness the silence of the birds betokened a message that mysterious breathing that beautiful life of the woods lay hushed locked in a waiting brooding silence far away among the somber trees where the shade deepened into impenetrable gloom lay a menace invisible and indefinable  a wind a breath a chill terribly potent seemed to pass over the borderman long experience had given him intuition of danger  as he moved slightly with lynxeyes fixed on the grove before him a sharp clear perfect birdnote broke the ominous quiet it was like the melancholy cry of an oriole short deep suggestive of lonely forest dells by a slight variation in the short call jonathan recognized it as a signal from wetzel the borderman smiled as he realized that with all his stealth wetzel had heard or seen him reenter the grove the signal was a warning to stand still or retreat  jonathans gaze narrowed down to the particular point whence had come the signal some two hundred yards ahead in this direction were several large trees standing in a group with one exception they all had straight trunks this deviated from the others in that it possessed an irregular bulging trunk or else halfshielded the form of wetzel so indistinct and immovable was this irregularity that the watcher could not be certain out of line somewhat with this tree which he suspected screened his comrade lay a huge windfall large enough to conceal in ambush a whole band of savages  even as he gazed a sheet of flame flashed from this covert  crack  a loud report followed then the whistle and zip of a bullet as it whizzed close by his head  shawnee lead muttered jonathan  unfortunately the tree he had selected did not hide him sufficiently his shoulders were so wide that either one or the other was exposed affording a fine target for a marksman  a quick glance showed him a change in the knotty treetrunk the seeming bulge was now the wellknown figure of wetzel  jonathan dodged as some object glanced slantingly before his eyes  twang whizz thud three familiar and distinct sounds caused him to press hard against the tree  a tufted arrow quivered in the bark not a foot from his head  close shave damn that arrowshootin shawnee muttered jonathan an he aint in that windfall either his eyes searched to the left for the source of this new peril  another sheet of flame another report from the windfall a bullet sang close overhead and glancing on a branch went harmlessly into the forest  injuns all around i guess id better be makin tracks jonathan said to himself peering out to learn if wetzel was still under cover  he saw the tall figure straighten up a long black rifle rise to a level and become rigid a red fire belch forth followed by a puff of white smoke  spang  an indians horrible strangelybreaking death yell rent the silence  then a chorus of plaintive howls followed by angry shouts rang through the forest naked painted savages darted out of the windfall toward the tree that had sheltered wetzel  quick as thought jonathan covered the foremost indian and with the crack of his rifle saw the redskin drop his gun stop in his mad run stagger sideways and fall then the borderman looked to see what had become of his ally the cracking of the indians rifle told him that wetzel had been seen by his foes  with almost incredible fleetness a brown figure with long black hair streaming behind darted in and out among the trees flashed through the sunlit glade and vanished in the dark depths of the forest  jonathan turned to flee also when he heard again the twanging of an indians bow a wind smote his cheek a shock blinded him an excruciating pain seized upon his breast a feathered arrow had pinned his shoulder to the tree he raised his hand to pull it out but slippery with blood it afforded a poor hold for his fingers violently exerting himself with both hands he wrenched away the weapon the flinthead lacerating his flesh and scraping his shoulder bones caused sharpest agony the pain gave away to a sudden sense of giddiness he tried to run a dark mist veiled his sight he stumbled and fell then he seemed to sink into a great darkness and knew no more  when consciousness returned to jonathan it was night he lay on his back and knew because of his cramped limbs that he had been securely bound he saw the glimmer of a fire but could not raise his head a rustling of leaves in the wind told that he was yet in the woods and the distant rumble of a waterfall sounded familiar he felt drowsy his wound smarted slightly still he did not suffer any pain presently he fell asleep  broad daylight had come when again he opened his eyes the blue sky was directly above and before him he saw a ledge covered with dwarfed pine trees he turned his head and saw that he was in a sort of amphitheater of about two acres in extent enclosed by low cliffs a cleft in the stony wall let out a brawling brook and served no doubt as entrance to the place several rude log cabins stood on that side of the enclosure jonathan knew he had been brought to bing leggets retreat  voices attracted his attention and turning his head to the other side he saw a big indian pacing near him and beyond seven savages and three white men reclining in the shade  the powerful darkvisaged savage near him he at once recognized as ashbow the shawnee chief and noted emissary of bing legget of the other indians three were delawares and four shawnees all veterans with swarthy somber faces and glistening heads on which the scalplocks were trimmed and tufted their naked muscular bodies were painted for the warpath with their strange emblems of death a trio of white men nearly as bronzed as their savage comrades completed the group one a desperatelooking outlaw jonathan did not know the blondbearded giant in the center was legget steelblue inhuman eyes with the expression of a free but hunted animal a set mastifflike jaw brutal and coarse individualized him the last man was the haggardfaced brandt  i tell ye brandt i aint agoin against this injun legget was saying positively hes the best reddy on the border an has saved me scores of times this fellar zane belongs to him an while id much rather see the scout knifed right here an now i wont do nothin to interfere with the shawnees plans  why does the redskin want to take him away to his village brandt growled all injun vanity and pride  its injun ways an we cant do nothin to change em  but youre boss here you could make him put this borderman out of the way  wal i aint agoin ter interfere anyways brandt the shawneell make short work of the scout when he gits him among the tribe injuns is injuns its a great honor fer him to git zane an he wants his own people to figger in the finish quite natrl i reckon  i understand all that but its not safe for us and its courting death for ashbow why dont he keep zane here until you can spare more than three indians to go with him these bordermen cant be stopped you dont know them because youre new in this part of the country  ive been here as long as you an agoin some too i reckon replied legget complacently  but youve not been hunted until lately by these bordermen and youve had little opportunity to hear of them except from indians what can you learn from these silent redskins i tell you letting this fellow get out of here alive even for an hour is a fatal mistake its two full days tramp to the shawnee village you dont suppose wetzel will be afraid of four savages why he sneaked right into eight of us when we were ambushed waiting for him he killed one and then was gone like a streak it was only a piece of pure luck we got zane  ive reason to know this wetzel this deathwind as the delawares call him i never seen him though an anyways i reckon i can handle him if ever i get the chance  man youre crazy cried brandt hed cut you to pieces before youd have time to draw he could give you a tomahawk then take it away and split your head i tell you i know you remember jake deering he came from up your way wetzel fought deering and jim girty together and killed them you know how he left girty  ill allow he must be a fighter but i aint afraid of him  thats not the question i am talking sense youve got a chance now to put one of these bordermen out of the way do it quick thats my advice  brandt spoke so vehemently that legget seemed impressed he stroked his yellow beard and puffed thoughtfully on his pipe presently he addressed the shawnee chief in the native tongue  will ashbow take five horses for his prisoner  the indian shook his head  how many will he take  the chief strode with dignity to and fro before his captive his dark impassive face gave no clew to his thoughts but his lofty bearing his measured stately walk were indicative of great pride then he spoke in his deep bass  the shawnee knows the woods from the great lakes where the sun sets to the blue hills where it rises he has met the great paleface hunters only for deathwind will ashbow trade his captive  see it aint no use said legget spreading out his hands let him go hell outwit the bordermen if any redskins able to the sooner he goes the quicker hell git back an we can go to work you oughter be satisfied to git the girl  shut up interrupted brandt sharply  pears to me brandt bein in love hes kinder worked on your nerves you used to be game now youre afeerd of a bound an tied man who aint got long to live  i fear no man answered brandt scowling darkly but i know what you dont seem to have sense enough to see if this zane gets away which is probable he and wetzel will clean up your gang  haw haw haw roared legget slapping his knees then youd hev little chanst of gittin the lass eh  all right ive no more to say snapped brandt rising and turning on his heel as he passed jonathan he paused zane if i could id get even with you for that punch you once gave me as it is ill stop at the shawnee village on my way west  with the pretty lass interposed legget  where i hope to see your scalp drying in the chiefs lodge  the borderman eyed him steadily but in silence words could not so well have conveyed his thought as did the cold glance of dark scorn and merciless meaning  brandt shuffled on with a curse no coward was he no man ever saw him flinch but his intelligence was against him as a desperado while such as these bordermen lived an outlaw should never sleep for he was a marked and doomed man the deadly coldpointed flame which scintillated in the prisoners eyes was only a gleam of what the border felt towards outlaws  while jonathan was considering all he had heard three more shawnees entered the retreat and were at once called aside in consultation by ashbow at the conclusion of this brief conference the chief advanced to jonathan cut the bonds round his feet and motioned for him to rise the prisoner complied to find himself weak and sore but able to walk he concluded that his wound while very painful was not of a serious nature and that he would be taken at once on the march toward the shawnee village  he was correct for the chief led him with the three shawnees following toward the outlet of the enclosure jonathans sharp eye took in every detail of leggets rendezvous in a corral near the entrance he saw a number of fine horses and among them his sisters pony a more inaccessible natural refuge than leggets could hardly have been found in that country the entrance was a narrow opening in the wall and could be held by half a dozen against an army of besiegers it opened moreover on the side of a barren hill from which could be had a good survey of the surrounding forests and plains  as jonathan went with his captors down the hill his hopes which while ever alive had been flagging now rose the long journey to the shawnee town led through an untracked wilderness the delaware villages lay far to the north the wyandot to the west no likelihood was there of falling in with a band of indians hunting because this region stony barren and poorly watered afforded sparse pasture for deer or bison from the prisoners point of view this enterprise of ashbows was reckless and vainglorious cunning as the chief was he erred in one point a great warriors only weakness love of show of pride of his achievement in indian nature this desire for fame was as strong as love of life the brave risked everything to win his eagle feathers and the matured warrior found death while keeping bright the glory of the plumes he had won  wetzel was in the woods fleet as a deer fierce and fearless as a lion somewhere among those glades he trod stealthily with the ears of a doe and eyes of a hawk strained for sound or sight of his comrades captors when he found their trail he would stick to it as the wolf to that of a bleeding bucks the rescue would not be attempted until the right moment even though that came within rifleshot of the shawnee encampment wonderful as his other gifts was the bordermans patience     chapter xiv  good morning colonel zane said helen cheerily coming into the yard where the colonel was at work did will come over this way  i reckon youll find him if you find betty replied colonel zane dryly  come to think of it thats true helen said laughing ive a suspicion will ran off from me this morning  he and betty have gone nutting  i declare its mean of will helen said petulantly i have been wanting to go so much and both he and betty promised to take me  say helen let me tell you something said the colonel resting on his spade and looking at her quizzically i told them we hadnt had enough frost yet to ripen hickorynuts and chestnuts but they went anyhow will did remember to say if you came along to tell you hed bring the colored leaves you wanted  how extremely kind of him ive a mind to follow them  now see here helen it might be a right good idea for you not to returned the colonel with a twinkle and a meaning in his eye  oh i understand how singularly dull ive been  its this way were mighty glad to have a fine young fellow like will come along and interest betty lord knows we had a time with her after alfred died shes just beginning to brighten up now and helen the point is that young people on the border must get married no my dear you neednt laugh youll have to find a husband same as the other girls its not here as it was back east where a lass might have her fling so to speak and take her time choosing an unmarried girl on the border is a positive menace i saw not many years ago two firstrate youngsters wild with border fire and spirit fight and kill each other over a lass who wouldnt choose like as not if she had done so the three would have been good friends for out here were like one big family remember this helen and as far as betty and will are concerned you will be wise to follow our example leave them to themselves nothing else will so quickly strike fire between a boy and a girl  betty and will im sure id love to see them care for each other then with big bright eyes bent gravely on him she continued may i ask colonel zane who you have picked out for me  there now youve said it and thats the problem ive looked over every marriageable young man in the settlement except jack of course you couldnt care for him a borderman a fighter and all that but i cant find a fellow i think quite up to you  colonel zane is not a borderman such as jonathan worthy a womans regard helen asked a little wistfully  bless your heart lass yes replied colonel zane heartily people out here are not as they are back east an educated man polished and all that but incapable of hard labor or shrinking from dirt and sweat on his hands or even blood would not help us in the winning of the west plain as jonathan is and with his lack of schooling he is greatly superior to the majority of young men on the frontier but unlettered or not he is as fine a man as ever stepped in moccasins or any other kind of foot gear  then why did you saythatwhat you did  well its this way replied colonel zane stealing a glance at her pensive downcast face girls all like to be wooed almost every one i ever knew wanted the young man of her choice to outstrip all her other admirers and then for a spell nearly die of love for her after which shed give in now jack being a borderman a man with no occupation except scouting will never look at a girl let alone make up to her i imagine my dear itd take some mighty tall courting to fetch home helen sheppard a bride on the other hand if some pretty and spirited lass like say for instance helen sheppard would come along and just make jack forget indians and fighting shed get the finest husband in the world true hes wild but only in the woods a simpler kinder cleaner man cannot be found  i believe that colonel zane but where is the girl who would interest him helen asked with spirit these bordermen are unapproachable imagine a girl interesting that great cold stern wetzel all her flatteries her wiles the little coquetries that might attract ordinary men would not be noticed by him or jonathan either  i grant itd not be easy but woman was made to subjugate man and always everlastingly until the end of life here on this beautiful earth she will do it  do you think jonathan and wetzel will catch brandt asked helen changing the subject abruptly  id stake my all that this years autumn leaves will fall on brandts grave  colonel zanes calm matteroffact coldness made helen shiver  why the leaves have already begun to fall papa told me brandt had gone to join the most powerful outlaw band on the border how can these two men alone cope with savages as ive heard they do and break up such an outlaw band as leggets  thats a question ive heard daniel boone ask about wetzel and boone though not a borderman in all the name implies was a great indian fighter ive heard old frontiersmen grown grizzled on the frontier use the same words ive been twenty years with that man yet i cant answer it jonathan of course is only a shadow of him wetzel is the type of these men who have held the frontier for us he was the first borderman and no doubt hell be the last  what have jonathan and wetzel that other men do not possess  in them is united a marvelously developed woodcraft with wonderful physical powers imagine a man having a sense almost an animal instinct for what is going on in the woods take for instance the fleetness of foot that is one of the greatest factors it is absolutely necessary to run to get away when to hold ground would be death whether at home or in the woods the bordermen retreat every day you wouldnt think they practiced anything of the kind would you well a man cant be great in anything without keeping at it jonathan says he exercises to keep his feet light wetzel would just as soon run as walk think of the magnificent condition of these men when a dash of speed is called for when to be fleet of foot is to elude vengeanceseeking indians they must travel as swiftly as the deer the zanes were all sprinters i could do something of the kind betty was fast on her feet as that old fort will testify until the logs rot isaac was fleet too and jonathan can get over the ground like a scared buck but even so wetzel can beat him  goodness me helen exclaimed the colonels buxom wife from the window dont you ever get tired hearing eb talk of wetzel and jack and indians come in with me i venture to say my gossip will do you more good than his stories  therefore helen went in to chat with mrs zane for she was always glad to listen to the colonels wife who was so bright and pleasant so helpful and kindly in her womanly way in the course of their conversation which drifted from weaving linsey mrs zanes occupation at the tune to the costly silks and satins of remembered days and then to matters of more present interest helen spoke of colonel zanes hint about will and betty  isnt eb a terror hes the worst matchmatcher you ever saw declared the colonels good spouse  theres no harm in that  no indeed its a good thing but he makes me laugh and betty he sets her furious  the colonel said he had designs on me  of course he has dear old eb how hed love to see you happily married his heart is as big as that mountain yonder he has given this settlement his whole life  i believe you he has such interest such zeal for everybody only the other day he was speaking to me of mr mordaunt telling how sorry he was for the englishman and how much hed like to help him it does seem a pity a man of mordaunts blood and attainments should sink to utter worthlessness  yestis a pity for any man blood or no and the worlds full of such wrecks i always liked that mans looks i never had a word with him of course but ive seen him often and something about him appealed to me i dont believe it was just his handsome face still i know women are susceptible that way  i too liked him once as a friend said helen feelingly well im glad hes gone  gone  yes he left fort henry yesterday he came to say goodbye to me and except for his pale face and trembling hands was much as he used to be in virginia said he was going home to england and wanted to tell me he was sorryforfor all hed done to make papa and me suffer drink had broken him he said and surely he looked a broken man i shook hands with him and then slipped upstairs and cried  poor fellow sighed mrs zane  papa said he left fort pitt with one of metzars men as a guide  then he didnt take the little cuss as eb calls his man case  no if i remember rightly papa said case wouldnt go  i wish he had hes no addition to our village  voices outside attracted their attention mrs zane glanced from the window and said there come betty and will  helen went on the porch to see her cousin and betty entering the yard and colonel zane once again leaning on his spade  gather any hickorynuts from birch or any other kind of trees asked the colonel grimly  no replied will cheerily the shells havent opened yet  too bad the frost is so backward said colonel zane with a laugh but i cant see that it makes any difference  where are my leaves asked helen with a smile and a nod to betty  what leaves inquired that young woman plainly mystified  why the autumn leaves will promised to gather with me then changed his mind and said hed bring them  i forgot will replied a little awkwardly  colonel zane coughed and then catching bettys glance which had begun to flash he plied his spade vigorously  bettys face had colored warmly at her brothers first question it toned down slightly when she understood that he was not going to tease her as usual and suddenly as she looked over his head it paled white as snow  eb look down the lane she cried  two tall men were approaching with labored tread one halfsupporting his companion  wetzel jack and jacks hurt cried betty  my dear be calm said colonel zane in that quiet tone he always used during moments of excitement he turned toward the bordermen and helped wetzel lead jonathan up the walk into the yard  from wetzels clothing water ran his long hair was disheveled his aspect frightful jonathans face was white and drawn his buckskin hunting coat was covered with blood and the hand which he held tightly against his left breast showed dark red stains  helen shuddered almost fainting she leaned against the porch too horrified to cry out with contracting heart and a chill stealing through her veins  jack jack cried betty in agonized appeal  betty its nothin said wetzel  now betts dont be scared of a little blood jonathan said with a faint smile flitting across his haggard face  bring water shears an some linsey cloth added wetzel as mrs zane came running out  come inside cried the colonels wife as she disappeared again immediately  no replied the borderman removing his coat and with the assistance of his brother he unlaced his hunting shirt pulling it down from a wounded shoulder a great gory hole gaped just beneath his left collarbone  although stricken with fear when helen saw the bronzed massive shoulder the long powerful arm with its cords of muscles playing under the brown skin she felt a thrill of admiration  just missed the lung said mrs zane eb no bullet ever made that hole  wetzel washed the bloody wound and placing on it a wad of leaves he took from his pocket bound up the shoulder tightly  what made that hole asked colonel zane  wetzel lifted the quiver of arrows jonathan had laid on the porch and selecting one handed it to the colonel the flinthead and a portion of the shaft were stained with blood  the shawnee exclaimed colonel zane then he led wetzel aside and began conversing in low tones while jonathan with betty holding his arm ascended the steps and went within the dwelling  helen ran home and once in her room gave vent to her emotions she cried because of fright nervousness relief and joy then she bathed her face tried to rub some color into her pale cheeks and set about getting dinner as one in a trance she could not forget that broad shoulder with its frightful wound what a man jonathan must be to receive a blow like that and live exhausted almost spent had been his strength when he reached home yet how calm and cool he was what would she not have given for the faint smile that shone in his eyes for betty  the afternoon was long for helen when at last supper was over she changed her gown and asking will to accompany her went down the lane toward colonel zanes cabin at this hour the colonel almost invariably could be found sitting on his doorstep puffing a long indian pipe and gazing with dreamy eyes over the valley  well well how sweet you look he said to helen then with a wink of his eyelid hello willie youll find elizabeth inside with jack  how is he asked helen eagerly as will with a laugh and a retort mounted the steps  jacks doing splendidly he slept all day i dont think his injury amounts to much at least not for such as him or wetzel it would have finished ordinary men bess says if complications dont set in bloodpoison or something to start a fever hell be up shortly wetzel believes the two of em will be on the trail inside of a week  did they find brandt asked helen in a low voice  yes they ran him to his hole and as might have been expected it was bing leggets camp the indians took jonathan there  then jack was captured  colonel zane related the events as told briefly by wetzel that had taken place during the preceding three days  the indian i saw at the spring carried that bow jonathan brought back he must have shot the arrow he was a magnificent savage  he was indeed a great and a bad indian one of the craftiest spies who ever stepped in moccasins but he lies quiet now on the moss and the leaves bing legget will never find another runner like that shawnee let us go indoors  he led helen into the large sittingroom where jonathan lay on a couch with betty and will sitting beside him the colonels wife and children silas zane and several neighbors were present  here jack is a lady inquiring after your health betts this reminds me of the time isaac came home wounded after his escape from the hurons strikes me he and his indian bride should be about due here on a visit  helen forgot every one except the wounded man lying so quiet and pale upon the couch she looked down upon him with eyes strangely dilated and darkly bright  how are you she asked softly  im all right thank you lass answered jonathan  colonel zane contrived with inimitable skill to get betty will silas bessie and the others interested in some remarkable news he had just heard or made up and this left jonathan and helen comparatively alone for the moment  the wise old colonel thought perhaps this might be the right time he saw helens face as she leaned over jonathan and that was enough for him he would have taxed his ingenuity to the utmost to keep the others away from the young couple  i was so frightened murmured helen  why asked jonathan  oh you looked so deathlythe blood and that awful wound  its nothin lass  helen smiled down upon him whether or not the hurt amounted to anything in the bordermans opinion she knew from his weakness and his white drawn face that the strain of the march home had been fearful his dark eyes held now nothing of the coldness and glitter so natural to them they were weary almost sad she did not feel afraid of him now he lay there so helpless his long powerful frame as quiet as a sleeping childs hitherto an almost indefinable antagonism in him had made itself felt now there was only gentleness as of a man too weary to fight longer helens heart swelled with pity and tenderness and love his weakness affected her as had never his strength with an involuntary gesture of sympathy she placed her hand softly on his  jonathan looked up at her with eyes no longer blind pain had softened him for the moment he felt carried out of himself as it were and saw things differently the melting tenderness of her gaze the glowing softness of her face the beauty bewitched him and beyond that a sweet impelling gladness stirred within him and would not be denied he thrilled as her fingers lightly timidly touched his and opened his broad hand to press hers closely and warmly  lass he whispered with a huskiness and unsteadiness unnatural to his deep voice  helen bent her head closer to him she saw his lips tremble and his nostrils dilate but an unutterable sadness shaded the brightness in his eyes  i love you  the low whisper reached helens ears she seemed to float dreamily away to some beautiful world with the music of those words ringing in her ears she looked at him again had she been dreaming no his dark eyes met hers with a love that he could no longer deny an exquisite emotion keen strangely sweet and strong yet terrible with sharp pain pulsated through her being the revelation had been too abrupt it was so wonderfully different from what she had ever dared hope she lowered her head trembling  the next moment she felt colonel zanes hand on her chair and heard him say in a cheery voice  well well see here lass you mustnt make jack talk too much see how white and tired he looks     chapter xv  in fortyeight hours jonathan zane was up and about the cabin as though he had never been wounded the third day he walked to the spring in a week he was waiting for wetzel ready to go on the trail  on the eighth day of his enforced idleness as he sat with betty and the colonel in the yard wetzel appeared on a ridge east of the fort soon he rounded the stockade fence and came straight toward them to colonel zane and betty wetzels expression was terrible the stern kindliness the calm though cold gravity of his countenance as they usually saw it had disappeared yet it showed no trace of his unnatural passion to pursue and slay no doubt that terrible instinct or lust was at white heat but it wore a mask of impenetrable stonegray gloom  wetzel spoke briefly after telling jonathan to meet him at sunset on the following day at a point five miles up the river he reported to the colonel that legget with his band had left their retreat moving southward apparently on a marauding expedition then he shook hands with colonel zane and turned to betty  goodbye betty he said in his deep sonorous voice  goodbye lew answered betty slowly as if surprised god save you she added  he shouldered his rifle and hurried down the lane halting before entering the thicket that bounded the clearing to look back at the settlement in another moment his dark figure had disappeared among the bushes  betts ive seen wetzel go like that hundreds of times though he never shook hands before but i feel sort of queer about it now wasnt he strange  betty did not answer until jonathan who had started to go within was out of hearing  lew looked and acted the same the morning he struck millers trail betty replied in a low voice i believe despite his indifference to danger he realizes that the chances are greatly against him as they were when he began the trailing of miller certain it would lead him into girtys camp then i know lew has an affection for us though it is never shown in ordinary ways i pray he and jack will come home safe  this is a bad trail theyre taking up the worst perhaps in border warfare said colonel zane gloomily did you notice how jacks face darkened when his comrade came much of this bordermanlife of his is due to wetzels influence  eb ill tell you one thing returned betty with a flash of her old spirit this is jacks last trail  why do you think so  if he doesnt return hell be gone the way of all bordermen but if he comes back once more hell never get away from helen  ugh exclaimed zane venting his pleasure in characteristic indian way  that night after jack came home wounded continued betty i saw him as he lay on the couch gaze at helen such a look eb she has won  i hope so but i fear i fear replied her brother gloomily if only he returns thats the thing betts be sure he sees helen before he goes away  i shall try here he comes now said betty  hello jack cried the colonel as his brother came out in somewhat of a hurry what have you got by george its that blamed arrow the shawnee shot into you where are you going with it what the deucesaybetts eh  betty had given him a sharp little kick  the borderman looked embarrassed he hesitated and flushed evidently he would have liked to avoid his brothers question but the inquiry came direct dissimulation with him was impossible  helen wanted this an i reckon thats where im goin with it he said finally and walked away  eb youre a stupid exclaimed betty  hang it whod have thought he was going to give her that blamed bloody arrow  as helen ushered jonathan for the first time into her cosy little sittingroom her heart began to thump so hard she could hear it  she had not seen him since the night he whispered the words which gave such happiness she had stayed at home thankful beyond expression to learn every day of his rapid improvement living in the sweetness of her joy and waiting for him and now as he had come so dark so grave so unlike a lover to woo that she felt a chill steal over her  im so glad youve brought the arrow she faltered for of course coming so far means that youre well once more  you asked me for it an ive fetched it over tomorrow im off on a trail i may never return from he answered simply and his voice seemed cold  an immeasurable distance stretched once more between them helens happiness slowly died  i thank you she said with a voice that was tremulous despite all her efforts  its not much of a keepsake  i did not ask for it as a keepsake but becausebecause i wanted it i need nothing tangible to keep alive my memory a few words whispered to me not many days ago will suffice for remembranceoror did i dream them  bitter disappointment almost choked helen this was not the gentle softvoiced man who had said he loved her it was the indifferent borderman again he was the embodiment of his strange quiet woods once more he seemed the comrade of the cold inscrutable wetzel  no lass i reckon you didnt dream he replied  helen swayed from sick bitterness and a suffocating sense of pain back to her old sweet joyous tumultuous heartthrobbing  tell me if i didnt dream she said softly her face flashing warm again she came close to him and looked up with all her heart in her great dark eyes and love trembling on her red lips  calmness deserted the borderman after one glance at her he paced the floor twisted and clasped his hands while his eyes gleamed  lass im only human he cried hoarsely facing her again  but only for a moment did he stand before her but it was long enough for him to see her shrink a little the gladness in her eyes giving way to uncertainty and a fugitive hope suddenly he began to pace the room again and to talk incoherently with the flow of words he gradually grew calmer and with something of his natural dignity spoke more rationally  i said i loved you an its true but i didnt mean to speak i oughtnt have done it somethin made it so easy so natural like id have died before letting you know if any idea had come to me of what i was sayin ive fought this feelin for months i allowed myself to think of you at first an theres the wrong i went on the trail with your big eyes pictured in my mind an before id dreamed of it youd crept into my heart life has never been the same sincethat kiss betty said as how you cared for me an that made me worse only i never really believed today i came over here to say goodbye expectin to hold myself well in hand but the first glance of your eyes unmans me nothin can come of it lass nothin but trouble even if you cared an i dont dare believe you do nothin can come of it ive my own life to live an theres no sweetheart in it mebbe as lew says theres one in heaven oh girl this has been hard on me i see you always on my lonely tramps i see your glorious eyes in the sunny fields an in the woods at gray twilight an when the stars shine brightest they haunt me ah youre the sweetest lass as ever tormented a man an i love you i love you  he turned to the window only to hear a soft broken cry and a flurry of skirts a rush of wind seemed to envelop him then two soft rounded arms encircled his neck and a golden head lay on his breast  my borderman my hero my love  jonathan clasped the beautiful quivering girl to his heart  lass for gods sake dont say you love me he implored thrilling with contact of her warm arms  ah she breathed and raised her head her radiant eyes darkly wonderful with unutterable love burned into his  he had almost pressed his lips to the sweet red ones so near his when he drew back with a start and his frame straightened  am i a man or only a coward he muttered lass let me think dont believe im harsh nor cold nor nothin except that i want to do whats right  he leaned out of the window while helen stood near him with a hand on his quivering shoulder when at last he turned his face was colorless white as marble and sad and set and stern  lass it mustnt be ill not ruin your life  but you will if you give me up  no no lass  i cannot live without you  you must my life is not mine to give  but you love me  i am a borderman  i will not live without you  hush lass hush  i love you  jonathan breathed hard once more the tremor which seemed pitiful in such a strong man came upon him his face was gray  i love you she repeated her rich voice indescribably deep and full she opened wide her arms and stood before him with heaving bosom with great eyes dark with womans sadness passionate with womans promise perfect in her beauty glorious in her abandonment  the borderman bowed and bent like a broken reed  listen she whispered coming closer to him go if you must leave me but let this be your last trail come back to me jack come back to me you have had enough of this terrible life you have won a name that will never be forgotten you have done your duty to the border the indians and outlaws will be gone soon take the farm your brother wants you to have and live for me we will be happy i shall learn to keep your home oh my dear i will recompense you for the loss of all this wild hunting and fighting let me persuade you as much for your sake as for mine for you are my heart and soul and life go out upon your last trail jack and come back to me  an let wetzel go always alone  he is different he lives only for revenge what are those poor savages to you you have a better nobler life opening  lass i cant give him up  you need not but give up this useless seeking of adventure that you know is half a bordermans life give it up jack it not for your own then for my sake  nononeveri canti wont be a coward after all these years i wont desert him nono  do not say more she pleaded stealing closer to him until she was against his breast she slipped her arms around his neck for love and more than life she was fighting now goodbye my love she kissed him a long lingering pressure of her soft full lips on his dearest do not shame me further dearest jack come back to me for i love you  she released him and ran sobbing from the room  unsteady as a blind man he groped for the door found it and went out     chapter xvi  the longest day in jonathan zanes life the oddest the most terrible and complex with unintelligible emotions was that one in which he learned that the wilderness no longer sufficed for him  he wandered through the forest like a man lost searching for he knew not what rambling along the shady trails he looked for that contentment which had always been his but found it not he plunged into the depths of deep gloomy ravines into the fastnesses of heavytimbered hollows where the trees hid the light of day he sought the open grassy hillsides and roamed far over meadow and plain yet something always eluded him the invisible and beautiful life of all inanimate things sang no more in his heart the springy moss the quivering leaf the telltale bark of the trees the limpid misty eddying pools under green banks the myriads of natural objects from which he had learned so much and the manifold joyous life around him no longer spoke with soulsatisfying faithfulness the environment of his boyish days of his youth and manhood rendered not a sweetness as of old  his intelligence sharpened by the pain of new experience told him he had been vain to imagine that he because he was a borderman could escape the universal destiny of human life dimly he could feel the broadening the awakening into a fuller existence but he did not welcome this new light he realized that men had always turned at some time in their lives to women even as the cypress leans toward the sun this weakening of the sterner stuff in him this softening of his heart and especially the inquietude and lack of joy and harmony in his old pursuits of the forest trails bewildered him and troubled him some thousands of times his bordermans trail had been crossed yet never to his sorrow until now when it had been crossed by a woman  sick at heart hurt in his pride darkly savage sad remorseful and thrilling with awakened passion all in turn he roamed the woodland unconsciously visiting the scenes where he had formerly found contentment  he paused by many a shady glen and beautiful quiet glade by gray cliffs and mossy banks searching with moody eyes for the spirit which evaded him  here in the green and golden woods rose before him a rugged giant rock mossstained and gleaming with trickling water tangled ferns dressed in autumns russet hue lay at the base of the greengray cliff and circled a dark deep pool dotted with yellow leaves halfway up the perpendicular ascent was broken by a protruding ledge upon which waved broadleaved plants and rusty ferns above the cliff sheered out with many cracks and seams in its weatherbeaten front  the forest grew to the verge of the precipice a full foliaged oak and a luxuriant maple the former still fresh with its dark green leaves the latter making a vivid contrast with its pale yellow purplered and orange hues leaned far out over the bluff a mighty chestnut grasped with gnarled roots deep into the broken cliff dainty plumes of goldenrod swayed on the brink red berries amber moss and green trailing vines peeped over the edge and every little niche and cranny sported fragile ferns and palefaced asters a second cliff higher than the first and more heavily wooded loomed above and over it sprayed a transparent film of water thin as smoke and iridescent in the sunshine far above where the glancing rill caressed the mossy cliff and shone like gleaming gold against the dark branches with their green and red and purple leaves lay the faint blue of the sky  jonathan pulled on down the stream with humbler heart his favorite waterfall had denied him the gold that had gleamed there was his sweethearts hair the red was of her lips the dark pool with its lights and shades its unfathomable mystery was like her eyes  he came at length to another scene of milder aspect an open glade where the dancing dimpling brook raced under dark hemlocks and where bloodred sumach leaves and beech leaves like flashes of sunshine lay against the green under a leaning birch he found a patch of purple asters and a little apart from them by a mossy stone a lonely fringed gentian its deep color brought to him the dark blue eyes that haunted him and once again like one possessed of an evil spirit he wandered along the merry watercourse  but finally pain and unrest left him when he surrendered to his love peace returned though he said in his heart that helen was not for him he felt he did not need to torture himself by fighting against resistless power he could love her without being a coward he would take up his life where it had been changed and live it carrying this bittersweet burden always  memory now that he admitted himself conquered made a toy of him bringing the sweetness of fragrant hair and eloquent eyes and clinging arms and dewy lips a thousandfold harder to fight than pain was the seductive thought that he had but to go back to helen to feel again the charm of her presence to see the grace of her person to hear the music of her voice to have again her lips on his  jonathan knew then that his trial had but begun that the pain and suffering of a bordermans broken pride and conquered spirit was nothing that to steel his heart against the joy the sweetness the longing of love was everything  so a tumult raged within his heart no bitterness nor wretchedness stabbed him as before but a passionate yearning born of memory and unquenchable as the fires of the sun burned there  helens reply to his pale excuses to his duty to his life was that she loved him the wonder of it made him weak was not her answer enough i love you three words only but they changed the world a beautiful girl loved him she had kissed him and his life could never again be the same she had held out her arms to himand he cold churlish unfeeling brute had let her shame herself fighting for her happiness for the joy that is a womans divine right he had been blind he had not understood the significance of her gracious action he had never realized until too late what it must have cost her what heartburning shame and scorn his refusal brought upon her if she ever looked tenderly at him again with her great eyes or leaned toward him with her beautiful arms outstretched he would fall at her feet and throw his duty to the winds swearing his love was hers always and his life forever  so love stormed in the bordermans heart  slowly the melancholy indiansummer day waned as jonathan strode out of the woods into a plain beyond where he was to meet wetzel at sunset a smoky haze like a purple cloud lay upon the gently waving grass he could not see across the stretch of prairieland though at this point he knew it was hardly a mile wide with the trilling of the grasshoppers alone disturbing the serene quiet of this autumn afternoon all nature seemed in harmony with the declining season he stood a while his thoughts becoming the calmer for the silence and loneliness of this breathing meadow  when the shadows of the trees began to lengthen and to steal far out over the yellow grass he knew the time had come and glided out upon the plain he crossed it and sat down upon a huge stone which lay with one shelving end overhanging the river  far in the west the goldred sun too fiery for his direct gaze lost the brilliance of its under circle behind the fringe of the wooded hill slowly the red ball sank when the last bright gleam had vanished in the dark horizon jonathan turned to search wood and plain wetzel was to meet him at sunset even as his first glance swept around a light step sounded behind him he did not move for that step was familiar in another moment the tall form of wetzel stood beside him  im about as much behind as you was ahead of time said wetzel well stay here fer the night an be off early in the mornin  under the shelving side of the rock and in the shade of the thicket the bordermen built a little fire and roasted strips of deermeat then puffing at their long pipes they sat for a long time in silence while twilight let fall a dark gray cloak over river and plain  leggets move up the river was a blind as i suspected said wetzel presently hes not far back in the woods from here an seems to be waitin fer somethin or somebody brandt an seven redskins are with him wed hev a good chance at them in the mornin now weve got em a long ways from their camp so well wait an see what deviltry theyre up to  mebbe hes waitin for some injun band suggested jonathan  thars redskins in the valley an close to him but i reckon hes barkin up another tree  suppose we run into some of these injuns  well hev to take what comes replied wetzel lying down on a bed of leaves  when darkness enveloped the spot wetzel lay wrapped in deep slumber while jonathan sat against the rock watching the last flickerings of the campfire     chapter xvii  will and helen hurried back along the river road beguiled by the soft beauty of the autumn morning they ventured farther from the fort than ever before and had been suddenly brought to a realization of the fact by a crackling in the underbrush instantly their minds reverted to bears and panthers such as they had heard invested the thickets round the settlement  oh will i saw a dark form stealing along in the woods from tree to tree exclaimed helen in a startled whisper  so did i it was an indian or i never saw one walk faster once round the bend in the road well be within sight of the fort then well run replied will he had turned pale but maintained his composure  they increased their speed and had almost come up to the curve in the road marked by dense undergrowth on both sides when the branches in the thicket swayed violently a sturdy little man armed with a musket appeared from among them  avast heave to he commanded in a low fierce voice leveling his weapon one breeze from ye an i let sail this broadside  what do you want we have no valuables said will speaking low  helen stared at the little man she was speechless with terror it flashed into her mind as soon as she recognized the red evil face of the sailor that he was the accomplice upon whom brandt had told metzar he could rely  shut up its not ye i want nor valuables but this wench growled case he pushed will around with the muzzle of the musket which action caused the young man to turn a sickly white and shrink involuntarily with fear the hammer of the musket was raised and might fall at the slightest jar  for gods sake will do as he says cried helen who saw murder in cases eyes capture or anything was better than sacrifice of life  march ordered case with the musket against wills back  will hurriedly started forward jostling helen who had preceded him he was forced to hurry because every few moments case pressed the gun to his back or side  without another word the sailor marched them swiftly along the road which now narrowed down to a trail his intention no doubt was to put as much distance between him and the fort as was possible no more than a mile had been thus traversed when two indians stepped into view  my god my god cried will as the savages proceeded first to bind helens arms behind her and then his in the same manner after this the journey was continued in silence the indians walking beside the prisoners and case in the rear  helen was so terrified that for a long time she could not think coherently it seemed as if she had walked miles yet did not feel tired always in front wound the narrow leafgirt trail and to the left the broad river gleamed at intervals through open spaces in the thickets flocks of birds rose in the line of march they seemed tame and uttered plaintive notes as if in sympathy  about noon the trail led to the river bank one of the savages disappeared in a copse of willows and presently reappeared carrying a birchbark canoe case ordered helen and will into the boat got in himself and the savages taking stations at bow and stern paddled out into the stream they shot over under the lee of an island around a rocky point and across a strait to another island beyond this they gained the ohio shore and beached the canoe  ahoy there capn cried case pushing helen up the bank before him and she gazing upward was more than amazed to see mordaunt leaning against a tree  mordaunt had you anything to do with this cried helen breathlessly  i had all to do with it answered the englishman  what do you mean  he did not meet her gaze nor make reply but turned to address a few words in a low tone to a white man sitting on a log  helen knew she had seen this person before and doubted not he was one of metzars men she saw a rude bark leanto the remains of a campfire and a pack tied in blankets evidently mordaunt and his men had tarried here awaiting such developments as had come to pass  you whitefaced hound hissed will beside himself with rage when he realized the situation bound though he was he leaped up and tried to get at mordaunt case knocked him on the head with the handle of his knife will fell with blood streaming from a cut over the temple  the dastardly act aroused all helens fiery courage she turned to the englishman with eyes ablaze  so youve at last found your level borderoutlaw kill me at once id rather be dead than breathe the same air with such a coward  i swore id have you if not by fair means then by foul he answered with dark and haggard face  what do you intend to do with me now that i am tied she demanded scornfully  keep you a prisoner in the woods till you consent to marry me  helen laughed in scorn desperate as was the plight her natural courage had arisen at the cruel blow dealt her cousin and she faced the englishman with flashing eyes and undaunted mien she saw he was again unsteady and had the cough and catching breath habitual to certain men under the influence of liquor she turned her attention to will he lay as he had fallen with blood streaming over his pale face and fair hair while she gazed at him case whipped out his long knife and looked up at mordaunt  capn id better loosen a hatch fer him he said brutally hes dead cargo fer us an in the way  he lowered the gleaming point upon wills chest  ohhh breathed helen in horror she tried to close her eyes but was so fascinated she could not  get up ill have no murder ordered mordaunt leave him here  hes not got a bad cut said the man sitting on the log hell come to arter a spell go back to ther fort an give an alarm  whats that to me asked mordaunt sharply we shall be safe i wont have him with us because some indian or another will kill him its not my purpose to murder any one  ugh grunted one of the savages and pointed eastward with his hand hurrylongwaygo he said in english with the indians in the lead the party turned from the river into the forest  helen looked back into the sandy glade and saw will lying as they had left him unconscious with his hands still bound tightly behind him and blood running over his face painful as was the thought of leaving him thus it afforded her relief she assured herself he had not been badly hurt would recover consciousness before long and even bound as he was could make his way back to the settlement  her own situation now that she knew mordaunt had instigated the abduction did not seem hopeless although dreading brandt with unspeakable horror she did not in the least fear the englishman he was mad to carry her off like this into the wilderness but would force her to do nothing he could not keep her a prisoner long while jonathan zane and wetzel were free to take his trail what were his intentions where was he taking her such questions as these however troubled helen more than a little they brought her thoughts back to the indians leading the way with lithe and stealthy step how had mordaunt associated himself with these savages then suddenly it dawned upon her that brandt also might be in this scheme to carry her off she scouted the idea but it returned perhaps mordaunt was only a tool perhaps he himself was being deceived helen turned pale at the very thought she had never forgotten the strange unreadable yet threatening expression which brandt had worn the day she had refused to walk with him  meanwhile the party made rapid progress through the forest not a word was spoken nor did any noise of rustling leaves or crackling twigs follow their footsteps the savage in the lead chose the open and less difficult ground he took advantage of glades mossy places and rocky ridges this careful choosing was evidently to avoid noise and make the trail as difficult to follow as possible once he stopped suddenly and listened  helen had a good look at the savage while he was in this position his lean athletic figure resembled in its halfclothed condition a bronzed statue his powerful visage was set changeless like iron his dark eyes seemed to take in all points of the forest before him  whatever had caused the halt was an enigma to all save his redskinned companion  the silence of the wood was the silence of the desert no bird chirped no breath of wind sighed in the treetops even the aspens remained unagitated pale yellow leaves sailed slowly reluctantly down from above  but some faint sound something unusual had jarred upon the exquisitely sensitive ears of the leader for with a meaning shake of the head to his followers he resumed the march in a direction at right angles with the original course  this caution and evident distrust of the forest ahead made helen think again of jonathan and wetzel those great bordermen might already be on the trail of her captors the thought thrilled her presently she realized from another long silent march through forest thickets glades aisles and groves over rockstrewn ridges and down mossystoned ravines that her strength was beginning to fail  i can go no further with my arms tied in this way she declared stopping suddenly  ugh uttered the savage before her turning sharply he brandished a tomahawk before her eyes  mordaunt hurriedly set free her wrists his pale face flushed a dark flaming red when she shrank from his touch as if he were a viper  after they had traveled what seemed to helen many miles the vigilance of the leaders relaxed  on the banks of the willowskirted stream the indian guide halted them and proceeded on alone to disappear in a green thicket presently he reappeared and motioned for them to come on he led the way over smooth sandy paths between clumps of willows into a heavy growth of alder bushes and prickly thorns at length to emerge upon a beautiful grassy plot enclosed by green and yellow shrubbery above the stream which cut the edge of the glade rose a sloping wooded ridge with huge rocks projecting here and there out of the brown forest  several birchbark huts could be seen then two rough bearded men lolling upon the grass and beyond them a group of painted indians  a whoop so shrill so savage so exultant that it seemingly froze her blood rent the silence a man unseen before came crashing through the willows on the side of the ridge he leaped the stream with the spring of a wild horse he was big and broad with disheveled hair keen hard face and wild gray eyes  helens sight almost failed her her head whirled dizzily it was as if her heart had stopped beating and was become a cold dead weight she recognized in this man the one whom she feared most of allbrandt  he cast one glance full at her the same threatening cool and evilmeaning look she remembered so well and then engaged the indian guide in low conversation  helen sank at the foot of a tree leaning against it despite her weariness she had retained some spirit until this direful revelation broke her courage what worse could have happened mordaunt had led her for some reason that she could not divine into the clutches of brandt into the power of legget and his outlaws  but helen was not one to remain long dispirited or hopeless as this plot thickened as every added misfortune weighed upon her when just ready to give up to despair she remembered the bordermen then colonel zanes tales of their fearless implacable pursuit when bent on rescue or revenge recurred to her and fortitude returned while she had life she would hope  the advent of the party with their prisoner enlivened leggets gang a great giant of a man blondbearded and handsome in a wild rugged uncouth way a man helen instinctively knew to be legget slapped brandt on the shoulder  damme roge if she aint a regular little daisy never seed such a purty lass in my life  brandt spoke hurriedly and legget laughed  all this time case had been sitting on the grass saying nothing but with his little eyes watchful mordaunt stood near him his head bowed his face gloomy  say capn i dont like this mess whispered case to his master they aint no crew fer us i know men fer ive sailed the seas an youre goin to get what metz calls the doublecross  mordaunt seemed to arouse from his gloomy reverie he looked at brandt and legget who were now in earnest council then his eyes wandered toward helen she beckoned him to come to her  why did you bring me here she asked  brandt understood my case he planned this thing and seemed to be a good friend of mine he said if i once got you out of the settlement he would give me protection until i crossed the border into canada there we could be married replied mordaunt unsteadily  then you meant marriage by me if i could be made to consent  of course im not utterly vile he replied with face lowered in shame  have you any idea what youve done  done i dont understand  you have ruined yourself lost your manhood become an outlaw a fugitive made yourself the worst thing on the bordera girlthief and all for nothing  no i have you you are more to me than all  but cant you see youve brought me out here for brandt  my god exclaimed mordaunt he rose slowly to his feet and gazed around like a man suddenly wakened from a dream i see it all now miserable drunken wretch that i am  helen saw his face change and lighten as if a cloud of darkness had passed away from it she understood that love of liquor had made him a party to this plot brandt had cunningly worked upon his weakness proposed a daring scheme and filled his befogged mind with hopes that in a moment of clearsightedness he would have seen to be vain and impossible and helen understood also that the sudden shock of surprise pain possible fury had sobered mordaunt probably for the first time in weeks  the englishmans face became exceedingly pale seating himself on a stone near case he bowed his head remaining silent and motionless  the conference between legget and brandt lasted for some time when it ended the latter strode toward the motionless figure on the rock  mordaunt you and case will do well to follow this indian at once to the river where you can strike the fort pitt trail said brandt  he spoke arrogantly and authoritatively his keen hard face his steely eyes bespoke the iron will and purpose of the man  mordaunt rose with cold dignity if he had been a dupe he was one no longer as could be plainly read on his calm pale face the old listlessness the unsteadiness had vanished he wore a manner of extreme quietude but his eyes were like balls of blazing blue steel  mr brandt i seem to have done you a service and am no longer required he said in a courteous tone  brandt eyed his man but judged him wrongly an english gentleman was new to the borderoutlaw  i swore the girl should be mine he hissed  doomed men cannot be choosers cried helen who had heard him her dark eyes burned with scorn and hatred  all the party heard her passionate outburst case arose as if unconcernedly and stood by the side of his master legget and the other two outlaws came up the indians turned their swarthy faces  hah aint she sassy cried legget  brandt looked at helen understood the meaning of her words and laughed but his face paled and involuntarily his shifty glance sought the rocks and trees upon the ridge  you played me from the first asked mordaunt quietly  i did replied brandt  you meant nothing of your promise to help me across the border  no  you intended to let me shift for myself out here in this wilderness  yes after this indian guides you to the rivertrail said brandt indicating with his finger the nearest savage  i get what you frontier men call the doublecross  thats it replied brandt with a hard laugh in which legget joined  a short pause ensued  what will you do with the girl  thats my affair  marry her mordaunts voice was low and quiet  no cried brandt she flaunted my love in my face scorned me she saw that borderman strike me and by god ill get even ill keep her here in the woods until im tired of her and when her beauty fades ill turn her over to legget  scarcely had the words dropped from his vile lips when mordaunt moved with tigerish agility he seized a knife from the belt of one of the indians  die he screamed  brandt grasped his tomahawk at the same instant the man who had acted as mordaunts guide grasped the englishman from behind  brandt struck ineffectually at the struggling man  fair play roared case leaping at mordaunts second assailant his long knife sheathed its glittering length in the mans breast without even a groan he dropped clear the decks case yelled sweeping round in a circle all fell back before that whirling knife  several of the indians started as if to raise their rifles but leggets stern command caused them to desist  the englishman and the outlaw now engaged in a fearful encounter the practiced rugged frontier desperado apparently had found his match in this palefaced slender man his border skill with the hatchet seemed offset by mordaunts terrible rage brandt whirled and swung the weapon as he leaped around his antagonist with his left arm the englishman sought only to protect his head while with his right he brandished the knife whirling here and there they struggled across the cleared space plunging out of sight among the willows during a moment there was a sound as of breaking branches then a dull blow horrible to hear followed by a low moan and then deep silence     chapter xviii  a black weight was seemingly lifted from helens weary eyelids the sun shone the golden forest surrounded her the brook babbled merrily but where were the struggling panting men she noticed presently when her vision had grown more clear that the scene differed entirely from the willowglade where she had closed her eyes upon the fight then came the knowledge that she had fainted and during the time of unconsciousness been moved  she lay upon a mossy mound a few feet higher than a swiftly running brook a magnificent chestnut tree spread its leafy branches above her directly opposite about an hundred feet away loomed a gray ragged mossstained cliff she noted this particularly because the dense forest encroaching to its very edge excited her admiration such wonderful coloring seemed unreal dead gold and bright red foliage flamed everywhere  two indians stood near by silent immovable no other of leggets band was visible helen watched the red men  sinewy muscular warriors they were with bodies partially painted and long straight hair black as burnt wood interwoven with bits of white bone and plaited around waving eagle plumes at first glance their dark faces and dark eyes were expressive of craft cunning cruelty courage all attributes of the savage  yet wild as these savages appeared helen did not fear them as she did the outlaws brandts eyes and leggets too when turned on her emitted a flame that seemed to scorch and shrivel her soul when the savages met her gaze which was but seldom she imagined she saw intelligence even pity in their dusky eyes certain it was she did not shrink from them as from brandt  suddenly with a sensation of relief and joy she remembered mordaunts terrible onslaught upon brandt although she could not recollect the termination of that furious struggle she did recall brandts scream of mortal agony and the death of the other at cases hands this meant whether brandt was dead or not that the fighting strength of her captors had been diminished surely as the sun had risen that morning helen believed jonathan and wetzel lurked on the trail of these renegades she prayed that her courage hope strength might be continued  ugh exclaimed one of the savages pointing across the open space a slight swaying of the bushes told that some living thing was moving among them and an instant later the huge frame of the leader came into view the other outlaw and case followed closely farther down the margin of the thicket the indians appeared but without the slightest noise or disturbance of the shrubbery  it required but a glance to show helen that case was in high spirits his repulsive face glowed with satisfaction he carried a bundle which helen saw with a sickening sense of horror was made up of mordaunts clothing brandt had killed the englishman legget also had a package under his arm which he threw down when he reached the chestnut tree to draw from his pocket a long leather belt such as travelers use for the carrying of valuables it was evidently heavy and the musical clink which accompanied his motion proclaimed the contents to be gold  brandt appeared next he was white and held his hand to his breast there were dark stains on his hunting coat which he removed to expose a shirt blotched with red  you aint much hurt i reckon inquired legget solicitously  no but im bleeding bad replied brandt coolly he then called an indian and went among the willows skirting the stream  so im to be in this border crew asked case looking up at legget  sure replied the big outlaw youre a handy fellar case an after i break you into border ways you will fit in here tiptop now youd better stick by me when eb zane his brother jack an wetzel find out this here days work hell will be a cool place compared with their whereabouts youll be safe with me an this is the only place on the border i reckon where you can say your life is your own  im yer mate capn ive sailed with soldiers pirates sailors an i guess i can navigate this borderland do we mess here you didnt come far  wal i aint pertikuler but i dont like eatin with buzzards said legget with a grin thets why we moved a bit  whats buzzards  ho ho mebbe youll hev em closern youd like some day if youd only know it buzzards are fine birds most particular birds as wont eat nothin but flesh an white man or injun is pie fer em  capn ive seed birds as wouldnt wait till a man was dead said case  haw haw you cant come no sailor yarns on this fellar wal now weve got ther englishmans gold one or tother of us might jest as well hev it all  right yer are capn dice cards anyways so long as i knows the game  here jenks hand over yer clickers an bring us a flat stone said legget sitting on the moss and emptying the belt in front of him case took a small bag from the dark blue jacket that had so lately covered mordaunts shoulders and poured out its bright contents  this coat aint worth keepin he said holding it up the garment was rent and slashed and under the left sleeve was a small bloodstained hole where one of brandts blows had fallen hullo whats this muttered the sailor feeling in the pocket of the jacket blast my timbers hooray  he held up a small silvermounted whiskey flask unscrewed the lid and lifted the vessel to his mouth  im kinder thirsty myself suggested legget  capn a nip an no more case replied holding the flask to leggets lips  the outlaw called jenks now returned with a flat stone which he placed between the two men the indians gathered around with greedy eyes they bent their heads over the gamblers and watched every movement with breathless interest at each click of the dice or clink of gold they uttered deep exclamations  lucks again ye capn said case skilfully shaking the ivory cubes  haint i got eyes growled the outlaw  steadily his pile of gold diminished and darker grew his face  capn im a bad wind to draw case rejoined drinking again from the flask his naturally red face had become livid his skin moist and his eyes wild with excitement  hullo if them dice wasnt jenkss an i hadnt played afore with him id swear theys loaded  you aint insinuatin nothin capn inquired case softly hesitating with the dice in his hands his evil eyes glinting at legget  no youre fair enough growled the leader its my tough luck  the game progressed with infrequent runs of fortune for the outlaw and presently every piece of gold lay in a shining heap before the sailor  clean busted exclaimed legget in disgust  cant you find nothin more asked case  the outlaws bold eyes wandered here and there until they rested upon the prisoner  ill play ther lass against yer pile of gold he growled best two throws out en three see here shes as much mine as brandts  make it half my pile an ill go you  nary time bet or give me back what yer win replied legget gruffly  shes a trim little craft no mistake said case critically surveying helen all right capn ive sportin blood an ill bet yer throw first  legget won the first cast and case the second with deliberation the outlaw shook the dice in his huge fist and rattled them out upon the stone hah he cried in delight he had come within one of the highest score possible case nonchalantly flipped the little white blocks the indians crowded forward their dusky eyes shining  legget swore in a terrible voice which reechoed from the stony cliff the sailor was victorious the outlaw got up kicked the stone and dice in the brook and walked away from the group he strode to and fro under one of the trees gruffly he gave an order to the indians several of them began at once to kindle a fire presently he called jenks who was fishing the dice out of the brook and began to converse earnestly with him making fierce gestures and casting lowering glances at the sailor  case was too drunk now to see that he had incurred the enmity of the outlaw leader he drank the last of the rum and tossed the silver flask to an indian who received the present with every show of delight  case then with the slow uncertain movements of a man whose mind is befogged began to count his gold but only to gather up a few pieces when they slipped out of his trembling hands to roll on the moss laboriously seriously he kept at it with the doggedness of a drunken man apparently he had forgotten the others failing to learn the value of the coins by taking up each in turn he arranged them in several piles and began to estimate his wealth in sections  in the meanwhile helen who had not failed to take in the slightest detail of what was going on saw that a plot was hatching which boded ill to the sailor moreover she heard legget and jenks whispering  i kin take him from right here atwixt his eyes said jenks softly and tapped his rifle significantly  wal go ahead only i ruther hev it done quieter answered legget were yet a long ways near thirty miles from my camp an theres no tellin whos in ther woods but weve got ter git rid of ther fresh sailor an theres no surer way  cautiously cocking his rifle jenks deliberately raised it to his shoulder one of the indian sentinels who stood near at hand sprang forward and struck up the weapon he spoke a single word to legget pointed to the woods above the cliff and then resumed his statuelike attitude  i told yer jenks that it wouldnt do the redskin scents somethin in the woods an thers an injun i never seed fooled we mustnt make a noise take yer knife an tomahawk crawl down below the edge o the bank an slip up on him ill give half ther gold fer ther job  jenks buckled his belt more tightly gave one threatening glance at the sailor and slipped over the bank the bed of the brook lay about six feet below the level of the ground this afforded an opportunity for the outlaw to get behind case without being observed a moment passed jenks disappeared round a bend of the stream presently his grizzled head appeared above the bank he was immediately behind the sailor but still some thirty feet away this ground must be covered quickly and noiselessly the outlaw began to crawl in his right hand he grasped a tomahawk and between his teeth was a long knife he looked like a huge yellow bear  the savages with the exception of the sentinel who seemed absorbed in the dense thicket on the cliff sat with their knees between their hands watching the impending tragedy  nothing but the merest chance or some extraordinary intervention could avert cases doom he was gloating over his gold the creeping outlaw made no more noise than a snake nearer and nearer he came his sweaty face shining in the sun his eyes tigerish his long body slipping silently over the grass at length he was within five feet of the sailor his knotty hands were dug into the sward as he gathered energy for a sudden spring  at that very moment case with his hand on his knife rose quickly and turned round  the outlaw discovered in the act of leaping had no alternative and spring he did like a panther  the little sailor stepped out of line with remarkable quickness and as the yellow body whirled past him his knife flashed bluebright in the sunshine  jenks fell forward his knife buried in the grass beneath him and his outstretched hand still holding the tomahawk  tryin ter doublecross me fer my gold muttered the sailor sheathing his weapon he never looked to see whether or no his blow had been fatal these border fellars might think a man as sails the seas cant handle a knife he calmly began gathering up his gold evidently indifferent to further attack  helen saw legget raise his own rifle but only to have it struck aside as had jenkss this time the savage whispered earnestly to legget who called the other indians around him the sentinels low throaty tones mingled with the soft babbling of the stream no sooner had he ceased speaking than the effect of his words showed how serious had been the information warning or advice the indians cast furtive glances toward the woods two of them melted like shadows into the red and gold thicket another stealthily slipped from tree to tree until he reached the open ground then dropped into the grass and was seen no more until his dark body rose under the cliff he stole along the greenstained wall climbed a rugged corner and vanished amid the dense foliage  helen felt that she was almost past discernment or thought the events of the day succeeding one another so swiftly and fraught with panic had despite her hope and fortitude reduced her to a helpless condition of piteous fear she understood that the savages scented danger or had in their mysterious way received intelligence such as rendered them wary and watchful  come on now an make no noise said legget to case bring the girl an see that she steps light  ay ay capn replied the sailor wheres brandt  hell be comin soons his cut stops bleedin i reckon hes weak yet  case gathered up his goods and tucking it under his arm grasped helens arm she was leaning against the tree and when he pulled her she wrenched herself free rising with difficulty his disgusting touch and revolting face had revived her sensibilities  yer kin begin duty by carryin thet said case thrusting the package into helens arms she let it drop without moving a hand  im runnin this ship yer belong to me hissed case and then he struck her on the head helen uttered a low cry of distress and half staggered against the tree the sailor picked up the package this time she took it trembling with horror  thets right now give ther capn a kiss he leered and jostled against her  helen pushed him violently with agonized eyes she appealed to the indians they were engaged tying up their packs legget looked on with a lazy grin  oh oh breathed helen as case seized her again she tried to scream but could not make a sound the evil eyes the beastly face transfixed her with terror  case struck her twice then roughly pulled her toward him  halffainting unable to move helen gazed at the heated bloated face approaching hers  when his coarse lips were within a few inches of her lips something hot hissed across her brow following so closely as to be an accompaniment rang out with singular clearness the sharp crack of a rifle  cases face changed the hot surging flush faded the expression became shaded dulled into vacant emptiness his eyes rolled wildly then remained fixed with a look of dark surprise he stood upright an instant swayed with the regular poise of a falling oak and then plunged backward to the ground his face ghastly and livid took on the awful calm of death  a very small hole reddishblue round the edges dotted the center of his temple  legget stared aghast at the dead sailor then he possessed himself of the bag of gold  saved me ther trouble he muttered giving case a kick  the indians glanced at the little figure then out into the flaming thickets each savage sprang behind a tree with incredible quickness legget saw this and grasping helen he quickly led her within cover of the chestnut  brandt appeared with his indian companion and both leaped to shelter behind a clump of birches near where legget stood brandts hawk eyes flashed upon the dead jenks and case without asking a question he seemed to take in the situation he stepped over and grasped helen by the arm  who killed case he asked in a whisper staring at the little blue hole in the sailors temple  no one answered  the two indians who had gone into the woods to the right of the stream now returned hardly were they under the trees with their party when the savage who had gone off alone arose out of the grass in the left of the brook took it with a flying leap and darted into their midst he was the sentinel who had knocked up the weapons thereby saving cases life twice he was lithe and supple but not young his grave shadowylined iron visage showed the traces of time and experience all gazed at him as at one whose wisdom was greater than theirs  old horse said brandt in english havent i seen bullet holes like this  the chippewa bent over case and then slowly straightened his tall form  deathwind he replied answering in the white mans language  his indian companions uttered low plaintive murmurs not signifying fear so much as respect  brandt turned as pale as the clean birchbark on the tree near him the gray flare of his eyes gave out a terrible light of certainty and terror  legget you neednt try to hide your trail he hissed and it seemed as if there was a bitter reckless pleasure in these words  then the chippewa glided into the low bushes bordering the creek legget followed him with brandt leading helen and the other indians brought up the rear each one sending wild savage glances into the dark surrounding forest     chapter xix  a dense white fog rose from the river obscuring all objects when the bordermen rolled out of their snug bed of leaves the air was cool and bracing faintly fragrant with dying foliage and the damp dewy luxuriance of the ripened season wetzel pulled from under the protecting ledge a bundle of bark and sticks he had put there to keep dry and built a fire while jonathan fashioned a cup from a green fruit resembling a gourd filling it at a spring near by  lew theres a frosty nip in the water this mornin said jonathan  i reckon its gettin along into fall now any clear still nightll fetch all the leaves an strip the trees bare as burned timber answered wetzel brushing the ashes off the strip of meat he had roasted get a stick an help me cook the rest of this chunk of bison the sunll be an hour breakin up thet mist an we cant clear out till then mebbe we wont have no chance to light another fire soon  with these bordermen everything pertaining to their lonely lives from the lighting of a fire to the trailing of a redskin was singularly serious no gladsome song ever came from their lips there was no jollity around their campfire hunters had their moments of rapturous delight bordermen knew the peace the content of the wilderness but their pursuits racked nerve and heart wetzel had his moments of frenzied joy but they passed with the echo of his vengeful yell jonathans happiness such as it was had been to roam the forests that before a womans eyes had dispelled it had been enough and compensated him for the gloomy bloody phantoms which haunted him  the bordermen having partaken of the frugal breakfast stowed in their spacious pockets all the meat that was left and were ready for the days march they sat silent for a time waiting for the mist to lift it broke in places rolled in huge billows sailed aloft like great white clouds and again hung tenaciously to the river and the plain away in the west blue patches of sky shone through the rifts and eastward banks of misty vapor reddened beneath the rising sun suddenly from beneath the silver edge of the rising pall the sun burst gleaming gold disclosing the winding valley with its steaming river  well make up stream fer two islands an cross there if so be weve reason wetzel had said  through the dewy dells avoiding the wet grass and bushes along the dark damp glades with their yellow carpets under the thinning arches of the trees down the gentle slopes of the ridges rich with green moss the bordermen glided like gray shadows the forest was yet asleep a squirrel frisked up an oak and barked quarrelsomely at these strange noiseless visitors a crow cawed from somewhere overhead these were the only sounds disturbing the quiet early hour  as the bordermen advanced the woods lightened and awoke to life and joy birds sang trilled warbled or whistled their plaintive songs peculiar to the dying season and in harmony with the glory of the earth birds that in earlier seasons would have screeched and fought now sang and fluttered side by side in fraternal parade on their slow pilgrimage to the far south  bad time fer us when the birds are so tame an chipper we cant put faith in them these days said wetzel seems like they never was wild i can tell cept at this season by the way they whistle an act in the woods if theres been any injuns along the trails  the greater part of the morning passed thus with the bordermen steadily traversing the forest here through a spare and gloomy wood blasted by fire worn by age with many a dethroned monarch of bygone times rotting to punk and duff under the ferns with many a dark seamed and ragged king still standing but gray and bald of head and almost ready to take his place in the forest of the past there through a maze of young saplings where each ash maple hickory and oak added some new and beautiful hue to the riot of color  i just had a glimpse of the lower island as we passed an opening in the thicket said jonathan  we aint far away replied wetzel  the bordermen walked less rapidly in order to proceed with more watchfulness every rod or two they stopped to listen  you think leggets across the river asked jonathan  he was two days back an had his gang with him hes up to some bad work but i cant make out what one thing i never seen his trail so near fort henry  they emerged at length into a more open forest which skirted the river at a point still some distance ahead but plainly in sight two small islands rose out of the water  hist whats that whispered wetzel slipping his hand in jonathans arm  a hundred yards beyond lay a long dark figure stretched at full length under one of the trees close to the bank  looks like a man said jonathan  youve hit the mark take a good peep roun now jack fer were comin somewhere near the trail we want  minutes passed while the patient bordermen searched the forest with their eyes seeking out every tree within rifle range or surveyed the level glades scrutinized the hollows and bent piercing eyes upon the patches of ferns  if theres a redskin around he aint big enough to hold a gun said wetzel moving forward again yet still with that same stealthy step and keen caution  finally they were gazing down upon the object which had attracted wetzels attention  will sheppard cried jonathan is he dead whats this mean  wetzel leaned over the prostrate lad and then quickly turned to his companion  get some water take his cap no he aint even hurt bad unless hes got some wound as dont show  jonathan returned with the water and wetzel bathed the bloody face when the gash on wills forehead was clean it told the bordermen much  not an hour old that blow muttered wetzel  hes comin to said jonathan as will stirred uneasily and moaned presently the lad opened his eyes and sat bolt upright he looked bewildered for a moment and felt of his head while gazing vaguely at the bordermen suddenly he cried  i remember we were captured brought here and i was struck down by that villain case  we who was with you asked jonathan slowly  helen we came after flowers and leaves while in full sight of the fort i saw an indian we hurried back he cried and proceeded with broken panting voice to tell his story  jonathan zane leaped to his feet with face deathly white and eyes blueblack like burning stars  jack study the trail while i get the lad acrost the river an steered fer home said wetzel and then he asked will if he could swim  yes but you will find a canoe there in those willows  come lad weve no time to spare added wetzel sliding down the bank and entering the willows he came out almost immediately with the canoe which he launched  will turned that he might make a parting appeal to jonathan to save helen but could not speak the expression on the bordermans face frightened him  motionless and erect jonathan stood his arms folded and his white stern face distorted with the agony of remorse fear and anguish which even as will gazed froze into an awful deadly look of fateful purpose  wetzel pushed the canoe off and paddled with powerful strokes he left will on the opposite bank and returned as swiftly as he could propel the light craft  the bordermen met each others glance and had little need of words wetzels great shoulders began to sag slightly and his head lowered as his eyes sought the grass a dark and gloomy shade overcast his features thus he passed from borderman to deathwind the sough of the wind overhead among the almost naked branches might well have warned indians and renegades that deathwind was on the trail  brandts had a hand in this an the englishmans a fool said wetzel  an hour ahead can we come up with them before they join brandt an legget  we can try but like as not well fail leggets gang is thirteen strong by now i said it somethin told mea hard trail a long trail an our last trail  its over thirty miles to leggets camp we know the woods an every stream an every cover hissed jonathan zane  with no further words wetzel took the trail on the run and so plain was it to his keen eyes that he did not relax his steady lope except to stop and listen at regular intervals jonathan followed with easy swing through forest and meadow over hill and valley they ran fleet and tireless once with unerring instinct they abruptly left the broad trail and cut far across a wide and rugged ridge to come again upon the tracks of the marching band then in open country they reduced their speed to a walk ahead in a narrow valley rose a thicket of willows yellow in the sunlight and impenetrable to human vision like huge snakes the bordermen crept into this copse over the sand under the low branches hard on the trail finally in a light open space where the sun shone through a network of yellow branches and foliage wetzels hand was laid upon jonathans shoulder  listen hear that he whispered  jonathan heard the flapping of wings and a low hissing sound not unlike that made by a goose  buzzards he said with a dark grim smile mebbe brandt has begun our work come  out into the open they crawled to put to flight a flock of huge black birds with grisly naked necks hooked beaks and long yellow claws upon the green grass lay three halfnaked men ghastly bloody in terribly limp and lifeless positions  metzars man smith jenks the outlaw and mordaunt  jonathan zane gazed darkly into the steely sightless eyes of the traitor deaths awful calm had set the expression but the mans whole life was there its better part sadly shining forth among the cruel shadows  his body was mutilated in a frightful manner cuts stabs and slashes told the tale of a long encounter brought to an end by one clean stroke  come here lew youve seen men chopped up but look at this dead englishman called zane  mordaunt lay weltering in a crimson tide strangely though his face was uninjured a black bruise showed under his fair hair the ghost of a smile seemed to hover around his set lips yet almost intangible though it was it showed that at last he had died a man his left shoulder side and arm showed where the brunt of brandts attack had fallen  howd he ever fight so mused jonathan  you never can tell replied wetzel mebbe he killed this other fellar too but i reckon not come we must go slow now fer legget is near at hand  jonathan brought huge flat stones from the brook and laid them over mordaunt then cautiously he left the glade on wetzels trail  five hundred yards farther on wetzel had ceased following the outlaws tracks to cross the creek and climb a ridge he was beginning his favorite trick of making a wide detour jonathan hurried forward feeling he was safe from observation soon he distinguished the tall brown figure of his comrade gliding ahead from tree to tree from bush to bush  see them maples an chestnuts down thar said wetzel when jonathan had come up pointing through an opening in the foliage theyve stopped fer some reason  on through the forest the bordermen glided they kept near the summit of the ridge under the best cover they could find and passed swiftly over this halfcircle when beginning once more to draw toward the open grove in the valley they saw a long irregular cliff densely wooded they swerved a little and made for this excellent covert  they crawled the last hundred yards and never shook a fern moved a leaf or broke a twig having reached the brink of the low precipice they saw the grassy meadow below the straggling trees the brook the group of indians crowding round the white men  see that point of rock thar its better cover whispered wetzel  patiently with no hurry or excitement they slowly made their difficult way among the rocks and ferns to the vantage point desired taking a position like this was one the bordermen strongly favored they could see everywhere in front and had the thick woods at their backs  what are they up to whispered jonathan as he and wetzel lay close together under a mass of grapevine still tenacious of its broad leaves  dicin answered wetzel i can see em throw anyways nothin but bettin ever makes redskins act like that  whos playin wheres brandt  i can make out legget see his shaggy head the other must be case brandt aint in sight nursin a hurt perhaps ah see thar over under the big tree as stands darklike agin the thicket thets an injun an he looks too quiet an keen to suit me well have a care of him  must

hes seen us down along ther ridge theres helen sittin behind the biggest tree thet injun guard afore he moved kept us from seein her  jonathan made no answer to this but his breath literally hissed through his clenched teeth  thar goes the other outlaw whispered wetzel as if his comrade could not see its all up with case see the sneak bendin down the bank now thets a poor way itd better be done from the front walkin up naturallike instead of tryin to cover thet wide stretch casell see him or hear him sure thar hes up now an crawlin hes too slow too slow aha i knew itcase turns look at the outlaw spring well did you see thet little cuss whip his knife one more less fer us to quiet thet makes four jack an mebbe soon itll be five  theyre holdin a council said jonathan  i see two injuns

jonathan  shshh whispered wetzel  see hes pulled her to her feet oh he struck her oh  jonathan leveled his rifle and would have fired but for the iron grasp on his wrist  hev you lost yer senses its full two hundred paces an too far fer your piece said wetzel in a whisper an it aint sense to try from here  lend me your gun lend me your gun  silently wetzel handed him the long black rifle  jonathan raised it but trembled so violently that the barrel wavered like a leaf in the breeze  take it i cant cover him groaned jonathan this is new to me i aint myself god lew he struck her again again hes tryin to kiss her wetzel if youre my friend kill him  jack itd be better to wait an  i love her breathed jonathan  the long black barrel swept up to a level and stopped white smoke belched from among the green leaves the report rang throughout the forest  ah i saw him stop an pause hissed jonathan he stands he sways he falls death for yours you sailorbeast     chapter xx  the bordermen watched legget and his band disappear into the thicket adjoining the grove when the last dark lithe form glided out of sight among the yellowing copse jonathan leaped from the low cliff and had hardly reached the ground before wetzel dashed down to the grassy turf  again they followed the outlaws trail darkerfaced fiercervisaged than ever with cocked tightlygripped rifles thrust well before them and light feet that scarcely brushed the leaves  wetzel halted after a long tramp up and down the ridges and surveyed with keen intent the lay of the land ahead  sooner or later well hear from that redskin as discovered us a ways back whispered he i wish we might get a crack at him afore he hinders us bad i aint seen many keener injuns its lucky we fixed ther arrowshootin shawnee wed never hev beat thet combination an fer all of thet im worrin some about the goin ahead  ambush jonathan asked  like as not leggetll send thet injun back an mebbe moren him jack see them little footprints theyre helens look how shes draggin along almost tuckered out legget cant travel many more miles today hell make a stand somewheres an lose all his redskins afore he gives up the lass  ill never live through tonight with her in that gang shell be saved or dead before the stars pale in the light of the moon  i reckon were nigh the end for some of us itll be moonlight an hour arter dusk an now its only the middle of the arternoon weve time enough fer anythin now jack lets not tackle the trail straight well split an go round to head em off see thet dead white oak standin high over thar  jonathan looked out between the spreading branches of a beech and saw far over a low meadow luxuriant with grasses and rushes and bright with sparkling ponds and streams a dense wood out of which towered a bare bleached treetop  you slip around along the right side of this meader an ill take the left side go slow an hev yer eyes open well meet under thet big dead tree i allow we can see it from anywhere around well leave the trail here an take it up farther on leggets goin straight for his camp he aint losin an inch he wants to get in that rocky hole of hisn  wetzel stepped off the trail glided into the woods and vanished  jonathan turned to the right traversed the summit of the ridge softly traveled down its slope and after crossing a slow eddying quiet stream gained the edge of the forest on that side of the swamp a fringe of briars and prickly thorns bordered this wood affording an excellent cover on the right the land rose rather abruptly he saw that by walking up a few paces he could command a view of the entire swamp as well as the ridge beyond which contained wetzel and probably the outlaw and his band  remembering his comrades admonition jonathan curbed his unusual impatience and moved slowly the wind swayed the treetops and rustled the fallen leaves birds sang as if thinking the warm soft weather was summer come again squirrels dropped heavy nuts that cracked on the limbs or fell with a thud to the ground and they scampered over the dry earth scratching up the leaves as they barked and scolded crows cawed clamorously after a hawk that had darted under the treetops to escape them deer loped swiftly up the hill and a lordly elk rose from a wallow in the grassy swamp crashing into the thicket  when twothirds around this oval plain which was a mile long and perhaps onefourth as wide jonathan ascended the hill to make a survey the grass waved bright brown and golden in the sunshine swished in the wind and swept like a choppy sea to the opposite ridge the hill was not densely wooded in many places the redbrown foliage opened upon irregular patches some black as if having been burned over others showing the yellow and purple colors of the low thickets and the gray barren stones  suddenly jonathan saw something darken one of these sunlit plots it might have been a deer he studied the rolling rounded treetops the narrow strips between the black trunks and the open places that were clear in the sunshine he had nearly come to believe he had seen a small animal or bird flit across the white of the sky far in the background when he distinctly saw dark figures stealing along past a greengray rock only to disappear under colored banks of foliage presently lower down they reappeared and crossed an open patch of yellow fern jonathan counted them two were rather yellow in color the hue of buckskin another slight of stature as compared with the first and light gray by contrast then six black slender gliding forms crossed the space jonathan then lost sight of them and did not get another glimpse he knew them to be legget and his band the slight figure was helen  jonathan broke into a run completed the circle around the swamp and slowed into a walk when approaching the big dead tree where he was to wait for wetzel  several rods beyond the lowland he came to a wood of white oaks all giants rugged and old with scarcely a sapling intermingled with them although he could not see the objective point he knew from his accurate sense of distance that he was near it as he entered the wood he swept its whole length and width with his eyes he darted forward twenty paces to halt suddenly behind a tree he knew full well that a sharply moving object was more difficult to see in the woods than one stationary again he ran fleet and light a few paces ahead to take up a position as before behind a tree thus he traversed the forest on the other side he found the dead oak of which wetzel had spoken  its trunk was hollow jonathan squeezed himself into the blackened space with his head in a favorable position behind a projecting knot where he could see what might occur near at hand  he waited for what seemed to him a long while during which he neither saw nor heard anything and then suddenly the report of a rifle rang out a single piercing scream followed hardly had the echo ceased when three hollow reports distinctly different in tone from the first could be heard from the same direction in quick succession short fierce yells attended rather than succeeded the reports  jonathan stepped out of the hidingplace cocked his rifle and fixed a sharp eye on the ridge before him whence those startling cries had come the first rifleshot unlike any other in its short spiteful stinging quality was unmistakably wetzels zane had heard it followed many times as now by the wild deathcry of a savage the other reports were of indian guns and the yells were the clamoring exultant cries of indians in pursuit  far down where the open forest met the gloom of the thickets a brown figure flashed across the yellow ground darting among the trees across the glades it moved so swiftly that jonathan knew it was wetzel in another instant a chorus of yelps resounded from the foliage and three savages burst through the thicket almost at right angles with the fleeing borderman running to intercept him the borderman did not swerve from his course but came on straight toward the dead tree with the wonderful fleetness that so often had served him well  even in that moment jonathan thought of what desperate chances his comrade had taken the trick was plain wetzel had most likely shot the dangerous scout and taking to his heels raced past the others trusting to his speed and their poor marksmanship to escape with a whole skin  when within a hundred yards of the oak wetzels strength apparently gave out his speed deserted him he ran awkwardly and limped the savages burst out into full cry like a pack of hungry wolves they had already emptied their rifles at him and now supposing one of the shots had taken effect redoubled their efforts making the forest ring with their short savage yells one gaunt darkbodied indian with a long powerful springy stride easily distanced his companions and evidently sure of gaining the coveted scalp of the borderman rapidly closed the gap between them as he swung aloft his tomahawk yelling the warcry  the sight on jonathans rifle had several times covered this savages dark face but when he was about to press the trigger wetzels fleeting form also in line with the savage made it extremely hazardous to take a shot  jonathan stepped from his place of concealment and let out a yell that pealed high over the cries of the savages  wetzel suddenly dropped flat on the ground  with a whipping crack of jonathans rifle the big indian plunged forward on his face  the other indians not fifty yards away stopped aghast at the fate of their comrade and were about to seek the shelter of trees when with his terrible yell wetzel sprang up and charged upon them he had left his rifle where he fell but his tomahawk glittered as he ran the lameness had been a trick for now he covered ground with a swiftness which caused his former progress to seem slow  the indians matured and seasoned warriors though they were gave but one glance at this huge brown figure bearing down upon them like a fiend and uttering the indian name of deathwind wavered broke and ran  one not so fleet as his companion wetzel overtook and cut down with a single stroke the other gained an hundredyard start in the slight interval of wetzels attack and spurred on by a pealing awful cry in the rear sped swiftly in and out among the trees until he was lost to view  wetzel scalped the two dead savages and after returning to regain his rifle joined jonathan at the dead oak  jack you can never tell how things is comin out thet redskin i allowed might worry us a bit fooled me as slick as you ever saw an i hed to shoot him knowin it was a case of runnin i just cut fer this oak drew the redskins fire an hed em arter me quicker n youd say jack robinson i was hopin youd be here but wasnt sure till id seen your rifle then i kinder got a kink in my leg jest to coax the brutes on  three more quiet said jonathan zane what now  weve headed legget an well keep nosin him off his course already hes lookin fer a safe campin place for the night  there is none in these woods fer him  we didnt plan this gettin between him an his camp but couldnt be better fixed a mile farther along the ridge is a campin place with a spring in a little dell close under a big stone an well wooded leggets headin straight fer it with a couple of injuns guardin thet spot hell think hes safe but i know the place an can crawl to thet rock the darkest night thet ever was an never crack a stick                                       in the gray of the deepening twilight jonathan zane sat alone an owl hooted dismally in the dark woods beyond the thicket where the borderman crouched waiting for wetzel his listening ear detected a soft rustling sound like the play of a mole under the leaves a branch trembled and swung back a soft footstep followed and wetzel came into the retreat  well asked jonathan impatiently as wetzel deliberately sat down and laid his rifle across his knees  easy jack easy weve an hour to wait  the time ive already waited has been long for me  theyre thar said wetzel grimly  how far from here  a halfhours slow crawl  close by hissed jonathan  too near fer you to get excited  let us go its as light now as in the gray of mornin  mornin would be best injuns get sleepy along towards day ive ever found thet time the best but well be lucky if we ketch these redskins asleep  lew i cant wait here all night i wont leave her longer with that renegade ive got to free or kill her  most likely itll be the last said wetzel simply  well so be it then and the borderman hung his head  you neednt worry none bout helen i jest had a good look at her not half an hour back shes fagged out but full of spunk yet i seen thet when brandt went near her leggets got his hands full jest now with the redskins hes hevin trouble keepin them on this slow trail i aint sayin theyre skeered but theyre mighty restless  will you take the chance now  i reckon you neednt hev asked thet  tell me the lay of the land  wai if we get to this rock i spoke bout well be right over em its ten feet high an we can jump straight amongst em most likely two or threell be guardin the openin which is a little ways to the right thers a big tree the only one low down by the spring helens under it halfsittin halfleanin against the roots when i first looked her hands were free but i saw brandt bind her feet an he had to get an injun to help him fer she kicked like a spirited little filly theres moss under the tree an theres where the redskinsll lay down to rest  ive got that now out with your plan  wal i calkilate its this the moonll be up in about an hour well crawl as weve never crawled afore because helens life depends as much on our not makin a noise as it does on fightin when the time comes if they hear us afore were ready to shoot the lassll be tomahawked quickern lightnin if they dont suspicion us when the right moment comes you shoot brandt yell loudern you ever did afore leap amongst em an cut down the first injun thets near you on your way to helen swing her over your arm an dig into the woods  well asked jonathan when wetzel finished  thats all the borderman replied grimly  an leave you all alone to fight legget an the rest of em  i reckon  not to be thought of  thers no other way  there must be let me think i cant im not myself  no other way repeated wetzel curtly  jonathans broad hand fastened on wetzels shoulder and wheeled him around  have i ever left you alone  thiss different and wetzel turned away again his voice was cold and hard  how is it different weve had the same thing to do almost more than once  weve never had as bad a bunch to handle as leggets theyre lookin fer us an will be hard to beat  thats no reason  we never had to save a girl one of us loved  jonathan was silent  i said thisd be my last trail continued wetzel i felt it an i know itll be yours  why  if you get away with the girl shell keep you at home an itll be well if you dont succeed youll die tryin so its sure your last trail  wetzels deep cold voice rang with truth  lew i cant run away an leave you to fight those devils alone after all these years weve been together i cant  no other chance to save the lass  jonathan quivered with the force of his emotion his black eyes glittered his hands grasped at nothing once more he was between love and duty again he fought over the old battle but this time it left him weak  you love the bigeyed lass dont you asked wetzel turning with softened face and voice  i have gone mad cried jonathan tortured by the simple question of his friend those big dear wonderful eyes he loved so well looked at him now from the gloom of the thicket the old beautiful soft glow the tender light was there and more a beseeching prayer to save her  jonathan bowed his head ashamed to let his friend see the tears that dimmed his eyes  jack weve follered the trail fer years together always youve been true an staunch this is our last but whatever bides well break up leggets band tonight an the borderll be cleared mebbe for always at least his race is run let thet content you our timed have to come sooner or later so why not now i know how it is that you want to stick by me but the lass draws you to her i understand an want you to save her mebbe you never dreamed it but i can tell jest how you feel all the tremblin an softness an sweetness an delight youve got for thet girl is no mystery to lew wetzel  you loved a lass  wetzel bowed his head as perhaps he had never before in all his life  bettyalways he answered softly  my sister exclaimed jonathan and then his hand closed hard on his comrades his mind going back to many things strange in the past but now explained wetzel had revealed his secret  an its been all my life since she wasnt higher n my knee there was a time when i might hev been closer to you than i am now but i was a mad an bloody injun hater so i never let her know till i seen it was too late wal wal no more of me i only told it fer you  jonathan was silent  an now to come back where we left off continued wetzel lets take a more hopeful look at this comin fight sure i said it was my last trail but mebbe its not you can never tell feelin as we do i imagine theyve no odds on us never in my life did i say to you least of all to any one else what i was goin to do but ill tell it now if i land uninjured amongst thet bunch ill kill them all  the giant bordermans low voice hissed and stung his eyes glittered with unearthly fire his face was cold and gray he spread out his brawny arms and clenched his huge fists making the muscles of his broad shoulders roll and bulge  i hate the thought lew i hate the thought aint there no other way  no other way  ill do it lew because id do the same for you because i have to because i love her but god it hurts  thets right answered wetzel his deep voice softening until it was singularly low and rich im glad youve come to it an sure it hurts i want you to feel so at leavin me to go it alone if we both get out alive ill come many times to see you an helen if you live an i dont think of me sometimes think of the trails weve crossed together when the fall comes with its soft cool air an smoky mornins an starry nights when the winds sad among the bare branches an the leaves drop down remember theyre fallin on my grave  twilight darkened into gloom the red tinge in the west changed to opal light through the trees over a dark ridge a rim of silver glinted and moved  the moon had risen the hour was come  the bordermen tightened their belts replaced their leggings tied their hunting coats loosened their hatchets looked to the priming of their rifles and were ready  wetzel walked twenty paces and turned his face was white in the moonlight his dark eyes softened into a look of love as he gripped his comrades outstretched hand  then he dropped flat on the ground carefully saw to the position of his rifle and began to creep jonathan kept close at his heels  slowly but steadily they crawled minute after minute the hazelnut bushes above them had not yet shed their leaves the ground was clean and hard and the course fatefully perfect for their deadly purpose  a slight rustling of their buckskin garments sounded like the rustling of leaves in a faint breeze  the moon came out above the trees and still wetzel advanced softly steadily surely  the owl lonely sentinel of that wood hooted dismally even his night eyes which made the darkness seem clear as day missed those gliding figures even he sure guardian of the wilderness failed the savages  jonathan felt soft moss beneath him he was now in the woods under the trees the thicket had been passed  wetzels moccasin pressed softly against jonathans head the first signal  jonathan crawled forward and slightly raised himself  he was on a rock the trees were thick and gloomy below the little hollow was almost in the wan moonbeams dark figures lay close together two savages paced noiselessly to and fro a slight form rolled in a blanket lay against a tree  jonathan felt his arm gently squeezed  the second signal  slowly he thrust forward his rifle and raised it in unison with wetzels slowly he rose to his feet as if the same muscles guided them both  over his head a twig snapped in the darkness he had not seen a low branch  the indian guards stopped suddenly and became motionless as stone  they had heard but too late  with the blended roar of the rifles both dropped lifeless  almost under the spouting flame and white cloud of smoke jonathan leaped behind wetzel over the bank his yells were mingled with wetzels vengeful cry like leaping shadows the bordermen were upon their foes  an indian sprang up raised a weapon and fell beneath jonathans savage blow to rise no more over his prostrate body the borderman bounded a dark nimble form darted upon the captive he swung high a blade that shone like silver in the moonlight his shrill warcry of death rang out with helens scream of despair even as he swung back her head with one hand in her long hair his arm descended but it fell upon the bordermans body jonathan and the indian rolled upon the moss there was a terrific struggle a whirling blade a dull blow which silenced the yell and the borderman rose alone  he lifted helen as if she were a child leaped the brook and plunged into the thicket  the noise of the fearful conflict he left behind swelled high and hideously on the night air above the shrill cries of the indians and the furious yells of legget rose the mad booming roar of wetzel no rifle cracked but sodden blows the clash of steel the threshing of struggling men told of the dreadful strife  jonathan gained the woods sped through the moonlit glades and far on under light and shadow  the shrill cries ceased only the hoarse yells and the mad roar could be heard gradually these also died away and the forest was still     chapter xxi  next morning when the mist was breaking and rolling away under the warm rays of the indiansummer sun jonathan zane beached his canoe on the steep bank before fort henry a pioneer attracted by the bordermans halloo ran to the bluff and sounded the alarm with shrill whoops among the hurrying brownclad figures that answered this summons was colonel zane  its jack kurnel an hes got her cried one  the doughty colonel gained the bluff to see his brother climbing the bank with a whitefaced girl in his arms  well he asked looking darkly at jonathan nothing kindly or genial was visible in his manner now rather grim and forbidding he seemed thus showing he had the same blood in his veins as the borderman  lend a hand said jonathan as far as i know shes not hurt  they carried helen toward colonel zanes cabin many women of the settlement saw them as they passed and looked gravely at one another but none spoke this return of an abducted girl was by no means a strange event  somebody run for sheppard ordered colonel zane as they entered his cabin  betty who was in the sittingroom sprang up and cried oh eb eb dont say shes  no no betts shes all right wheres my wife ah bess here get to work  the colonel left helen in the tender skilful hands of his wife and sister and followed jonathan into the kitchen  i was just ready for breakfast when i heard some one yell said he come jack eat something  they ate in silence from the sittingroom came excited whispers a joyous cry from betty and a faint voice then heavy hurrying footsteps followed by sheppards words of thanksgiving  wheres wetzel began colonel zane  the borderman shook his head gloomily  where did you leave him  we jumped leggets bunch last night when the moon was about an hour high i reckon about fifteen miles northeast i got away with the lass  ah left lew fighting  the borderman answered the question with bowed head  you got off well not a hurt that i can see and more than lucky to save helen well jack what do you think about lew  im goin back replied jonathan  no no  the door opened to admit mrs zane she looked bright and cheerful hello jack glad youre home helens all right only faint from hunger and overexertion i want something for her to eatwell you men didnt leave much  colonel zane went into the sittingroom sheppard sat beside the couch where helen lay white and wan betty and nell were looking on with their hearts in their eyes silas zane was there and his wife with several women neighbors  betty go fetch jack in here whispered the colonel in his sisters ear drag him if you have to he added fiercely  the young woman left the room to reappear directly with her brother he came in reluctantly  as the sternfaced borderman crossed the threshold a smile beautiful to see dawned in helens eyes  im glad to see youre comin round said jonathan but he spoke dully as if his mind was on other things  shes a little flighty but a nights sleep will cure that cried mrs zane from the kitchen  what do you think interrupted the colonel jacks not satisfied to get back with helen unharmed and a whole skin himself but hes going on the trail again  no jack no no cried betty  whats that i hear asked mrs zane as she came in jacks going out again well all i want to say is that hes as mad as a march hare  jonathan look here said silas seriously cant you stay home now  jack listen whispered betty going close to him not one of us ever expected to see either you or helen again and oh we are so happy do not go away again you are a man you do not know you cannot understand all a woman feels she must sit and wait and hope and pray for the safe return of husband or brother or sweetheart the long days oh the long sleepless nights with the wail of the wind in the pines and the rain on the roof it is maddening do not leave us do not leave me do not leave helen say you will not jack  to these entreaties the borderman remained silent he stood leaning on his rifle a tall dark strangely sad and stern man  helen beg him to stay implored betty  colonel zane took helens hand and stroked it yes he said you ask him lass im sure you can persuade him to stay  helen raised her head is brandt dead she whispered faintly  still the borderman failed to speak but his silence was not an affirmative  you said you loved me she cried wildly you said you loved me yet you didnt kill that monster  the borderman moving quickly like a startled indian went out of the door                                       once more jonathan zane entered the gloomy quiet aisles of the forest with his soft tireless tread hardly stirring the leaves  it was late in the afternoon when he had long left two islands behind and arrived at the scene of mordaunts death satisfied with the distance he had traversed he crawled into a thicket to rest  daybreak found him again on the trail he made a short cut over the ridges and by the time the mist had lifted from the valley he was within stalking distance of the glade he approached this in the familiar slow cautious manner and halted behind the big rock from which he and wetzel had leaped the wood was solemnly quiet no twittering of birds could be heard the only sign of life was a gaunt timberwolf slinking away amid the foliage under the big tree the savage who had been killed as he would have murdered helen lay a crumpled mass where he had fallen two dead indians were in the center of the glade and on the other side were three more bloody lifeless forms wetzel was not there nor legget nor brandt  i reckoned so muttered jonathan as he studied the scene the grass had been trampled the trees barked the bushes crushed aside  jonathan went out of the glade a short distance and circling it began to look for wetzels trail he found it and near the light footprints of his comrade were the great broad moccasin tracks of the outlaw further searching disclosed the fact that brandt must have traveled in line with the others  with the certainty that wetzel had killed three of the indians and in some wonderful manner characteristic of him routed the outlaws of whom he was now in pursuit jonathans smoldering emotion burst forth into full flame love for his old comrade deadly hatred of the outlaws and passionate thirst for their blood rioted in his heart  like a lynx scenting its quarry the borderman started on the trail tireless and unswervable the traces left by the fleeing outlaws and their pursuer were plain to jonathan it was not necessary for him to stop legget and brandt seeking to escape the implacable nemesis were traveling with all possible speed regardless of the broad trail such hurried movements left behind they knew full well it would be difficult to throw this wolf off the scent understood that if any attempt was made to ambush the trail they must cope with woodcraft keener than an indians flying in desperation they hoped to reach the rocky retreat where like foxes in their burrows they believed themselves safe  when the sun sloped low toward the western horizon lengthening jonathans shadow he slackened pace he was entering the rocky rugged country which marked the approach to the distant alleghenies from the top of a ridge he took his bearings deciding that he was within a few miles of leggets hidingplace  at the foot of this ridge where a murmuring brook sped softly over its bed he halted here a number of horses had forded the brook they were ironshod which indicated almost to a certainty that they were stolen horses and in the hands of indians  jonathan saw where the trail of the steeds was merged into that of the outlaws he suspected that the indians and legget had held a short council as he advanced the borderman found only the faintest impression of wetzels trail legget and brandt no longer left any token of their course they were riding the horses  all the borderman cared to know was if wetzel still pursued he passed on swiftly up a hill through a wood of birches where the trail showed on a line of broken ferns then out upon a low ridge where patches of grass grew sparsely here he saw in this last ground no indication of his comrades trail nothing was to be seen save the imprints of the horses hoofs jonathan halted behind the nearest underbrush this sudden move on the part of wetzel was token that suspecting an ambush he had made a detour somewhere probably in the grove of birches  all the while his eyes searched the long barren reach ahead no thicket fallen tree or splintered rocks such as indians utilized for an ambush could be seen indians always sought the densely matted underbrush a windfall or rocky retreat and there awaited a pursuer it was one of the bordermans tricks of woodcraft that he could recognize such places  far beyond the sandy ridge jonathan came to a sloping wooded hillside upon which were scattered big rocks some mossy and lichencovered and one a giant boulder with a crown of ferns and laurel gracing its flat surface it was such a place as the savages would select for ambush he knew however that if an indian had hidden himself there wetzel would have discovered him when opposite the rock jonathan saw a broken fern hanging over the edge the heavy trail of the horses ran close beside it  then with that thoroughness of search which made the borderman what he was jonathan leaped upon the rock there lying in the midst of the ferns lay an indian with sullen somber face set in the repose of death in his side was a small bullet hole  jonathan examined the savages rifle it had been discharged the rock the broken fern the dead indian the discharged rifle told the story of that woodland tragedy  wetzel had discovered the ambush leaving the trail he had tricked the redskin into firing then getting a glimpse of the indians red body through the sights of his fatal weapon the deed was done  with greater caution jonathan advanced once more not far beyond the rock he found wetzels trail the afternoon was drawing to a close he could not travel much farther yet he kept on hoping to overtake his comrade before darkness set in from time to time he whistled but got no answering signal  when the tracks of the horses were nearly hidden by the gathering dusk jonathan decided to halt for the night he whistled one more note louder and clearer and awaited the result with strained ears the deep silence of the wilderness prevailed suddenly to be broken by a faint faraway melancholy call of the hermitthrush it was the answering signal the borderman had hoped to hear  not many moments elapsed before he heard another call low and near at hand to which he replied the bushes parted noiselessly on his left and the tall form of wetzel appeared silently out of the gloom  the two gripped hands in silence  hev you any meat wetzel asked and as jonathan handed him his knapsack he continued i was kinder lookin fer you did you get out all right with the lass  nary a scratch  the giant borderman grunted his satisfaction  howd legget and brandt get away asked jonathan  cut an run like scared bucks never got a hand on either of em  how many redskins did they meet back here a spell  they was seven but now there are only six an all snug in leggets place by this time  i reckon were near his den  were not far off  night soon closing down upon the bordermen found them wrapped in slumber as if no deadly foes were near at hand the soft night wind sighed dismally among the bare trees a few bright stars twinkled overhead in the darkness of the forest the bordermen were at home     chapter xxii  in leggets rude log cabin a fire burned low lightening the forms of the two border outlaws and showing in the background the dark forms of indians sitting motionless on the floor their dusky eyes emitted a baleful glint seemingly a reflection of their savage souls caught by the firelight legget wore a look of ferocity and sullen fear strangely blended brandts face was hard and haggard his lips set his gray eyes smoldering  safe he hissed safe you say youll see that its the same now as on the other night when those bordertigers jumped us and we ran like cowards id have fought it out here but for you  thet man wetzel is ravin mad i tell you growled legget i reckon ive stood my ground enough to know i aint no coward but this fellars crazy he hed the injuns slashin each other like a pack of wolves round a buck  hes no more mad than you or i declared brandt i know all about him his moaning in the woods and wild yells are only tricks he knows the indian nature and he makes their very superstition and religion aid him in his fighting i told you what hed do didnt i beg you to kill zane when we had a chance wetzel would never have taken our trail alone now theyve beat me out of the girl and as sure as death will round us up here  you dont believe theyll rush us here asked legget  theyre too keen to take foolish chances but something will be done we dont expect zane was a prisoner here he had a good look at this place and you can gamble hell remember  zane must hev gone back to fort henry with the girl  mark what i say hell come back  wal we kin hold this place against all the men eb zane may put out  he wont send a man snapped brandt passionately remember this legget were not to fight against soldiers settlers or hunters but bordermenunderstandbordermen such as have been developed right here on this bloody frontier and nowhere else on earth they havent fear in them both are fleet as deer in the woods they cant be seen or trailed they can snuff a candle with a rifle ball in the dark ive seen zane do it three times at a hundred yards and wetzel he wouldnt waste powder on practicing they cant be ambushed or shaken off a track they take the scent like buzzards and have eyes like eagles  we kin slip out of here under cover of night suggested legget  well what then thats all they want theyd be on us again by sunset no weve got to stand our ground and fight well stay as long as we can but theyll rout us out somehow be sure of that and if one of us pokes his nose out to the daylight it will be shot off  youre sore an youve lost your nerve said legget harshly sore at me cause i got sweet on the girl ho ho  brandt shot a glance at legget which boded no good his strong hands clenched in an action betraying the reckless rage in his heart then he carefully removed his hunting coat and examined his wound he retied the bandage muttering gloomily im so weak as to be lightheaded if this cut opens again its all day for me  after that the inmates of the hut were quiet the huge outlaw bowed his shaggy head for a while and then threw himself on a pile of hemlock boughs brandt was not long in seeking rest soon both were fast asleep two of the savages passed out with catlike step leaving the door open the fire had burned low leaving a bed of dead coals outside in the dark a waterfall splashed softly  the darkest hour came and passed and paled slowly to gray birds began to twitter through the door of the cabin the light of day streamed in the two indian sentinels were building a fire on the stone hearth one by one the other savages got up stretched and yawned and began the business of the day by cooking their breakfast it was apparently every one for himself  legget arose shook himself like a shaggy dog and was starting for the door when one of the sentinels stopped him brandt who was now awake saw the action and smiled  in a few moments indians and outlaws were eating for breakfast roasted strips of venison with corn meal baked brown which served as bread it was a somber silent group  presently the shrill neigh of a horse startled them following it the whiplike crack of a rifle stung and split the morning air hard on this came an indians long wailing deathcry  hah exclaimed brandt  legget remained immovable one of the savages peered out through a little porthole at the rear of the hut the others continued their meal  whistlerll come in presently to tell us whos doin thet shootin said legget hes a keen injun  hes not very keen now replied brandt with bitter certainty hes what the settlers call a good indian which is to say dead  legget scowled at his lieutenant  ill go an see he replied and seized his rifle  he opened the door when another rifleshot rang out a bullet whistled in the air grazing the outlaws shoulder and imbedded itself in the heavy doorframe  legget leaped back with a curse  close shave said brandt coolly that bullet came probably straight down from the top of the cliff jack zanes there wetzel is lower down watching the outlet were trapped  trapped shouted legget with an angry leer we kin live here longern the bordermen kin weve meat on hand an a good spring in the back of the hut hower we trapped  we wont live twentyfour hours declared brandt  why  because well be routed out theyll find some way to do it and well never have another chance to fight in the open as we had the other night when they came after the girl from now on therell be no sleep no time to eat the nameless fear of an unseen foe who cant be shaken off marching by night hiding and starving by day until id rather be back in fort henry at colonel zanes mercy  legget turned a ghastly face toward brandt look a here youre takin a lot of glee in sayin these things i believe youve lost your nerve or the lettin out of a little blood hes made you wobbly weve injuns here an ought to be a match fer two men  brandt gazed at him with a derisive smile  we kin go out an fight these fellars continued legget we might try their own game hidin an crawlin through the woods  we two would have to go it alone if you still had your trusty trained band of experienced indians id say that would be just the thing but ashbow and the chippewa are dead so are the others this bunch of redskins here may do to steal a few horses but they dont amount to much against zane and wetzel besides theyll cut and run presently for theyre scared and suspicious look at the chief ask him  the savage brandt indicated was a big indian just coming into manhood his swarthy face still retained some of the frankness and simplicity of youth  chief said legget in the indian tongue the great paleface hunter deathwind lies hid in the woods  last night the shawnee heard the wind of death mourn through the trees replied the chief gloomily  see what did i say cried brandt the superstitious fool he would begin his deathchant almost without a fight we cant count on the redskins whats to be done  the outlaw threw himself upon the bed of boughs and legget sat down with his rifle across his knees the indians maintained the same stoical composure the moments dragged by into hours  ugh suddenly exclaimed the indian at the end of the hut  legget ran to him and acting upon a motion of the indians hand looked out through the little porthole  the sun was high he saw four of the horses grazing by the brook then gazed scrutinizingly from the steep waterfall along the greenstained cliff to the dark narrow cleft in the rocks here was the only outlet from the inclosure he failed to discover anything unusual  the indian grunted again and pointed upward  smoke theres smoke risin above the trees cried legget brandt come here whats thet mean  brandt hurried looked out his face paled his lower jaw protruded quivered and then was shut hard he walked away put his foot on a bench and began to lace his leggings  wal demanded legget  the games up get ready to run and be shot at cried brandt with a hiss of passion  almost as he spoke the roof of the hut shook under a heavy blow  whats thet no one replied legget glanced from brandts cold determined face to the uneasy savages they were restless and handling their weapons the chief strode across the floor with stealthy steps  thud  a repetition of the first blow caused the indians to jump and drew a fierce imprecation from their outlaw leader  brandt eyed him narrowly its coming to you legget they are shooting arrows of fire into the roof from the cliff zane is doin that he can make a bow and draw one too were to be burned out now damn you take your medicine i wanted you to kill him when you had the chance if you had done so wed never have come to this burned out do you get that burned out  fire exclaimed legget he sat down as if the strength had left his legs  the indians circled around the room like caged tigers  ugh the chief suddenly reached up and touched the birchbark roof of the hut  his action brought the attention of all to a faint crackling of burning wood  its caught all right cried brandt in a voice which cut the air like a blow from a knife  ill not be smoked like a ham fer all these tricky bordermen roared legget drawing his knife he hacked at the heavy buckskin hinges of the rude door when it dropped free he measured it against the open space sheathing the blade he grasped his rifle in his right hand and swung the door on his left arm heavy though it was he carried it easily the roughly hewn planks afforded a capital shield for all except the lower portion of his legs and feet he went out of the hut with the screen of wood between himself and the cliff calling for the indians to follow they gathered behind him breathing hard clutching their weapons and seemingly almost crazed by excitement  brandt with no thought of joining this foolhardy attempt to escape from the inclosure ran to the little porthole that he might see the outcome legget and his five redskins were running toward the narrow outlet in the gorge the awkward and futile efforts of the indians to remain behind the shield were almost pitiful they crowded each other for favorable positions but struggle as they might one or two were always exposed to the cliff suddenly one pushed to the rear stopped simultaneously with the crack of a rifle threw up his arms and fell another report differing from the first rang out a savage staggered from behind the speeding group with his hand at his side then he dropped into the brook  evidently legget grasped this as a golden opportunity for he threw aside the heavy shield and sprang forward closely followed by his redskinned allies immediately they came near the cliff where the trail ran into the gorge a violent shaking of the dry ferns overhead made manifest the activity of some heavy body next instant a huge yellow figure not unlike a leaping catamount plunged down with a roar so terrible as to sound inhuman legget indians and newcomer rolled along the declivity toward the brook in an indistinguishable mass  two of the savages shook themselves free and bounded to their feet nimbly as cats but legget and the other redskin became engaged in a terrific combat it was a wrestling whirl so fierce and rapid as to render blows ineffectual the leaves scattered as if in a whirlwind leggets fury must have been awful to judge from his hoarse screams the indians fear maddening as could be told by their shrieks the two savages ran wildly about the combatants one trying to level a rifle the other to get in a blow with a tomahawk but the movements of the trio locked in deadly embrace were too swift  above all the noise of the contest rose that strange thrilling roar  wetzel muttered brandt with a chill creeping shudder as he gazed upon the strife with fascinated eyes  bang again from the cliff came that heavy bellow  the savage with the rifle shrunk back as if stung and without a cry fell limply in a heap his companion uttering a frightened cry fled from the glen  the struggle seemed too deadly too terrible to last long the indian and the outlaw were at a disadvantage they could not strike freely the whirling conflict grew more fearful during one second the huge brown bearish figure of legget appeared on top then the darkbodied halfnaked savage spotted like a hyena and finally the lithe powerful tigershape of the borderman  finally legget wrenched himself free at the same instant that the bloodystained indian rolled writhing in convulsions away from wetzel the outlaw dashed with desperate speed up the trail and disappeared in the gorge the borderman sped toward the cliff leaped on a projecting ledge grasped an overhanging branch and pulled himself up he was out of sight almost as quickly as legget  after his rifle brandt muttered and then realized that he had watched the encounter without any idea of aiding his comrade he consoled himself with the knowledge that such an attempt would have been useless from the moment the borderman sprang upon legget until he scaled the cliff his movements had been incredibly swift it would have been hardly possible to cover him with a rifle and the outlaw grimly understood that he needed to be careful of that charge in his weapon  by heavens wetzels a wonder cried brandt in unwilling admiration now hell go after legget and the redskin while zane stays here to get me well hell succeed most likely but ill never quit whats this  he felt something slippery and warm on his hand it was blood running from the inside of his sleeve a slight pain made itself felt in his side upon examination he found to his dismay that his wound had reopened with a desperate curse he pulled a linsey jacket off a peg tore it into strips and bound up the injury as tightly as possible  then he grasped his rifle and watched the cliff and the gorge with flaring eyes suddenly he found it difficult to breathe his throat was parched his eyes smarted then the odor of woodsmoke brought him to a realization that the cabin was burning it was only now he understood that the room was full of blue clouds he sank into the corner a wolf at bay  not many moments passed before the outlaw understood that he could not withstand the increasing heat and stifling vapor of the room pieces of burning birch dropped from the roof the crackling above grew into a steady roar  ive got to run for it he gasped death awaited him outside the door but that was more acceptable than death by fire yet to face the final moment when he desired with all his soul to live required almost superhuman courage sweating panting he glared around god is there no other way he cried in agony at this moment he saw an ax on the floor  seizing it he attacked the wall of the cabin beyond this partition was a hut which had been used for a stable half a dozen strokes of the ax opened a hole large enough for him to pass through with his rifle and a piece of venison which hung near he literally fell through the hole where he lay choking almost fainting after a time he crawled across the floor to a door outside was a dense laurel thicket into which he crawled  the crackling and roaring of the fire grew louder he could see the column of yellow and black smoke once fairly under way the flames rapidly consumed the pitchpine logs in an hour leggets cabins were a heap of ashes  the afternoon waned brandt lay watchful slowly recovering his strength he felt secure under this cover and only prayed for night to come as the shadows began to creep down the sides of the cliffs he indulged in hope if he could slip out in the dark he had a good chance to elude the borderman in the passionate desire to escape he had forgotten his fatalistic words to legget he reasoned that he could not be trailed until daylight that a long nights march would put him far in the lead and there was just a possibility of zanes having gone away with wetzel  when darkness had set in he slipped out of the covert and began his journey for life within a few yards he reached the brook he had only to follow its course in order to find the outlet to the glen moreover its rush and gurgle over the stones would drown any slight noise he might make  slowly patiently he crawled stopping every moment to listen what a long time he was in coming to the mossy stones over which the brook dashed through the gorge but he reached them at last here if anywhere zane would wait for him  with teeth clenched desperately and an inward tightening of his chest for at any moment he expected to see the red flame of a rifle he slipped cautiously over the mossy stones finally his hands touched the dewy grass and a breath of cool wind fanned his hot cheek he had succeeded in reaching the open crawling some rods farther on he lay still a while and listened the solemn wilderness calm was unbroken rising he peered about behind loomed the black hill with its narrow cleft just discernible facing the north star he went silently out into the darkness     chapter xxiii  at daylight jonathan zane rolled from his snug bed of leaves under the side of a log and with the flint steel and punk he always carried began building a fire his actions were far from being hurried they were deliberate and seemed strange on the part of a man whose stern face suggested some dark business to be done when his little fire had been made he warmed some slices of venison which had already been cooked and thus satisfied his hunger carefully extinguishing the fire and looking to the priming of his rifle he was ready for the trail  he stood near the edge of the cliff from which he could command a view of the glen the black smoldering ruins of the burned cabins defaced a picturesque scene  brandt must have lit out last night for i could have seen even a rabbit hidin in that laurel patch hes gone an its what i wanted thought the borderman  he made his way slowly around the edge of the inclosure and clambered down on the splintered cliff at the end of the gorge a wide welltrodden trail extended into the forest below jonathan gave scarcely a glance to the beaten path before him but bent keen eyes to the north and carefully scrutinized the mossy stones along the brook upon a little sand bar running out from the bank he found the light imprint of a hand  it was a black night hed have to travel by the stars an norths the only safe direction for him muttered the borderman  on the bank above he found oblong indentations in the grass barely perceptible but owing to the peculiar position of the blades of grass easy for him to follow  hed better have learned to walk light as an injun before he took to outlawin said the borderman in disdain then he returned to the gorge and entered the inclosure at the foot of the little rise of ground where wetzel had leaped upon his quarry was one of the dead indians another lay partly submerged in the brown water  jonathan carried the weapons of the savages to a dry place under a projecting ledge in the cliff passing on down the glen he stopped a moment where the cabins had stood not a log remained the horses with the exception of two were tethered in the copse of laurel he recognized colonel zanes thoroughbred and bettys pony he cut them loose positive they would not stray from the glen and might easily be secured at another time  he set out upon the trail of brandt with a long swinging stride to him the outcome of that pursuit was but a question of time the consciousness of superior endurance speed and craft spoke in his every movement the consciousness of being in right a factor so powerfully potent for victory spoke in the intrepid front with which he faced the north  it was a gloomy november day gray steely clouds drifted overhead the wind wailed through the bare trees sending dead leaves scurrying and rustling over the brown earth  the borderman advanced with a step that covered glade and glen forest and field with astonishing swiftness long since he had seen that brandt was holding to the lowland this did not strike him as singular until for the third time he found the trail lead a short distance up the side of a ridge then descend seeking a level with this discovery came the certainty that brandts pace was lessening he had set out with a hunters stride but it had begun to shorten the outlaw had shirked the hills and shifted from his northern course why the man was weakening he could not climb he was favoring a wound  what seemed more serious for the outlaw was the fact that he had left a good trail and entered the low wild land north of the ohio even the indians seldom penetrated this tangled belt of laurel and thorn owing to the dry season the swamps were shallow which was another factor against brandt no doubt he had hoped to hide his trail by wading and here it showed up like the track of a bison  jonathan kept steadily on knowing the farther brandt penetrated into this wilderness the worse off he would be the outlaw dared not take to the river until below fort henry which was distant many a weary mile the trail grew more ragged as the afternoon wore away when twilight rendered further tracking impossible the borderman built a fire in a sheltered place ate his supper and went to sleep  in the dim gray morning light he awoke fancying he had been startled by a distant rifle shot he roasted his strips of venison carefully and ate with a hungry hunters appreciation yet sparingly as befitted a borderman who knew how to keep up his strength upon a long trail  hardly had he traveled a mile when brandts footprints covered anothers nothing surprised the borderman but he had expected this least of all a hasty examination convinced him that legget and his indian ally had fled this way with wetzel in pursuit  the morning passed slowly the borderman kept to the trail like a hound the afternoon wore on over sandy reaches thick with willows and through long matted driedout cranberry marshes and copses of prickly thorn the borderman hung to his purpose his legs seemed never to lose their spring but his chest began to heave his head bent and his face shone with sweat  at dusk he tired crawling into a dry thicket he ate his scanty meal and fell asleep when he awoke it was gray daylight he was wet and chilled again he kindled a fire and sat over it while cooking breakfast  suddenly he was brought to his feet by the sound of a rifle shot then two others followed in rapid succession though they were faint and far away to the west jonathan recognized the first which could have come only from wetzels weapon and he felt reasonably certain of the third which was brandts there might have been he reflected grimly a good reason for leggets not shooting however he knew that wetzel had rounded up the fugitives and again he set out  it was another dismal day such a one as would be fitting for a dark deed of border justice a cold drizzly rain blew from the northwest jonathan wrapped a piece of oilskin around his riflebreech and faced the downfall soon he was wet to the skin he kept on but his free stride had shortened even upon his iron muscles this soggy sticky ground had begun to tell  the morning passed but the storm did not the air grew colder and darker the short afternoon would afford him little time especially as the rain and running rills of water were obliterating the trail  in the midst of a dense forest of great cottonwoods and sycamores he came upon a little pond hidden among the bushes and shrouded in a windy wet gloom jonathan recognized the place he had been there in winter hunting bears when all the swampland was locked by ice  the borderman searched along the banks for a time then went back to the trail patiently following it around the pond it led to the side of a great shelving rock he saw an indian leaning against this and was about to throw forward his rifle when the strange fixed position of the savage told of the tragedy a wound extended from his shoulder to his waist near by on the ground lay legget he too was dead his gigantic frame weltered in blood his big feet were wide apart his arms spread and from the middle of his chest protruded the haft of a knife  the level space surrounding the bodies showed evidence of a desperate struggle a bush had been rolled upon and crushed by heavy bodies on the ground was blood as on the stones and leaves the blade legget still clutched was red and the wrist of the hand which held it showed a dark discolored band where it had felt the relentless grasp of wetzels steel grip the dead mans buckskin coat was cut into ribbons on his broad face a demoniacal expression had set in eternal rigidity the animal terror of death was frozen in his wide staring eyes the outlaw chief had died as he had lived desperately  jonathan found wetzels trail leading directly toward the river and soon understood that the borderman was on the track of brandt the borderman had surprised the worn starved sleepy fugitives in the gray misty dawn the indian doubtless was the sentinel and had fallen asleep at his post never to awaken legget and brandt must have discharged their weapons ineffectually zane could not understand why his comrade had missed brandt at a few rods distance perhaps he had wounded the younger outlaw but certainly he had escaped while wetzel had closed in on legget to meet the hardest battle of his career  while going over his version of the attack jonathan followed brandts trail as had wetzel to where it ended in the river the old borderman had continued on down stream along the sandy shore the outlaw remained in the water to hide his trail  at one point wetzel turned north this move puzzled jonathan as did also the peculiar tracks it was more perplexing because not far below zane discovered where the fugitive had left the water to get around a ledge of rock  the trail was approaching fort henry jonathan kept on down the river until arriving at the head of the island which lay opposite the settlement still no traces of wetzel here zane lost brandts trail completely he waded the first channel which was shallow and narrow and hurried across the island walking out upon a sandbar he signaled with his wellknown indian cry almost immediately came an answering shout  while waiting he glanced at the sand and there pointing straight toward the fort he found brandts straggling trail     chapter xxiv  colonel zane paced to and fro on the porch his genial smile had not returned he was grave and somber information had just reached him that jonathan had hailed from the island and that one of the settlers had started across the river in a boat  betty came out accompanied by mrs zane  whats this i hear asked betty flashing an anxious glance toward the river has jack really come in  yes replied the colonel pointing to a throng of men on the river bank  now therell be trouble said mrs zane nervously i wish with all my heart brandt had not thrown himself as he called it on your mercy  so do i declared colonel zane  what will be done she asked there thats jack silas has hold of his arm  hes lame he has been hurt replied her husband  a little procession of men and boys followed the borderman from the river and from the cabins appeared the settlers and their wives but there was no excitement except among the children the crowd filed into the colonels yard behind jonathan and silas  colonel zane silently greeted his brother with an iron grip of the hand which was more expressive than words no unusual sight was it to see the borderman wet ragged bloody worn with long marches holloweyed and gloomy yet he had never before presented such an appearance at fort henry betty ran forward and though she clasped his arm shrank back there was that in the bordermans presence to cause fear  wetzel jonathan cried sharply  the colonel raised both hands palms open and returned his brothers keen glance then he spoke lew hasnt come in he chased brandt across the river thats all i know  brandts here then hissed the borderman  the colonel nodded gloomily  where  in the long room over the fort i locked him in there  why did he come here  colonel zane shrugged his shoulders its beyond me he said hed rather place himself in my hands than be run down by wetzel or you he didnt crawl ill say that for him he just said im your prisoner hes in pretty bad shape barked over the temple lame in one foot cut under the arm starved and worn out  take me to him said the borderman and he threw his rifle on a bench  very well come along replied the colonel he frowned at those following them here you women clear out but they did not obey him  it was a soberfaced group that marched in through the big stockade gate under the huge bulging front of the fort and up the rough stairway colonel zane removed a heavy bar from before a door and thrust it open with his foot the long guardroom brilliantly lighted by sunshine coming through the portholes was empty save for a ragged man lying on a bench  the noise aroused him he sat up and then slowly labored to his feet it was the same flaring wildeyed brandt only fiercer and more haggard he wore a bloody bandage round his head when he saw the borderman he backed with involuntary instinctive action against the wall yet showed no fear  in the dark glance jonathan shot at brandt shone a pitiless implacability no scorn nor hate nor passion but something which had it not been so terrible might have been justice  i think wetzel was hurt in the fight with legget said jonathan deliberately an ask if you know  i believe he was replied brandt readily i was asleep when he jumped us and was awakened by the indians yell wetzel must have taken a snap shot at me as i was getting up which accounts probably for my being alive i fell but did not lose consciousness i heard wetzel and legget fighting and at last struggled to my feet although dizzy and bewildered i could see to shoot but missed for a long time it seemed to me i watched that terrible fight and then ran finally reaching the river where i recovered somewhat  did you see wetzel again  once about a quarter of a mile behind me he was staggering along on my trail  at this juncture there was a commotion among the settlers crowding behind colonel zane and jonathan and helen sheppard appeared white with her big eyes strangely dilated  oh she cried breathlessly clasping both hands around jonathans arm im not too late youre not going to  helen this is no place for you said colonel zane sternly this is business for men you must not interfere  helen gazed at him at brandt and then up at the borderman she did not loose his arm  outside some one told me you intended to shoot him is it true  colonel zane evaded the searching gaze of those strained brilliant eyes nor did he answer  as helen stepped slowly back a hush fell upon the crowd the whispering the nervous coughing and shuffling of feet ceased  in those around her helen saw the spirit of the border colonel zane and silas wore the same look cold hard almost brutal the women were strangely grave nellie douns sweet face seemed changed there was pity even suffering on it but no relenting even bettys face always so warm piquant and wholesome had taken on a shade of doubt of gloom of something almost sullen which blighted its dark beauty what hurt helen most cruelly was the bordermans glittering eyes  she fought against a shuddering weakness which threatened to overcome her  whose prisoner is brandt she asked of colonel zane  he gave himself up to me naturally as i am in authority here replied the colonel but that signifies little i can do no less than abide by jonathans decree which after all is the decree of the border  and that is  death to outlaws and renegades  but cannot you spare him implored helen i know he is a bad man but he might become a better one it seems like murder to me to kill him in cold blood wounded suffering as he is when he claimed your mercy oh it is dreadful  the usually kindhearted colonel soft as wax in the hands of a girl was now colder and harder than flint  it is useless he replied curtly i am sorry for you we all understand your feelings that yours are not the principles of the border if you had lived long here you could appreciate what these outlaws and renegades have done to us this man is a hardened criminal he is a thief a murderer  he did not kill mordaunt replied helen quickly i saw him draw first and attack brandt  no matter come helen cease no more of this colonel zane cried with impatience  but i will not exclaimed helen with ringing voice and flashing eye she turned to her girl friends and besought them to intercede for the outlaw but nell only looked sorrowfully on while betty met her appealing glance with a fire in her eyes that was no dim reflection of her brothers  then i must make my appeal to you said helen facing the borderman there could be no mistaking how she regarded him respect honor and love breathed from every line of her beautiful face  why do you want him to go free demanded jonathan you told me to kill him  oh i know but i was not in my right mind listen to me please he must have been very different once perhaps had sisters for their sake give him another chance i know he has a better nature i feared him hated him scorned him as if he were a snake yet he saved me from that monster legget  for himself  well yes i cant deny that but he could have ruined me wrecked me yet he did not at least he meant marriage by me he said if i would marry him he would flee over the border and be an honest man  have you no other reason  yes helens bosom swelled and a glory shone in her splendid eyes the other reason is my own happiness  plain to all if not through her words from the light in her eyes that she could not love a man who was a party to what she considered injustice  the bordermans white face became flaming red  it was difficult to refuse this glorious girl any sacrifice she demanded for the sake of the love so openly avowed  sweetly and pityingly she turned to brandt will not you help me  lass if it were for me you were asking my life id swear it yours for always and id be a man he replied with bitterness but not to save my soul would i ask anything of him  the giant passions hate and jealousy flamed in his gray eyes  if i persuade them to release you will you go away leave this country and never come back  ill promise that lass and honestly he replied  she wheeled toward jonathan and now the rosy color chased the pallor from her cheeks  jack do you remember when we parted at my home when you left on this terrible trail now ended thank god do you remember what an ordeal that was for me must i go through it again  bewitchingly sweet she was then with the girlish charm of coquetry almost lost in the deeper stranger power of the woman  the borderman drew his breath sharply then he wrapped his long arms closely round her she understanding that victory was hers sank weeping upon his breast for a moment he bowed his face over her and when he lifted it the dark and terrible gloom had gone  eb let him go an at once ordered jonathan give him a rifle some meat an a canoe for he cant travel an turn him loose only be quick about it because if wetzel comes in god himself couldnt save the outlaw  it was an indescribable glance that brandt cast upon the tearful face of the girl who had saved his life but without a word he followed colonel zane from the room  the crowd slowly filed down the steps betty and nell lingered behind their eyes beaming through happy tears jonathan long so cold showed evidence of becoming as quick and passionate a lover as he had been a borderman at least helen had to release herself from his embrace and it was a blushing tearstained face she turned to her friends  when they reached the stockade gate colonel zane was hurrying toward the river with a bag in one hand and a rifle and a paddle in the other brandt limped along after him the two disappearing over the river bank  betty nell and the lovers went to the edge of the bluff  they saw colonel zane choose a canoe from among a number on the beach he launched it deposited the bag in the bottom handed the rifle and paddle to brandt and wheeled about  the outlaw stepped aboard and pushing off slowly drifted down and out toward midstream when about fifty yards from shore he gave a quick glance around and ceased paddling his face gleamed white and his eyes glinted like bits of steel in the sun  suddenly he grasped the rifle and leveling it with the swiftness of thought fired at jonathan  the borderman saw the act even from the beginning and must have read the outlaws motive for as the weapon flashed he dropped flat on the bank the bullet sang harmlessly over him imbedding itself in the stockade fence with a distinct thud  the girls were so numb with horror that they could not even scream  colonel zane swore lustily wheres my gun get me a gun oh what did i tell you  look cried jonathan as he rose to his feet  upon the sandbar opposite stood a tall dark familiar figure  by all thats holy wetzel exclaimed colonel zane  they saw the giant borderman raise a long black rifle which wavered and fell and rose again a little puff of white smoke leaped out accompanied by a clear stinging report  brandt dropped the paddle he had hurriedly begun plying after his traitors act his white face was turned toward the shore as it sank forward to rest at last upon the gunwale of the canoe then his body slowly settled as if seeking repose his hand trailed outside in the water drooping inert and lifeless the little craft drifted down stream  you see helen it had to be said colonel zane gently what a dastard a long shot jack fate itself must have glanced down the sights of wetzels rifle     chapter xxv  a year rolled round once again indian summer veiled the golden fields and forests in a soft smoky haze once more from the opalblue sky of autumn nights shone the great white stars and nature seemed wrapped in a melancholy hush  november the third was the anniversary of a memorable event on the frontierthe marriage of the younger borderman  colonel zane gave it the name of independence day and arranged a holiday a feast and dance where all the settlement might meet in joyful thankfulness for the first year of freedom on the border  with the wiping out of leggets fierce band the yoke of the renegades and outlaws was thrown off forever simon girty migrated to canada and lived with a few indians who remained true to him his confederates slowly sank into oblivion the shawnee tribe sullenly retreated westward far into the interior of ohio the delawares buried the war hatchet and smoked the pipe of peace they had ever before refused for them the dark mysterious fatal wind had ceased to moan along the trails or sigh through treetops over lonely indian campfires  the beautiful ohio valley had been wrested from the savages and from those parasites who for years had hung around the necks of the red men  this day was the happiest of colonel zanes life the task he had set himself and which he had hardly ever hoped to see completed was ended the west had been won what boone achieved in kentucky he had accomplished in ohio and west virginia  the feast was spread on the colonels lawn every man woman and child in the settlement was there isaac zane with his indian wife and child had come from the faroff huron town pioneers from yellow creek and eastward to fort pitt attended the spirit of the occasion manifested itself in such joyousness as had never before been experienced in fort henry the great feast was equal to the event choice cuts of beef and venison savory viands wonderful loaves of bread and great plump pies sweet cider and old wine delighted the merry party  friends neighbors dear ones said colonel zane my heart is almost too full for speech this occasion commemorating the day of our freedom on the border is the beginning of the reward for stern labor hardship silenced hearths of long relentless years i did not think id live to see it the seed we have sown has taken root in years to come perhaps a great people will grow up on these farms we call our homes and as we hope those coming afterward will remember us we should stop a moment to think of the heroes who have gone before many there are whose names will never be written on the roll of fame whose graves will be unmarked in history but we who worked fought bled beside them who saw them die for those they left behind will render them all justice honor and love to them we give the victory they were true then let us who begin to enjoy the freedom happiness and prosperity they won with their lives likewise be true in memory of them in deed to ourselves and in grace to god  by no means the least of the pleasant features of this pleasant day was the fact that three couples blushingly presented themselves before the colonel and confided to him their sudden conclusions in regard to the felicitousness of the moment the happy colonel raced around until he discovered jim douns the minister and there amid the merry throng he gave the brides away being the first to kiss them  it was late in the afternoon when the villagers dispersed to their homes and left the colonel to his own circle with his strong dark face beaming he mounted the old porch step  where are my zane babies he asked ah here you are did anybody ever see anything to beat that four wonderful babies mother heres your danielif youd only named him eb silas come for silas junior bad boy that he is isaac take your indian princess ah little myeerah with the dusky face woe be to him who looks into those eyes when you come to age jack heres little jonathan the last of the bordermen he too has beautiful eyes big like his mothers ah well i dont believe i have left a wish unless  unless suggested betty with her sweet smile  it might be he said and looked at her  bettys warm cheek was close to his as she whispered dear eb the rest only the colonel heard  well by all thats glorious he exclaimed and attempted to seize her but with burning face betty fled                                       jack dear how the leaves are falling exclaimed helen see them floating and whirling it reminds me of the day i lay a prisoner in the forest glade praying waiting for you  the borderman was silent  they passed down the sandy lane under the colored maple trees to a new cottage on the hillside  i am perfectly happy today continued helen everybody seems to be content except you for the first time in weeks i see that shade on your face that look in your eyes jack you do not regret the new life  my love no a thousand times no he answered smiling down into her eyes they were changing shadowing with thought bright as in other days and with an added beauty the wilful spirit had been softened by love  ah i know you miss the old friend  the yellow thicket on the slope opened to let out a tall dark man who came down with lithe and springy stride  jack its wetzel said helen softly  no words were spoken as the comrades gripped hands  let me see the boy asked wetzel turning to helen  little jonathan blinked up at the grave borderman with great round eyes and pulled with friendly chubby fingers at the fringed buckskin coat  when youre a man the forest trails will be corn fields muttered wetzel  the bordermen strolled together up the brown hillside and wandered along the river bluff the air was cool in the west the ruddy light darkened behind bold hills a blue mist streaming in the valley shaded into gray as twilight fell
