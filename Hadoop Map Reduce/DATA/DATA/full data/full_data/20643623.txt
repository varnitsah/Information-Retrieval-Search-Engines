brontë paid a visit to harriet martineau at ambleside and she wrote to her friends various emphatic accounts of her hostess without adopting her theories miss brontë said i yet find a worth and greatness in herself and a consistency benevolence perseverance in her practice such as wins the sincerest esteem and affection she is not a person to be judged by her writings alone but rather by her own deeds and life than which nothing can be more exemplary or noble  the division which miss brontë thus makes between opinions and character and again between literary production and character is at the root of any just criticism of the two volumes of autobiography which have just been given to the public of the third volume the memorials by mrs chapman it is impossible to say anything serious mrs chapman fought an admirable fight in the dark times of american history for the abolition of slavery but unhappily she is without literary gifts and this third volume is one more illustration of the folly of entrusting the composition of biography to persons who have only the wholly irrelevant claim of intimate friendship or kinship or sympathy in public causes the qualification for a biographer is not in the least that he is a virtuous person or a second cousin or a dear friend or a trusty colleague but that he knows how to write a book has tact style taste considerateness sense of proportion and a good eye for the beginnings and ends of things the third volume then tells us little about the person to whom they relate the two volumes of autobiography tell all that we can seek to know and the reader who judges them in an equitable spirit will be ready to allow that when all is said that can be said of her hardness arbitrariness and insularity harriet martineau is still a singular and worthy figure among the conspicuous personages of a generation that has now almost vanished some will wonder how it was that her literary performances acquired so little of permanent value others will be pained by the distinct repudiation of all theology avowed by her with a simple and courageous directness that can scarcely be counted other than honourable to her but everybody will admit as charlotte brontë did that though her books are not of the first nor of the second rank and though her antitheological opinions are to many so repugnant yet behind books and opinions was a remarkable personality a sure eye for social realities a moral courage that never flinched a strong judgment within its limits a vigorous selfreliance both in opinion and act which yet did not prevent a habit of the most neutral selfjudgment the commonplace virtues of industry and energy devoted to aims too elevated and too large and generous to be commonplace a splendid sincerity a magnificent love of truth and that all these fine qualities which would mostly be described as manly should exist not in a man but a woman and in a woman who discharged admirably such feminine duties as fell to her fills up the measure of our interest in such a character                                                   harriet martineau was born at norwich in 1802 and she died as we all remember in the course of the summer of 1876 few people have lived so long as threequarters of a century and undergone so little substantial change of character amid some very important changes of opinion her family was unitarian and family life was in her case marked by some of that stiffness that severity that chilly rigour with which unitarians are sometimes taxed by religionists of a more ecstatic doctrine her childhood was very unhappy the household seems to have been unamiable and she was treated with none of that tenderness and sympathy for which firm and defiant natures are apt to yearn as strongly as others that get the credit of greater sensibility with that singular impulse to suicide which is frequent among children though rarer with girls than boys she went one day into the kitchen for the carvingknife that she might cut her throat luckily the servants were at dinner and the child retreated deafness which proved incurable began to afflict her before she was sixteen a severe harsh and mournful kind of religiosity seized her and this abominable spiritual rigidity as she calls it confirmed all the gloomy predispositions of her mind she learned a good deal mastering latin french and italian in good time and reading much in her own tongue including constant attention to the bible with all sorts of commentaries and explanations such as those of us who were brought up in a certain spiritual atmosphere have only too good reasons never to forget this expansion of intellectual interest however did not make her less silent less low in her spirits less full of vague and anxious presentiment the reader is glad when these ungracious years of youth are at an end and the demands of active life stirred harriet martineaus energies into vigorous work  in 1822 her father died and seven years later his widow and his daughters lost at a single blow nearly all that they had in the world before this event which really proved to be a blessing in the disguise of a catastrophe harriet martineau had written a number of slight pieces they had been printed and received a certain amount of recognition they were of a religious cast as was natural in one with whom religious literature and religious life and observance had hitherto taken in the whole sphere of her continual experience traditions of palestine and devotional exercises are titles that tell their own tale and we may be sure that their authoress was still at the antipodean point of the positive philosophy in which she ended her speculative journey she still clung undoubtingly to what she had been brought up to believe when she won three prizes for essays intended to present unitarianism to the notice of jews of catholics and of mahometans her success in these and similar efforts turned her mind more decidedly towards literature as a profession  miss martineau is at some pains to assure us on several occasions that it was the need of utterance now and always that drove her to write and that money although welcome when it came was never her motive this perhaps a little savours of affectation nobody would dream of suspecting miss martineau of writing anything that she did not believe to be true or useful merely for the sake of money but there is plenty of evidence that the prospect of payment stirred her to true and useful work as it does many other authors by profession and as it does the followers of all professions whatever she puts the case fairly enough in another place i 422every author is in a manner an adventurer and no one was ever more decidedly so than myself but the difference between one kind of adventurer and another is i believe simply thisthat the one has something to say which presses for utterance and is uttered at length without a view to future fortunes while the other has a sort of general inclination towards literature without any specific need of utterance and a very definite desire for the honours and rewards of the literary career even in the latter case however honest journeymans work enough is done in literature by men and women who seek nothing higher than a reputable source of income miss martineau did no doubt seek objects far higher and more generous than income but she lived on the income which literature brought to her and there seems a certain failure of her usually admirable common sense in making any ado about so simple a matter when doctors and counsel refuse their guineas and the parson declines a stipend it will be quite soon enough for the author to be especially anxious to show that he has a right to regard money much as the rest of the human race regard it  miss martineau underwent the harsh ordeal which awaits most literary aspirants she had a scheme in her head for a long series of short tales to illustrate some of the propositions of political economy she trudged about london day after day through mud and fog with weary limbs and anxious heart as many an author has done before and since the times were bad cholera was abroad people were full of apprehension and concern about the reform bill and the publishers looked coldly on a doubtful venture miss martineau talks none of the conventional nonsense about the cruelty and stupidity of publishers what she says is this i have always been anxious to extend to young or struggling authors the sort of aid which would have been so precious to me in that winter of 18291830 and i know that in above twenty years i have never succeeded but once one of the most distinguished editors in london who had charge of a periodical for many years told us what comes to the same thing namely that in no single case during all these years did a volunteer contributor of real quality or with any promise of eminence present himself or herself so many hundreds think themselves called so few are chosen in miss martineaus case however the trade made a mistake when at length she found some one to go halves with her in the enterprise on terms extremely disadvantageous to herself the first of her tales was published 1832 and instantly had a prodigious success the sale ran up to more than ten thousand of each monthly volume in that singular autobiographical sketch of herself which miss martineau prepared for a london paper to be printed as her obituary notice she pronounced a judgment upon this work which more disinterested though not more impartial critics will confirm her own unalterable view she says of what the work could and could not effect prevented her from expecting too much from it either in regard to its social operations or its influence on her own fame the original idea of exhibiting the great natural laws of society by a series of pictures of selected social action was a fortunate one and her tales initiated a multitude of minds into the conception of what political economy is and how it concerns everybody living in society beyond this there is no merit of a high order in the work it popularised in a fresh form some doctrines and many truths long before made public by others james mill one of the acutest economists of the day and one of the most vigorous and original characters of that or any other day had foretold failure but when the time came he very handsomely admitted that his prophecy had been rash in after years when miss martineau had acquired from comte a conception of the growth and movement of societies as a whole with their economic conditions controlled and constantly modified by a multitude of other conditions of various kinds she rated the science of her earlier days very low even in those days however she says i believe i should not have been greatly surprised or displeased to have perceived even then that the pretended science is no science at all strictly speaking and that so many of its parts must undergo essential change that it may be a question whether future generations will owe much more to it than the benefit inestimable to be sure of establishing the grand truth that social affairs proceed according to general laws no less than natural phenomena of every kind autob ii 245  harriet martineau was not of the class of writers most of them terribly unprofitable who merely say literary things about social organisation its institutions and their improvement her feeling about society was less literary than scientific it was not sentimental but the businesslike quality of a good administrator she was moved less by pity or by any sense of the pathos and the hardness of the world than by a sensible and energetic interest in good government and in the rational and convenient ordering of things her tales to illustrate the truths of political economy are what might be expected from a writer of this character they are far from being wantingmany of themin the genuine interest of good storytelling they are rapid definite and without a trace of either slovenliness or fatigue we are amazed as we think of the speed and prompt regularity with which they were produced and the fertile ingenuity with which the pill of political economy is wrapped up in the confectionery of a tale may stand as a marvel of true cleverness and inventive dexterity of course of imagination or invention in a high sense there is not a trace such a quality was not in the gifts of the writer nor could it in any case have worked within such limitations as those set by the matter and the object of the series  literary success was followed in the usual order by social temptation miss martineau removed from norwich to london and she had good reasons for making the change her work dealt with matters of a political kind and she could only secure a real knowledge of what was best worth saying by intercourse with those who had a better point of view for a survey of the social state of england than could be found in a provincial town like norwich so far as evening parties went miss martineau soon perceived how little essential difference there is between the extreme case of a cathedral city and that of literary london or any other place where dissipation takes the turn of booktalk instead of dancing or masquerading she went out to dinner every night except sundays and saw all the most interesting people of the london of fiveandforty years ago while she was free from presumptuousness in her judgments she was just as free from a foolish willingness to take the reputations of her hour on trust her attitude was friendly and sensible but it was at the same time critical and independent and that is what every frank upright and sterling character naturally becomes in face of an unfamiliar society harriet martineau was too keensighted too aware of the folly and incompetent pretension of half the world too consciously selfrespecting and proud to take society and its ways with any diffidence or ingenuous simplicity on the importance of the small littérateur who unreasonably thinks himself a great one on the airs and graces of the gushing bluestockings who were in vogue in that day on the detestable vulgarity of literary lionising she had no mercy she recounts with caustic relish the story about a certain pedantical lady of whom tierney had said that there was not another head in england that could encounter hers on the subject of cause and effect the story was that when in a country house one fine day she took her seat in a window saying in a businesslike manner to david ricardo come now let us have a little discussion about space we remember a story about a certain mademoiselle de launay afterwards well known to the paris of the eighteenth century being introduced at versailles by a silly great lady who had an infatuation for her this the great lady kept saying is the young person whom i have told you about who is so wonderfully intelligent who knows so much come mademoiselle pray talk now madame you will see how she talks well first of all now talk a little about religion then you can tell us about something else  we cannot wonder that miss martineau did not go a second time to the house where space might be the unprovoked theme of a casual chat pretension in every shape she hated most heartily her judgments in most cases were thoroughly justat this period of her life at any rateand sometimes even unexpectedly kindly and the reason is that she looked at society through the medium of a strong and penetrating kind of common sense which is more often the gift of clever women than of clever men if she is masculine she is like mrs colonel poyntz in one of bulwers novels masculine in a womanly way there is a real spirit of ethical divination in some of her criticism of character take the distinguished man whose name we have just written there was bulwer on a sofa she says sparkling and languishing among a set of female votarieshe and they dizened out perfumed and presenting the nearest picture to a seraglio to be seen on british groundonly the indifference or hauteur of the lord of the harem being absent yet this disagreeable sight does not prevent her from feeling a cordial interest in him amidst any amount of vexation and pity for his weakness he seems to be a woman of genius inclosed by misadventure in a mans form he has insight experience sympathy letters power and grace of expression and an irrepressible impulse to utterance and industry which should have produced works of the noblest quality and these have been intercepted by mischiefs which may be called misfortune rather than fault his friendly temper his generous heart his excellent conversation at his best and his simple manners when he forgot himself have many a time left me mourning that such a being should allow himself to sport with perdition those who knew most about bulwer and who were most repelled by his terrible faults will feel in this page of miss martineaus the breath of social equity in which charity is not allowed to blur judgment nor moral disapproval to narrow starve and discolour vision into lost possibilities of character and we may note in passing how even here in the mere story of the men and women whom she met in london drawingrooms harriet martineau does not lose herself in gossip about individuals looked at merely in their individual relations it is not merely the blighting of promise nor the forfeiture of a career that she deplores in the case of a bulwer or a brougham it is the intercepting of national blessings if this view of natural gifts as a source of blessing to society and not merely of power or fame to their privileged possessor were more common than it is the impression which such a thought is calculated to make would be the highest available protection against those blighted promises and forfeited careers of which brougham and bulwer were only two out of a too vast host of examples  it is the very fulness with which she is possessed by this large way of conceiving a life in its manifold relations to the service of the world that is the secret of harriet martineaus firm clear calm and almost neutral way of judging both her own work and character and those of others by calm we do not mean that she was incapable of strong and direct censure many of her judgments both here and in her biographic sketches are stern and somelike that on macaulay for instancemay even pass for harsh but they are never the product of mere anger or heatedness and it is a great blunder to suppose that reasoned severity is incompatible with perfect composure or that calm is another name for amiable vapidity                          thöricht ists     in allen stücken billig sein es heisst     sein eigen selbst zerstören  her condemnation of the whigs for example is as stringent and outspoken as condemnation can be yet it is a deliberate and reasoned judgment not a mere bitterness or prejudice the whigs were at that moment between 1832 and 1834 at the height of their authority political literary and social after a generation of misgovernment they had been borne to power on the tide of national enthusiasm for parliamentary reform and for all those improvements in our national life to which parliamentary reform was no more than the first step the harshness and darkness of the past generation were the measure of the hopes of the new time these hopes which were at least as strong in harriet martineau as in anybody then living the whigs were soon felt to have cheated she cannot forgive them speaking of john and edward romilly they had virtuous projects she says and had every hope of achieving service worthy of their fathers fame but their aspirations were speedily tamed downas all high aspirations are lowered by whig influences a certain peer is described as agreeable enough in society to those who are not very particular in regard to sincerity and was as chancellor of the exchequer or anything else as good a representative as could be found of the flippancy conceit and official helplessness and ignorance of the whig administration charles knight started a new periodical for the people under the patronage of the official whigs but the poverty and perverseness of their ideas and the insolence of their feelings were precisely what might be expected by all who really knew that remarkably vulgar class of men they purposed to lecture the working classes who were by far the wiser party of the two in a jejune coaxing dull religioustract sort of tone and criticised and deprecated everything like vigour and a manly and genial tone of address in the new publication while trying to push in as contributors effete and exhausted writers and friends of their own who knew about as much of the working classes of england as of those of turkey this energetic description which belongs to the year 1848 gives us an interesting measure of the distance that has been traversed during the last thirty years the workmen have acquired direct political power they have organised themselves into effective groups for industrial purposes they have produced leaders of ability and sound judgment and the whig who seeks their support must stoop or rise to talk a radicalism that would have amply satisfied even harriet martineau herself  the source of this improvement in the society to which she bade farewell over that into which she had been born is set down by miss martineau to the most remarkable literary genius with whom during her residence in london she was brought into contact what wordsworth did for poetry she says in bringing us out of a conventional idea and method to a true and simple one carlyle has done for morality he may be himself the most curious opposition to himselfhe may be the greatest mannerist of his age while denouncing conventionalismthe greatest talker while eulogising silencethe most woful complainer while glorifying fortitudethe most uncertain and stormy in mood while holding forth serenity as the greatest good within the reach of man but he has nevertheless infused into the mind of the english nation a sincerity earnestness healthfulness and courage which can be appreciated only by those who are old enough to tell what was our morbid state when byron was the representative of our temper the clapham church of our religion and the rottenborough system of our political morality we have no quarrel with this account of the greatest man of letters of our generation but carlyle has only been one influence among others it is a far cry indeed from sartor resartus to the tracts for the times yet they were both of them protests against the same thing both of them attempted answers to the same problem and the tracts perhaps did more than sartor to quicken spiritual life to shatter the clapham church and to substitute a mystic faith and not unlovely hope for the frigid hard and mechanical lines of official orthodoxy on the one hand and the egotism and sentimental despair of byronism on the other there is a third school too and harriet martineau herself was no insignificant member of it to which both the temper and the political morality of our time have owed a deep debt the school of those utilitarian political thinkers who gave light rather than heat and yet by the intellectual force with which they insisted on the right direction of social reform also stirred the very impulse which made men desire social reform the most illustrious of this body was undoubtedly john mill because to accurate political science he added a fervid and vibrating social sympathy and a power of quickening it in the best minds of a scientific turn it is odd by the way that miss martineau while so lavish in deserved panegyric on carlyle should be so grudging and disparaging in the case of mill with whom her intellectual affinities must have been closer than with any other of her contemporaries the translator of comtes positive philosophy had better reasons than most people for thinking well of the services of the author of the system of logic it was certainly the latter book which did more than any other to prepare the minds of the english philosophic public for the former  it is creditable to miss martineaus breadth of sympathy that she should have left on record the tribute of her admiration for carlyle for nobody has written so harshly as carlyle on the subject which interested harriet martineau more passionately than any other events of her time in 1834 she had finished her series of illustrations of political economy her domestic life was fretted by the unreasonable exigences of her mother london society had perhaps begun to weary her and she felt the need of a change of scene the united states with the old european institutions placed amid new conditions were then as now a natural object of interest to everybody with a keen feeling for social improvement so to the western republic miss martineau turned her face she had not been long in the states before she began to feel that the abolitionists at that moment a despised and persecuted handful of men and women were the truly moral and regenerating party in the country harriet martineau no sooner felt this conviction driving out her former prejudice against them as fanatical and impracticable than she at once bore public testimony at serious risk of every kind to herself in favour of the extreme antislavery agitators and for thirty years she never slackened her sympathy nor her energetic action on english public opinion in this most vital matter of her time she was guided not merely by humanitarian disgust at the cruel and brutal abominations of slaverythough we know no reason why this alone should not be a sufficient ground for turning abolitionistbut also on the more purely political ground of the cowardice silence corruption and hypocrisy that were engendered in the free states by purchased connivance at the peculiar institution of the slave states nobody has yet traced out the full effect upon the national character of the americans of all those years of conscious complicity in slavery after the moral iniquity of slavery had become clear to the inner conscience of the very men who ignobly sanctioned the mobbing of abolitionists  in the summer of 1836 miss martineau returned to england having added this great question to the stock of her foremost objects of interest and concern such additions whether literary or social are the best kind of refreshment that travel supplies she published two books on america one of them abstract and quasiscientific society in america the other a retrospect of western travel of a lighter and more purely descriptive quality their success with the public was moderate and in after years she condemned them in very plain language the first of them especially as full of affectations and preachments their only service and it was not inconsiderable was the information which they circulated as to the condition of slavery and of the country under it we do not suppose that they are worth reading at the present day except from a historical point of view but they are really good specimens of a kind of literature which is not abundant and yet which is of the utmost valuewe mean the record of the sociological observation of a country by a competent traveller who stays long enough in the country has access to the right persons of all kinds and will take pains enough to mature his judgments it was a happy idea of oconnells to suggest that she should go over to ireland and write such an account of that country as she had written of the united states and we wish at this very hour that some one as competent as miss martineau would do what oconnell wished her to do a similar request came to her from milan why should she not visit lombardy and then tell europe the true tale of austrian rule  but after her american journey miss martineau felt a very easily intelligible desire to change the literary field for many years she had been writing almost entirely about fact and the constraint of the effort to be always correct and to bear without solicitude the questioning of her correctness had become burdensome she felt the danger of losing nerve and becoming morbidly fearful of criticism on the one hand and of growing narrow and mechanical about accuracy on the other i longed inexpressibly she says for the liberty of fiction while occasionally doubting whether i had the power to use that freedom as i could have done ten years before the product of this new mental phase was deerbrook which was published in the spring of 1839 deerbrook is a story of an english country village its petty feuds its gentilities its chances and changes of fortune the influence of jane austens stories is seen in every chapter but harriet martineau had none of the easy flow the pleasant humour the lighthanded irony of her model any more than she had the energetic and sustained imaginative power of charlotte or emily brontë there is playfulness enough in deerbrook but it is too deliberate to remind us of the crooning involuntary playfulness of pride and prejudice or sense and sensibility deerbrook is not in the least a story with a moral it is truly and purely a piece of art yet we are conscious of the serious spirit of the social reformer as haunting the background and only surrendering the scene for reasons of its own on the other hand there is in deerbrook a gravity of moral reflection that jane austen whether wisely or unwisely seldom or never attempts in this respect deerbrook is the distant forerunner of some of george eliots most characteristic work distant because george eliots moralising is constantly suffused by the broad light of a highly poetic imagination and this was in no degree among miss martineaus gifts still there is something above the flat touch of the common didactic in such a page as that in which chapter xix she describes the case of the unamiablethe only order of evil ones who suffer hell without seeing and knowing that it is hell nay they are under a heavier curse than even this they inflict torments second only to their own with an unconsciousness worthy of spirits of light however when all is said we may agree that this is one of the books that give a rational person pleasure once but which we hardly look forward to reading again  shortly after the publication of her first novel miss martineau was seized by a serious internal malady from which recovery seemed hopeless according to her usual practice of taking her life deliberately in her hands and settling its conditions for herself instead of letting things drift as they might she insisted on declining the hospitable shelter pressed upon her by a near relative on the excellent ground that it is wrong for an invalid to impose restraints upon a healthy household she proceeded to establish herself in lodgings at tynemouth on the coast of northumberland here she lay on a couch for nearly five years seeing as few persons as might be and working at such literary matters as came into her head with steadfast industry and fortitude the ordeal was hard but the little book that came of it life in a sickroom remains to show the moods in which the ordeal was borne  at length miss martineau was induced to try mesmerism as a possible cure for her disease and what is certain is that after trying mesmeric treatment the invalid whom the doctors had declared incurable shortly recovered as perfect health as she had ever known a virulent controversy arose upon the case for by some curious law physicians are apt to import into professional disputes a heat and bitterness at least as marked as that of their old enemies the theologians it was said that miss martineau had begun to improve before she was mesmerised and what was still more to the point that she had been taking heavy doses of iodine it is beyond all question or dispute as voltaire said that magic words and ceremonies are quite capable of most effectually destroying a whole flock of sheep if the words be accompanied by a sufficient quantity of arsenic  mesmerism was indirectly the means of bringing miss martineau into an intimate acquaintance with a gentleman who soon began to exert a decisive influence upon the most important of her opinions mr atkinson is still alive and we need not say much about him he seems to have been a grave and sincere person using his mind with courageous independence upon the great speculative problems which were not in 1844 as they are in 1877 the common topics of everyday intercourse among educated people this is not the place for an examination of the philosophy in which miss martineau was finally landed by mr atkinsons influence that philosophy was given to the world in 1851 in a volume called letters on the laws of mans nature and development the greater part of it was written by mr atkinson in reply to short letters in which miss martineau stated objections and propounded questions the book points in the direction of that explanation of the facts of the universe which is now so familiar under the name of evolution but it points in this way only as the once famous vestiges of creation pointed towards the scientific hypotheses of darwin and wallace or as buckles crude and superficial notions about the history of civilisation pointed towards a true and complete conception of sociology that is to say the atkinson letters state some of the difficulties in the way of the explanations of life and motion hitherto received as satisfactory they insist upon approaching the facts exclusively by the positive baconian or inductive method and then they hurry to an explanation of their own which may be as plausible as that which they intend it to replace but which they leave equally without ordered proof and strict verification  the only point to which we are called upon to refer is that this way of thinking about man and the rest of nature led to repudiation by miss martineau of the whole structure of dogmatic theology for one thing she ceased to hold the conception of a god with any human attributes whatever also of any principle or practice of design of an administration of life according to human wishes or of the affairs of the world by the principles of human morals all these became to her as mere visions beliefs necessary in their day but not philosophically nor permanently true miss martineau was not an atheist in the philosophic sense she never denied a first cause but only that this cause is within the sphere of human attributes or can be defined in their terms  then for another thing she ceased to believe in the probability of there being a continuance of conscious individual life after the dissolution of the body with this of course fell all expectation of a state of personal rewards and punishments the real and justifiable and honourable subject of interest she said to human beings living and dying is the welfare of their fellows surrounding them or surviving them about that she cared supremely and about nothing else did she bring herself to care at all it is painful to many people even to hear of a person holding such beliefs as these yet it would plainly be the worst kind of spiritual valetudinarianism to insist on the omission from even the shortest account of this remarkable woman of what became the very basis and foundation of her life for those thirty years of it which she herself always counted the happiest part of the whole  although it was mr atkinson who finally provided her with a positive substitute for her older beliefs yet a journey which miss martineau made in the east shortly after her restoration to health 1846 had done much to build up in her mind a historic conception of the origin and order of the great faiths of mankindthe christian the hebrew the mahometan the old egyptian we need not say more on this subject the work in which she published the experiences of the journey which was always so memorable to her deserves a word there are few more delightful books of travel than eastern life past and present the descriptions are admirably graphic and they have the attraction of making their effect by a few direct strokes without any of the wordy elaboration of our modern picturesque the writer shows a true feeling for nature and she shows a vigorous sense which is not merely pretty sentiment like chateaubriands for the vast historic associations of those old lands and dim cradles of the race all is sterling and real we are aware that the elevated reflection and the meditative stroke are not due to mere composition but did actually pass through her mind as the suggestive wonders passed before her eyes and hence there is no jar as we find a little homily on the advantage of being able to iron your own linen on a nile boat followed by a lofty page on the mighty pair of solemn figures that gaze as from eternity on time amid the sand at thebes the whole one may say again is sterling and real both the elevation and the homeliness the student of the history of opinion may find some interest in comparing miss martineaus work with the famous book ruins or meditations on the revolutions of empires in which volney between fifty and sixty years before had drawn equally dissolvent conclusions with her own from the same panorama of the dead ages perhaps miss martineaus history is not much better than volneys but her brisk sense is preferable to volneys high à priori declamation and artificial rhetoric  before starting for the east miss martineau had settled a new plan of life for herself and built a little house where she thought she could best carry her plan out to this little house she returned and it became her cherished home for the long remainder of her days london during the years of her first success had not been without its usual attractions to the newcomer but she had always been alive to the essential incompleteness the dispersion the want of steadfast selfcollection in a life much passed in london society and we may believe that the five austere and lonely years at tynemouth with their evening outlook over the busy waters of the harbourbar into the stern faroff sea may have slowly bred in her an unwillingness to plunge again into the bustling triviality the gossip the distracting lightness of the world of splendid fireflies to have discerned the pale horse so near and for so long a space awakens new moods and strangely alters the old perspectives of our life yet it would imply a misunderstanding of harriet martineaus character to suppose that she turned her back upon london and built her pretty hermitage at ambleside in anything like the temper of jean jacques rousseau she was far too positive a spirit for that and far too full of vivid and concentrated interest in men and their doings it would be unjust to think of harriet martineau as having no ear for the inner voices yet her whole nature was objective it turned to practice and not to reverie she had her imaginative visions as we know and as all truly superior minds have them even though their main superiority happens to be in the practical order but her visions were limited as a landscape set in a rigid frame they had not the wings that soar and poise in the vague unbounded empyrean and she was much too sensible to think that these moods were strong or constant or absorbing enough in her case to furnish material and companionship for a life from day to day and year to year nor again was it for the sake of undisturbed acquisition of knowledge nor cultivation of her finer faculties that she sought a hermitage she was not moved by thought of the famous maxim which goethe puts into the mouth of leonore      es bildet ein talent sich in der stille     sich ein charakter in dem strom der welt  though an intense egotist in the good and respectable sense of insisting on her own way of doing things of settling for herself what it was that she was living for and of treading the path with a firm and selfreliant step yet harriet martineau was as little of an egotist as ever lived in the poor and stifling sense of thinking of the perfecting of her own culture as in the least degree worthy of ranking among endsinthemselves she settled in the lake district because she thought that there she would be most favourably placed for satisfying the various conditions which she had fixed as necessary to her scheme of life my own idea of an innocent and happy life she says was a house of my own among poor improvable neighbours with young servants whom i might train and attach to myself with pure air a garden leisure solitude at command and freedom to work in peace and quietness  it is the wisest step in her life wordsworth said when he heard that she had bought a piece of land and built a pretty house upon it and then he added the strangely unpoetic reasonbecause the value of the property will be doubled in ten years her poetic neighbour gave her a characteristic piece of advice in the same prudential vein he warned her that she would find visitors a great expense when you have a visitor he said you must do as we did you must say if you like to have a cup of tea with us you are very welcome but if you want any meat you must pay for your board miss martineau declined to carry thrift to this ungracious extremity she constantly had guests in her house and if they were all like charlotte brontë they enjoyed their visits in spite of the arbitrary ways of their energetic hostess  her manner of life during these years is pleasant to contemplate cheerful active thoroughly wholesome my habit she says was to rise at six and to take a walk returning to my solitary breakfast at halfpast seven my household orders were given for the day and all affairs settled out of doors and in by a quarter or halfpast eight when i went to work which i continued without interruption except from the post till three oclock or later when alone while my friend was with me we dined at two and that was of course the limit of my days work de tocqueville if we remember never saw his guests until after he had finished his mornings work of which he had done six hours by eleven oclock schopenhauer was still more sensitive to the jar of external interruption on that finelytuned instrument the brain after a nights repose for it was as much as his housekeepers place was worth to allow either herself or any one else to appear to the philosopher before midday after the early dinner at ambleside cottage came little bits of neighbourly business exercise and so forth it is with singular alacrity that in winter evenings i light the lamp and unroll my woolwork and meditate or dream till the arrival of the newspaper tells me that the tea has stood long enough after tea if there was news from the seat of war i called in my maids who brought down the great atlas and studied the chances of the campaign with me then there was an hour or two for montaigne or bacon or shakespeare or tennyson or some dear old biography  the only productions of this time worth mentioning are the history of the thirty years peace 1849 and the condensed version of comtes positive philosophy 1853 both of them meritorious and useful pieces of work and both of them undertaken as nearly all miss martineaus work was not from merely literary motives but because she thought that they would be meritorious and useful and because nothing more useful came into her head or under her hand at the moment the condensation of comte is easy and rapid and it is said by those who have looked very closely into it to be hardly free from some too hasty renderings it must however on the whole be pronounced a singularly intelligent and able performance the pace at which comte was able to compose is a standing marvel to all who have pondered the great and difficult art of composition it must be admitted that the author of the english version of him was in this respect no unworthy match for her original miss martineau tells us that she despatched the last three volumes which number over 1800 pages in some five months she thought the rendering of thirty pages of comte a fair mornings work if we consider the abstract and difficult nature of the matter this must be pronounced something of a feat we have not space to describe her method but any reader who happens to be interested in the mechanism of literary productions will find the passage in vol ii p 391 the history of the thirty years peace is no less astonishing an example of rapid industry from the first opening of the books to study for the history to the depositing of the ms of the first volume at press was exactly six months the second volume took six months to do with an interval of some weeks of holiday and other work  we think all this worth mentioning because it is an illustration of what is a highly important maxim namely that it is a great mistake to expend more time and labour on a piece of composition than is enough to make it serve the purpose in hand the immeasurable moment and farreachingness of the very highest kinds of literature are apt to make men who play at being students forget there are many other kinds of literature which are not in the least immeasurably farreaching but which for all that are extremely useful in their own day and generation those highly fastidious and indolent people who sometimes live at oxford and cambridge with whom indeed for the most part their high fastidiousness is only a fine name for impotence and lack of will forget that the less immortal kinds of literature are the only kinds within their own reach literature is no doubt a fine artthe finest of the artsbut it is also a practical art and it is deplorable to think how much stout instructive work might and ought to be done by people who in dreaming of ideals in prose or verse beyond their attainment end like the poor casaubon of fiction in a little pamphlet on a particle or else in mediocre poetry or else in nothing by insisting on rearing nothing short of a great monument more durable than brass they are cutting themselves off from building the useful little mudhut or some of the other modest performances by which only they are capable of serving their age it is only one volume in a million that is not meant to perish and to perish soon as flowers sunbeams and all the other brightnesses of the earth are meant to perish there are some forms of composition in which perfection is not only good but indispensable but the most are designed for the purpose of a day and if they have the degree of elaboration accuracy grasp and faithfulness that suffice for the given purpose then we may say that it is enough there is literature proper for which only two or three men and women in a generation have the true gift this cannot be too good but besides this there is a mass of honest and needful work to be done with the pen to which literary form is only accidental and in which consummate literary finish or depth is a sheer work of supererogation if miss martineau had given twice as many years as she gave months to the condensation of comte the book would not have been a whit more useful in any possible respectindeed overelaboration might easily have made it much less soand the world would have lost many other excellent if not dazzling or stupendous services  her original power she wrote of herself in that manly and outspoken obituary notice to which we have already referred was nothing more than was due to earnestness and intellectual clearness within a certain range with small imaginative and suggestive powers and therefore nothing approaching to genius she could see clearly what she did see and give a clear expression to what she had to say in short she could popularise while she could neither discover nor invent she could obtain and keep a firm grasp of her own views and moreover she could make them understood the function of her life was to do this and in as far as it was done diligently and honestly her life was of use all this is precisely true and her life was of great use and that makes what she says not only true but an example worth much weighing by many of those who meddle with literature  miss martineau was never tired of trying to be useful in directing and improving opinion she did not disdain the poor neighbours at her gates she got them to establish a building society she set them an example of thrifty and profitable management by her little farm of two acres and she gave them interesting and cheerful courses of lectures in the winter evenings all this time her eye was vigilant for the great affairs of the world in 1852 she began to write leading articles for the daily news and in this department her industry and her aptitude were such that at times she wrote as many as six leading articles in a week when she died it was computed that she had written sixteen hundred they are now all dead enough as they were meant to die but they made an impression that is still alive in its consequences upon some of the most important social political and economical matters of fiveandtwenty important years in what was by far the greatest of all the issues of those years the civil war in the united states harriet martineaus influence was of the most inestimable value in keeping public opinion right against the strong tide of ignorant southern sympathies in this country if she may seem to some to have been less right in her views of the crimean war we must admit that the issues were very complex and that complete assurance on that struggle is not easy to everybody even at this distance of time  to this period belong the biographic sketches which she contributed to a london newspaper they have since been collected in a single volume now in its fourth edition they are masterpieces in the style of the vignette their conciseness their clearness in fact their definiteness in judgment and above all the rightly graduated impression of the writers own personality in the background make them perfect in their kind there is no fretting away of the portrait in overmultiplicity of lines and strokes here more than anywhere else miss martineau shows the true quality of the writer the true mark of literature the sense of proportion the modulated sentence the compact and suggestive phrase there is a happy precision a pithy brevity a condensed argumentativeness and this literary skill is made more telling by the writers own evident interest and sincerity about the real lives and characters of the various conspicuous people with whom she deals it may be said that she has no subtle insight into the complexities of human nature and that her philosophy of character is rather too little analytical too downright too content with averages of motive and too external this is so in a general way but it does not spoil the charm of these sketches because the personages concerned though all of them conspicuous were for the most part commonplace in motive though more than commonplace in strength of faculty subtle analysis is wholly unreasonable in the case of miss martineau herself and she would probably have been unable to use that difficult instrument in criticising characters less downright and objective than her own  the moment of the crimean war marked an alarming event in her own life the doctors warned her that she had a heart disease which would end her days suddenly and soon miss martineau at once set her affairs in order and sat down to write her autobiography she had the manuscript put into type and the sheets finally printed off just as we now possess them but the hour was not yet the doctors had exaggerated the peril and the strong woman lived for twenty years after she had been given up she used up the stuff of her life to the very end and left no dreary remnant nor morbid waste of days she was like herself to the lastenglish practical positive yet she had thoughts and visions which were more than this we like to think of this faithful woman and veteran worker in good causes in the stroll which she always took on her terrace before retiring to rest for the night  on my terrace there were two worlds extended bright before me even when the midnight darkness hid from my bodily eyes all but the outlines of the solemn mountains that surround our valley on three sides and the clear opening to the lake on the south in the one of those worlds i saw now the magnificent coast of massachusetts in autumn or the flowery swamps of louisiana or the forests of georgia in spring or the illinois prairie in summer or the blue nile or the brown sinai or the gorgeous petra or the view of damascus from the salahiey or the grand canal under a venetian sunset or the black forest in twilight or malta in the glare of noon or the broad desert stretching away under the stars or the red sea tossing its superb shells on shore in the pale dawn that is one world all comprehended within my terrace wall and coming up into the light at my call the other and finer scenery is of that world only beginning to be explored of science it is truly an exquisite pleasure to dream after the toil of study on the sublime abstractions of mathematics the transcendent scenery unrolled by astronomy the mysterious invisible forces dimly hinted to us by physics the new conception of the constitution of matter originated by chemistry and then the inestimable glimpses opened to us in regard to the nature and destiny of man by the researches into vegetable and animal organisation which are at length perceived to be the right path of inquiry into the highest subjects of thought wondrous beyond the comprehension of any one mind is the mass of glorious facts and the series of mighty conceptions laid open but the shadow of the surrounding darkness rests upon it all the unknown always engrosses the greater part of the field of vision and the awe of infinity sanctifies both the study and the dream  it would be a pity if difference of opinion upon subjects of profound difficulty remoteness and manifold perplexity were to prevent any one from recognising in such words and such moods as these what was in spite of some infirmities a character of many large thoughts and much generous purpose and with this feeling we may part from her
