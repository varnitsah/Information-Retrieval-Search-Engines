pointing to the spring      here where the water burst from under the heel      of the sun man mounting into the sky       war chief leads the way up the hillside      to the spring and signals to the old man      to begin       old man      when the world was in the making      here within the mighty forest      came the sun man every morning      white and shining was the sun man      blue his eyes were as the skyblue      bright his hair was as dry grass is      warm his eyes were as the sun is      fruit and flower were in his glances      all he looked on grew and sprouted      as these trees we see about us      mightiest trees in all the forest      for the sun man looked upon them       where his glance fell grasses seeded      where his feet fell sprang upstarting      buckeye woods and hazel thickets      berry bushes manzanita      till his pathway was a garden      flowing after like a river      laughing into bud and blossom      there was never frost nor famine      and the nishinam were happy      singing dancing through the seasons      never cold and never hungered      when the sun man lived among us       but the foxes mean and cunning      hating nishinam and all men      laid their snares within this forest      caught the sun man in the morning      with their ropes of sinew caught him      bound him down to steal his wisdom      and become themselves bright sun men      warm of glance and fruitfulfooted      masters of the frost and famine       swiftly the coyote running      came to aid the fallen sun man      swiftly killed the cunning foxes      swiftly cut the ropes of sinew      swiftly the coyote freed him       but the sun man in his anger      lightning flashing thunderthrowing      loosed the frost and fanged the

break into a wailing inarticulate      chant swaying their bodies to the      accent the men join them somewhat      reluctantly all save red cloud who      betrays vexation and war chief who      betrays truculence       shaman leading the rising frenzy with      convulsive shiverings and tremblings tears      of his skin garments so that he is quite      naked save for a girdle of eagleclaws      about his thighs his long black hair      flies about his face with an abruptness      that is startling he ceases all movement      and stands erect rigid this is greeted      with a low moaning that slowly dies      away        chant of prophecy       shaman      the sun never grows cold      the sun man is like the sun      his anger never grows cold      the sun man will return      the
