contains the six metrical tales which were composed within the years 1812 and 1815 the hebrew melodies and the minor poems of 18091816 with the exception of the first fifteen poems 18091811chansons de voyage as they might be calledthe volume as a whole was produced on english soil beginning with the giaour which followed in the wake of childe harold and shared its triumph and ending with the illomened domestic pieces or poems of the separation the poems which byron wrote in his own country synchronize with his popularity as a poet by the acclaim and suffrages of his own countrymen his greatest work by which his lasting fame has been established and by which his relative merits as a great poet will be judged in the future was yet to come but the work which made his name which is stamped with his signmanual and which has come to be regarded as distinctively and characteristically byronic preceded maturity and achievement  no poet of his own or other times not walter scott not tennyson not mr kipling was ever in his own lifetime so widely so amazingly popular thousands of copies of the talesof the bride of abydos of the corsair of larawere sold in a day and edition followed edition month in and month out everywhere men talked about the noble authorin the capitals of europe in literary circles in the united states in the east indies he was the glass of fashion  the observd of all observers the swayer of sentiment the master and creator of popular emotion no other english poet before or since has divided mens attention with generals and seacaptains and statesmen has attracted and fascinated and overcome the world so entirely and potently as lord byron  it was childe harold the unfinished immature childe harold and the turkish and other tales which raised this sudden and deafening storm of applause when the century was young and now at its close i refer of course to the tales not to byrons poetry as a whole which in spite of the critics has held and still holds its own are ignored if not forgotten passed over if not despisedwhich but few know thoroughly and very few are found to admire or to love ubi lapsus quid feci might the questioning spirit of the author exclaim with regard to his harrys and larrys pilgrims and pirates who once held the field and now seem to have gone under in the struggle for poetical existence  to what then may we attribute the passing away of interest and enthusiasm to the caprice of fashion to an insistence on a more faultless technique to a nicer taste in ethical sentiment to a preference for a subtler treatment of loftier themes more certainly and more particularly i think to the blurring of outline and the blotting out of detail due to lapse of time and the shifting of the intellectual standpoint  however much the charm of novelty and the contagion of enthusiasm may have contributed to the success of the turkish and other tales it is in the last degree improbable that our grandfathers and greatgrandfathers were enamoured not of a reality but of an illusion born of ignorance or of vulgar bewilderment they were carried away because they breathed the same atmosphere as the singer and being undistracted by ethical or grammatical or metrical offences they not only read these poems with avidity but understood enough of what they read to be touched by their vitality to realize their verisimilitude  tout comprendre cest tout pardonner nay more the knowledge the comprehension of essential greatness in art in nature or in man is not to know that there is aught to forgive but that sufficing knowledge which the reader of average intelligence brings with him for the comprehension and appreciation of contemporary literature has to be bought at the price of close attention and patient study when the subjectmatter of a poem and the modes and movements of the poets consciousness are alike unfamiliar  criticism however subtle however suggestive however luminous will not bridge over the gap between the past and the present will not supply the sufficing knowledge it is delightful and interesting and in a measure instructive to know what great poets of his own time and of ours have thought of byron how he strikes them but unless we are ourselves saturated with his thought and style unless we learn to breathe his atmosphere by reading the books which he read picturing to ourselves the scenes which he sawunless we aspire to his ideals and suffer his limitations we are in no way entitled to judge his poems whether they be good or bad  byrons metrical tales come before us in the guise of light reading and may be easily criticized as melodramaticthe heroines conventional puppets the heroes reduplicated reflections of the authors personality the oriental properties loosely arranged and somewhat stageworn a thorough and sympathetic study of these once extravagantly lauded and now belittled poems will not perhaps reverse the deliberate judgment of later generations but it will display them for what they are bold and rapid and yet exact presentations of the gorgeous east vivid and fresh from the hand of the great artist who conceived them out of the abundance of memory and observation and wrought them into shape with the pen of a ready writer they will be once more recognized as works of genius an integral portion of our literary inheritance which has its proper value and will repay a more assiduous and a finer husbandry  i have once more to acknowledge the generous assistance of the officials of the british museum and more especially of mr a g ellis of the oriental printed books and mss department who has afforded me invaluable instruction in the compilation of the notes to the giaour and bride of abydos  i have also to thank mr r l binyon of the department of prints and drawings for advice and assistance in the selection of illustrations  i desire to express my cordial thanks to the registrar of the copyright office stationers hall to

oh never talk again to me       of northern climes and british ladies     it has not been your lot to seea       like me the lovely girl of cadiz     although her eye be not of blue       nor fair her locks like english lasses     how far its own expressive hue       the languid azure eye surpasses                      2      prometheuslike from heaven she stole       the fire that through those silken lashes     in darkest glances seems to roll       from eyes that cannot hide their flashes     and as along her bosom steal       in lengthened flow her raven tresses     youd swear each clustering lock could feel       and curled to give her neck caresses                      3      our english maids are long to woob2       and frigid even in possession     and if their charms be

girl of cadiz                      4      the spanish maid is no coquette       nor joys to see a lover tremble     and if she love or if she hate       alike she knows not to dissemble     her heart can neer be bought or sold       howeer it beats it beats sincerely     and though it will not bend to gold       twill love you long and love you dearly                      5      the spanish girl that meets your love       neer taunts you with a mock denial     for every thought is bent to prove       her passion in the hour of trial     when thronging foemen menace spain       she dares the deed and shares the danger     and should her lover press the plain       she hurls the spear her loves avenger                      6      and when beneath the evening star       she mingles in the gay bolero3     or sings to her attuned guitar       of christian knight or moorish hero     or counts her beads with fairy hand       beneath the twinkling rays of hesperc     or joins devotions choral band       to chaunt the sweet and hallowed vesper                      7      in each her charms the heart must move       of all who venture to behold her     then let not maids less fair reprove       because her bosom is not colder     through many a clime tis mine to roam       where many a soft and melting maid is     but none abroad and few at home       may match the darkeyed

the current was computed by those on board the frigate at upwards of four english miles though the actual breadth is barely one the rapidity of the current is such that no boat can row directly across and it may in some measure be estimated from the circumstance of the whole distance being accomplished by one of the parties in an hour and five and by the other in an hour and ten minutes the water was extremely cold from the melting of the mountain snows about three weeks before in april we had made an attempt but having ridden all the way from the troad the same morning and the water being of an icy chillness we found it necessary to postpone the completion till the frigate anchored below the castles when we swam the straits as just stated entering a considerable way above the european and landing below the asiatic fort le chevalier says that a young jew swam the same distance for his mistress and olivier mentions its having been done by a neapolitan but our consul tarragona remembered neither of these circumstances and tried to dissuade us from the attempt a number of the salsettes crew were known to have accomplished a greater distance and the only thing that surprised me was that

addressed under this name really existed or was an imaginary      being have given rise to much speculation and discussion of a more      or less futile kind       this difficulty is now incapable of

existed and the date of whose death almost      coincided with lord byrons landing in england in 1811 on one      occasion he showed lady byron a beautiful tress of hair which she      understood to

    lauderdale messrs adams and sheridan       the prince regent expressed his surprise and mortification at      the conduct of lords grey and grenville who had replied      unfavourably to a letter addressed by the pr to the duke of york      suggesting an united administration lord lauderdale thereupon      with a freedom unusual in courts asserted that the reply did not      express the opinions of lords grey and grenville only but of every      political friend of that way of thinking and that he had been      present at and assisted in the drawingup and that every sentence      had

december 12 1821 life p 545 byron avows that the giaour story had actually some foundation on facts soon after the poem appeared june 5 1813 a story was circulated by some gentlewomen  a little too close to the text letters to moore september 1 1813 letters 1898 ii 258 and in order to put himself right with his friends or posterity byron wrote to his friend lord sligo who in july 1810 was anchored off athens in a twelvegun brig with a crew of fifty men see letters 1898 i 289 note 1 requesting him to put on paper not so much the narrative of an actual event but what he had heard at athens about the affair of that girl who was so near being put an end to while you were there according to the letter which moore published life p 178 and which is reprinted in the present issue letters 1898 ii 257 byron interposed on behalf of a girl who in compliance with the strict letter of the mohammedan law had been sewn in a sack and was about to be thrown into the sea i was told adds lord sligo that you then conveyed her in safety to the convent and despatched her off at night to thebes the letter which byron characterizes as curious is by no means conclusive and to judge from the designedly mysterious references in the journal dated november 16 and december 5 and in the second postscript to a letter to professor clarke dated december 15 1813 letters 1898 ii 321 361 311 the circumstances which were the groundwork are not before us an event says john wright ed 1832 ix 145 in which lord byron was personally concerned undoubtedly supplied the groundwork of this tale but for the story so circumstantially set forth see medwins conversations 1824 pp 121 124 of his having been the lover of this female slave there is no foundation the girl whose life the poet saved at athens was not we are assured by sir john hobhouse westminster review january 1825 iii 27 an object of his lordships attachment but of that of his turkish servant nevertheless whatever byron may have told hobhouse who had returned to england and he distinctly says letters 1898 ii 393 that he did not tell him everything he avowed to clarke that he had been led to the waters edge and confided to his diary that to describe the feelings of that situation was impossibleit is icy even to recollect them  for the allusive and fragmentary style of the giaour the voyage of columbus which rogers published in 1812 is in part responsible it is sudden in its transitions wrote the author in the preface to the first edition  leaving much to be imagined by the reader the story or a part of it is told by a fellowseaman of columbus who had turned eremite in his old age and though the narrative itself is in heroic verse the prologue and epilogue as they may be termed are in the romance or balladmeasure of the spanish the resemblance between the two poems is certainly more than accidental on the other hand a vivid and impassioned description of oriental scenery and customs was as gifford observed new and original and though by his own admission byron was indebted to vathek or rather s henleys notes to vathek and to dherbelots bibliothèque orientale for allusions and details the atmosphere could only have been reproduced by the creative fancy of an observant and enthusiastic traveller who had lived under eastern skies and had come within ken of eastern life and sentiment  in spite however of his love for the subjectmatter of his poem and the facility surprising even to himself with which he spun his rhymes byron could not persuade himself that a succession of fragments would sort themselves and grow into a complete and connected whole if his thricerepeated depreciation of the giaour is not entirely genuine it is plain that he misdoubted himself writing to murray august 26 1813 he says i have but with some difficulty not added any more to this snake of a poem which has been lengthening its rattles every month to moore september 1 the giaour i have added to a good deal but still in foolish fragments and again to moore september 8 by the coach i send you a copy of that awful pamphlet the giaour  but while the author doubted and apologized or deprecated his loves excess in words of wrong and bitterness the public read and edition followed edition with bewildering speed  the giaour was reviewed by george agar ellis in the quarterly no xxxi january 1813 published february 11 1813 and in the edinburgh review by jeffrey no 54 january 1813 published february 24 1813    bibliographical note on the giaour  the bibliography of the giaour is beset with difficulties and it is doubtful if more than approximate accuracy can be secured the composition of the entire poem in its present shape was accomplished within six months maynovember 1813 but during that period it was expanded by successive accretions from a first draft of 407 lines extant in ms to a seventh edition of 1334 lines a proof is extant of an edition of 28 pages containing 460 lines itself an enlargement on the ms but whether as a note in the handwriting of the late mr murray affirms this was or was not published is uncertain a portion of a second proof of 38 pages has been preserved but of the publication of the poem in this state there is no record on june 5 a first edition of 41 pages containing 685 lines was issued and of this numerous copies are extant at the end of june or the

regrets to vivid recollections diary december 5 1813 letters ii 361 to distract his dreams from  diary november 16 for the sake of employment letter to moore november 30 1813 he had been staying

abydos or zuleika as it was first entitled was written early in november in four nights diary november 16 or in a week letter to gifford november 12the reckoning goes for littleas a counterirritant to the pain and distress of amour interrompu  the confession or apology is eminently characteristic whilst the giaour was still in process of evolution still lengthening its rattles another turkish poem is offered to the public and the natural explanation that the author is in vein and can score another trick is felt to be inadequate and dishonouringto withdraw myself from myself he confides to his diarynovember 27 has ever been my sole my entire my sincere motive for scribbling at all  it is more than probable that in his twentysixth year byron had not attained to perfect selfknowledge but there is no reason to question his sincerity that byron loved to surround himself with mystery and to dissociate himself from the general is true enough but it does not follow that at all times and under all circumstances he was insincere once a poseur always a poseur is a roughandready formula not invariably applicable even to a poet  but the bride of abydos was a tonic as well as a styptic like the giaour it embodied a personal experience and recalled a country replete with the darkest and brightest but always the most lively colours of my memory diary december 5 1813  in a letter to galt december 11 1813 letters 1898 ii 304 reprinted from life of byron pp 181 182 byron maintains that the first part of the bride was drawn from observations of his own from existence he had it would appear intended to make the story turn on the guilty love of a brother for a sister a tragic incident of life in a harem which had come under his notice during his travels in the east but on second thoughts had reflected that he lived two centuries at least too late for the subject and that not even the authority of the finest works of the greeks or of schiller in the bride of messina or of alfieri in mirra in modern times would sanction the intrusion of the μισητὸν misêto\n into english literature the early drafts and variants of the ms do not afford any evidence of this alteration of the plot which as byron thought was detrimental to the poem as a work of art but the undoubted fact that the bride of abydos as well as the giaour embody recollections of actual scenes and incidents which had burnt themselves into the memory of an eyewitness accounts not only for the fervent heat at which these turkish tales were written but for the extraordinary glamour which they threw over contemporary readers to whom the local colouring was new and attractive and who were not out of conceit with good monsieur melancholy  byron was less dissatisfied with his second turkish tale than he had been with the giaour he apologizes for the rapidity with which it had been composedstans pede in unobut he announced to murray november 20 that he was doing his best to beat the giaour and november 29 he appraises the bride as my first entire composition of any length  moreover he records november 15 with evident gratification the approval of his friend hodgson a very sincere and by no means at times a flattering critic of mine and modestly accepts the praise of such masters of letters as mr canning hookham frere heber lord holland and of the traveller edward daniel clarke  the

darkest but always most lively colours of my memory journal december 5 1813 letters 1898 ii 291 361                                  the corsair                                  a tale           i

final additions and the first edition of the bride of abydos were published on the twentyninth of november 1813 in less than three weeks december 18 byron began the corsair and completed the fair copy of the first draft by the last day of the year the corsair in all but its final shape together with the sixth edition of the bride of abydos the seventh of childe harold and the ninth of the giaour was issued on the first of february 1814  a letter from john murray to lord byron dated february 3 1814 memoir of john murray 1891 i 223 presents a vivid picture of a great literary triumph       my lordi have been unwilling to write until i had something to      say i am most happy to tell you that your last poem iswhat      mr southeys is calleda carmen triumphale never in my      recollection has any work  excited such a ferment  i sold on      the day of publicationa thing perfectly unprecedented10000      copies mr moore says it is masterlya wonderful performance      mr hammond mr heber disraeli every one who comes  declare      their unlimited approbation mr ward was here with mr gifford      yesterday and mingled his admiration with the rest  and gifford      did what i never knew him do beforehe repeated several stanzas      from memory particularly the closing stanza      his death yet dubious deeds too widely known       i have the highest encomiums in letters from croker and mr hay      but i rest most upon the warm feeling it has created in giffords      critic heart you have no notion of the sensation which the      publication has occasioned and my only regret is that you were not      present to witness it  for some time before and after the poem appeared byron was as he told leigh hunt february 9 1814 letters 1899 iii 27 snowbound and thawswamped in the valley of the shadow of newstead abbey and it was not till he had returned to town that he resumed his journal and bethought him of placing on record some dark sayings with regard to the story of the corsair and the personality of conrad under date february 18 1814 he writes       the corsair has been conceived written published etc since      i last took up this journal last day but one they tell me it      has great success it was written con amore ie during the      reign of lady frances wedderburn webster and much from      existence  and again journal march 10 letters 1898 ii 399       he hobhouse told me an odd reportthat i am the actual      conrad the veritable corsair and that part of my travels are      supposed to have passed in privacy sicpiracy um people      sometimes hit near the truth but never the whole truth h dont      know what i was about the year after he left the levant nor does      any onenornornorhowever it is a liebut i doubt the      equivocation of the fiend that lies like truth  very little weight can be attached to these i could an i would pronouncements deliberately framed to provoke curiosity and destined no doubt sooner or later to see the light but the fact remains that conrad is not a mere presentation of byron in a fresh disguise or the pirates tale altogether a painting of the imagination  that the corsair is founded upon fact is argued at some length by the author an english gentleman in the greek military service of the life writings opinions and times of the r h george gordon noel byron which was published in 1825 the point of the story i 197201 which need not be repeated at length is that byron on leaving constantinople and reaching the island of zea july 1810 visited strolled about the islands of the archipelago in company with a venetian gentleman who had turned buccaneer malgré lui and whose history and adventures amatory and piratical prefigured and inspired the gestes of conrad the tale must be taken for what it is worth but it is to be remarked that it affords a clue to byrons mysterious entries in a journal which did not see the light till 1830 five years after the english gentleman published his volumes of gossiping anecdote it may too be noted that although in his correspondence of 1810 1811 there is no mention of any tour among the isles of greece in a letter to moore dated february 2 1815 letters 1899 iii 176 byron recalls the interesting white squalls and short seas of archipelago memory  how far byron may have drawn on personal experience for his picture of a pirate chez lui it is impossible to say but during the year 180911 when he was travelling in greece the exploits of lambros katzones and other greek pirates sailing under the russian flag must have been within the remembrance and on the lips of the islanders and the patriots of the mainland the pirates island from which ariadnes isle line 444 was visible may be intended for paros or antiparos  for the inception of conrad see canto i stanza ii the paradoxical hero an assortment rather than an amalgam of incongruous characteristics byron may perhaps have been in some measure indebted to the description of malefort junior in massingers unnatural combat act i sc 2 line 20 sq      i have sat with him in his cabin a day together                                               sigh he did often as if inward grief     and melancholy at that instant would     choke up his vital spirits                    when from the maintop     a sails descried all thoughts that do concern     himself laid by no lion pinched with hunger     rouses himself more fiercely from his den     then he comes on the deck and then how wisely     he gives directions etc  the corsair together with the bride of abydos was reviewed by jeffrey in the edinburgh review of april 1814 vol xxiii p 198 and together with lara by george agar ellis in the quarterly review of july 1814 vol ii p 428    bibliographical note on the corsair  in comparison with the giaour the additions made to the corsair whilst it was passing through the press were inconsiderable the original ms which numbers 1737 lines is probably the fair copy of a number of loose sheets which have not been preserved the erasures are few and far between and the variations between the copy and the text are neither numerous nor important  in one of the latest revises stanza x was added to the first canto the last four lines of stanza xi first appeared in the seventh edition  the second canto suffered no alteration except the substitution of lines 11311133 for two lines which were expunged  larger additions were made to the third canto lines 12991375 or stanza v included in a revise dated january 6 1814 stanzas xvii and xxiii numbering respectively 77 32 and 16 lines and the two last lines of stanza x 127 lines in all represent the difference between the text as it now stands and the original ms  in a note to byrons poetical works 1832 ix 257 it is stated that the corsair was begun on the 18th and finished on the 31st of december 1813 in the introduction to the corsair prefixed to the library edition the poem is said to have been composed in ten days at the rate of 200 lines a day the first page of the ms is dated 27th of december 1813 and the last page december 31 1813 january 1 1814 it is probable that the composition of the first draft was begun on the 18th and finished on the 27th of december and that the work of transcription occupied the last five days of the month stanza v of canto iii reached the publisher on the 6th and stanzas xvii and xxiii on the 11th and 12th of january 1814  the first edition amounted to 1859 lines the numeration owing to the inclusion of broken lines is given as 1863 and falls short of the existing text by the last four lines of stanza xi it contains the first dedication to moore and numbers 100 pages to the second edition which numbers 108 pages the following poems were appended  to a lady weeping  from the turkish  sonnet to genevra thine eyes blue tenderness etc  sonnet to genevra thy cheek is pale with thought etc  inscription on the monument of a newfoundland dog  farewell  these occasional poems were not appended to the third edition which only numbered 100 pages but they reappeared in the fourth and subsequent editions  the seventh edition contained four additional lines the last four of stanza xi and a note unnumbered to line 226 in defence of the vraisemblance of the corsairs misanthropy the ninth edition numbered 112 pages the additional matter consists of a long note to the last line of the poem linked with one virtue and a thousand crimes on the pirates of barataria  twentyfive thousand copies of the corsair were sold between january and march 1814 an eighth edition of fifteen hundred copies was printed in march and sold before the end of the year a ninth edition of three thousand copies was printed in the beginning of 1815    to thomas moore esq  my dear moore  i dedicate to you the last production with which i shall trespass on public patience and your indulgence for some years and i own that i feel anxious to avail myself of this latest and only opportunity of adorning my pages with a name consecrated by unshaken public principle and the most undoubted and various talents while ireland ranks you among the firmest of her patriots while you stand alone the first of her bards in her estimation and britain repeats and ratifies the decree permit one whose only regret since our first acquaintance has been the years he had lost before it commenced to add the humble but sincere suffrage of friendship to the voice of more than one nation it will at least prove to you that i have neither forgotten the gratification derived from your society nor abandoned the prospect of its renewal whenever your leisure or inclination allows you to atone to your friends for too long an absence it is said among those friends i trust truly that you are engaged in the composition of a poem whose scene will be laid in the east none can do those scenes so much justice the wrongs of your own country194 the magnificent and fiery spirit of her sons the beauty and feeling of her daughters may there be found and collins when he denominated his oriental his irish eclogues was not aware how true at least was a part of his parallel your imagination will create a warmer sun and less clouded sky but wildness tenderness and originality are part of your national claim of oriental descent to which you have already thus far proved your title more clearly than the most zealous of your countrys antiquarians  may i add a few words on a subject on which all men are supposed to be fluent and none agreeableself i have written much and published more than enough to demand a longer silence than i now meditate but for some years to come it is my intention to tempt no further the award of gods men nor columns in the present composition i have attempted not the most difficult but perhaps the best adapted measure to our language the good old and now neglected heroic couplet the stanza of spenser is perhaps too slow and dignified for narrative though i confess it is the measure most after my own heart scott alone195 of the present generation has hitherto completely triumphed over the fatal facility of the octosyllabic verse and this is not the least victory of his fertile and mighty genius in blank verse milton thomson and our dramatists are the beacons that shine along the deep but warn us from the rough and barren rock on which they are kindled the heroic couplet is not the most popular measure certainly but as i did not deviate into the other from a wish to flatter what is called public opinion i shall quit it without further apology and take my chance once more with that versification in which i have hitherto published nothing but compositions whose former circulation is part of my present and will be of my future regret  with regard to my story and stories in general i should have been glad to have rendered my personages more perfect and amiable if possible inasmuch as i have been sometimes criticised and considered no less responsible for their deeds and qualities than if all had been personal be it soif i have deviated into the gloomy vanity of drawing from self the pictures are probably like since they are unfavourable and if not those who know me are undeceived and those who do not i have little interest in undeceiving i have no particular desire that any but my acquaintance should think the author better than the beings of his imagining but i cannot help a little surprise and perhaps amusement at some odd critical exceptions in the present instance when i see several bards far more deserving i allow in very reputable plight and quite exempted from all participation in the faults of those heroes who nevertheless might be found with little more morality than the giaour and perhapsbut noi must admit childe harold to be a very repulsive personage and as to his identity those who like it must give him whatever alias they please196  if however it were worth while to remove the impression it might be of some service to me that the man who is alike the delight of his readers and his friends the poet of all circles and the idol of his own permits me here and elsewhere to subscribe myself                        most truly                          and affectionately                             his obedient servant                                      byron january 2

he would take his choice moore chose the original dedication which was accordingly prefixed to the first edition the alternative ran as follows  january 7th 1814  my dear moore  i had written to you a long letter of dedication which i suppress because though it contained something relating to you which every one had been glad to hear yet there was too much about politics and poesy and all things whatsoever ending with that topic on which most men are fluent and none very amusingones self it might have been rewritten but to what purpose my praise could add nothing to your wellearned and firmly established fame and with my most hearty admiration of your talents and delight in your conversation you are already acquainted in availing myself of your friendly permission to inscribe this poem to

admission or a denial of the opinion to which it refers but lord byron certainly did the public injustice if he supposed it imputed to him the criminal actions with which many of his heroes were stained men no more expected to meet in lord byron the corsair who knew himself a villain than they looked for the hypocrisy of kehama on the shores of the derwent water yet even in the features of

tournefort clarke choiseulgouffier and other travellers  239 296 that the point of honour which is represented in one instance of conrads character has not been carried beyond the bounds of probability may perhaps be in some degree confirmed by the following anecdote of a brother buccaneer in the year 1814our readers have all seen the account of the enterprise against the pirates of barataria but few we believe were informed of the situation history or nature of that establishment for the information of such as were unacquainted with it we have procured from a friend the following interesting narrative of the main facts of which he has personal knowledge and which cannot fail to interest some of our readersbarataria is a bayou or a narrow arm of the gulf of mexico it runs through a rich but very flat country until it reaches within a mile of the mississippi river fifteen miles below the city of new orleans this bayou has branches almost innumerable in which persons can lie concealed from the severest scrutiny it communicates with three lakes which lie on the southwest side and these with the lake of the same name and which lies contiguous to the sea where there is an island formed by the two arms of this lake and the sea the east and west points of this island were fortified in the year 1811 by a band of pirates under the command of one monsieur la fitte a large majority of these outlaws are of that class of the population of the state of louisiana who fled from the island of st domingo during the troubles there and took refuge in the island of cuba and when the last war between france and spain commenced they were compelled to leave that island with the short notice of a few days without ceremony they entered the united states the most of them the state of louisiana with all the negroes they had possessed in cuba they were notified by the governor of that state of the clause in the constitution which forbade the importation of slaves but at the same time received the assurance of the governor that he would obtain if possible the approbation of the general government for their retaining this propertythe island of barataria is situated about lat 29 deg 15 min lon 92 30 and is as remarkable for its health as for the superior scale and shell fish with which its waters abound the chief of this horde like charles de moor had mixed with his many vices some transcendant virtues in the year 1813 this party had from its turpitude and boldness claimed the attention of the governor of louisiana and to break up the establishment he thought proper to strike at the head he therefore offered a reward of 500 dollars for the head of monsieur la fitte who was well known to the inhabitants of the city of new orleans from his immediate connection and his once having been a fencingmaster in that city of great reputation which art he learnt in buonapartes army where he was a captain the reward which was offered by the governor for the head of la fitte was answered by the offer of a reward from the latter of 15000 for the head of the governor the governor ordered out a company to march from the city to la fittes island and to burn and destroy all the property and to bring to the city of new orleans all his banditti this company under the command of a man who had been the intimate associate of this bold captain approached very near to the fortified island before he saw a man or heard a sound until he heard a whistle not unlike a boatswains call then it was he found himself surrounded by armed men who had emerged from the secret avenues which led to this bayou here it was that this modern charles de moor developed his few noble traits for to this man who had come to destroy his life and all that was dear to him he not only spared his life but offered him that which would have made the honest soldier easy for the remainder of his days which was indignantly refused he then with the approbation of his captor returned to the city this circumstance and some concomitant events proved that this band of pirates was not to be taken by land our naval force having always been small in that quarter exertions for the destruction of this illicit establishment could not be expected from them until augmented for an officer of the navy with most of the gunboats on that station had to retreat from an overwhelming force of la fittes so soon as the augmentation of the navy authorised an attack one was made the overthrow of this banditti has been the result and now this almost invulnerable point and key to new orleans is clear of an enemy it is to be hoped the government will hold it by a strong military forceamerican newspaper  the story of the pirates of barataria which an american print the national intelligencer was the first to make public is quoted in extenso by the weekly messenger published at boston of november 4 1814 it is remarkable that a tale which was destined to pass into the domain of historical romance should have been instantly seized upon and turned to account by byron whilst it was as yet halftold while the legend was still in the making jean lafitte the francoamerican conrad was born either at bayonne or bordeaux circ 1780 emigrated with his elder brother pierre and settled at new orleans in 1809 as a blacksmith legitimate trade was flat but the delta of the mississippi with its labyrinth of creeks and islands and bayous teemed with pirates or merchantsmugglers accordingly under the nominal sanction of letters of marque from the republic of cartagena and as belligerents of spain the brothers who had taken up their quarters on grande terre an island to the east of the grand pass or channel of the bay of barataria swept the gulph of mexico with an organised flotilla of privateers and acquired vast booty in the way of specie and living cargoes of claves hence the proclamation of the governor of louisiana w c c claiborne in which november 24 1813 he offered a sum of 500 for the capture of jean lafitte for the sequel of this first act of the drama the american newspaper is the sole authority the facts however if facts they be which are pieced together by charles Étienne arthur gayarré in the history of louisiana 1885 iv 301 sq and in two articles contributed to the american magazine of history october and november 1883 are as curious and romantic as the legend it would appear that early in september 1814 a british officer colonel e nicholls made overtures to jean lafitte offering him the rank of captain in the british army a grant of lands and a sum of 30000 if he would join forces with the british squadron then engaged in an attack on the coast of louisiana lafitte begged for time to consider colonel nichollss proposal but immediately put himself in communication with claiborne offering on condition of immunity for past offences to place his resources at the disposal of the united states claibornes reply to this patriotic offer seems to have been to despatch a strong naval force under commander daniel patterson with orders to exterminate the pirates and seize their fort on grande terre and on this occasion though the brothers escaped the authorities were successful a proclamation was issued by general andrew jackson in which the pirates were denounced as hellish banditti and to all appearances their career was at an end but circumstances were in their favour and a few weeks later jackson not only went back on his own mandate but accepted the alliance and services of the brothers lafitte and their captains at the siege of new orleans january 8 1815 finally when peace with great britain was concluded president madison publicly acknowledged the unequivocal traits of courage and fidelity which had been displayed by the brothers lafitte and the once proscribed band of outlaws thenceforth pierre lafitte disappears from history but jean is believed to have settled first at galveston in texas and afterwards in 1820 on the coast of yucatan whence he continued his depredations on spanish commerce he died game a pirate to the last in 1826 see for what purports to be documentary evidence of the

archbishop blackbourne 16581743 and as in some measure connected with the profession of the hero of the foregoing poem i cannot resist the temptation of extracting itthere is something mysterious in the history and character of dr blackbourne the former is but imperfectly known and report has even asserted he was a buccaneer and that one of his brethren in that profession having asked on his arrival in england what had become of his old chum blackbourne was answered he is archbishop of york we are informed that blackbourne was installed subdean of exeter in 1694 which office he resigned in 1702 but after his successor lewis barnets death in 1704 he regained it in the following year he became dean and in 1714 held with it the archdeanery ie archdeaconry of cornwall he was consecrated bishop of exeter february 24 1716 and translated to york november 28 1724 as a reward according to court scandal for uniting george i to the duchess of munster this however appears to have been an unfounded calumny as archbishop he behaved with great prudence and was equally respectable as the guardian of the revenues of the see rumour whispered he retained the vices of his youth and that a passion for the fair sex formed an item in the list of his weaknesses but so far from being convicted by seventy witnesses he does not appear to have been directly criminated by one in short i look upon these aspersions as the effects of mere malice how is it possible a buccaneer should have been so good a scholar as blackbourne certainly was he who had so perfect a knowledge of the classics particularly of the greek tragedians as to be able to read them with the same ease as he could shakespeare must have taken great pains to acquire the learned languages and have had both leisure and good masters but he was undoubtedly educated at christchurch college oxford he is allowed to have been a pleasant man this however was turned against him by its being said he gained more hearts than souls  walpole in his memoirs of the reign of king george ii 1847 i 87 who makes himself the mouthpiece of these calumnies says that hayter bishop of norwich was a natural son of blackbourne the jolly old archbishop of york who had all the manners of a man of quality though he had been a buccaneer and was a clergyman but he retained nothing of his first profession except his seraglio

declined upon the kingdom of elba on the next day april 10 he wrote two notes to murray to inform him that he had written an ode on the fall of napoleon that murray could print it or not as he pleased but that if it appeared by itself it was to be published anonymously a first edition consisting of fifteen stanzas and numbering fourteen pages was issued on the 16th of april 1814 a second edition followed immediately but as publications of less than a sheet were liable to the stamp tax on newspapers at murrays request another stanza the fifth was inserted in a later between the second and the twelfth edition and by this means the pamphlet was extended to seventeen pages the concluding stanzas xvii xviii xix which moore gives in a note life p 249 were not printed in byrons lifetime but were first included in a separate poem in murrays edition of 1831 and first appended to the ode in the seventeenvolume edition of 1832  although he had stipulated that the ode should be published

promises to cease writing and publishing which sound as if they were only made to be broken are somewhat exasperating and if as he pleaded in his own behalf the occasion of napoleons abdication was physically irresistible it is to be regretted that he did not swerve from his selfdenying ordinance to better purpose the note of disillusionment and disappointment in the ode is but an echo of the

to lara   the ms of lara is dated may 14 1814 the opening lines which were not prefixed to the published poem and were first printed in murrays magazine january 1887 are of the nature of a dedication they were probably written a few days after the wellknown song i speak not i trace not i breathe not thy name which was enclosed to moore in a letter dated may 4 1814 there can be little doubt that both song and dedication were addressed to lady frances wedderburn webster and that lara like the corsair and the bride of abydos was written con amore and because the poet was eating his heart away  by the 14th of june byron was able to announce to moore that lara was finished and that he had begun copying it was written owing to the length of the london season amidst balls and fooleries and after coming home from masquerades and routs in the summer of the sovereigns letter to moore june 8 1822 life p 561  by way of keeping his engagementalready broken by the publication of the ode to napoleon buonapartenot to trespass on public patience byron began by protesting june 14 that lara was not to be published separately but might be included in a third volume now collecting a fortnight later june 27 an interchange of unpublished poems between himself and rogers two cantos of darkness and dismay in return for a privately printed copy of jacqueline who is all grace and softness and poetry letter to rogers letters 1899 iii 101 suggested another and happier solution of the difficulty a coalescing with rogers and if possible moore life 1892 p 257 note 2 into a joint invasion of the public letter to moore july 8 1814 letters 1899 iii 102 but rogers hesitated and moore refused to embark on so doubtful a venture with the result that as late as the 3rd of august byron thought fit to remonstrate with murray for advertising lara and jacqueline and confessed to moore that he was still demurring and delaying and in a fuss letters 1899 iii 115 119 murray knew his man and though he waited for byrons formal and ostensibly reluctant word of command out with lara since it must be august 5 1814 letters 1899 iii 122 he admitted august 6 memoir of john murray 1891 i 230 that he had anticipated his consent and had done everything but actually deliver the copies of lara the moment he adds i received your letter for for it i waited i cut the last cord of my aerial work and at this instant 6000 copies are sold lara a tale jacqueline a tale was published on saturday august 6 1814  jacqueline is a somewhat insipid pastoral betraying the influence of the lake school more especially coleridge on a belated and irresponsive disciple and wholly out of place as contrast or foil to the melodramatic lara  no sooner had the lady as byron was pleased to call her played her part as decoy than she was discharged as emerita a week after publication august 12 1814 letters iii 125 byron told moore that murray talks of divorcing larry and jackya bad sign for the authors who will i suppose be divorced too seriously i dont care a cigar about it the divorce was soon pronounced and contrary to byrons advice september 2 1814 letters iii 131 at least four separate editions of lara were published during the autumn of 1814  the advertisement to lara and jacqueline contains the plain statement that the reader  may probably regard it lara as a sequel to the corsairan admission on the authors part which forestalls and renders nugatory any prolonged discussion on the subject it is evident that lara is conrad and that kaled the darkly delicate and mysterious page whose hand is femininely white is gulnare in a transparent and temporary disguise  if the facts which the english gentleman in the greek military service life writings etc of lord byron 1825 i 191201 gives in detail with regard to the sources of the corsair are not wholly imaginary it is possible that the original conrads determination to quit so horrible a mode of life and return to civilization may have suggested to byron the possible adventures and fate of a grand seigneur who had played the pirate in his time and resumed his ancestral dignities only to be detected and exposed by some rival or victim of his wild and lawless youth  lara was reviewed together with the corsair by george agar ellis in the quarterly review for july 1814 vol xi p 428 and in the portfolio vol xiv p 33

this same impulse would in tempting time     mislead his spirit equally to crime     so much he soared beyond or sunk beneath     the men with whom he felt condemned to breathe     and longed by good or ill to separate     himself from all who shared his mortal state     his mind abhorring this had fixed her throne     far from the world in regions of her own                          350     thus

deeply were he left at large     the general rumour ignorantly loud     the mystery dearest to the curious crowd     the seeming friendliness of him who strove     to win no confidence and wake no

duke of gandia the most interesting and particular account of it is given by burchard and is in substance as followson the eighth day of june the cardinal of valenza and the duke of gandia sons of the pope supped with their mother vanozza near the church of s pietro ad vincula several other persons being present at the entertainment a late hour approaching and the cardinal having reminded his brother that it was time to return to the apostolic palace they mounted their horses or mules with only a few attendants and proceeded together as far as the palace of cardinal ascanio sforza when the duke informed the cardinal that before he returned home he had to pay a visit of pleasure dismissing therefore all his attendants excepting his staffiero or footman and a person in a mask who had paid him a visit whilst at supper and who during the space of a month or thereabouts previous to this time had called upon him almost daily at the apostolic palace he took this person behind him on his mule and proceeded to the street of the jews where he quitted his servant directing him to remain there until a certain hour when if he did not return he might repair to the palace the duke then seated the person in the mask behind him and rode i know not whither but in that night he was assassinated and thrown into the river the servant after having been dismissed was also assaulted and mortally wounded and although he was attended with great care yet such was his situation that he could give no intelligible account of what had befallen his master in the morning the duke not having returned to the palace his servants began to be alarmed and one of them informed the pontiff of the evening excursion of his sons and that the duke had not yet made his appearance this gave the pope no small anxiety but he conjectured that the duke had been attracted by some courtesan to pass the night with her and not choosing to quit the house in open day had waited till the following evening to return home when however the evening arrived and he found himself disappointed in his expectations he became deeply afflicted and began to make inquiries from different persons whom he ordered to attend him for that purpose amongst these was a man named giorgio schiavoni who having discharged some timber from a bark in the river had remained on board the vessel to watch it and being interrogated whether he had seen any one thrown into the river on the night preceding he replied that he saw two men on foot who came down the street and looked diligently about to observe whether any person was passing that seeing no one they returned and a short time afterwards two others came and looked around in the same manner as the former no person still appearing they gave a sign to their companions when a man came mounted on a white horse having behind him a dead body the head and arms of which hung on one side and the feet on the other side of the horse the two persons on foot supporting the body to prevent its falling they thus proceeded towards that part where the filth of the city is usually discharged into the river and turning the horse with his tail towards the water the two persons took the dead body by the arms and feet and with all their strength flung it into the river the person on horseback then asked if they had thrown it in to which they replied signor si yes sir he then looked towards the river and seeing a mantle floating on the stream he enquired what it was that appeared black to which they answered it was a mantle and one of them threw stones upon it in consequence of which it sunk the attendants of the pontiff then enquired from giorgio why he had not revealed this to the governor of the city to which he replied that he had seen in his time a hundred dead bodies thrown into the river at the same place without any inquiry being made respecting them and that he had not therefore considered it as a matter of any importance the fishermen and seamen were then collected and ordered to search the river where on the following evening they found the body of the duke with his habit entire and thirty ducats in his purse he was pierced with nine wounds one of which was in his throat the others in his head body and limbs no sooner was the pontiff informed of the death of his son and that he had been thrown like filth into the river than giving way to his grief he shut himself up in a chamber and wept bitterly the cardinal of segovia and other attendants on the pope went to the door and after many hours spent in persuasions and exhortations prevailed upon him to admit them from the evening of wednesday till the following saturday the pope took no food nor did he sleep from thursday morning till the same hour on the ensuing day at length however giving way to the entreaties of his attendants he began to restrain his sorrow and to consider the injury which his own health might sustain by the further indulgence of his griefroscoes life

advertisement prefixed to murrays first edition of the hebrew melodies london 1815 the date january 1815 was appended in 1832 the poems were written at the request of the authors friend the hon d kinnaird for a selection of hebrew melodies and have been published with the music arranged by mr braham and mr nathan  byrons engagement to miss milbanke took place in september 1814 and the remainder of the year was passed in london at his chambers in the albany the socalled hebrew melodies were probably begun in the late autumn of that year and were certainly finished at seaham after his marriage had taken place in januaryfebruary 1815 it is a natural and pardonable conjecture that byron took to writing sacred or at any rate scriptural verses by way of giving pleasure and doing honour to his future wife the girl who gave to song what gold could never buy they were so to speak the firstfruits of a seemlier muse  it is probable that the greater number of these poems were in ms before it occurred to byrons friend and banker the honble douglas james william kinnaird 17881830 to make him known to isaac nathan 17921864 a youthful composer of musical farces and operatic works who had been destined by his parents for the hebrew priesthood but had broken away and after some struggles succeeded in qualifying himself as a musician  byron took a fancy to nathan and presented him with the copyright of his poetical effusions on the understanding that they were to be set to music and sung in public by john braham professional occupations prevented braham from fulfilling his part of the engagement but a guinea folio part i selections of hebrew melodies ancient and modern with appropriate symphonies and accompaniments by i braham and i nathan the poetry written expressly for the work by the right honourable lord byronwith an ornamental titlepage designed by the architect edward blore 17891879 and dedicated to the princess charlotte of waleswas published in april 1815 a second part was issued in 1816  the preface part of which was reprinted p vi by nathan in his fugitive pieces and reminiscences of lord byron london 1829 is not without interest       the hebrew melodies are a selection from the favourite airs which      are still sung in the religious ceremonies of the jews some of      these have in common with all their sacred airs been preserved by      memory and tradition alone without the assistance of written      characters their age and originality therefore must be left to      conjecture but the latitude given to the taste and genius of their      performers has been the means of engrafting on the original      melodies a certain wildness and pathos which have at length become      the chief characteristics of the sacred songs of the jews       of the poetry it is necessary to speak in order thus publicly to      acknowledge the kindness with which lord byron has condescended to      furnish the most valuable part of the work it has been our      endeavour to select such melodies as would best suit the style and      sentiment of the poetry  moore for whose benefit the melodies had been rehearsed was by no means impressed by their wildness and pathos and seems to have twitted byron on the subject or as he puts it life p 276 to have taken the liberty of laughing a little at the manner in which some of the hebrew melodies had been set to music the author of sacred songs 1814 set to airs by beethoven mozart haydn etc was a critic not to be gainsaid but from the halfcomical petulance with which he curses and sunburns letters to moore february 22 march 8 1815 letters 1899 iii 179 183 nathan and his vile ebrew nasalities it is evident that byron winced under moores chaff  apart from the merits or demerits of the setting the title hebrew melodies is somewhat misleading three lovesongs she walks in beauty like the night oh snatched away in beautys bloom and i saw thee weep still form part of the collection and in nathans folio which does not contain a spirit passed before me two fragments it is the hour when from the boughs and francesca walks in the shadow of night which were afterwards incorporated in parisina were included the fugitive pieces 1829 retain the fragments from parisina and add the following hitherto unpublished poems i speak not i trace not etc they say that hope is happiness and the genuine but rejected hebrew melody in the valley of waters we wept on the day  it is uncertain when murrays first edition appeared byron wrote to nathan with regard to the copyright in january 1815 letters 1899 iii 167 but it is unlikely that the volume was put on the market before nathans folio which was advertised for the first time in the morning chronicle april 6 1815 and it is possible that the first public announcement of the hebrew melodies as a separate issue was made in the courier june 22 1815  the hebrew melodies were reviewed in the christian observer august 1815 vol xiv p 542 in the analectic magazine october 1815 vol vi p 292 and were noticed by jeffrey the hebrew melodies though obviously inferior to lord byrons other works display a skill in versification and a mastery in diction which would have raised an inferior artist to the very summit of distinction in the edinburgh review december 1816 vol xxvii p 291                                  advertisement  the

during the years 180910 he had crossed the isthmus of corinth eight times and in a letter to his mother dated patras july 30 1810 he alludes to a recent visit to the town of corinth in company with his friend lord sligo see too his letter to coleridge dated october 27 1815 letters 1899 iii 228 it is probable that he revisited corinth more than once in the autumn of 1810 and we may infer that just as the place and its surroundingsthe temple with its two or three columns line 497 and the view across the bay from acrocorinthare sketched from memory so the story of the siege which took place in 1715 is based upon tales and legends which were preserved and repeated by the grandchildren of the besieged and were taken down from their lips there is point and meaning in the apparently insignificant line stanza xxiv line 765 we have heard the hearers say see variant i p 483 which is slipped into the description of the final catastrophe it bears witness to the fact that the siege of corinth is not a poetical expansion of a chapter in history but a heightened reminiscence of local tradition  history has indeed very little to say on the subject the anonymous compleat history of the turks london 1719 which byron quotes as an authority is meagre and inaccurate hammerpurgstall histoire de lempire ottoman 1839 xiii 269 who gives as his authorities girolamo ferrari and raschid dismisses the siege in a few lines and it was not till the publication of finlays history of greece vol v ad 14531821 in 1856 that the facts were known or reported finlays newly discovered authority was a then unpublished ms of a journal kept by benjamin brue a connection of voltaires who accompanied the grand vizier ali cumurgi as his interpreter on the expedition into the morea according to brue journal de la campagne  en 1715  paris 1870 p 18 the siege began on june 28 1715 a peremptory demand on the part of the grand vizier to surrender at discretion was answered by the venetian proveditorgeneral giacomo minetto with calm but assured defiance your menaces are useless for we are prepared to resist all your attacks and with confidence in the assistance of god we will preserve this fortress to the most serene republic god is with us nevertheless the turks made good their threat and on the 2nd of july the fortress capitulated on the following day at noon whilst a party of janissaries contrary to order were looting and pillaging in all directions the fortress was seen to be enveloped in smoke how or why the explosion happened was never discovered but the result was that some of the pillaging janissaries perished and that others to avenge their death which they attributed to venetian treachery put the garrison to the sword it was believed at the time that minetto was among the slain but as brue afterwards discovered he was secretly conveyed to smyrna and ultimately ransomed by the dutch consul  the late professor kölbing siege of corinth 1893 p xxvii in commenting on the sources of the poem suggests under reserve that byron may have derived the incident of minettos selfimmolation from an historic sourcethe siege of zsigetvar in 1566 when a multitude of turks perished from the explosion of a powder magazine which had been fired at the cost of his own life by the hungarian commander zrini  it is at least equally probable that local patriotism was in the first instance responsible for the poetic colouring and that byron supplemented the meagre and uninteresting historic details which were at his disposal by intimate knowledge of the corinthian version of the siege see memoirs of the life and writings of the right hon lord byron london 1822 p 222 and memoirs of the life and writings of lord byron by george clinton london 1825 p 284  it has been generally held that the siege of corinth was written in the second half of 1815 kölbings siege of corinth p vii it appears says john wright works 1832 x 100 by the original ms to have been begun in july 1815 and moore life p 307 who probably relied on the same authority speaks of both the siege of corinth and parisina having been produced but a short time before the separation ie spring 1816 some words which medwin conversations 1824 p 55 puts into byrons mouth point to the same conclusion byrons own testimony which is completely borne out by the ms itself dated jy ie january not july 31 1815 is in direct conflict with these statements in a note to stanza xix lines 521532 vide post pp 471473 he affirms that it was not till after these lines were written that he heard that wild and singularly original and beautiful poem christabel recited and in a letter to s t coleridge dated october 27 1815 letters 1899 iii 228 he is careful to explain that the enclosed extract from an unpublished poem ie stanza xix lines 521532  was written before not seeing your christabelle sic for that you know i never did till this day but before i heard mr scott repeat it which he did in june last and this thing was begun in january and more than half written before the summer the question of plagiarism will be discussed in an addendum to byrons note on the lines in question but subject to the correction that it was probably at the end of may see lockharts memoir of the life of sir w scott 1871 pp 311313 not in june that scott recited christabel for byrons benefit the date of the composition of the poem must be determined by the evidence of the author himself  the copy of the ms of the siege of corinth was sent to murray at the beginning probably on the 2nd the date of the copy of november and was placed in giffords hands about the same time see letter to murray november 4 1815 letters 1899 iii 245 and murrays undated letter on giffords great delight in the poem and his three critical remarks memoir of john murray 1891 i 356 as with lara byron began by insisting that the siege should not be published separately but slipped into a fourth volume of the collected works and once again possibly when he had at last made up his mind to accept a thousand guineas for his own requirements and not for other beneficiariesgodwin coleridge or maturin yielded to his publishers wishes and representations at any rate the siege of corinth and parisina which says moore during the month of january and part of february were in the hands of the printers life p 300 were published in a single volume on february 7 1816 the greater reviews were silent but notices appeared in numerous periodicals eg the monthly review february 1816 vol lxxix p 196 the eclectic review march 1816 ns vol v p 269 the european may 1816 vol lxxix p 427 the literary panorama june 1816 ns vol iv p 418 etc many of these reviews took occasion to pick out and hold up to ridicule the illogical sentences the grammatical solecisms and general imperfections of technique which marked and disfigured the siege of corinth a passage in a letter which john murray wrote to his brotherpublisher william blackwood annals of a publishing house 1897 i 53 refers to these cavillings and suggests both an apology and a retaliation       many who by numbers judge a poets song are so stupid as not to      see the powerful effect of the poems which is the great object of      poetry because they can pick out fifty careless or even bad lines      the words may be carelessly put together but this is secondary      many can write polished lines who will never reach the name of      poet you see it is all poetically conceived in lord bs mind  in such wise did murray bear testimony to byrons splendid and

place against so mighty a force thought it fit to beat a parley but while they were treating about the articles one of the magazines in the turkish camp wherein they had six hundred barrels of powder blew up by accident whereby six or seven hundred men were killed which so enraged the infidels that they would not grant any capitulation but stormed the place with so much fury that they took it and

  we were a gallant company     riding oer land and sailing oer sea     oh but we went merrily334     we forded the river and clomb the high hill     never our steeds for a day stood still     whether we lay in the cave or the shed     our sleep fell soft on the hardest bed     whether we couched in our rough capote335                         10     on the rougher plank of our gliding boat     or stretched on the beach or our saddles spread     as a pillow beneath the resting head     fresh we woke upon the morrow       all our thoughts and words had scope       we had health and we had hope     toil and travel but no sorrow     we were of all tongues and creeds     some were those who counted beads     some of mosque and some of church                                  20       and some or i missay of neither     yet through the wide world might ye search       nor find a motlier crew nor blither      but some are dead and some are gone     and some are scattered and alone     and some are rebels on the hills336       that look along epirus valleys       where freedom still at moments rallies     and pays in blood oppressions ills       and some are in a far countree                                    30     and some all restlessly at home       but never more oh never we     shall meet to revel and to roam     but those hardy days flew cheerilynz     and when they now fall drearily     my thoughts like swallows skim the main337     and bear my spirit back again     over the earth and through the air     a wild bird and a wanderer     tis this that ever wakes my strain

plagiarism by explaining that lines 521532 of stanza xix were written before he heard walter scott repeat christabel in the preceding june now as byron himself perceived perhaps for the first time when he had the ms of christabel before him the coincidence in language and style between the two passages is unquestionable and as he hoped and expected that coleridges fragment when completed would issue from the press he was anxious to avoid even the semblance of pilfering and went so far as to suggest that the passage should be cancelled neither in the private letter nor the published note does byron attempt to deny or explain away the coincidence but pleads that his lines were written before he had heard coleridges poem recited and that he had not been guilty of a wilful plagiarism there is no difficulty in accepting his statement long before the summer of 1815 christabel had a pretty general circulation in the literary world medwin conversations 1824 p 261 and he may have heard without heeding this and other passages quoted by privileged readers or though never a line of christabel had sounded in his ears he may as kölbing points out have caught its lilt at second hand from

publication of fare thee well and a sketch and before there was time to reconsider the new volume on its own merits the new canto of childe harold followed almost immediately by the prisoner of chillon and its brilliant and noticeable companion poems usurped the attention of friend and foe contemporary critics with the exception of the monthly and critical reviews fell foul of the subjectmatter of the poemthe guilty passion of a bastard son for his fathers wife it was too disgusting to be rendered pleasing by any display of genius european magazine the story of parisina includes adultery not to be named literary panorama while the eclectic on grounds of taste rather than of morals gave judgment that the subject of the tale was purely unpleasingthe impression left simply painful  byron no doubt for better or worse was in advance of his age in the pursuit of art for arts sake and in his indifference not to moralitythe dénouement of the story is severely moralbut to the moral edification of his readers the tale was chosen because it is a tale of love and guilt and woe and the poet unconcerned with any other issue sets the tale to an enchanting melody it does not occur to him to condone or to reprobate the loves of hugo and parisina and in detailing the issue leaves the actors to their fate it was this aloofness from ethical considerations which perturbed and irritated the canters as byron called themthe children and champions of the antirevolution the modern reader without being attracted or repelled by the motif of the story will take pleasure in the sustained energy and sure beauty of the poetic strain byron may have gone to the nakedness of history for his facts but he clothed them in singing robes of a delicate and shining texture

the court where parisina and hugo were beheaded according to the annal of gibbonvide advertisement to lament of tasso  412 505 this turned out a calamitous year for the people of ferrara for there occurred a very tragical event in the court of their sovereign our annals both printed and in manuscript with the exception of the unpolished and negligent work of sardi and one other have given the following relation of itfrom which however are rejected many details and especially the narrative of bandelli who wrote a century afterwards and who does not accord with the contemporary historians  by the abovementioned stella dell assassino the marquis in the year 1405 had a son called ugo a beautiful and ingenuous youth parisina malatesta second wife of niccolo like the generality of stepmothers treated him with little kindness to the infinite regret of the marquis who regarded him with fond partiality one day she asked leave of her husband to undertake a certain journey to which he consented but upon condition that ugo should bear her company for he hoped by these means to induce her in the end to lay aside the obstinate aversion which she had conceived against him and indeed his intent was accomplished but too well since during the journey she not only divested herself of all her hatred but fell into the opposite extreme after their return the marquis had no longer any occasion to renew his former reproofs it happened one day that a servant of the marquis named zoese or as some call him giorgio passing before the apartments of parisina saw going out from them one of her chambermaids all terrified and in tears asking the reason she told him that her mistress for some slight offence had been beating her and giving vent to her rage she added that she could easily be revenged if she chose to make known the criminal familiarity which subsisted between parisina and her stepson the servant took note of the words and related them to his master he was astounded thereat but scarcely believing his ears he assured himself of the fact alas too clearly on the 18th of may by looking through a hole made in the ceiling of his wifes chamber instantly he broke into a furious rage and arrested both of them together with aldobrandino rangoni of modena her gentleman and also as some say two of the women of her chamber as abettors of this sinful act he ordered them to be brought to a hasty trial desiring the judges to pronounce sentence in the accustomed forms upon the culprits this sentence was death some there were that bestirred themselves in favour of the delinquents and amongst others ugoccion contrario who was allpowerful with niccolo and also his aged and much deserving minister alberto dal sale both of these their tears flowing down their cheeks and upon their knees implored him for mercy adducing whatever reasons they could suggest for sparing the offenders besides those motives of honour and decency which might persuade him to conceal from the public so scandalous a deed but his rage made him inflexible and on the instant he commanded that the sentence should be put in execution  it was then in the prisons of the castle and exactly in those frightful dungeons which are seen at this day beneath the chamber called the aurora at the foot of the lions tower at the top of the street giovecca that on the night of the 21st of may were beheaded first ugo and afterwards parisina zoese he that accused her conducted the latter under his arm to the place of punishment she all along fancied that she was to be thrown into a pit and asked at every step whether she was yet come to the spot she was told that her punishment was the axe she enquired what was become of ugo and received for answer that he was already dead at which sighing grievously she exclaimed now then i wish not myself to live and being come to the block she stripped herself with her own hands of all her ornaments and wrapping a cloth round her head submitted to the fatal stroke which terminated the cruel scene the same was done with rangoni who together with the others according to two calendars in the library of st francesco was buried in the cemetery of that convent nothing else is known respecting the women  the marquis kept watch the whole of that dreadful night and as he was walking backwards and forwards enquired of the captain of the castle if ugo was dead yet who answered him yes he then gave himself up to the most desperate lamentations exclaiming oh that i too were dead since i have been hurried on to resolve thus against my own ugo and then gnawing with his teeth a cane which he had in his hand he passed the rest of the night in sighs and in tears calling frequently upon his own dear ugo on the following day calling to mind that it would be necessary to make public his justification seeing that the transaction could not be kept secret he ordered the narrative to be drawn out upon paper and sent it to all the courts of italy  on receiving this advice the doge of venice francesco foscari gave orders but without publishing his reasons that stop should be put to the preparations for a tournament which under the auspices of the marquis and at the expense of the city of padua was about to take place in the square of st mark in order to celebrate his advancement to the ducal chair  the marquis in addition to what he had already done from some unaccountable burst of vengeance commanded that as many of the married women as were well known to him to be faithless like his parisina should like her be beheaded amongst others barberina or as some call her laodamia romei wife of the court judge underwent this sentence at the usual place of execution that is to say in the quarter of st giacomo opposite the present fortress beyond st pauls it cannot be told how strange appeared this proceeding in a prince who considering his own disposition should as it seemed have been in such cases most indulgent some however

heard her do so      before without regarding it much but there was something that      roused my attention now i listened she sighed again and again      spoke a few broken words at last i heard her

cavaliers i thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from      their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened her with      insult  rb 514 as tear by tear rose gathering stillrevise  418

part of parisina and a similar scene in canto 2d of marmion i fear there is though i never thought of it before and could hardly wish to imitate that which is inimitable i had completed the story on the passage from gibbon which in fact leads to a like scene naturally without a thought of the kind but it comes upon me not very comfortablyletter to murray february 3 1816 letters 1899 iii 260 the scene in marmion is the one where constance de beverley appears before the conclave      her look composed and steady eye     bespoke a matchless constancy     and there she stood so calm and pale     that but her breathing did not fail     and motion slight of eye and head     and of her bosom warranted     that neither sense nor pulse she lacks     you must have thought a form of wax     wrought

separation   the two poems fare thee well march 17 and a sketch march 29 1816 which have hitherto been entitled domestic pieces or poems on his own circumstances i have ventured to rename poems of the separation of secondary importance as poems or works of art they stand out by themselves as marking and helping to make the critical epoch in the life and reputation of the poet it is to be observed that there was an interval of twelve days between the date of fare thee well and a sketch that the composition of the latter belongs to a later episode in the separation drama and that for some reasons connected with the proceedings between the parties a pathetic if not uncritical resignation had given place to the extremity of exasperationto hatred and fury and revenge it follows that either poem in respect of composition and of publication must be judged on its own merits contemporary critics while they were all but unanimous in holding up a sketch to unqualified reprobation were divided with regard to the good taste and good faith of fare thee well moore intimates that at first and indeed for some years after the separation he was strongly inclined to condemn the fare thee well as a histrionic performancea showy effusion of sentiment but that on reading the account of all the circumstances in byrons memoranda he was impressed by the reality of the swell of tender recollections under the influence of which as he sat one night musing in his study these stanzas were producedthe tears as he said falling fast over the paper as he wrote them life p 302  with whatever purpose or under whatever emotion the lines were written byron did not keep them to himself they were shown to murray and copies were sent to the initiated i have just received writes murray the enclosed letter from mrs maria graham 17851842 née dundas authoress and traveller afterwards lady callcott to whom i had sent the verses it will show you that you are thought of in the remotest corners and furnishes me with an excuse for repeating that i shall not forget you god bless your lordship fare thee well mss m  but it does not appear that they were printed in their final shape the proof of a first draft consisting of thirteen stanzas is dated march 18 1816 till the second copy of verses were set up in type with a view to private distribution see letters 1899 iii 279 even then there was no thought of publication on the part of byron or of murray and as a matter of fact though fare thee well was included in the poems of 1816 it was not till both poems had appeared in over twenty pirated editions that a sketch was allowed to appear in vol iii of the collected works of 1819 unquestionably byron intended that the initiated whether foes or sympathizers should know that he had not taken his dismissal in silence but it is far from certain that he connived at the appearance of either copy of verses in the public press it is impossible to acquit him of the charge of appealing to a limited circle of specially chosen witnesses and advocates in a matter which lay between himself and his wife but the aggravated offence of rushing into print may well be attributed to the injudicious zeal of a friend or the malice prepense of an enemy if he had hoped that the verses would slip into a newspaper as it were malgré lui he would surely have taken care that the seed fell on good ground under the favouring influence of perry of the morning chronicle or leigh hunt of the examiner as it turned out the first paper which possessed or ventured to publish a copy of the domestic pieces was the champion a tory paper then under the editorship of john scott 17831821 a man of talent and of probity but as mr lang puts it life and letters of john gibson lockhart 1897 i 256 scotch and a professed moralist the date of publication was sunday april 14 and it is to be noted that the ode from the french we do not curse thee waterloo had been published in the morning chronicle on march 15 and that on the preceding sunday april 7 the brilliant but unpatriotic apostrophe to the star of the legion of honour had appeared in the examiner we notice it this strain of his lordships harp writes the editor because we think it would not be doing justice to the merits of such political tenets if they were not coupled with their corresponding practice in regard to moral and domestic obligations there is generally a due proportion kept in the music of mens lives  of many of the facts of this distressing case we are not ignorant but god knows they are not for a newspaper fortunately they fall within very general knowledge in london at least if they had not they would never have found their way to us but there is a respect due to certain wrongs and sufferings that would be outraged by uncovering them it was all very mysterious very terrible but what wonder that the laureate of the exemperor the contemner of the bourbons the pæanist of the star of the brave the rainbow of the free should make good his political heresy by personal depravityby unmanly vice unmanly whining unmanly vituperation  wordsworth to whom scott forwarded the champion of april 14 outdid the journalist in virtuous fury let me say only one word of lord b the man is insane the verses on his private affairs excite in me less indignation than pity the latter copy is the billingsgate of bedlam  you yourself seem to labour under some delusion as to the merits of lord bs poetry and treat the wretched verses the fare well with far too much respect they are disgusting in sentiment and in execution contemptible though my many faults deface me etc can worse doggerel than such a stanza be written one verse is commendable all my madness none can know the criticism as criticism confutes itself and is worth quoting solely because it displays the feeling of a sane and honourable man towards a member of the opposition who had tripped and fallen and now lay within reach of his lash see life of william wordsworth 1889 ii 267 etc  it was not only as macaulay put it that byron was singled out as an expiatory sacrifice by the british public in a periodical fit of morality but as the extent and the limitations of the attack reveal occasion was taken by political adversaries to inflict punishment for an outrage on popular sentiment  the champion had been the first to give tongue and the other journals on the plea that the mischief was out one after the other took up the cry on monday april 15 the sun printed fare thee well and on tuesday april 16 followed with a sketch on the same day the morning chronicle protesting that the poems were not written for the public eye but as having been inserted in a sunday paper printed both sets of verses the morning post with an ugly hint that the noble lord gives us verses when he dare not give us circumstances restricted itself to fare thee well while the times in a leading paragraph feigned to regard the two extraordinary copies of verses  the whining stanzas of fare thee well and the low malignity and miserable doggerel of the companion sketch as an injurious fabrication on thursday the 18th the courier though declining to insert a sketch deals temperately and sympathetically with the fare thee well and quotes the testimony of a fair correspondent  madame de staël that if her husband had bade her such a farewell she could not have avoided running into his arms and being reconciled immediatelyje naurois pu my tenir un instant and on the same day the times having learnt to its extreme astonishment and regret that both poems were indeed lord byrons maintained that the noble author had degraded literature and abused the privileges of rank by converting them into weapons of vengeance against an inferior and a female on friday the 19th the star printed both poems and the morning post inserted a criticism which had already appeared in the courier of the preceding day on saturday the 20th the courier found itself compelled in the interests of its readers to print both poems on sunday the 21st the octave of the original issue the examiner devoted a long article to an apology for byron and a fierce rejoinder to the champion and on the same day the independent whig and the sunday news which favoured the opposition printed both poems with prefatory notices more or less favourable to the writer whereas the tory antigallican monitor which also printed both poems added the significant remark that if everything said of lord byron be true it would appear that the whigs were not altogether so immaculate as they themselves would wish the world to suppose  the testimony of the press is instructive from two points of view in the first place it tends to show that the controversy was conducted on party lines and secondly that the editor of the champion was in some degree responsible for the wide diffusion and lasting publicity of the scandal the separation of lord and lady byron must in any case have been more than a nine days wonder but if the circulation of the pamphlet had been strictly confined to the initiated the excitement and interest of the general public would have smouldered and died out for lack of material  in his second letter on bowles dated march 25 1821 observations upon observations life 1892 p 705 byron alludes to the publication of these poems in the champion and comments on the behaviour of the editor who had recently february 16 1821 been killed in a duel he does not minimize the wrong but he pays a fine and generous tribute to the courage and worth of his assailant poor scott is now no more he died like a brave man and he lived an able one etc it may be added that byron was an anonymous subscriber to a fund raised by sir james mackintosh murray and others for the helpless family of a man of virtue and ability london magazine april 1821 vol iii p 359  for chronological reasons and in accordance with the precedent of the edition of 1832
