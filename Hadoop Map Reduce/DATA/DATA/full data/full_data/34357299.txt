34357299	the tragedy of puddnhead wilson  by mark twain     a whisper to the reader       there is no character howsoever good and fine but it can      be destroyed by ridicule howsoever poor and witless      observe the ass for instance his character is about      perfect he is the choicest spirit among all the humbler      animals yet see what ridicule has brought him to instead      of feeling complimented when we are called an ass we are      left in doubt puddnhead wilsons calendar  a person who is ignorant of legal matters is always liable to make mistakes when he tries to photograph a court scene with his pen and so i was not willing to let the law chapters in this book go to press without first subjecting them to rigid and exhausting revision and correction by a trained barristerif that is what they are called these chapters are right now in every detail for they were rewritten under the immediate eye of william hicks who studied law part of a while in southwest missouri thirtyfive years ago and then came over here to florence for his health and is still helping for exercise and board in macaroni vermicellis horsefeed shed which is up the back alley as you turn around the corner out of the piazza del duomo just beyond the house where that stone that dante used to sit on six hundred years ago is let into the wall when he let on to be watching them build giottos campanile and yet always got tired looking as beatrice passed along on her way to get a chunk of chestnut cake to defend herself with in case of a ghibelline outbreak before she got to school at the same old stand where they sell the same old cake to this day and it is just as light and good as it was then too and this is not flattery far from it he was a little rusty on his law but he rubbed up for this book and those two or three legal chapters are right and straight now he told me so himself  given under my hand this second day of january 1893 at the villa viviani village of settignano three miles back of florence on the hillsthe same certainly affording the most charming view to be found on this planet and with it the most dreamlike and enchanting sunsets to be found in any planet or even in any solar systemand given too in the swell room of the house with the busts of cerretani senators and other grandees of this line looking approvingly down upon me as they used to look down upon dante and mutely asking me to adopt them into my family which i do with pleasure for my remotest ancestors are but spring chickens compared with these robed and stately antiques and it will be a great and satisfying lift for me that six hundred years will  mark twain     chapter 1  puddnhead wins his name       tell the truth or trumpbut get the trick puddnhead      wilsons calendar   the scene of this chronicle is the town of dawsons landing on the missouri side of the mississippi half a days journey per steamboat below st louis  in 1830 it was a snug collection of modest one and twostory frame dwellings whose whitewashed exteriors were almost concealed from sight by climbing tangles of rose vines honeysuckles and morning glories each of these pretty homes had a garden in front fenced with white palings and opulently stocked with hollyhocks marigolds touchmenots princesfeathers and other oldfashioned flowers while on the windowsills of the houses stood wooden boxes containing moss rose plants and terracotta pots in which grew a breed of geranium whose spread of intensely red blossoms accented the prevailing pink tint of the roseclad housefront like an explosion of flame when there was room on the ledge outside of the pots and boxes for a cat the cat was therein sunny weatherstretched at full length asleep and blissful with her furry belly to the sun and a paw curved over her nose then that house was complete and its contentment and peace were made manifest to the world by this symbol whose testimony is infallible a home without a catand a wellfed wellpetted and properly revered catmay be a perfect home perhaps but how can it prove title  all along the streets on both sides at the outer edge of the brick sidewalks stood locust trees with trunks protected by wooden boxing and these furnished shade for summer and a sweet fragrancer in spring when the clusters of buds came forth the main street one block back from the river and running parallel with it was the sole business street it was six blocks long and in each block two or three brick stores three stories high towered above interjected bunches of little frame shops swinging signs creaked in the wind the streets whole length the candystriped pole which indicates nobility proud and ancient along the palacebordered canals of venice indicated merely the humble barbershop along the main street of dawsons landing on a chief corner stood a lofty unpainted pole wreathed from top to bottom with tin pots and pans and cups the chief tinmongers noisy notice to the world when the wind blew that his shop was on hand for business at that corner  the hamlets front was washed by the clear waters of the great river its body stretched itself rearward up a gentle incline its most rearward border fringed itself out and scattered its houses about its base line of the hills the hills rose high enclosing the town in a halfmoon curve clothed with forests from foot to summit  steamboats passed up and down every hour or so those belonging to the little cairo line and the little memphis line always stopped the big orleans liners stopped for hails only or to land passengers or freight and this was the case also with the great flotilla of transients these latter came out of a dozen riversthe illinois the missouri the upper mississippi the ohio the monongahela the tennessee the red river the white river and so onand were bound every whither and stocked with every imaginable comfort or necessity which the mississippis communities could want from the frosty falls of st anthony down through nine climates to torrid new orleans  dawsons landing was a slaveholding town with a rich slaveworked grain and pork country back of it the town was sleepy and comfortable and contented it was fifty years old and was growing slowlyvery slowly in fact but still it was growing  the chief citizen was york leicester driscoll about forty years old judge of the county court he was very proud of his old virginian ancestry and in his hospitalities and his rather formal and stately manners he kept up its traditions he was fine and just and generous to be a gentlemana gentleman without stain or blemishwas his only religion and to it he was always faithful he was respected esteemed and beloved by all of the community he was well off and was gradually adding to his store he and his wife were very nearly happy but not quite for they had no children the longing for the treasure of a child had grown stronger and stronger as the years slipped away but the blessing never cameand was never to come  with this pair lived the judges widowed sister mrs rachel pratt and she also was childlesschildless and sorrowful for that reason and not to be comforted the women were good and commonplace people and did their duty and had their reward in clear consciences and the communitys approbation they were presbyterians the judge was a freethinker  pembroke howard lawyer and bachelor aged almost forty was another old virginian grandee with proved descent from the first families he was a fine majestic creature a gentleman according to the nicest requirements of the virginia rule a devoted presbyterian an authority on the code and a man always courteously ready to stand up before you in the field if any act or word of his had seemed doubtful or suspicious to you and explain it with any weapon you might prefer from bradawls to artillery he was very popular with the people and was the judges dearest friend  then there was colonel cecil burleigh essex another ffv of formidable caliberhowever with him we have no concern  percy northumberland driscoll brother to the judge and younger than he by five years was a married man and had had children around his hearthstone but they were attacked in detail by measles croup and scarlet fever and this had given the doctor a chance with his effective antediluvian methods so the cradles were empty he was a prosperous man with a good head for speculations and his fortune was growing on the first of february 1830 two boy babes were born in his house one to him one to one of his slave girls roxana by name roxana was twenty years old she was up and around the same day with her hands full for she was tending both babes  mrs percy driscoll died within the week roxy remained in charge of the children she had her own way for mr driscoll soon absorbed himself in his speculations and left her to her own devices  in that same month of february dawsons landing gained a new citizen this was mr david wilson a young fellow of scotch parentage he had wandered to this remote region from his birthplace in the interior of the state of new york to seek his fortune he was twentyfive years old college bred and had finished a postcollege course in an eastern law school a couple of years before  he was a homely freckled sandyhaired young fellow with an intelligent blue eye that had frankness and comradeship in it and a covert twinkle of a pleasant sort but for an unfortunate remark of his he would no doubt have entered at once upon a successful career at dawsons landing but he made his fatal remark the first day he spent in the village and it gaged him he had just made the acquaintance of a group of citizens when an invisible dog began to yelp and snarl and howl and make himself very comprehensively disagreeable whereupon young wilson said much as one who is thinking aloud  i wish i owned half of that dog  why somebody asked  because i would kill my half  the group searched his face with curiosity with anxiety even but found no light there no expression that they could read they fell away from him as from something uncanny and went into privacy to discuss him one said  pears to be a fool  pears said another is i reckon you better say  said he wished he owned half of the dog the idiot said a third what did he reckon would become of the other half if he killed his half do you reckon he thought it would live  why he must have thought it unless he is the downrightest fool in the world because if he hadnt thought it he would have wanted to own the whole dog knowing that if he killed his half and the other half died he would be responsible for that half just the same as if he had killed that half instead of his own dont it look that way to you gents  yes it does if he owned one half of the general dog it would be so if he owned one end of the dog and another person owned the other end it would be so just the same particularly in the first case because if you kill one half of a general dog there aint any man that can tell whose half it was but if he owned one end of the dog maybe he could kill his end of it and  no he couldnt either he couldnt and not be responsible if the other end died which it would in my opinion that man aint in his right mind  in my opinion he haint got any mind  no 3 said well hes a lummox anyway  thats what he is said no 4 hes a labrickjust a simonpure labrick if there was one  yes sir hes a dam fool thats the way i put him up said no 5 anybody can think different that wants to but those are my sentiments  im with you gentlemen said no 6 perfect jackassyes and it aint going too far to say he is a puddnhead if he aint a puddnhead i aint no judge thats all  mr wilson stood elected the incident was told all over the town and gravely discussed by everybody within a week he had lost his first name puddnhead took its place in time he came to be liked and well liked too but by that time the nickname had got well stuck on and it stayed that first days verdict made him a fool and he was not able to get it set aside or even modified the nickname soon ceased to carry any harsh or unfriendly feeling with it but it held its place and was to continue to hold its place for twenty long years     chapter 2  driscoll spares his slaves       adam was but humanthis explains it all he did not want      the apple for the apples sake he wanted it only because it      was forbidden the mistake was in not forbidding the      serpent then he would have eaten the serpent puddnhead      wilsons calendar   puddnhead wilson had a trifle of money when he arrived and he bought a small house on the extreme western verge of the town between it and judge driscolls house there was only a grassy yard with a paling fence dividing the properties in the middle he hired a small office down in the town and hung out a tin sign with these words on it  d a v i d w i l s o n  attorney and counseloratlaw  surveying conveyancing etc  but his deadly remark had ruined his chanceat least in the law no clients came he took down his sign after a while and put it up on his own house with the law features knocked out of it it offered his services now in the humble capacities of land surveyor and expert accountant now and then he got a job of surveying to do and now and then a merchant got him to straighten out his books with scotch patience and pluck he resolved to live down his reputation and work his way into the legal field yet poor fellow he could foresee that it was going to take him such a weary long time to do it  he had a rich abundance of idle time but it never hung heavy on his hands for he interested himself in every new thing that was born into the universe of ideas and studied it and experimented upon it at his house one of his pet fads was palmistry to another one he gave no name neither would he explain to anybody what its purpose was but merely said it was an amusement in fact he had found that his fads added to his reputation as a puddnhead there he was growing chary of being too communicative about them the fad without a name was one which dealt with peoples finger marks he carried in his coat pocket a shallow box with grooves in it and in the grooves strips of glass five inches long and three inches wide along the lower edge of each strip was pasted a slip of white paper he asked people to pass their hands through their hair thus collecting upon them a thin coating of the natural oil and then making a thumbmark on a glass strip following it with the mark of the ball of each finger in succession under this row of faint grease prints he would write a record on the strip of white paperthus  john smith right hand  and add the day of the month and the year then take smiths left hand on another glass strip and add name and date and the words left hand the strips were now returned to the grooved box and took their place among what wilson called his records  he often studied his records examining and poring over them with absorbing interest until far into the night but what he found thereif he found anythinghe revealed to no one sometimes he copied on paper the involved and delicate pattern left by the ball of the finger and then vastly enlarged it with a pantograph so that he could examine its web of curving lines with ease and convenience  one sweltering afternoonit was the first day of july 1830he was at work over a set of tangled account books in his workroom which looked westward over a stretch of vacant lots when a conversation outside disturbed him it was carried on in yells which showed that the people engaged in it were not close together  say roxy how does yo baby come on this from the distant voice  fustrate how does you come on jasper this yell was from close by  oh is middlin haint got nothn to complain of is gwine to come acourtn you bimeby roxy  you is you black mud cat yahyahyah i got somepn better to do den sociatn wid niggers as black as you is is ole miss coopers nancy done give you de mitten roxy followed this sally with another discharge of carefree laughter  yous jealous roxy dats whats de matter wid you you hussyyahyahyah dats de time i got you  oh yes you got me haint you clah to goodness if dat conceit o yon strikes in jasper it gwine to kill you sho if you blonged to me id sell you down de river fo you git too fur gone fust time i runs acrost yo marster is gwine to tell him so  this idle and aimless jabber went on and on both parties enjoying the friendly duel and each well satisfied with his own share of the wit exchangedfor wit they considered it  wilson stepped to the window to observe the combatants he could not work while their chatter continued over in the vacant lots was jasper young coal black and of magnificent build sitting on a wheelbarrow in the pelting sunat work supposably whereas he was in fact only preparing for it by taking an hours rest before beginning in front of wilsons porch stood roxy with a local handmade baby wagon in which sat her two chargesone at each end and facing each other from roxys manner of speech a stranger would have expected her to be black but she was not only one sixteenth of her was black and that sixteenth did not show she was of majestic form and stature her attitudes were imposing and statuesque and her gestures and movements distinguished by a noble and stately grace her complexion was very fair with the rosy glow of vigorous health in her cheeks her face was full of character and expression her eyes were brown and liquid and she had a heavy suit of fine soft hair which was also brown but the fact was not apparent because her head was bound about with a checkered handkerchief and the hair was concealed under it her face was shapely intelligent and comelyeven beautiful she had an easy independent carriagewhen she was among her own casteand a high and sassy way withal but of course she was meek and humble enough where white people were  to all intents and purposes roxy was as white as anybody but the one sixteenth of her which was black outvoted the other fifteen parts and made her a negro she was a slave and salable as such her child was thirtyone parts white and he too was a slave and by a fiction of law and custom a negro he had blue eyes and flaxen curls like his white comrade but even the father of the white child was able to tell the children apartlittle as he had commerce with themby their clothes for the white babe wore ruffled soft muslin and a coral necklace while the other wore merely a coarse towlinen shirt which barely reached to its knees and no jewelry  the white childs name was thomas a becket driscoll the others name was valet de chambre no surnameslaves hadnt the privilege roxana had heard that phrase somewhere the fine sound of it had pleased her ear and as she had supposed it was a name she loaded it on to her darling it soon got shorted to chambers of course  wilson knew roxy by sight and when the duel of wits begun to play out he stepped outside to gather in a record or two jasper went to work energetically at once perceiving that his leisure was observed wilson inspected the children and asked  how old are they roxy  bofe de same age sirfive months bawn de fust o febuary  theyre handsome little chaps ones just as handsome as the other too  a delighted smile exposed the girls white teeth and she said  bless yo soul misto wilson its powful nice o you to say dat case one of em aint ony a nigger mighty prime little nigger i alays says but dats case its mine o course  how do you tell them apart roxy when they havent any clothes on  roxy laughed a laugh proportioned to her size and said  oh i kin tell em part misto wilson but i bet marse percy couldnt not to save his life  wilson chatted along for awhile and presently got roxys fingerprints for his collectionright hand and lefton a couple of his glass strips then labeled and dated them and took the records of both children and labeled and dated them also  two months later on the third of september he took this trio of finger marks again he liked to have a series two or three takings at intervals during the period of childhood these to be followed at intervals of several years  the next daythat is to say on the fourth of septembersomething occurred which profoundly impressed roxana mr driscoll missed another small sum of moneywhich is a way of saying that this was not a new thing but had happened before in truth it had happened three times before driscolls patience was exhausted he was a fairly humane man toward slaves and other animals he was an exceedingly humane man toward the erring of his own race theft he could not abide and plainly there was a thief in his house necessarily the thief must be one of his negros sharp measures must be taken he called his servants before him there were three of these besides roxy a man a woman and a boy twelve years old they were not related mr driscoll said  you have all been warned before it has done no good this time i will teach you a lesson i will sell the thief which of you is the guilty one  they all shuddered at the threat for here they had a good home and a new one was likely to be a change for the worse the denial was general none had stolen anythingnot money anywaya little sugar or cake or honey or something like that that marse percy wouldnt mind or miss but not moneynever a cent of money they were eloquent in their protestations but mr driscoll was not moved by them he answered each in turn with a stern name the thief  the truth was all were guilty but roxana she suspected that the others were guilty but she did not know them to be so she was horrified to think how near she had come to being guilty herself she had been saved in the nick of time by a revival in the colored methodist church a fortnight before at which time and place she got religion the very next day after that gracious experience while her change of style was fresh upon her and she was vain of her purified condition her master left a couple dollars unprotected on his desk and she happened upon that temptation when she was polishing around with a dustrag she looked at the money awhile with a steady rising resentment then she burst out with  dad blame dat revival i wisht it had a ben put off till tomorrow  then she covered the tempter with a book and another member of the kitchen cabinet got it she made this sacrifice as a matter of religious etiquette as a thing necessary just now but by no means to be wrested into a precedent no a week or two would limber up her piety then she would be rational again and the next two dollars that got left out in the cold would find a comforterand she could name the comforter  was she bad was she worse than the general run of her race no they had an unfair show in the battle of life and they held it no sin to take military advantage of the enemyin a small way in a small way but not in a large one they would smouch provisions from the pantry whenever they got a chance or a brass thimble or a cake of wax or an emery bag or a paper of needles or a silver spoon or a dollar bill or small articles of clothing or any other property of light value and so far were they from considering such reprisals sinful that they would go to church and shout and pray the loudest and sincerest with their plunder in their pockets a farm smokehouse had to be kept heavily padlocked or even the colored deacon himself could not resist a ham when providence showed him in a dream or otherwise where such a thing hung lonesome and longed for someone to love but with a hundred hanging before him the deacon would not take twothat is on the same night on frosty nights the humane negro prowler would warm the end of the plank and put it up under the cold claws of chickens roosting in a tree a drowsy hen would step on to the comfortable board softly clucking her gratitude and the prowler would dump her into his bag and later into his stomach perfectly sure that in taking this trifle from the man who daily robbed him of an inestimable treasurehis libertyhe was not committing any sin that god would remember against him in the last great day  name the thief  for the fourth time mr driscoll had said it and always in the same hard tone and now he added these words of awful import  i give you one minute he took out his watch if at the end of that time you have not confessed i will not only sell all four of you buti will sell you down the river  it was equivalent to condemning them to hell no missouri negro doubted this roxy reeled in her tracks and the color vanished out of her face the others dropped to their knees as if they had been shot tears gushed from their eyes their supplicating hands went up and three answers came in the one instant  i done it  i done it  i done ithave mercy marsterlord have mercy on us po niggers  very good said the master putting up his watch i will sell you here though you dont deserve it you ought to be sold down the river  the culprits flung themselves prone in an ecstasy of gratitude and kissed his feet declaring that they would never forget his goodness and never cease to pray for him as long as they lived they were sincere for like a god he had stretched forth his mighty hand and closed the gates of hell against them he knew himself that he had done a noble and gracious thing and was privately well pleased with his magnanimity and that night he set the incident down in his diary so that his son might read it in after years and be thereby moved to deeds of gentleness and humanity himself     chapter 3  roxy plays a shrewd trick       whoever has lived long enough to find out what life is      knows how deep a debt of gratitude we owe to adam the first      great benefactor of our race he brought death into the      world puddnhead wilsons calendar   percy driscoll slept well the night he saved his house minions from going down the river but no wink of sleep visited roxys eyes a profound terror had taken possession of her her child could grow up and be sold down the river the thought crazed her with horror if she dozed and lost herself for a moment the next moment she was on her feet flying to her childs cradle to see if it was still there then she would gather it to her heart and pour out her love upon it in a frenzy of kisses moaning crying and saying dey shant oh dey shantyo po mammy will kill you fust  once when she was tucking him back in its cradle again the other child nestled in its sleep and attracted her attention she went and stood over it a long time communing with herself  what has my po baby done dat he couldnt have yo luck he haint done nuthn god was good to you why warnt he good to him dey cant sell you down de river i hates yo pappy he haint got no heartfor niggers he haint anyways i hates him en i could kill him she paused awhile thinking then she burst into wild sobbings again and turned away saying oh i got to kill my chile dey aint no yuther waykillin him wouldnt save de chile fum goin down de river oh i got to do it yo po mammys got to kill you to save you honey she gathered her baby to her bosom now and began to smother it with caresses mammys got to kill youhow kin i do it but yo mammy aint gwine to desert youno no dah dont cryshe gwine wid you she gwine to kill herself too come along honey come along wid mammy we gwine to jump in de river den troubles o dis worl is all overdey dont sell po niggers down the river over yonder  she stared toward the door crooning to the child and hushing it midway she stopped suddenly she had caught sight of her new sunday gowna cheap curtaincalico thing a conflagration of gaudy colors and fantastic figures she surveyed it wistfully longingly  haint ever wore it yet she said en its just lovely then she nodded her head in response to a pleasant idea and added no i aint gwine to be fished out wid everybody lookin at me in dis misable ole linseywoolsey  she put down the child and made the change she looked in the glass and was astonished at her beauty she resolved to make her death toilet perfect she took off her handkerchief turban and dressed her glossy wealth of hair like white folks she added some odds and ends of rather lurid ribbon and a spray of atrocious artificial flowers finally she threw over her shoulders a fluffy thing called a cloud in that day which was of a blazing red complexion then she was ready for the tomb  she gathered up her baby once more but when her eye fell upon its miserably short little gray towlinen shirt and noted the contrast between its pauper shabbiness and her own volcanic eruption of infernal splendors her motherheart was touched and she was ashamed  no dolling mammy aint gwine to treat you so de angels is gwine to mire you jist as much as dey does yo mammy aint gwine to have em puttn dey hans up fo dey eyes en sayin to david and goliah en dem yuther prophets dat chile is dress to indelicate fo dis place  by this time she had stripped off the shirt now she clothed the naked little creature in one of thomas a beckets snowy long baby gowns with its bright blue bows and dainty flummery of ruffles  dahnow yous fixed she propped the child in a chair and stood off to inspect it straightway her eyes begun to widen with astonishment and admiration and she clapped her hands and cried out why it do beat all i never knowed you was so lovely marse tommy aint a bit puttiernot a single bit  she stepped over and glanced at the other infant she flung a glance back at her own then one more at the heir of the house now a strange light dawned in her eyes and in a moment she was lost in thought she seemed in a trance when she came out of it she muttered when i uz awashin em in de tub yistiddy he own pappy asked me which of em was hisn  she began to move around like one in a dream she undressed thomas a becket stripping him of everything and put the towlinen shirt on him she put his coral necklace on her own childs neck then she placed the children side by side and after earnest inspection she muttered  now who would blieve cloes could do de like o dat dog my cats if it aint all i kin do to tell t other fum which let alone his pappy  she put her cub in tommys elegant cradle and said  yous young marse tom fum dis out en i got to practice and

uneasily  is sorry for you honey is sorry god knows i isbut what kin i do what could i do yo pappy would sell him to somebody sometime en den hed go down de river sho en i couldnt couldnt couldnt stan it  she flung herself on her bed and began to think and toss toss and think by and by she sat suddenly upright for a comforting thought had flown through her worried mind  t aint no sinwhite folks has done it it aint no sin glory to goodness it aint no sin deys done ityes en dey was de biggest quality in de whole bilin tookings  she began to muse she was trying to gather out of her memory the dim particulars of some tale she had heard some time or other at last she said  now is got it now i member it was dat ole nigger preacher dat tole it de time he come over here fum illinois en preached in de nigger church he said dey aint nobody kin save his own selfcant do it by faith cant do it by works cant do it no way at all free grace is de ony way en dat dont come fum nobody but jis de lord en

bilin oh is so glad i member bout dat  she got lighthearted and happy and went to the cradles and spent what was left of the night practicing she would give her own child a light pat and say humbly lay still marse tom then give the real tom a pat and say with severity lay still chambers does you want me to take somepn to you  as she progressed with her practice she was surprised to see how steadily and surely the awe which had kept her tongue reverent and her manner humble toward her young master was transferring itself to her speech and manner toward the usurper and how similarly handy she was becoming in transferring her motherly curtness of speech and peremptoriness of manner to the unlucky heir of the ancient house of driscoll  she took occasional rests from practicing and absorbed herself in calculating her chances  deyll sell dese niggers today fo stealin de money den deyll buy some mo dat dont now de chillenso dats all right when i takes de chillen out to git de air

course the master gave her none for one of his speculations was in jeopardy and his mind was so occupied that he hardly saw the children when he looked at them and all roxy had to do was to get them both into a gale of laughter when he came about then their faces were mainly cavities exposing gums and he was gone again before the spasm passed and the little creatures resumed a human aspect  within a few days the fate of the speculation became so dubious that mr percy went away with his brother the judge to see what could be done with it it was a land speculation as usual and it had gotten complicated with a lawsuit the men were gone seven weeks before they got back roxy had paid her visit to wilson and was satisfied wilson took the fingerprints labeled them with the names and with the date october the firstput them carefully away and continued his chat with roxy who seemed very anxious that he should admire the great advance in flesh and beauty which the babes had made since he took their fingerprints a month before he complimented their improvement to her contentment and as they were without any disguise of jam or other stain she trembled all the while and was miserably frightened lest at any moment he  but he didnt he discovered nothing and she went home jubilant and dropped all concern about the matter permanently out of her mind     chapter 4  the ways of the changelings       adam and eve had many advantages but the principal one      was that they escaped teething puddnhead wilsons      calendar       there is this trouble about special providencesnamely      there is so often a doubt as to which party was intended to      be the beneficiary in the case of the children the bears      and the prophet the bears got more real satisfaction out of      the episode than the prophet did because they got the      children puddnhead wilsons calendar   this history must henceforth accommodate itself to the change which roxana has consummated and call the real heir chambers and the usurping little slave thomas a becketshortening this latter name to tom for daily use as the people about him did  tom was a bad baby from the very beginning of his usurpation he would cry for nothing he would burst into storms of devilish temper without notice and let go scream after scream and squall after squall then climax the thing with holding his breaththat frightful specialty of the teething nursling in the throes of which the creature exhausts its lungs then is convulsed with noiseless squirmings and twistings and kickings in the effort to get its breath while the lips turn blue and the mouth stands wide and rigid offering for inspection one wee tooth set in the lower rim of a hoop of red gums and when the appalling stillness has endured until one is sure the lost breath will never return a nurse comes flying and dashes water in the childs face andpresto the lungs fill and instantly discharge a shriek or a yell or a howl which bursts the listening ear and surprises the owner of it into saying words which would not go well with a halo if he had one the baby tom would claw anybody who came within reach of his nails and pound anybody he could reach with his rattle he would scream for water until he got it and then throw cup and all on the floor and scream for more he was indulged in all his caprices howsoever troublesome and exasperating they might be he was allowed to eat anything he wanted particularly things that would give him the stomachache  when he got to be old enough to begin to toddle about and say broken words and get an idea of what his hands were for he was a more consummate pest than ever roxy got no rest while he was awake he would call for anything and everything he saw simply saying awnt it want it which was a command when it was brought he said in a frenzy and motioning it away with his hands dont awnt it dont awnt it and the moment it was gone he set up frantic yells of awnt it awnt it and roxy had to give wings to her heels to get that thing back to him again before he could get time to carry out his intention of going into convulsions about it  what he preferred above all other things was the tongs this was because his father had forbidden him to have them lest he break windows and furniture with them the moment roxys back was turned he would toddle to the presence of the tongs and say like it and cock his eye to one side or see if roxy was observed then awnt it and cock his eye again then hab it with another furtive glance and finally take itand the prize was his the next moment the heavy implement was raised aloft the next there was a crash and a squall and the cat was off on three legs to meet an engagement roxy would arrive just as the lamp or a window went to irremediable smash  tom got all the petting chambers got none tom got all the delicacies chambers got mush and milk and clabber without sugar in consequence tom was a sickly child and chambers wasnt tom was fractious as roxy called it and overbearing chambers was meek and docile  with all her splendid common sense and practical everyday ability roxy was a doting fool of a mother she was this toward her childand she was also more than this by the fiction created by herself he was become her master the necessity of recognizing this relation outwardly and of perfecting herself in the forms required to express the recognition had moved her to such diligence and faithfulness in practicing these forms that this exercise soon concreted itself into habit it became automatic and unconscious then a natural result followed deceptions intended solely for others gradually grew practically into selfdeceptions as well the mock reverence became real reverence the mock homage real homage the little counterfeit rift of separation between imitationslave and imitationmaster widened and widened and became an abyss and a very real oneand on one side of it stood roxy the dupe of her own deceptions and on the other stood her child no longer a usurper to her but her accepted and recognized master he was her darling her master and her deity all in one and in her worship of him she forgot who she was and what he had been  in babyhood tom cuffed and banged and scratched chambers unrebuked and chambers early learned that between meekly bearing it and resenting it the advantage all lay with the former policy the few times that his persecutions had moved him beyond control and made him fight back had cost him very dear at headquarters not at the hands of roxy for if she ever went beyond scolding him sharply for forgettn who his young marster was she at least never extended her punishment beyond a box on the ear no percy driscoll was the person he told chambers that under no provocation whatever was he privileged to lift his hand against his little master chambers overstepped the line three times and got three such convincing canings from the man who was his father and didnt know it that he took toms cruelties in all humility after that and made no more experiments  outside the house the two boys were together all through their boyhood chambers was strong beyond his years and a good fighter strong because he was coarsely fed and hard worked about the house and a good fighter because tom furnished him plenty of practiceon white boys whom he hated and was afraid of chambers was his constant bodyguard to and from school he was present on the playground at recess to protect his charge he fought himself into such a formidable reputation by and by that tom could have changed clothes with him and ridden in peace like sir kay in launcelots armor  he was good at games of skill too tom staked him with marbles to play keeps with and then took all the winnings away from him in the winter season chambers was on hand in toms wornout clothes with holy red mittens and holy shoes and pants holy at the knees and seat to drag a sled up the hill for tom warmly clad to ride down on but he never got a ride himself he built snowmen and snow fortifications under toms directions he was toms patient target when tom wanted to do some snowballing but the target couldnt fire back chambers carried toms skates to the river and strapped them on him then trotted around after him on the ice so as to be on hand when he wanted but he wasnt ever asked to try the skates himself  in summer the pet pastime of the boys of dawsons landing was to steal apples peaches and melons from the farmers fruit wagonsmainly on account of the risk they ran of getting their heads laid open with the butt of the farmers whip tom was a distinguished adept at these theftsby proxy chambers did his stealing and got the peach stones apple cores and melon rinds for his share  tom always made chambers go in swimming with him and stay by him as a protection when tom had had enough he would slip out and tie knots in chambers shirt dip the knots in the water and make them hard to undo then dress himself and sit by and laugh while the naked shiverer tugged at the stubborn knots with his teeth  tom did his humble comrade these various ill turns partly out of native viciousness and partly because he hated him for his superiorities of physique and pluck and for his manifold cleverness tom couldnt dive for it gave him splitting headaches chambers could dive without inconvenience and was fond of doing it he excited so much admiration one day among a crowd of white boys by throwing back somersaults from the stern of a canoe that it wearied toms spirit and at last he shoved the canoe underneath chambers while he was in the airso he came down on his head in the canoe bottom and while he lay unconscious several of toms ancient adversaries saw that their longdesired opportunity was come and they gave the false heir such a drubbing that with chambers best help he was hardly able to drag himself home afterward  when the boys was fifteen and upward tom was showing off in the river one day when he was taken with a cramp and shouted for help it was a common trick with the boysparticularly if a stranger was presentto pretend a cramp and howl for help then when the stranger came tearing hand over hand to the rescue the howler would go on struggling and howling till he was close at hand then replace the howl with a sarcastic smile and swim blandly away while the town boys assailed the dupe with a volley of jeers and laughter tom had never tried this joke as yet but was supposed to be trying it now so the boys held warily back but chambers believed his master was in earnest therefore he swam out and arrived in time unfortunately and saved his life  this was the last feather tom had managed to endure everything else but to have to remain publicly and permanently under such an obligation as this to a nigger and to this nigger of all niggersthis was too much he heaped insults upon chambers for pretending to think he was in earnest in calling for help and said that anybody but a blockheaded nigger would have known he was funning and left him alone  toms enemies were in strong force here so they came out with their opinions quite freely they laughed at him and called him coward liar sneak and other sorts of pet names and told him they meant to call chambers by a new name after this and make it common in the towntom driscolls nigger pappyto signify that he had had a second birth into this life and that chambers was the author of his new being tom grew frantic under these taunts and shouted  knock their heads off chambers knock their heads off what do you stand there with your hands in your pockets for  chambers expostulated and said but marse tom deys too many of emdeys  do you hear me  please marse tom dont make me deys so many of em dat  tom sprang at him and drove his pocketknife into him two or three times before the boys could snatch him away and give the wounded lad a chance to escape he was considerably hurt but not seriously if the blade had been a little longer his career would have ended there  tom had long ago taught roxy her place it had been many a day now since she had ventured a caress or a fondling epithet in his quarter such things from a nigger were repulsive to him and she had been warned to keep her distance and remember who she was she saw her darling gradually cease from being her son she saw that detail perish utterly all that was left was mastermaster pure and simple and it was not a gentle mastership either she saw herself sink from the sublime height of motherhood to the somber depths of unmodified slavery the abyss of separation between her and her boy was complete she was merely his chattel now his convenience his dog his cringing and helpless slave the humble and unresisting victim of his capricious temper and vicious nature  sometimes she could not go to sleep even when worn out with fatigue because her rage boiled so high over the days experiences with her boy she would mumble and mutter to herself  he struck me en i warnt no way to blamestruck me in de face right before folks en hes alays callin me nigger wench en hussy en all dem mean names when is doin de very bes i kin oh lord i done so much for himi lif him away up to what he isen dis is what i git for it  sometimes when some outrage of peculiar offensiveness stung her to the heart she would plan schemes of vengeance and revel in the fancied spectacle of his exposure to the world as an imposter and a slave but in the midst of these joys fear would strike her she had made him too strong she could prove nothing andheavens she might get sold down the river for her pains so her schemes always went for nothing and she laid them aside in impotent rage against the fates and against herself for playing the fool on that fatal september day in not providing herself with a witness for use in the day when such a thing might be needed for the appeasing of her vengeancehungry heart  and yet the moment tom happened to be good to her and kindand this occurred every now and thenall her sore places were healed and she was happy happy and proud for this was her son her nigger son lording it among the whites and securely avenging their crimes against her race  there were two grand funerals in dawsons landing that fallthe fall of 1845 one was that of colonel cecil burleigh essex the other that of percy driscoll  on his deathbed driscoll set roxy free and delivered his idolized ostensible son solemnly into the keeping of his brother the judge and his wife those childless people were glad to get him childless people are not difficult to please  judge driscoll had gone privately to his brother a month before and bought chambers he had heard that tom had been trying to get his father to sell the boy down the river and he wanted to prevent the scandalfor public sentiment did not approve of that way of treating family servants for light cause or for no cause  percy driscoll had worn himself out in trying to save his great speculative landed estate and had died without succeeding he was hardly in his grave before the boom collapsed and left his envied young devil of an heir a pauper but that was nothing his uncle told him he should be his heir and have all his fortune when he died so tom was comforted  roxy had no home now so she resolved to go around and say goodby to her friends and then clear out and see the worldthat is to say she would go chambermaiding on a steamboat the darling ambition of her race and sex  her last call was on the black giant jasper she found him chopping puddnhead wilsons winter provision of wood  wilson was chatting with him when roxy arrived he asked her how she could bear to go off chambermaiding and leave her boys and chaffingly offered to copy off a series of their fingerprints reaching up to their twelfth year for her to remember them by but she sobered in a moment wondering if he suspected anything then she said she believed she didnt want them wilson said to himself the drop of black blood in her is superstitious she thinks theres some devilry some witch business about my glass mystery somewhere she used to come here with an old horseshoe in her hand it could have been an accident but i doubt it     chapter 5  the twins thrill dawsons landing       training is everything the peach was once a bitter almond      cauliflower is

puddnhead wilsons calendar   mrs york driscoll enjoyed two years of bliss with that prize tombliss that was troubled a little at times it is true but bliss nevertheless then she died and her husband and his childless sister mrs pratt continued this blissbusiness at the old stand tom was petted and indulged and spoiled to his entire contentor nearly that this went on till he was nineteen then he was sent to yale he went handsomely equipped with conditions but otherwise he was not an object of distinction there he remained at yale two years and then threw up the struggle he came home with his manners a good deal improved he had lost his surliness and brusqueness and was rather pleasantly soft and smooth now he was furtively and sometimes openly ironical of speech and given to gently touching people on the raw but he did it with a goodnatured semiconscious air that carried it off safely and kept him from getting into trouble he was as indolent as ever and showed no very strenuous desire to hunt up an occupation people argued from this that he preferred to be supported by his uncle until his uncles shoes should become vacant he brought back one or two new habits with him one of which he rather openly practicedtipplingbut concealed another which was gambling it would not do to gamble where his uncle could hear of it he knew that quite well  toms eastern polish was not popular among the young people they could have endured it perhaps if tom had stopped there but he wore gloves and that they couldnt stand and wouldnt so he was mainly without society he brought home with him a suit of clothes of such exquisite style and cut in fashioneastern fashion city fashionthat it filled everybody with anguish and was regarded as a peculiarly wanton affront he enjoyed the feeling which he was exciting and paraded the town serene and happy all day but the young fellows set a tailor to work that night and when tom started out on his parade next morning he found the old deformed negro bell ringer straddling along in his wake tricked out in a flamboyant curtaincalico exaggeration of his finery and imitating his fancy eastern graces as well as he could  tom surrendered and after that clothed himself in the local fashion but the dull country town was tiresome to him since his acquaintanceship with livelier regions and it grew daily more and more so he began to make little trips to st louis for refreshment there he found companionship to suit him and pleasures to his taste along with more freedom in some particulars than he could have at home so during the next two years his visits to the city grew in frequency and his tarryings there grew steadily longer in duration  he was getting into deep waters he was taking chances privately which might get him into trouble some dayin fact did  judge driscoll had retired from the bench and from all business activities in 1850 and had now been comfortably idle three years he was president of the freethinkers society and puddnhead wilson was the other member the societys weekly discussions were now the old lawyers main interest in life puddnhead was still toiling in obscurity at the bottom of the ladder under the blight of that unlucky remark which he had let fall twentythree years before about the dog  judge driscoll was his friend and claimed that he had a mind above the average but that was regarded as one of the judges whims and it failed to modify the public opinion or rather that was one of the reasons why it failed but there was another and better one if the judge had stopped with bare assertion it would have had a good deal of effect but he made the mistake of trying to prove his position for some years wilson had been privately at work on a whimsical almanac for his amusementa calendar with a little dab of ostensible philosophy usually in ironical form appended to each date and the judge thought that these quips and fancies of wilsons were neatly turned and cute so he carried a handful of them around one day and read them to some of the chief citizens but irony was not for those people their mental vision was not focused for it they read those playful trifles in the solidest terms and decided without hesitancy that if there had ever been any doubt that dave wilson was a puddnheadwhich there hadntthis revelation removed that doubt for good and all that is just the way in this world an enemy can partly ruin a man but it takes a goodnatured injudicious friend to complete the thing and make it perfect after this the judge felt tenderer than ever toward wilson and surer than ever that his calendar had merit  judge driscoll could be a freethinker and still hold his place in society because he was the person of most consequence to the community and therefore could venture to go his own way and follow out his own notions the other member of his pet organization was allowed the like liberty because he was a cipher in the estimation of the public and nobody attached any importance to what he thought or did he was liked he was welcome enough all around but he simply didnt count for anything  the widow cooperaffectionately called aunt patsy by everybodylived in a snug and comely cottage with her daughter rowena who was nineteen romantic amiable and very pretty but otherwise of no consequence rowena had a couple of young brothersalso of no consequence  the widow had a large spare room which she let to a lodger with board when she could find one but this room had been empty for a year now to her sorrow her income was only sufficient for the family support and she needed the lodging money for trifling luxuries but now at last on a flaming june day she found herself happy her tedious wait was ended her yearworn advertisement had been answered and not by a village applicant no nothis letter was from away off yonder in the dim great world to the north it was from st louis she sat on her porch gazing out with unseeing eyes upon the shining reaches of the mighty mississippi her thoughts steeped in her good fortune indeed it was specially good fortune for she was to have two lodgers instead of one  she had read the letter to the family and rowena had danced away to see to the cleaning and airing of the room by the slave woman nancy and the boys had rushed abroad in the town to spread the great news for it was a matter of public interest and the public would wonder and not be pleased if not informed presently rowena returned all ablush with joyous excitement and begged for a rereading of the letter it was framed thus  honored madam my brother and i have seen your advertisement by chance and beg leave to take the room you offer we are twentyfour years of age and twins we are italians by birth but have lived long in

thursday they are coming and this is only tuesday its a cruel long time to wait here comes judge driscoll in at the gate hes heard about it ill go and open the door  the judge was full of congratulations and curiosity the letter was read and discussed soon justice robinson arrived with more congratulations and there was a new reading and a new discussion this was the beginning neighbor after neighbor of both sexes followed and the procession drifted in and out all day and evening and all wednesday and thursday the letter was read and reread until it was nearly worn out everybody admired its courtly and gracious tone and smooth and practiced style everybody was sympathetic and excited and the coopers were steeped in happiness all the while  the boats were very uncertain in low water in these primitive times this time the thursday boat had not arrived at ten at nightso the people had waited at the landing all day for nothing they were driven to their homes by a heavy storm without having had a view of the illustrious foreigners  eleven oclock came and the cooper house was the only one in the town that still had lights burning the rain and thunder were booming yet and the anxious family were still waiting still hoping at last there was a knock at the door and the family jumped to open it two negro men entered each carrying a trunk and proceeded upstairs toward the guest room then entered the twinsthe handsomest the best dressed the most distinguishedlooking pair of young fellows the west had ever seen one was a little fairer than the other but otherwise they were exact duplicates     chapter 6  swimming in glory       let us endeavor so to live that when we come to die even      the undertaker will be sorry puddnhead wilsons      calendar       habit is

polished bearing made speedy conquest of the familys good graces all constraint and formality quickly disappeared and the friendliest feeling succeeded aunt patsy called them by their christian names almost from the beginning she was full of the keenest curiosity about them and showed it they responded by talking about themselves which pleased her greatly it presently appeared that in their early youth they had known poverty and hardship as the talk wandered along the old lady watched for the right place to drop in a question or two concerning that matter and when she found it she said to the blond twin who was now doing the biographies in his turn while the brunette one rested  if it aint asking what i ought not to ask mr angelo how did you come to be so friendless and in such trouble when you were little do you mind telling but dont if you do  oh we dont mind it at all madam in our case it was merely misfortune and nobodys fault our parents were well to do there in italy and we were their only child we were of the old florentine nobilityrowenas heart gave a great bound her nostrils expanded and a fine light played in her eyesand when the war broke out my father was on the losing side and had to fly for his life his estates were confiscated his personal property seized and there we were in germany strangers friendless and in fact paupers my brother and i were ten years old and well educated for that age very studious very fond of our books and well grounded in the german french spanish and english languages also we were marvelous musical prodigiesif you will allow me to say it it being only the truth  our father survived his misfortunes only a month our mother soon followed him and we were alone in the world our parents could have made themselves comfortable by exhibiting us as a show and they had many and large offers but the thought revolted their pride and they said they would starve and die first but what they wouldnt consent to do we had to do without the formality of consent we were seized for the debts occasioned by their illness and their funerals and placed among the attractions of a cheap museum in berlin to earn the liquidation money it took us two years to get out of that slavery we traveled all about germany receiving no wages and not even our keep we had to be exhibited for nothing and beg our bread  well madam the rest is not of much consequence when we escaped from that slavery at twelve years of age we were in some respects men experience had taught us some valuable things among others how to take care of ourselves how to avoid and defeat sharks and sharpers and how to conduct our own business for our own profit and without other peoples help we traveled everywhereyears and yearspicking up smatterings of strange tongues familiarizing ourselves with strange sights and strange customs accumulating an education of a wide and varied and curious sort it was a pleasant life we went to veniceto london paris russia india china japan  at this point nancy the slave woman thrust her head in at the door and exclaimed  ole missus de house is plum jam full o people en deys jes aspilin to see de genlemen she indicated the twins with a nod of her head and tucked it back out of sight again  it was a proud occasion for the widow and she promised herself high satisfaction in showing off her fine foreign birds before her neighbors and friendssimple folk who had hardly ever seen a foreigner of any kind and never one of any distinction or style yet her feeling was moderate indeed when contrasted with rowenas rowena was in the clouds she walked on air this was to be the greatest day the most romantic episode in the colorless history of that dull country town she was to be familiarly near the source of its glory and feel the full flood of it pour over her and about her the other girls could only gaze and envy not partake  the widow was ready rowena was ready so also were the foreigners  the party moved along the hall the twins in advance and entered the open parlor door whence issued a low hum of conversation the twins took a position near the door the widow stood at luigis side rowena stood beside angelo and the marchpast and the introductions began the widow was all smiles and contentment she received the procession and passed it on to rowena  good mornin sister cooperhandshake  good morning brother higginscount luigi capello mr higgins handshake followed by a devouring stare and im glad to see ye on the part of higgins and a courteous inclination of the head and a pleasant most happy on the part of count luigi  good mornin rowenyhandshake  good morning mr higginspresent you to count angelo capello handshake admiring stare glad to see yecourteous nod smily most happy and higgins passes on  none of these visitors was at ease but being honest people they didnt pretend to be none of them had ever seen a person bearing a title of nobility before and none had been expecting to see one now consequently the title came upon them as a kind of piledriving surprise and caught them unprepared a few tried to rise to the emergency and got out an awkward my lord or your lordship or something of that sort but the great majority were overwhelmed by the unaccustomed word and its dim and awful associations with gilded courts and stately ceremony and anointed kingship so they only fumbled through the handshake and passed on speechless now and then as happens at all receptions everywhere a more than ordinary friendly soul blocked the procession and kept it waiting while he inquired how the brothers liked the village and how long they were going to stay and if their family was well and dragged in the weather and hoped it would get cooler soon and all that sort of thing so as to be able to say when he got home i had quite a long talk with them but nobody did or said anything of a regrettable kind and so the great affair went through to the end in a creditable and satisfactory fashion  general conversation followed and the twins drifted about from group to group talking easily and fluently and winning approval compelling admiration and achieving favor from all the widow followed their conquering march with a proud eye and every now and then rowena said to herself with deep satisfaction and to think they are oursall ours  there were no idle moments for mother or daughter eager inquiries concerning the twins were pouring into their enchanted ears all the time each was the constant center of a group of breathless listeners each recognized that she knew now for the first time the real meaning of that great word glory and perceived the stupendous value of it and understood why men in all ages had been willing to throw away meaner happiness treasure life itself to get a taste of its sublime and supreme joy napoleon and all his kind stood accounted forand justified  when rowena had at last done all her duty by the people in the parlor she went upstairs to satisfy the longings of an overflow meeting there for the parlor was not big enough to hold all the comers again she was besieged by eager questioners and again she swam in sunset seas of glory when the forenoon was nearly gone she recognized with a pang that this most splendid episode of her life was almost over that nothing could prolong it that nothing quite its equal could ever fall to her fortune again but never mind it was sufficient unto itself the grand occasion had moved on an ascending scale from the start and was a noble and memorable success if the twins could but do some crowning act now to climax it something usual something startling something to concentrate upon themselves the companys loftiest admiration something in the nature of an electric surprise  here a prodigious slambanging broke out below and everybody rushed down to see it was the twins knocking out a classic fourhanded piece on the piano in great style rowena was satisfiedsatisfied down to the bottom of her heart  the young strangers were kept long at the piano the villagers were astonished and enchanted with the magnificence of their performance and could not bear to have them stop all the music that they had ever heard before seemed spiritless prenticework and barren of grace and charm when compared with these intoxicating floods of melodious sound they realized that for once in their lives they were hearing masters     chapter 7  the unknown nymph       one of the most striking differences between a cat and a      lie is that a cat has only nine lives puddnhead      wilsons calendar   the company broke up reluctantly and drifted toward their several homes chatting with vivacity and all agreeing that it would be many a long day before dawsons landing would see the equal of this one again the twins had accepted several invitations while the reception was in progress and had also volunteered to play some duets at an amateur entertainment for the benefit of a local charity society was eager to receive them to its bosom judge driscoll had the good fortune to secure them for an immediate drive and to be the first to display them in public they entered his buggy with him and were paraded down the main street everybody flocking to the windows and sidewalks to see  the judge showed the strangers the new graveyard and the jail and where the richest man lived and the freemasons hall and the methodist church and the presbyterian church and where the baptist church was going to be when they got some money to build it with and showed them the town hall and the slaughterhouse and got out the independent fire company in uniform and had them put out an imaginary fire then he let them inspect the muskets of the militia company and poured out an exhaustless stream of enthusiasm over all these splendors and seemed very well satisfied with the responses he got for the twins admired his admiration and paid him back the best they could though they could have done better if some fifteen or sixteen hundred thousand previous experiences of this sort in various countries had not already rubbed off a considerable part of the novelty in it  the judge laid himself out hospitality to make them have a good time and if there was a defect anywhere it was not his fault he told them a good many humorous anecdotes and always forgot the nub but they were always able to furnish it for these yarns were of a pretty early vintage and they had had many a rejuvenating pull at them before and he told them all about his several dignities and how he had held this and that and the other place of honor or profit and had once been to the legislature and was now president of the society of freethinkers he said the society had been in existence four years and already had two members and was firmly established he would call for the brothers in the evening if they would like to attend a meeting of it  accordingly he called for them and on the way he told them all about puddnhead wilson in order that they might get a favorable impression of him in advance and be prepared to like him this scheme succeededthe favorable impression was achieved later it was confirmed and solidified when wilson proposed that out of courtesy to the strangers the usual topics be put aside and the hour be devoted to conversation upon ordinary subjects and the cultivation of friendly relations and goodfellowshipa proposition which was put to vote and carried  the hour passed quickly away in lively talk and when it was ended the lonesome and neglected wilson was richer by two friends than he had been when it began he invited the twins to look in at his lodgings presently after disposing of an intervening engagement and they accepted with pleasure  toward the middle of the evening they found themselves on the road to his house puddnhead was at home waiting for them and putting in his time puzzling over a thing which had come under his notice that morning the matter was this he happened to be up very earlyat dawn in fact and he crossed the hall which divided his cottage through the center and entered a room to get something there the window of the room had no curtains for that side of the house had long been unoccupied and through this window he caught sight of something which surprised and interested him it was a young womana young woman where properly no young woman belonged for she was in judge driscolls house and in the bedroom over the judges private study or sitting room this was young tom driscolls bedroom he and the judge the judges widowed sister mrs pratt and three negro servants were the only people who belonged in the house who then might this young lady be the two houses were separated by an ordinary yard with a low fence running back through its middle from the street in front to the lane in the rear the distance was not great and wilson was able to see the girl very well the window shades of the room she was in being up and the window also the girl had on a neat and trim summer dress patterned in broad stripes of pink and white and her bonnet was equipped with a pink veil she was practicing steps gaits and attitudes apparently she was doing the thing gracefully and was very much absorbed in her work who could she be and how came she to be in young tom driscolls room  wilson had quickly chosen a position from which he could watch the girl without running much risk of being seen by her and he remained there hoping she would raise her veil and betray her face but she disappointed him after a matter of twenty minutes she disappeared and although he stayed at his post half an hour longer she came no more  toward noon he dropped in at the judges and talked with mrs pratt about the great event of the day the levee of the distinguished foreigners at aunt patsy coopers he asked after her nephew tom and she said he was on his way home and that she was expecting him to arrive a little before night and added that she and the judge were gratified to gather from his letters that he was conducting himself very nicely and creditablyat which wilson winked to himself privately wilson did not ask if there was a newcomer in the house but he asked questions that would have brought lightthrowing answers as to that matter if mrs pratt had had any light to throw so he went away satisfied that he knew of things that were going on in her house of which she herself was not aware  he was now awaiting for the twins and still puzzling over the problem of who that girl might be and how she happened to be in that young fellows room at daybreak in the morning     chapter 8  marse tom tramples his chance       the holy passion of friendship is of so sweet and steady      and loyal and enduring a nature that it will last through a      whole lifetime if not asked to lend money puddnhead      wilsons calendar       consider well the proportions of things it is better to be      a young june bug than an old bird of paradise puddnhead      wilsons calendar   it is necessary now to hunt up roxy  at the time she was set free and went away chambermaiding she was thirtyfive she got a berth as second chambermaid on a cincinnati boat in the new orleans trade the grand mogul a couple of trips made her wonted and easygoing at the work and infatuated her with the stir and adventure and independence of steamboat life then she was promoted and become head chambermaid she was a favorite with the officers and exceedingly proud of their joking and friendly way with her  during eight years she served three parts of the year on that boat and the winters on a vicksburg packet but now for two months she had had rheumatism in her arms and was obliged to let the washtub alone so she resigned but she was well fixedrich as she would have described it for she had lived a steady life and had banked four dollars every month in new orleans as a provision for her old age she said in the start that she had put shoes on one barfooted nigger to tromple on her with and that one mistake like that was enough she would be independent of the human race thenceforth forevermore if hard work and economy could accomplish it when the boat touched the levee at new orleans she bade goodby to her comrades on the grand mogul and moved her kit ashore  but she was back in a hour the bank had gone to smash and carried her four hundred dollars with it she was a pauper and homeless also disabled bodily at least for the present the officers were full of sympathy for her in her trouble and made up a little purse for her she resolved to go to her birthplace she had friends there among the negros and the unfortunate always help the unfortunate she was well aware of that those lowly comrades of her youth would not let her starve  she took the little local packet at cairo and now she was on the homestretch time had worn away her bitterness against her son and she was able to think of him with serenity she put the vile side of him out of her mind and dwelt only on recollections of his occasional acts of kindness to her she gilded and otherwise decorated these and made them very pleasant to contemplate she began to long to see him she would go and fawn upon him slavelikefor this would have to be her attitude of courseand maybe she would find that time had modified him and that he would be glad to see his longforgotten old nurse and treat her gently that would be lovely that would make her forget her woes and her poverty  her poverty that thought inspired her to add another castle to her dream maybe he would give her a trifle now and thenmaybe a dollar once a month say any little thing like that would help oh ever so much  by the time she reached dawsons landing she was her old self again her blues were gone she was in high feather she would get along surely there were many kitchens where the servants would share their meals with her and also steal sugar and apples and other dainties for her to carry homeor give her a chance to pilfer them herself which would answer just as well and there was the church she was a more rabid and devoted methodist than ever and her piety was no sham but was strong and sincere yes with plenty of creature comforts and her old place in the amen corner in her possession again she would be perfectly happy and at peace thenceforward to the end  she went to judge driscolls kitchen first of all she was received there in great form and with vast enthusiasm her wonderful travels and the strange countries she had seen and the adventures she had had made her a marvel and a heroine of romance the negros hung enchanted upon a great story of her experiences interrupting her all along with eager questions with laughter exclamations of delight and expressions of applause and she was obliged to confess to herself that if there was anything better in this world than steamboating it was the glory to be got by telling about it the audience loaded her stomach with their dinners and then stole the pantry bare to load up her basket  tom was in st louis the servants said he had spent the best part of his time there during the previous two years roxy came every day and had many talks about the family and its affairs once she asked why tom was away so much the ostensible chambers said  de fac is ole marster kin git along better when young marsters away den he kin when hes in

den ole marse forgive him en fixed up de will agindo dat satisfy you  yes she was satisfied now and quite happy and sentimental over it she kept coming daily and at last she was told that tom had come home she began to tremble with emotion and straightway sent to beg him to let his po ole nigger mammy have jes one sight of him en die for joy  tom was stretched at his lazy ease on a sofa when chambers brought the petition time had not modified his ancient detestation of the humble drudge and protector of his boyhood it was still bitter and uncompromising he sat up and bent a severe gaze upon the face of the young fellow whose name he was unconsciously using and whose family rights he was enjoying he maintained the gaze until the victim of it had become satisfactorily pallid with terror then he said  what does the old rip want with me  the petition was meekly repeated  who gave you permission to come and disturb me with the social attentions of niggers  tom had risen the other young man was trembling now visibly he saw what was coming and bent his head sideways and put up his left arm to shield it tom rained cuffs upon the head and its shield saying no word the victim received each blow with a beseeching please marse tomoh please marse tom seven blowsthen tom said face the doormarch he followed behind with one two three solid kicks the last one helped the purewhite slave over the doorsill and he limped away mopping his eyes with his old ragged sleeve tom shouted after him send her in  then he flung himself panting on the sofa again and rasped out the remark he arrived just at the right moment i was full to the brim with bitter thinkings and nobody to take it out of how refreshing it was i feel better  toms mother entered now closing the door behind her and approached her son with all the wheedling and supplication servilities that fear and interest can impart to the words and attitudes of the born slave she stopped a yard from her boy and made two or three admiring exclamations over his manly stature and general handsomeness and tom put an arm under his head and hoisted a leg over the sofa back in order to look properly indifferent  my lan how you is growed honey clah to goodness i wouldnt aknowed you marse tom deed i wouldnt look at me good does you member old roxy does you know yo old nigger mammy honey well now i kin lay down en die in peace case ise seed  cut it short goddamn it cut it short what is it you want  you heah dat jes the same old marse tom alays so gay and funnin wid de ole mammy iuz jes as shore  cut it short i tell you and get along what do you want  this was a bitter disappointment roxy had for so many days nourished and fondled and petted her notion that tom would be glad to see his old nurse and would make her proud and happy to the marrow with a cordial word or two that it took two rebuffs to convince her that he was not funning and that her beautiful dream was a fond and foolish variety a shabby and pitiful mistake she was hurt to the heart and so ashamed that for a moment she did not quite know what to do or how to act then her breast began to heave the tears came and in her forlornness she was moved to try that other dream of hersan appeal to her boys charity and so upon the impulse and without reflection she offered her supplication  oh marse tom de po ole mammy is in sich hard luck dese days en shes kinder crippled in de arms and cant work en if you could gimme a dollahony jes one little dol  tom was on his feet so suddenly that the supplicant was startled into a jump herself  a dollargive you a dollar ive a notion to strangle you is that your errand here clear out and be quick about it  roxy backed slowly toward the door when she was halfway she stopped and said mournfully  marse tom i nussed you when you was a little baby en i raised you all by myself tell you was most a young man en now you is young en rich en i is po en gittn ole en i come heah bleavin dat you would hep de ole mammy long down de little road dats lef twix her en de grave en  tom relished this tune less than any that he had preceded it for it began to wake up a sort of echo in his conscience so he interrupted and said with decision though without asperity that he was not in a situation to help her and wasnt going to do it  aint you ever gwine to hep me marse tom  no now go away and dont bother me any more  roxys head was down in an attitude of humility but now the fires of her old wrongs flamed up in her breast and began to burn fiercely she raised her head slowly till it was well up and at the same time her great frame unconsciously assumed an erect and masterful attitude with all the majesty and grace of her vanished youth in it she raised her finger and punctuated with it  you has said de word you has had yo chance en you has trompled it under yo foot when you git another one youll git down on yo knees en beg for it  a cold chill went to toms heart he didnt know why for he did not reflect that such words from such an incongruous source and so solemnly delivered could not easily fail of that effect however he did the natural thing he replied with bluster and mockery  youll give me a chanceyou perhaps id better get down on my knees now but in case i dontjust for arguments sakewhats going to happen pray  dis is what is gwine to happen is gwine as straight to yo uncle as i kin walk en tell him every las thing i knows bout you  toms cheek blenched and she saw it disturbing thoughts began to chase each other through his head how can she know and yet she must have found outshe looks it ive had the will back only three months and am already deep in debt again and moving heaven and earth to save myself from exposure and destruction with a reasonably fair show of getting the thing covered up if im let alone and now this fiend has gone and found me out somehow or other i wonder how much she knows oh oh oh its enough to break a bodys heart but ive got to humor hertheres no other way  then he worked up a rather sickly sample of a gay laugh and a hollow chipperness of manner and said  well well roxy dear old friends like you and me mustnt quarrel heres your dollarnow tell me what you know  he held out the wildcat bill she stood as she was and made no movement it was her turn to scorn persuasive foolery now and she did not waste it she said with a grim implacability in voice and manner which made tom almost realize that even a former slave can remember for ten minutes insults and injuries returned for compliments and flatteries received and can also enjoy taking revenge for them when the opportunity offers  what does i know ill tell you what i knows i knows enough to bust dat will to flindersen more mind you more  tom was aghast  more he said what do you call more wheres there any room for more  roxy laughed a mocking laugh and said scoffingly with a toss of her head and her hands on her hips  yesoh i reckon cose youd like to knowwid yo po little ole rag dollah what you reckon is gwine to tell you foryou aint got no money is gwine to tell yo uncleen ill do it dis minute toohell gimme five dollahs for de news en mighty glad too  she swung herself around disdainfully and started away tom was in a panic he seized her skirts and implored her to wait she turned and said loftily  lookaheah what uz it i tole you  youyoui dont remember anything what was it you told me  i tole you dat de next time i give you a chance youd git down on yo knees en beg for it  tom was stupefied for a moment he was panting with excitement then he said  oh roxy you

slumped to his knees and began to beg saying  you see im begging and its honest begging too now tell me roxy tell me  the heir of two centuries of unatoned insult and outrage looked down on him and seemed to drink in deep draughts of satisfaction then she said  fine nice young white genlman kneelin down to a nigger wench is wanted to see dat jes once befo is called now gabrel blow de hawn is ready    git up  tom did it he said humbly  now roxy dont punish me any more i deserved what ive got but be good and let me off with that dont go to uncle tell meill give you the five dollars  yes i

dollah bill he gave it to her she examined it and said hmlike enough de banks busted she started again but halted again has you got any whisky  yes a little  fetch it  he ran to his room overhead and brought down a bottle which was twothirds full she tilted it up and took a drink her eyes sparkled with satisfaction and she tucked the bottle under her shawl saying its prime ill take it along  tom humbly held the door for her and she marched out as grim and erect as a grenadier     chapter 9  tom practices sycophancy       why is it that we rejoice at a birth and grieve at a      funeral it is because we are not the person involved      puddnhead wilsons calendar       it is easy to find fault if one has that disposition      there was once a man who not being able to find any other      fault with his coal complained that there were too many      prehistoric toads in it puddnhead wilsons calendar   tom flung himself on the sofa and put his throbbing head in his hands and rested his elbows on his knees he rocked himself back and forth and moaned  ive knelt to a nigger wench he muttered i thought i had struck the deepest depths of degradation before but oh dear it was nothing to this    well there is one consolation such as it isive struck bottom this time theres nothing lower  but that was a hasty conclusion  at ten that night he climbed the ladder in the haunted house pale weak and wretched roxy was standing in the door of one of the rooms waiting for she had heard him  this was a twostory log house which had acquired the reputation a few years ago of being haunted and that was the end of its usefulness nobody would live in it afterward or go near it by night and most people even gave it a wide berth in the daytime as it had no competition it was called the haunted house it was getting crazy and ruinous now from long neglect it stood three hundred yards beyond puddnhead wilsons house with nothing between but vacancy it was the last house in the town at that end  tom followed roxy into the room she had a pile of clean straw in the corner for a bed some cheap but wellkept clothing was hanging on the wall there was a tin lantern freckling the floor with little spots of light and there were various soap and candle boxes scattered about which served for chairs the two sat down roxy said  now den ill tell you straight off en ill begin to kleck de money later on i aint in no hurry what does you reckon is gwine to tell you  well youyouoh roxy dont make it too hard for me come right out and tell me youve found out somehow what a shape im in on account of

till i tell you  tom fretted and chafed awhile in a whirlwind of disorganizing sensations and emotions and finally said with something like settled conviction  the whole thing is moonshine now then go ahead and do your worst im done with you  roxy made no answer she took the lantern and started for the door tom was in a cold panic in a moment  come back come back he wailed i didnt mean it roxy i

its de las time youll ever say it to me ill tramp as straight to de judge as i kin walk en tell him who you is en prove it does you blieve me when i says dat  oh groaned tom i more than believe it i know it  roxy knew her conquest was complete she could have proved nothing to anybody and her threat of writings was a lie but she knew the person she was dealing with and had made both statements without any doubt as to the effect they would produce  she went and sat down on her candle box and the pride and pomp of her victorious attitude made it a throne she said  now den chambers wes gwine to talk business en dey aint gwine to be no mo foolishness in de fust place you gits fifty dollahs a month yous gwine to han over half of it to yo ma plank it out  but tom had only six dollars in the world he gave her that and promised to start fair on next months pension  chambers how much is you in debt  tom shuddered and said  nearly three hundred dollars  how is you gwine to pay it  tom groaned out oh i dont know dont ask me such awful questions  but she stuck to her point until she wearied a confession out of him he had been prowling about in disguise stealing small valuables from private houses in fact he made a good deal of a raid on his fellow villagers a fortnight before when he was supposed to be in st louis but he doubted if he had sent away enough stuff to realize the required amount and was afraid to make a further venture in the present excited state of the town his mother approved of his conduct and offered to help but this frightened him he tremblingly ventured to say that if she would retire from the town he should feel better and safer and could hold his head higherand was going on to make an argument but she interrupted and surprised him pleasantly by saying she was ready it didnt make any difference to her where she stayed so that she got her share of the pension regularly she said she would not go far and would call at the haunted house once a month for her money then she said  i dont hate you so much now but ive hated you a many a yearand anybody would didnt i change you off en give you a good fambly en a good name en made you a white genlman en rich wid store clothes onen what did i git for it you despised me all de time en was alays sayin mean hard things to me befo folks en wouldnt ever let me forgit is a niggerenen  she fell to sobbing and broke down tom said but you know i didnt know you were my mother and besides  well nemmine bout dat now let it go is gwine to fogit it then she added fiercely en dont ever make me remember it agin or youll be sorry i tell you  when they were parting tom said in the most persuasive way he could command  ma would you mind telling me who was my father  he had supposed he was asking an embarrassing question he was mistaken roxy drew herself up with a proud toss of her head and said  does i mine tellin you no dat i dont you aint got no casion to be shame o yo father i kin tell you he

bigges funeral dis town ever seed dats de man  under the inspiration of her soaring complacency the departed graces of her earlier days returned to her and her bearing took to itself a dignity and state that might have passed for queenly if her surroundings had been a little more in keeping with it  dey aint another nigger in dis town dats as highbawn as you is now den go long en jes you hold yo head up as high as you want toyou has de right en dat i kin swah     chapter 10  the nymph revealed       all say how hard it is that we have to diea strange      complaint to come from the mouths of people who have had to      live puddnhead wilsons calendar       when angry count four when very angry swear      puddnhead wilsons calendar   every now and then after tom went to bed he had sudden wakings out of his sleep and his first thought was oh joy it was all a dream then he laid himself heavily down again with a groan and the muttered words a nigger i am a nigger oh i wish i was dead  he woke at dawn with one more repetition of this horror and then he resolved to meddle no more with that treacherous sleep he began to think sufficiently bitter thinkings they were they wandered along something after this fashion  why were niggers and whites made what crime did the uncreated first nigger commit that the curse of birth was decreed for him and why is this awful difference made between white and black    how hard the niggers fate seems this morningyet until last night such a thought never entered my head  he sighed and groaned an hour or more away then chambers came humbly in to say that breakfast was nearly ready tom blushed scarlet to see this aristocratic white youth cringe to him a nigger and call him young marster he said roughly  get out of my sight and when the youth was gone he muttered he has done me no harm poor wretch but he is an eyesore to me now for he is driscoll the young gentleman and i am aoh i wish i was dead  a gigantic eruption like that of krakatoa a few years ago with the accompanying earthquakes tidal waves and clouds of volcanic dust changes the face of the surrounding landscape beyond recognition bringing down the high lands elevating the low making fair lakes where deserts had been and deserts where green prairies had smiled before the tremendous catastrophe which had befallen tom had changed his moral landscape in much the same way some of his low places he found lifted to ideals some of his ideas had sunk to the valleys and lay there with the sackcloth and ashes of pumice stone and sulphur on their ruined heads  for days he wandered in lonely places thinking thinking thinking trying to get his bearings it was new work if he met a friend he found that the habit of a lifetime had in some mysterious way vanished his arm hung limp instead of involuntarily extending the hand for a shake it was the nigger in him asserting its humility and he blushed and was abashed and the nigger in him was surprised when the white friend put out his hand for a shake with him he found the nigger in him involuntarily giving the road on the sidewalk to a white rowdy and loafer when rowena the dearest thing his heart knew the idol of his secret worship invited him in the nigger in him made an embarrassed excuse and was afraid to enter and sit with the dread white folks on equal terms the nigger in him went shrinking and skulking here and there and yonder and fancying it saw suspicion and maybe detection in all faces tones and gestures so strange and uncharacteristic was toms conduct that people noticed it and turned to look after him when he passed on and when he glanced backas he could not help doing in spite of his best resistanceand caught that puzzled expression in a persons face it gave him a sick feeling and he took himself out of view as quickly as he could he presently came to have a hunted sense and a hunted look and then he fled away to the hilltops and the solitudes he said to himself that the curse of ham was upon him  he dreaded his meals the nigger in him was ashamed to sit at the white folks table and feared discovery all the time and once when judge driscoll said whats the matter with you you look as meek as a nigger he felt as secret murderers are said to feel when the accuser says thou art the man tom said he was not well and left the table  his ostensible aunts solicitudes and endearments were become a terror to him and he avoided them  and all the time hatred of his ostensible uncle was steadily growing in his heart for he said to himself he is white and i am his chattel his property his goods and he can sell me just as he could his dog  for as much as a week after this tom imagined that his character had undergone a pretty radical change but that was because he did not know himself  in several ways his opinions were totally changed and would never go back to what they were before but the main structure of his character was not changed and could not be changed one or two very important features of it were altered and in time effects would result from this if opportunity offeredeffects of a quite serious nature too under the influence of a great mental and moral upheaval his character and his habits had taken on the appearance of complete change but after a while with the subsidence of the storm both began to settle toward their former places he dropped gradually back into his old frivolous and easygoing ways and conditions of feeling and manner of speech and no familiar of his could have detected anything in him that differentiated him from the weak and careless tom of other days  the theft raid which he had made upon the village turned out better than he had ventured to hope it produced the sum necessary to pay his gaming debts and saved him from exposure to his uncle and another smashing of the will he and his mother learned to like each other fairly well she couldnt love him as yet because there warnt nothing to him as she expressed it but her nature needed something or somebody to rule over and he was better than nothing her strong character and aggressive and commanding ways compelled toms admiration in spite of the fact that he got more illustrations of them than he needed for his comfort however as a rule her conversation was made up of racy tales about the privacies of the chief families of the town for she went harvesting among their kitchens every time she came to the village and tom enjoyed this it was just in his line she always collected her half of his pension punctually and he was always at the haunted house to have a chat with her on these occasions every now and then she paid him a visit there on betweendays also  occasions he would run up to st louis for a few weeks and at last temptation caught him again he won a lot of money but lost it and with it a deal more besides which he promised to raise as soon as possible  for this purpose he projected a new raid on his town he never meddled with any other town for he was afraid to venture into houses whose ins and outs he did not know and the habits of whose households he was not acquainted with he arrived at the haunted house in disguise on the wednesday before the advent of the twinsafter writing his aunt pratt that he would not arrive until two days afterand laying in hiding there with his mother until toward daylight friday morning when he went to his uncles house and entered by the back way with his own key and slipped up to his room where he could have the use of the mirror and toilet articles he had a suit of girls clothes with him in a bundle as a disguise for his raid and was wearing a suit of his mothers clothing with black gloves and veil by dawn he was tricked out for his raid but he caught a glimpse of puddnhead wilson through the window over the way and knew that puddnhead had caught a glimpse of him so he entertained wilson with some airs and graces and attitudes for a while then stepped out of sight and resumed the other disguise and by and by went down and out the back way and started downtown to reconnoiter the scene of his intended labors  but he was ill at ease he had changed back to roxys dress with the stoop of age added to the disguise so that wilson would not bother himself about a humble old women leaving a neighbors house by the back way in the early morning in case he was still spying but supposing wilson had seen him leave and had thought it suspicious and had also followed him the thought made tom cold he gave up the raid for the day and hurried back to the haunted house by the obscurest route he knew his mother was gone but she came back by and by with the news of the grand reception at patsy coopers and soon persuaded him that the opportunity was like a special providence it was so inviting and perfect so he went raiding after all and made a nice success of it while everybody was gone to patsy coopers success gave him nerve and even actual intrepidity insomuch indeed that after he had conveyed his harvest to his mother in a back alley he went to the reception himself and added several of the valuables of that house to his takings  after this long digression we have now arrived once more at the point where puddnhead wilson while waiting for the arrival of the twins on that same friday evening sat puzzling over the strange apparition of that morninga girl in young tom driscolls bedroom fretting and guessing and puzzling over it and wondering who the shameless creature might be     chapter 11  puddnheads thrilling discovery       there are three infallible ways of pleasing an author and      the three form a rising scale of compliment 1to tell him      you have read one of his books 2to tell him you have read      all of his books 3to ask him to let you read the      manuscript of his forthcoming book no 1 admits you to his      respect no 2 admits you to his admiration no 3 carries      you clear into his heart puddnhead wilsons calendar       as to the adjective when in doubt strike it out      puddnhead wilsons calendar   the twins arrived presently and talk began it flowed along chattily and sociably and under its influence the new friendship gathered ease and strength wilson got out his calendar by request and read a passage or two from it which the twins praised quite cordially this pleased the author so much that he complied gladly when they asked him to lend them a batch of the work to read at home in the course of their wide travels they had found out that there are three sure ways of pleasing an author they were now working the best of the three  there was an interruption now young driscoll appeared and joined the party he pretended to be seeing the distinguished strangers for the first time when they rose to shake hands but this was only a blind as he had already had a glimpse of them at the reception while robbing the house the twins made mental note that he was smoothfaced and rather handsome and smooth and undulatory in his movementsgraceful in fact angelo thought he had a good eye luigi thought there was something veiled and sly about it angelo thought he had a pleasant freeandeasy way of talking luigi thought it was more so than was agreeable angelo thought he was a sufficiently nice young man luigi reserved his decision toms first contribution to the conversation was a question which he had put to wilson a hundred times before it was always cheerily and goodnatured put and always inflicted a little pang for it touched a secret sore but this time the pang was sharp since strangers were present  well how does the law come on had a case yet  wilson bit his lip but answered nonot yet with as much indifference as he could assume judge driscoll had generously left the law feature out of wilsons biography which he had furnished to the twins young tom laughed pleasantly and said  wilsons a lawyer gentlemen but he doesnt practice now  the sarcasm bit but wilson kept himself under control and said without passion  i dont practice it is true it is true that i have never had a case and have had to earn a poor living for twenty years as an expert accountant in a town where i cant get a hold of a set of books to untangle as often as i should like but it is also true that i did myself well for the practice of the law by the time i was your age tom i had chosen a profession and was soon competent to enter upon it tom winced i never got a chance to try my hand at it and i may never get a chance and yet if i ever do get it i shall be found ready for i have kept up my law studies all these years  thats it thats good grit i like to see it ive a notion to throw all my business your way my business and your law practice ought to make a pretty gay team dave and the young fellow laughed again  if you will throw wilson had thought of the girl in toms bedroom and was going to say if you will throw the surreptitious and disreputable part of your business my way it may amount to something but thought better of it and said  however this matter doesnt fit well in a general conversation  all right well change the subject i guess you were about to give me another dig anyway so im willing to change hows the awful mystery flourishing these days wilsons got a scheme for driving plain window glass panes out of the market by decorating it with greasy finger marks and getting rich by selling it at famine prices to the crowned heads over in europe to outfit their palaces with fetch it out dave  wilson brought three of his glass strips and said  i get the subject to pass the fingers of his right hand through his hair so as to get a little coating of the natural oil on them and then press the balls of them on the glass a fine and delicate print of the lines in the skin results and is permanent if it doesnt come in contact with something able to rub it off you begin tom  why i think you took my finger marks once or twice before  yes but you were a little boy the last time only about twelve years old  thats so of course ive changed entirely since then and variety is what the crowned heads want i guess  he passed his fingers through his crop of short hair and pressed them one at a time on the glass angelo made a print of his fingers on another glass and luigi followed with a third wilson marked the glasses with names and dates and put them away tom gave one of his little laughs and said  i thought i wouldnt say anything but if variety is what you are after you have wasted a piece of glass the hand print of one twin is the same as the hand print of the fellow twin  well its done now and i like to have them both anyway said wilson returned to his place  but look here dave said tom you used to tell peoples fortunes too when you took their finger marks daves just an allround geniusa genius of the first water gentlemen a great scientist running to seed here in this village a prophet with the kind of honor that prophets generally get at homefor here they dont give shucks for his scientifics and they call his skull a notion factoryhey dave aint it so but never mind hell make his mark somedayfinger mark you know hehe but really you want to let him take a shy at your palms once its worth twice the price of admission or your moneys returned at the door why hell read your wrinkles as easy as a book and not only tell you fifty or sixty things thats going to happen to you but fifty or sixty thousand that aint come dave show the gentlemen what an inspired jackatallscience weve got in this town and dont know it  wilson winced under this nagging and not very courteous chaff and the twins suffered with him and for him they rightly judged now that the best way to relieve him would be to take the thing in earnest and treat it with respect ignoring toms rather overdone raillery so luigi said  we have seen something of palmistry in our wanderings and know very well what astonishing things it can do if it isnt a science and one of the greatest of them too i dont know what its other name ought to be in the orient  tom looked surprised and incredulous he said  that juggling a science but really you aint serious are you  yes entirely so four years ago we had our hands read out to us as if our plans had been covered with print  well do you mean to say there was actually anything in it asked tom his incredulity beginning to weaken a little  there was this much in it said angelo what was told us of our characters was minutely exactwe could have not have bettered it ourselves next two or three memorable things that have happened to us were laid barethings which no one present but ourselves could have known about  why its rank sorcery exclaimed tom who was now becoming very much interested and how did they make out with what was going to happen to you in the future  on the whole quite fairly said luigi two or three of the most striking things foretold have happened since much the most striking one of all happened within that same year some of the minor prophesies have come true some of the minor and some of the major ones have not been fulfilled yet and of course may never be still i should be more surprised if they failed to arrive than if they didnt  tom was entirely sobered and profoundly impressed he said apologetically  dave i wasnt meaning to belittle that science i was only chaffing chattering i reckon id better say i wish you would look at their palms come wont you  why certainly if you want me to but you know ive had no chance to become an expert and dont claim to be one when a past event is somewhat prominently recorded in the palm i can generally detect that but minor ones often escape menot always of course but oftenbut i havent much confidence in myself when it comes to reading the future i am talking as if palmistry was a daily study with me but that is not so i havent examined half a dozen hands in the last half dozen years you see the people got to joking about it and i stopped to let the talk die down ill tell you what well do count luigi ill make a try at your past and if i have any success thereno on the whole ill let the future alone thats really the affair of an expert  he took luigis hand tom said  waitdont look yet dave count luigi heres paper and pencil set down that thing that you said was the most striking one that was foretold to you and happened less than a year afterward and give it to me so i can see if dave finds it in your hand  luigi wrote a line privately and folded up the piece of paper and handed it to tom saying  ill tell you when to look at it if he finds it  wilson began to study luigis palm tracing life lines heart lines head lines and so on and noting carefully their relations with the cobweb of finer and more delicate marks and lines that enmeshed them on all sides he felt of the fleshy cushion at the base of the thumb and noted its shape he felt of the fleshy side of the hand between the wrist and the base of the little finger and noted its shape also he painstakingly examined the fingers observing their form proportions and natural manner of disposing themselves when in repose all this process was watched by the three spectators with absorbing interest their heads bent together over luigis palm and nobody disturbing the stillness with a word wilson now entered upon a close survey of the palm again and his revelations began  he mapped out luigis character and disposition his tastes aversions proclivities ambitions and eccentricities in a way which sometimes made luigi wince and the others laugh but both twins declared that the chart was artistically drawn and was correct  next wilson took up luigis history he proceeded cautiously and with hesitation now moving his finger slowly along the great lines of the palm and now and then halting it at a star or some such landmark and examining that neighborhood minutely he proclaimed one or two past events luigi confirmed his correctness and the search went on presently wilson glanced up suddenly with a surprised expression  here is a record of an incident which you would perhaps not wish me to  bring it out said luigi goodnaturedly i promise you shant embarrass me  but wilson still hesitated and did not seem quite to know what to do then he said  i think it is too delicate a matter totoi believe i would rather write it or whisper it to you and let you decide for yourself whether you want it talked out or not  that will answer said luigi write it  wilson wrote something on a slip of paper and handed it to luigi who read it to himself and said to tom  unfold your slip and read it mr driscoll  tom said  it was prophesied that i would kill a man it came true before the year was out  tom added great scott  luigi handed wilsons paper to tom and said  now read this one  tom read  you have killed someone but whether man woman or child i do not make out  caesars ghost commented tom with astonishment it beats anything that was ever heard of why a mans own hand is his deadliest enemy just think of thata mans own hand keeps a record of the deepest and fatalest secrets of his life and is treacherously ready to expose himself to any blackmagic stranger that comes along but what do you let a person look at your hand for with that awful thing printed on it  oh said luigi reposefully i dont mind it i killed the man for good reasons and i dont regret it  what were the reasons  well he needed killing  ill tell you why he did it since he wont say himself said angelo warmly he did it to save my life thats what he did it for so it was a noble act and not a thing to be hid in the dark  so it was so it was said wilson to do such a thing to save a brothers life is a great and fine action  now come said luigi it is very pleasant to hear you say these things but for unselfishness or heroism or magnanimity the circumstances wont stand scrutiny you overlook one detail suppose i hadnt saved angelos life what would have become of mine if i had let the man kill him wouldnt he have killed me too i saved my own life you see  yes that is your way of talking said angelo but i know youi dont believe you thought of yourself at all i keep that weapon yet that luigi killed the man with and ill show it to you sometime that incident makes it interesting and it had a history before it came into luigis hands which adds to its interest it was given to luigi by a great indian prince the gaikowar of baroda and it had been in his family two or three centuries it killed a good many disagreeable people who troubled the hearthstone at one time or another it isnt much too look at except it isnt shaped like other knives or dirks or whatever it may be calledhere ill draw it for you he took a sheet of paper and made a rapid sketch there it isa broad and murderous blade with edges like a razor for sharpness the devices engraved on it are the ciphers or names of its long line of possessorsi had luigis name added in roman letters myself with our coat of arms as you see you notice what a curious handle the thing has it is solid ivory polished like a mirror and is four or five inches longround and as thick as a large mans wrist with the end squared off flat for your thumb to rest on for you grasp it with your thumb resting on the blunt endsoand lift it along and strike downward the gaikowar showed us how the thing was done when he gave it to luigi and before that night was ended luigi had used the knife and the gaikowar was a man short by reason of it the sheath is magnificently ornamented with gems of great value you will find a sheath more worth looking at than the knife itself of course  tom said to himself  its lucky i came here i would have sold that knife for a song i supposed the jewels were glass  but go on dont stop said wilson our curiosity is up now to hear about the homicide tell us about that  well briefly the knife was to blame for that all around a native servant slipped into our room in the palace in the night to kill us and steal the knife on account of the fortune encrusted on its sheath without a doubt luigi had it under his pillow we were in bed together there was a dim nightlight burning i was asleep but luigi was awake and he thought he detected a vague form nearing the bed he slipped the knife out of the sheath and was ready and unembarrassed by hampering bedclothes for the weather was hot and we hadnt any suddenly that native rose at the bedside and bent over me with his right hand lifted and a dirk in it aimed at my throat but luigi grabbed his wrist pulled him downward and drove his own knife into the mans neck that is the whole story  wilson and tom drew deep breaths and after some general chat about the tragedy puddnhead said taking toms hand  now tom ive never had a look at your palms as it happens perhaps youve got some little questionable privacies that needhello  tom had snatched away his hand and was looking a good deal confused  why hes blushing said luigi  tom darted an ugly look at him and said sharply  well if i am it aint because im a murderer luigis dark face flushed but before he could speak or move tom added with anxious haste oh i beg a thousand pardons i didnt mean that it was out before i thought and im very very sorryyou must forgive me  wilson came to the rescue and smoothed things down as well as he could and in fact was entirely successful as far as the twins were concerned for they felt sorrier for the affront put upon him by his guests outburst of ill manners than for the insult offered to luigi but the success was not so pronounced with the offender tom tried to seem at his ease and he went through the motions fairly well but at bottom he felt resentful toward all the three witnesses of his exhibition in fact he felt so annoyed at them for having witnessed it and noticed it that he almost forgot to feel annoyed at himself for placing it before them however something presently happened which made him almost comfortable and brought him nearly back to a state of charity and friendliness this was a little spat between the twins not much of a spat but still a spat and before they got far with it they were in a decided condition of irritation while pretending to be actuated by more respectable motives by his help the fire got warmed up to the blazing point and he might have had the happiness of seeing the flames show up in another moment but for the interruption of a knock on the dooran interruption which fretted him as much as it gratified wilson wilson opened the door  the visitor was a goodnatured ignorant energetic middleaged irishman named john buckstone who was a great politician in a small way and always took a large share in public matters of every sort one of the towns chief excitements just now was over the matter of rum there was a strong rum party and a strong antirum party buckstone was training with the rum party and he had been sent to hunt up the twins and invite them to attend a mass meeting of that faction he delivered his errand and said the clans were already gathering in the big hall over the market house luigi accepted the invitation cordially angelo less cordially since he disliked crowds and did not drink the powerful intoxicants of america in fact he was even a teetotaler sometimes when it was judicious to be one  the twins left with buckstone and tom driscoll joined the company with them uninvited  in the distance one could see a long wavering line of torches drifting down the main street and could hear the throbbing of the bass drum the clash of cymbals the squeaking of a fife or two and the faint roar of remote hurrahs the tail end of this procession was climbing the market house stairs when the twins arrived in its neighborhood when they reached the hall it was full of people torches smoke noise and enthusiasm they were conducted to the platform by buckstonetom driscoll still followingand were delivered to the chairman in the midst of a prodigious explosion of welcome when the noise had moderated a little the chair proposed that our illustrious guests be at once elected by complimentary acclamation to membership in our everglorious organization the paradise of the free and the perdition of the slave  this eloquent discharge opened the floodgates of enthusiasm again and the election was carried with thundering unanimity then arose a storm of cries  wet them down wet them down give them a drink  glasses of whisky were handed to the twins luigi waves his aloft then brought it to his lips but angelo set his down there was another storm of cries  whats the matter with the other one what is the blond one going back on us for explain explain  the chairman inquired and then reported  we have made an unfortunate mistake gentlemen i find that the count angelo capello is opposed to our creedis a teetotaler in fact and was not intending to apply for membership with us he desires that we reconsider the vote by which he was elected what is the pleasure of the house  there was a general burst of laughter plentifully accented with whistlings and catcalls but the energetic use of the gavel presently restored something like order then a man spoke from the crowd and said that while he was very sorry that the mistake had been made it would not be possible to rectify it at the present meeting according to the bylaws it must go over to the next regular meeting for action he would not offer a motion as none was required he desired to apologize to the gentlemen in the name of the house and begged to assure him that as far as it might lie in the power of the sons of liberty his temporary membership in the order would be made pleasant to him  this speech was received with great applause mixed with cries of  thats the talk hes a good fellow anyway if he is a teetotaler drink his health give him a rouser and no heeltaps  glasses were handed around and everybody on the platform drank angelos health while the house bellowed forth in song         for hes a jolly good fellow       for hes a jolly good fellow       for hes a jolly good feellow       which nobody can deny  tom driscoll drank it was his second glass for he had drunk angelos the moment that angelo had set it down the two drinks made him very merryalmost idiotically so and he began to take a most lively and prominent part in the proceedings particularly in the music and catcalls and side remarks  the chairman was still standing at the front the twins at his side the extraordinarily close resemblance of the brothers to each other suggested a witticism to tom driscoll and just as the chairman began a speech he skipped forward and said with an air of tipsy confidence to the audience  boys i move that he keeps still and lets this human philopena snip you out a speech  the descriptive aptness of the phrase caught the house and a mighty burst of laughter followed  luigis southern blood leaped to the boiling point in a moment under the sharp humiliation of this insult delivered in the presence of four hundred strangers it was not in the young mans nature to let the matter pass or to delay the squaring of the account he took a couple of strides and halted behind the unsuspecting joker then he drew back and delivered a kick of such titanic vigor that it lifted tom clear over the footlights and landed him on the heads of the front row of the sons of liberty  even a sober person does not like to have a human being emptied on him when he is not doing any harm a person who is not sober cannot endure such an attention at all the nest of sons of liberty that driscoll landed in had not a sober bird in it in fact there was probably not an entirely sober one in the auditorium driscoll was promptly and indignantly flung on the heads of sons in the next row and these sons passed him on toward the rear and then immediately began to pummel the front row sons who had passed him to them this course was strictly followed by bench after bench as driscoll traveled in his tumultuous and airy flight toward the door so he left behind him an everlengthening wake of raging and plunging and fighting and swearing humanity down went group after group of torches and presently above the deafening clatter of the gavel roar of angry voices and crash of succumbing benches rose the paralyzing cry of fire  the fighting ceased instantly the cursing ceased for one distinctly defined moment there was a dead hush a motionless calm where the tempest had been then with one impulse the multitude awoke to life and energy again and went surging and struggling and swaying this way and that its outer edges melting away through windows and doors and gradually lessening the pressure and relieving the mass  the fireboys were never on hand so suddenly before for there was no distance to go this time their quarters being in the rear end of the market house there was an engine company and a hookandladder company half of each was composed of rummies and the other half of antirummies after the moral and political shareandsharealike fashion of the frontier town of the period enough antirummies were loafing in quarters to man the engine and the ladders in two minutes they had their red shirts and helmets onthey never stirred officially in unofficial costumeand as the mass meeting overhead smashed through the long row of windows and poured out upon the roof of the arcade the deliverers were ready for them with a powerful stream of water which washed some of them off the roof and nearly drowned the rest but water was preferable to fire and still the stampede from the windows continued and still the pitiless drenching assailed it until the building was empty then the fireboys mounted to the hall and flooded it with water enough to annihilate forty times as much fire as there was there for a village fire company does not often get a chance to show off and so when it does get a chance it makes the most of it such citizens of that village as were of a thoughtful and judicious temperament did not insure against fire they insured against the fire company     chapter 12  the shame of judge driscoll       courage is resistance to fear mastery of fearnot absence      of fear except a creature be part coward it is not a      compliment to say it is brave it is merely a loose      misapplication of the word consider the fleaincomparably      the bravest of all the creatures of god if ignorance of      fear were courage whether you are asleep or awake he will      attack you caring nothing for the fact that in bulk and      strength you are to him as are the massed armies of the      earth to a sucking child he lives both day and night and      all days and nights in the very lap of peril and the      immediate presence of death and yet is no more afraid than      is the man who walks the streets of a city that was      threatened by an earthquake ten centuries before when we      speak of clive nelson and putnam as men who didnt know      what fear was we ought always to add the fleaand put him      at the head of the procession puddnhead wilsons      calendar   judge driscoll was in bed and asleep by ten oclock on friday night and he was up and gone afishing before daylight in the morning with his friend pembroke howard these two had been boys together in virginia when that state still ranked as the chief and most imposing member of the union and they still coupled the proud and affectionate adjective old with her name when they spoke of her in missouri a recognized superiority attached to any person who hailed from old virginia and this superiority was exalted to supremacy when a person of such nativity could also prove descent from the first families of that great commonwealth the howards and driscolls were of this aristocracy in their eyes it was a nobility it had its unwritten laws and they were as clearly defined and as strict as any that could be found among the printed statutes of the land the ffv was born a gentleman his highest duty in life was to watch over that great inheritance and keep it unsmirched he must keep his honor spotless those laws were his chart his course was marked out on it if he swerved from it by so much as half a point of the compass it meant shipwreck to his honor that is to say degradation from his rank as a gentleman these laws required certain things of him which his religion might forbid then his religion must yieldthe laws could not be relaxed to accommodate religions or anything else honor stood first and the laws defined what it was and wherein it differed in certain details from honor as defined by church creeds and by the social laws and customs of some of the minor divisions of the globe that had got crowded out when the sacred boundaries of virginia were staked out  if judge driscoll was the recognized first citizen of dawsons landing pembroke howard was easily its recognized second citizen he was called the great lawyeran earned title he and driscoll were of the same agea year or two past sixty  although driscoll was a freethinker and howard a strong and determined presbyterian their warm intimacy suffered no impairment in consequence they were men whose opinions were their own property and not subject to revision and amendment suggestion or criticism by anybody even their friends  the days fishing finished they came floating downstream in their skiff talking national politics and other high matters and presently met a skiff coming up from town with a man in it who said  i reckon you know one of the new twins gave your nephew a kicking last night judge  did what  gave him a kicking  the old judges lips paled and his eyes began to flame he choked with anger for a moment then he got out what he was trying to say  wellwellgo on give me the details  the man did it at the finish the judge was silent a minute turning over in his mind the shameful picture of toms flight over the footlights then he said as if musing aloud  hmi dont understand it i was asleep at home he didnt wake me thought he was competent to manage his affair without my help i reckon his face lit up with pride and pleasure at that thought and he said with a cheery complacency i like thatits the true old bloodhey pembroke  howard smiled an iron smile and nodded his head approvingly then the newsbringer spoke again  but tom beat the twin on the trial  the judge looked at the man wonderingly and said  the trial what trial  why tom had him up before judge robinson for assault and battery  the old man shrank suddenly together like one who has received a death stroke howard sprang for him as he sank forward in a swoon and took him in his arms and bedded him on his back in the boat he sprinkled water in his face and said to the startled visitor  go nowdont let him come to and find you here you see what an effect your heedless speech has had you ought to have been more considerate than to blurt out such a cruel piece of slander as that  im right down sorry i did it now mr howard and i wouldnt have done it if i had thought but it aint slander its perfectly true just as i told him  he rowed away presently the old judge came out of his faint and looked up piteously into the sympathetic face that was bent over him  say it aint true pembroke tell me it aint true he said in a weak voice  there was nothing weak in the deep organ tones that responded  you know its a lie as well as i do old friend he is of the best blood of the old dominion  god bless you for saying it said the old gentleman fervently ah pembroke it was such a blow  howard stayed by his friend and saw him home and entered the house with him it was dark and past suppertime but the judge was not thinking of supper he was eager to hear the slander refuted from headquarters and as eager to have howard hear it too tom was sent for and he came immediately he was bruised and lame and was not a happylooking object his uncle made him sit down and said  we have been hearing about your adventure tom with a handsome lie added for embellishment now pulverize that lie to dust what measures have you taken how does the thing stand  tom answered guilelessly it dont stand at all its all over i had him up in court and beat him puddnhead wilson defended himfirst case he ever had and lost it the judge fined the miserable hound five dollars for the assault  howard and the judge sprang to their feet with the opening sentence why neither knew then they stood gazing vacantly at each other howard stood a moment then sat mournfully down without saying anything the judges wrath began to kindle and he burst out  you cur you scum you vermin do you mean to tell me that blood of my race has suffered a blow and crawled to a court of law about it answer me  toms head drooped and he answered with an eloquent silence his uncle stared at him with a mixed expression of amazement and shame and incredulity that was sorrowful to see at last he said  which of the twins was it  count luigi  you have challenged him  nno hesitated tom turning pale  you will challenge him tonight howard will carry it  tom began to turn sick and to show it he turned his hat round and round in his hand his uncle glowering blacker and blacker upon him as the heavy seconds drifted by then at last he began to stammer and said piteously  oh please dont ask me to do it uncle he is a murderous devili never couldiim afraid of him  old driscolls mouth opened and closed three times before he could get it to perform its office then he stormed out  a coward in my family a driscoll a coward oh what have i done to deserve this infamy he tottered to his secretary in the corner repeated that lament again and again in heartbreaking tones and got out of a drawer a paper which he slowly tore to bits scattering the bits absently in his track as he walked up and down the room still grieving and lamenting at last he said  there it is shreds and fragments once moremy will once more you have forced me to disinherit you you base son of a most noble father leave my sight gobefore i spit on you  the young man did not tarry then the judge turned to howard  you will be my second old friend  of course  there is pen and paper draft the cartel and lose no time  the count shall have it in his hands in fifteen minutes said howard  tom was very heavyhearted his appetite was gone with his property and his selfrespect he went out the back way and wandered down the obscure lane grieving and wondering if any course of future conduct however discreet and carefully perfected and watched over could win back his uncles favor and persuade him to reconstruct once more that generous will which had just gone to ruin before his eyes he finally concluded that it could he said to himself that he had accomplished this sort of triumph once already and that what had been done once could be done again he would set about it he would bend every energy to the task and he would score that triumph once more cost what it might to his convenience limit as it might his frivolous and libertyloving life  to begin he says to himself ill square up with the proceeds of my raid and then gambling has got to be stoppedand stopped short off its the worst vice ive gotfrom my standpoint anyway because its the one he can most easily find out through the impatience of my creditors he thought it expensive to have to pay two hundred dollars to them for me once expensivethat why it cost me the whole of his fortunebut of course he never thought of that some people cant think of any but their own side of a case if he had known how deep i am in now the will would have gone to pot without waiting for a duel to help three hundred dollars its a pile but hell never hear of it im thankful to say the minute ive cleared it off im safe and ill never touch a card again anyway i wont while he lives i make oath to that im entering on my last reformi know ityes and ill win but after that if i ever slip again im gone     chapter 13  tom stares at ruin       when i reflect upon the number of disagreeable people who i      know have gone to a better world i am moved to lead a      different life puddnhead wilsons calendar       october this is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to      speculate in stocks in the others are july january      september april november may march june december      august and february puddnhead wilsons calendar   thus mournfully communing with himself tom moped along the lane past puddnhead wilsons house and still on and on between fences enclosing vacant country on each hand till he neared the haunted house then he came moping back again with many sighs and heavy with trouble he sorely wanted cheerful company rowena his heart gave a bound at the thought but the next thought quieted itthe detested twins would be there  he was on the inhabited side of wilsons house and now as he approached it he noticed that the sitting room was lighted this would do others made him feel unwelcome sometimes but wilson never failed in courtesy toward him and a kindly courtesy does at least save ones feelings even if it is not professing to stand for a welcome wilson heard footsteps at his threshold then the clearing of a throat  its that fickletempered dissipated young goosepoor devil he find friends pretty scarce today likely after the disgrace of carrying a personal assault case into a lawcourt  a dejected knock come in  tom entered and dropped into a chair without saying anything wilson said kindly  why my boy you look desolate dont take it so hard try and forget you have been kicked  oh dear said tom wretchedly its not that puddnheadits not that its a thousand times worse than thatoh yes a million times worse  why tom what do you mean has rowena  flung me no but the old man has  wilson said to himself aha and thought of the mysterious girl in the bedroom the driscolls have been making discoveries then he said aloud gravely  tom there are some kinds of dissipation which  oh shucks this hasnt got anything to do with dissipation he wanted me to challenge that derned italian savage and i wouldnt do it  yes of course he would do that said wilson in a meditative matterofcourse way but the thing that puzzled me was why he didnt look to that last night for one thing and why he let you carry such a matter into a court of law at all either before the duel or after it its no place for it it was not like him i couldnt understand it how did it happen  it happened because he didnt know anything about it he was asleep when i got home last night  and you didnt wake him tom is that possible  tom was not getting much comfort here he fidgeted a moment then said  i didnt choose to tell himthats all he was going afishing before dawn with pembroke howard and if i got the twins into the common calabooseand i thought sure i couldi never dreamed of their slipping out on a paltry fine for such an outrageous offensewell once in the calaboose they would be disgraced and uncle wouldnt want any duels with that sort of characters and wouldnt allow any  tom i am ashamed of you i dont see how you could treat your good old uncle so i am a better friend of his than you are for if i had known the circumstances i would have kept that case out of court until i got word to him and let him have the gentlemans chance  you would exclaimed tom with lively surprise and it your first case and you know perfectly well there never would have been any case if he had got that chance dont you and youd have finished your days a pauper nobody instead of being an actually launched and recognized lawyer today and you would really have done that would you  certainly  tom looked at him a moment or two then shook his head sorrowfully and said  i believe youupon my word i do i dont know why i do but i do puddnhead wilson i think youre the biggest fool i ever saw  thank you  dont mention it  well he has been requiring you to fight the italian and you have refused you degenerate remnant of an honorable line im thoroughly ashamed of you tom  oh thats nothing i dont care for anything now that the wills torn up again  tom tell me squarelydidnt he find any fault with you for anything but those two thingscarrying the case into court and refusing to fight  he watched the young fellows face narrowly but it was entirely reposeful and so also was the voice that answered  no he didnt find any other fault with me if he had had any to find he would have begun yesterday for he was just in the humor for it he drove that jackpair around town and showed them the sights and when he came home he couldnt find his fathers old silver watch that dont keep time and he thinks so much of and couldnt remember what he did with it three or four days ago when he saw it last and when i suggested that it probably wasnt lost but stolen it put him in a regular passion and he said i was a foolwhich convinced me without any trouble that that was just what he was afraid had happened himself but did not want to believe it because lost things stand a better chance of being found again than stolen ones  wheew whistled wilson score another one the list  another what  another theft  theft  yes theft that watch isnt lost its stolen theres been another raid on the townand just the same old mysterious sort of thing that has happened once before as you remember  you dont mean it  its as sure as you are born have you missed anything yourself  no that is i did miss a silver pencil case that aunt mary pratt gave me last birthday  youll find it stolenthats what youll find  no i shant for when i suggested theft about the watch and got such a rap i went and examined my room and the pencil case was missing but it was only mislaid and i found it again  you are sure you missed nothing else  well nothing of consequence i missed a small plain gold ring worth two or three dollars but that will turn up ill look again  in my opinion youll not find it theres been a raid i tell you come in  mr justice robinson entered followed by buckstone and the town constable jim blake they sat down and after some wandering and aimless weatherconversation wilson said  by the way weve just added another to the list of thefts maybe two judge driscolls old silver watch is gone and tom here has missed a gold ring  well it is a bad business said the justice and gets worse the further it goes the hankses the dobsons the pilligrews the ortons the grangers the hales the fullers the holcombs in fact everybody that lives around about patsy coopers had been robbed of little things like trinkets and teaspoons and suchlike small valuables that are easily carried off its perfectly plain that the thief took advantage of the reception at patsy coopers when all the neighbors were in her house and all their niggers hanging around her fence for a look at the show to raid the vacant houses undisturbed patsy is miserable about it miserable on account of the neighbors and particularly miserable on account of her foreigners of course so miserable on their account that she hasnt any room to worry about her own little losses  its the same old raider said wilson i suppose there isnt any doubt about that  constable blake doesnt think so  no youre wrong there said blake the other times it was a man there was plenty of signs of that as we know in the profession though we never got hands on him but this time its a woman  wilson thought of the mysterious girl straight off she was always in his mind now but she failed him again blake continued  shes a stoopshouldered old woman with a covered basket on her arm in a black veil dressed in mourning i saw her going aboard the ferryboat yesterday lives in illinois i reckon but i dont care where she lives im going to get hershe can make herself sure of that  what makes you think shes the thief  well there aint any other for one thing and for another some nigger draymen that happened to be driving along saw her coming out of or going into houses and told me soand it just happens that they was robbed every time  it was granted that this was plenty good enough circumstantial evidence a pensive silence followed which lasted some moments then wilson said  theres one good thing anyway she cant either pawn or sell count luigis costly indian dagger  my said tom is that gone  yes  well that was a haul but why cant she pawn it or sell it  because when the twins went home from the sons of liberty meeting last night news of the raid was sifting in from everywhere and aunt patsy was in distress to know if they had lost anything they found that the dagger was gone and they notified the police and pawnbrokers everywhere it was a great haul yes but the old woman wont get anything out of it because shell get caught  did they offer a reward asked buckstone  yes five hundred dollars for the knife and five hundred more for the thief  what a leatherheaded idea exclaimed the constable the thief dasnt go near them nor send anybody whoever goes is going to get himself nabbed for their aint any pawnbroker thats going to lose the chance to  if anybody had noticed toms face at that time the graygreen color of it might have provoked curiosity but nobody did he said to himself im gone i never can square up the rest of the plunder wont pawn or sell for half of the bill oh i know itim gone im goneand this time its for good oh this is awfuli dont know what to do nor which way to turn  softly softly said wilson to blake i planned their scheme for them at midnight last night and it was all finished up shipshape by two this morning theyll get their dagger back and then ill explain to you how the thing was done  there were strong signs of a general curiosity and buckstone said  well you have whetted us up pretty sharp wilson and im free to say that if you dont mind telling us in confidence  oh id as soon tell as not buckstone but as long as the twins and i agreed to say nothing about it we must let it stand so but you can take my word for it you wont be kept waiting three days somebody will apply for that reward pretty promptly and ill show you the thief and the dagger both very soon afterward  the constable was disappointed and also perplexed he said  it may all beyes and i hope it will but im blamed if i can see my way through it its too many for yours truly  the subject seemed about talked out nobody seemed to have anything further to offer after a silence the justice of the peace informed wilson that he and buckstone and the constable had come as a committee on the part of the democratic party to ask him to run for mayorfor the little town was about to become a city and the first charter election was approaching it was the first attention which wilson had ever received at the hands of any party it was a sufficiently humble one but it was a recognition of his debut into the towns life and activities at last it was a step upward and he was deeply gratified he accepted and the committee departed followed by young tom     chapter 14  roxana insists upon reform       the true southern watermelon is a boon apart and not to be      mentioned with commoner things it is chief of this worlds      luxuries king by the grace of god over all the fruits of      the earth when one has tasted it he knows what the angels      eat it was not a southern watermelon that eve took we know      it because she repented puddnhead wilsons calendar   about the time that wilson was bowing the committee out pembroke howard was entering the next house to report he found the old judge sitting grim and straight in his chair waiting  well howardthe news  the best in the world  accepts does he and the light of battle gleamed joyously in the judges eye  accepts why he jumped at it  did did he now thats finethats very fine i like that when is it to be  now straight off tonight an admirable fellowadmirable  admirable hes a darling why its an honor as well as a pleasure to stand up before such a man comeoff with you go and arrange everythingand give him my heartiest compliments a rare fellow indeed an admirable fellow as you have said  ill have him in the vacant stretch between wilsons and the haunted house within the hour and ill bring my own pistols  judge driscoll began to walk the floor in a state of pleased excitement but presently he stopped and began to thinkbegan to think of tom twice he moved toward the secretary and twice he turned away again but finally he said  this may be my last night in the worldi must not take the chance he is worthless and unworthy but it is largely my fault he was entrusted to me by my brother on his dying bed and i have indulged him to his hurt instead of training him up severely and making a man of him i have violated my trust and i must not add the sin of desertion to that i have forgiven him once already and would subject him to a long and hard trial before forgiving him again if i could live but i must not run that risk no i must restore the will but if i survive the duel i will hide it away and he will not know and i will not tell him until he reforms and i see that his reformation is going to be permanent  he redrew the will and his ostensible nephew was heir to a fortune again as he was finishing his task tom wearied with another brooding tramp entered the house and went tiptoeing past the sitting room door he glanced in and hurried on for the sight of his uncle was nothing but terrors for him tonight but his uncle was writing that was unusual at this late hour what could he be writing a chill of anxiety settled down upon toms heart did that writing concern him he was afraid so he reflected that when ill luck begins it does not come in sprinkles but in showers he said he would get a glimpse of that document or know the reason why he heard someone coming and stepped out of sight and hearing it was pembroke howard what could be hatching  howard said with great satisfaction  everythings right and ready hes gone to the battleground with his second and the surgeonalso with his brother ive arranged it all with wilsonwilsons his second we are to have three shots apiece  good how is the moon  bright as day nearly perfect for the distancefifteen yards no windnot a breath hot and still  all good all firstrate here pembroke read this and witness it  pembroke read and witnessed the will then gave the old mans hand a hearty shake and said  now thats right yorkbut i knew you would do it you couldnt leave that poor chap to fight along without means or profession with certain defeat before him and i knew you wouldnt for his fathers sake if not for his own  for his dead fathers sake i couldnt i know for poor percybut you know what percy was to me but mindtom is not to know of this unless i fall tonight  i understand ill keep the secret  the judge put the will away and the two started for the battleground in another minute the will was in toms hands his misery vanished his feelings underwent a tremendous revulsion he put the will carefully back in its place and spread his mouth and swung his hat once twice three times around his head in imitation of three rousing huzzahs no sound issuing from his lips he fell to communing with himself excitedly and joyously but every now and then he let off another volley of dumb hurrahs  he said to himself ive got the fortune again but ill not let on that i know about it and this time im going to hang on to it i take no more risks ill gamble no more ill drink no more becausewell because ill not go where there is any of that sort of thing going on again its the sure way and the only sure way i might have thought of that soonerwell yes if i had wanted to but nowdear me ive had a scare this time and ill take no more chances not a single chance more land i persuaded myself this evening that i could fetch him around without any great amount of effort but ive been getting more and more heavyhearted and doubtful straight along ever since if he tells me about this thing all right but if he doesnt i shant let on iwell id like to tell puddnhead wilson butno ill think about that perhaps i wont he whirled off another dead huzzah and said im reformed and this time ill stay so sure  he was about to close with a final grand silent demonstration when he suddenly recollected that wilson had put it out of his power to pawn or sell the indian knife and that he was once more in awful peril of exposure by his creditors for that reason his joy collapsed utterly and he turned away and moped toward the door moaning and lamenting over the bitterness of his luck he dragged himself upstairs and brooded in his room a long time disconsolate and forlorn with luigis indian knife for a text at last he sighed and said  when i supposed these stones were glass and this ivory bone the thing hadnt any interest for me because it hadnt any value and couldnt help me out of my trouble but nowwhy now it is full of interest yes and of a sort to break a bodys heart its a bag of gold that has turned to dirt and ashes in my hands it could save me and save me so easily and yet ive got to go to ruin its like drowning with a life preserver in my reach all the hard luck comes to me and all the good luck goes to other peoplepuddnhead wilson for instance even his career has got a sort of a little start at last and what has he done to deserve it i should like to know yes he has opened his own road but he isnt content with that but must block mine its a sordid selfish world and i wish i was out of it he allowed the light of the candle to play upon the jewels of the sheath but the flashings and sparklings had no charm for his eye they were only just so many pangs to his heart i must not say anything to roxy about this thing he said she is too daring she would be for digging these stones out and selling them and thenwhy she would be arrested and the stones traced and then the thought made him quake and he hid the knife away trembling all over and glancing furtively about like a criminal who fancies that the accuser is already at hand  should he try to sleep oh no sleep was not for him his trouble was too haunting too afflicting for that he must have somebody to mourn with he would carry his despair to roxy  he had heard several distant gunshots but that sort of thing was not uncommon and they had made no impression upon him he went out at the back door and turned westward he passed wilsons house and proceeded along the lane and presently saw several figures approaching wilsons place through the vacant lots these were the duelists returning from the fight he thought he recognized them but as he had no desire for white peoples company he stooped down behind the fence until they were out of his way  roxy was feeling fine she said  whah was you child warnt you in it  in what  in de duel  duel has there been a duel  cose dey has de ole jedge has ben havin a duel wid one o dem twins  great scott then he added to himself thats what made him remake the will he thought he might get killed and it softened him toward me and thats what he and howard were so busy about    oh dear if the twin had only killed him i should be out of my  what is you mumblin bout chambers whah was you didnt you know dey was gwine to be a duel  no i didnt the old man tried to get me to fight one with count luigi but he didnt succeed so i reckon he concluded to patch up the family honor himself  he laughed at the idea and went rambling on with a detailed account of his talk with the judge and how shocked and ashamed the judge was to find that he had a coward in his family he glanced up at last and got a shock himself roxanas bosom was heaving with suppressed passion and she was glowering down upon him with measureless contempt written in her face  en you refuse to fight a man dat kicked you stid o jumpin at de chance en you aint got no mo feelin den to come en tell me dat fetched sich a po lowdown ornery rabbit into de worl pah it make me sick its de nigger in you dats what it is thirtyone parts o you is white en ony one part nigger en dat po little one part is yo soul taint wuth savin taint wuth totin out on a shovel en throwin en de gutter you has disgraced yo birth what would yo pa think o you its enough to make him turn in his grave  the last three sentences stung tom into a fury and he said to himself that if his father were only alive and in reach of assassination his mother would soon find that he had a very clear notion of the size of his indebtedness to that man and was willing to pay it up in full and would do it too even at risk of his life but he kept this thought to himself that was safest in his mothers present state

husbun was a nigger king outen africaen yit here you is a slinkin outen a duel en disgracin our whole line like a ornery lowdown hound yes its de nigger in you  she sat down on her candle box and fell into a reverie tom did not disturb her he sometimes lacked prudence but it was not in circumstances of this kind roxanas storm went gradually down but it died hard and even when it seemed to be quite gone it would now and then break out in a distant rumble so to speak in the form of muttered ejaculations one of these was aint nigger enough in him to show in his fingernails en dat takes mighty littleyit deys enough to pain his soul  presently she muttered yassir enough to paint a whole thimbleful of em at last her ramblings ceased altogether and her countenance began to cleara welcome sight to tom who had learned her moods and knew she was on the threshold of good humor now he noticed that from time to time she unconsciously carried her finger to the end of her nose he looked closer and said  why mammy the end of your nose is skinned how did that come  she sent out the sort of wholehearted peal of laughter which god had vouchsafed in its perfection to none but the happy angels in heaven and the bruised and broken black slave on the earth and said  dad fetch dat duel i ben in it myself  gracious did a bullet do that  yassir you bet it did  well i declare why how did that happen

har off  george said tom to himself to come so near being out of my trouble and miss it by an inch oh dear dear he will live to find me out and sell me to some nigger trader yetyes and he would do it in a minute then he said aloud in a grave tone  mother we are in an awful fix  roxana caught her breath with a spasm and said  chile what you hit a body so sudden for like dat whats ben en gone en happen  well theres one thing i didnt tell you when i wouldnt fight he tore up the will again and  roxanas face turned a dead white and she said  now yous donedone forever dats de end bofe un us is

levity in his voice when he answered  yes mother i know now that i am reformedand permanently permanentlyand beyond the reach of any human temptation  den glong home en begin     chapter 15  the robber robbed       nothing so needs reforming as other peoples habits      puddnhead wilsons calendar       behold the fool saith put not all thine eggs in the one      basketwhich is but a manner of saying scatter your      money and your attention but the wise man saith put all      your eggs in the one basket andwatch that basket      puddnhead wilsons calendar   what a time of it dawsons landing was having all its life it had been asleep but now it hardly got a chance for a nod so swiftly did big events and crashing surprises come along in one anothers wake friday morning first glimpse of real nobility also grand reception at aunt patsy coopers also great robber raid friday evening dramatic kicking of the heir of the chief citizen in presence of four hundred people saturday morning emergence as practicing lawyer of the longsubmerged puddnhead wilson saturday night duel between chief citizen and titled stranger  the people took more pride in the duel than in all the other events put together perhaps it was a glory to their town to have such a thing happen there in their eyes the principals had reached the summit of human honor everybody paid homage to their names their praises were in all mouths even the duelists subordinates came in for a handsome share of the public approbation wherefore puddnhead wilson was suddenly become a man of consequence when asked to run for the mayoralty saturday night he was risking defeat but sunday morning found him a made man and his success assured  the twins were prodigiously great now the town took them to its bosom with enthusiasm day after day and night after night they went dining and visiting from house to house making friends enlarging and solidifying their popularity and charming and surprising all with their musical prodigies and now and then heightening the effects with samples of what they could do in other directions out of their stock of rare and curious accomplishments they were so pleased that they gave the regulation thirty days notice the required preparation for citizenship and resolved to finish their days in this pleasant place that was the climax the delighted community rose as one man and applauded and when the twins were asked to stand for seats in the forthcoming aldermanic board and consented the public contentment was rounded and complete  tom driscoll was not happy over these things they sunk deep and hurt all the way down he hated the one twin for kicking him and the other one for being the kickers brother  now and then the people wondered why nothing was heard of the raider or of the stolen knife or the other plunder but nobody was able to throw any light on that matter nearly a week had drifted by and still the thing remained a vexed mystery  on sunday constable blake and puddnhead wilson met on the street and tom driscoll joined them in time to open their conversation for them he said to blake you are not looking well blake you seem to be annoyed about something has anything gone wrong in the detective business i believe you fairly and justifiably claim to have a pretty good reputation in that line isnt it sowhich made blake feel good and look it but tom added for a country detectivewhich made blake feel the other way and not only look it but betray it in his voice  yes sir i have got a reputation and its as good as anybodys in the profession too country or no country  oh i beg pardon i didnt mean any offense what i started out to ask was only about the old woman that raided the townthe stoopshouldered old woman you know that you said you were going to catch and i knew you would too because you have the reputation of never boasting andwell youyouve caught the old woman  damn the old woman  why sho you dont mean to say you havent caught her  no i havent caught her if anybody could have caught her i could but nobody couldnt i dont care who he is  i am sorry real sorryfor your sake because when it gets around that a detective has expressed himself confidently and then  dont you worry thats alldont you worry and as for the town the town neednt worry either shes my meatmake yourself easy about that im on her track ive got clues that  thats good now if you could get an old veteran detective down from st louis to help you find out what the clues mean and where they lead to and then  im plenty veteran enough myself and i dont need anybodys help ill have her inside of a weinside of a month that ill swear to  tom said carelessly  i suppose that will answeryes that will answer but i reckon she is pretty old and old people dont often outlive the cautious pace of the professional detective when he has got his clues together and is out on his stillhunt  blakes dull face flushed under this gibe but before he could set his retort in order tom had turned to wilson and was saying with placid indifference of manner and voice  who got the reward puddnhead  wilson winced slightly and saw that his own turn was come  what reward  why the reward for the thief and the other one for the knife  wilson answeredand rather uncomfortably to judge by his hesitating fashion of delivering himself  well thewell in face nobody has claimed it yet  tom seemed surprised  why is that so  wilson showed a trifle of irritation when he replied  yes its so and what of it  oh nothing only i thought you had struck out a new idea and invented a scheme that was going to revolutionize the timeworn and ineffectual methods of the he stopped and turned to blake who was happy now that another had taken his place on the gridiron blake didnt you understand him to intimate that it wouldnt be necessary for you to hunt the old woman down  bgeorge he said hed have thief and swag both inside of three days he did by hokey and thats just about a week ago why i said at the time that no thief and no thiefs pal was going to try to pawn or sell a thing where he knowed the pawnbroker could get both rewards by taking him into camp with the swag it was the blessedest idea that ever i struck  youd change your mind said wilson with irritated bluntness if you knew the entire scheme instead of only part of it  well said the constable pensively i had the idea that it wouldnt work and up to now im right anyway  very well then let it stand at that and give it a further show it has worked at least as well as your own methods you perceive  the constable hadnt anything handy to hit back with so he discharged a discontented sniff and said nothing  after the night that wilson had partly revealed his scheme at his house tom had tried for several days to guess out the secret of the rest of it but had failed then it occurred to him to give roxanas smarter head a chance at it he made up a supposititious case and laid it before her she thought it over and delivered her verdict upon it tom said to himself shes hit it sure he thought he would test that verdict now and watch wilsons face so he said reflectively  wilson youre not a foola fact of recent discovery whatever your scheme was it had sense in it blakes opinion to the contrary notwithstanding i dont ask you to reveal it but i will suppose a casea case which you will answer as a starting point for the real thing i am going to come at and thats all i want you offered five hundred dollars for the knife and five hundred for the thief we will suppose for arguments sake that the first reward is advertised and the second offered by private letter to pawnbrokers and  blake slapped his thigh and cried out  by jackson hes got you puddnhead now why couldnt i or any fool have thought of that  wilson said to himself anybody with a reasonably good head would have thought of it i am not surprised that blake didnt detect it i am only surprised that tom did there is more to him than i supposed he said nothing aloud and tom went on  very well the thief would not suspect that there was a trap and he would bring or send the knife and say he bought it for a song or found it in the road or something like that and try to collect the reward and be arrestedwouldnt he  yes said wilson  i think so said tom there cant be any doubt of it have you ever seen that knife  no  has any friend of yours  not that i know of  well i begin to think i understand why your scheme failed  what do you mean tom what are you driving at asked wilson with a dawning sense of discomfort  why that there isnt any such knife  look here wilson said blake tom driscolls right for a thousand dollarsif i had it  wilsons blood warmed a little and he wondered if he had been played upon by those strangers it certainly had something of that look but what could they gain by it he threw out that suggestion tom replied  gain oh nothing that you would value maybe but they are strangers making their way in a new community is it nothing to them to appear as pets of an oriental princeat no expense is it nothing to them to be able to dazzle this poor town with thousanddollar rewardsat no expense wilson there isnt any such knife or your scheme would have fetched it to light or if there is any such knife theyve got it yet i believe myself that theyve seen such a knife for angelo pictured it out with his pencil too swiftly and handily for him to have been inventing it and of course i cant swear that theyve never had it but this ill go bail forif they had it when they came to this town theyve got it yet  blake said  it looks mighty reasonable the way tom puts it it most certainly does  tom responded turning to leave  you find the old woman blake and if she cant furnish the knife go and search the twins  tom sauntered away wilson felt a good deal depressed he hardly knew what to think he was loath to withdraw his faith from the twins and was resolved not to do it on the present indecisive evidence butwell he would think and then decide how to act  blake what do you think of this matter  well puddnhead im bound to say i put it up the way tom does they hadnt the knife or if they had it theyve got it yet  the men parted wilson said to himself  i believe they had it if it had been stolen the scheme would have restored it that is certain and so i believe theyve got it  tom had no purpose in his mind when he encountered those two men when he began his talk he hoped to be able to gall them a little and get a trifle of malicious entertainment out of it but when he left he left in great spirits for he perceived that just by pure luck and no troublesome labor he had accomplished several delightful things he had touched both men on a raw spot and seen them squirm he had modified wilsons sweetness for the twins with one small bitter taste that he wouldnt be able to get out of his mouth right away and best of all he had taken the hated twins down a peg with the community for blake would gossip around freely after the manner of detectives and within a week the town would be laughing at them in its sleeve for offering a gaudy reward for a bauble which they either never possessed or hadnt lost tom was very well satisfied with himself  toms behavior at home had been perfect during the entire week his uncle and aunt had seen nothing like it before they could find no fault with him anywhere  saturday evening he said to the judge  ive had something preying on my mind uncle and as i am going away and might never see you again i cant bear it any longer i made you believe i was afraid to fight that italian adventurer i had to get out of it on some pretext or other and maybe i chose badly being taken unawares but no honorable person could consent to meet him in the field knowing what i knew about him  indeed what was that  count luigi is a confessed assassin  incredible  its perfectly true wilson detected it in his hand by palmistry and charged him with it and cornered him up so close that he had to confess but both twins begged us on their knees to keep the secret and swore they would lead straight lives here and it was all so pitiful that we gave our word of honor never to expose them while they kept the promise you would have done it yourself uncle  you are right my boy i would a mans secret is still his own property and sacred when it has been surprised out of him like that you did well and i am proud of you then he added mournfully but i wish i could have been saved the shame of meeting an assassin on the field of honor  it couldnt be helped uncle if i had known you were going to challenge him i should have felt obliged to sacrifice my pledged word in order to stop it but wilson couldnt be expected to do otherwise than keep silent  oh no wilson did right and is in no way to blame tom tom you have lifted a heavy load from my heart i was stung to the very soul when i seemed to have discovered that i had a coward in my family  you may imagine what it cost me to assume such a part uncle  oh i know it poor boy i know it and i can understand how much it has cost you to remain under that unjust stigma to this time but it is all right now and no harm is done you have restored my comfort of mind and with it your own and both of us had suffered enough  the old man sat awhile plunged in thought then he looked up with a satisfied light in his eye and said that this assassin should have put the affront upon me of letting me meet him on the field of honor as if he were a gentleman is a matter which i will presently settlebut not now i will not shoot him until after election i see a way to ruin them both before i will attend to that first neither of them shall be elected that i promise you are sure that the fact that he is an assassin has not got abroad  perfectly certain of it sir  it will be a good card i will fling a hint at it from the stump on the polling day it will sweep the ground from under both of them  theres not a doubt of it it will finish them  that and outside work among the voters will to a certainty i want you to come down here by and by and work privately among the ragtag and bobtail you shall spend money among them i will furnish it  another point scored against the detested twins really it was a great day for tom he was encouraged to chance a parting shot now at the same target and did it  you know that wonderful indian knife that the twins have been making such a todo about well theres no track or trace of it yet so the town is beginning to sneer and gossip and laugh half the people believe they never had any such knife the other half believe they had it and have got it still ive heard twenty people talking like that today  yes toms blemishless week had restored him to the favor of his aunt and uncle  his mother was satisfied with him too privately she believed she was coming to love him but she did not say so she told him to go along to st louis now and she would get ready and follow then she smashed her whisky bottle and said  dah now is agwine to make you walk as straight as a string chambers en so is bown you aint gwine to git no bad example out o yo mammy i tole you you couldnt go into no bad compny well yous gwine into my compny en is gwine to fill de bill now den trot along trot along  tom went aboard one of the big transient boats that night with his heavy satchel of miscellaneous plunder and slept the sleep of the unjust which is serener and sounder than the other kind as we know by the hangingeve history of a million rascals but when he got up in the morning luck was against him again a brother thief had robbed him while he slept and gone ashore at some intermediate landing     chapter 16  sold down the river       if you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous he      will not bite you this is the principal difference between      a dog and a man puddnhead wilsons calendar       we all know about the habits of the ant we know all about      the habits of the bee but we know nothing at all about the      habits of the oyster it seems almost certain that we have      been choosing the wrong time for studying the oyster      puddnhead wilsons calendar   when roxana arrived she found her son in such despair and misery that her heart was touched and her motherhood rose up strong in her he was ruined past hope now his destruction would be immediate and sure and he would be an outcast and friendless that was reason enough for a mother to love a child so she loved him and told him so it made him wince secretlyfor she was a nigger that he was one himself was far from reconciling him to that despised race  roxana poured out endearments upon him to which he responded uncomfortably but as well as he could and she tried to comfort him but that was not possible these intimacies quickly became horrible to him and within the hour he began to try to get up courage enough to tell her so and require that they be discontinued or very considerably modified but he was afraid of her and besides there came a lull now for she had begun to think she was trying to invent a saving plan finally she started up and said she had found a way out tom was almost suffocated by the joy of this sudden good news roxana said  here is de plan en shell win sure is a nigger en nobody aint gwine to doubt it dat hears me talk is wuth six hundd dollahs take en sell me en pay off dese gamblers  tom was dazed he was not sure he had heard aright he was dumb for a moment then he said  do you mean that you would be sold into slavery to save me  aint you my chile en does you know anything dat a mother wont do for her chile day aint nothin a white mother wont do for her chile who made em so de lord done it en who made de niggers de lord made em in de inside mothers is all de same de good lord he made em so is gwine to be sole into slavery en in a year yous gwine to buy yo ole mammy free agin ill show you how dats de plan  toms hopes began to rise and his spirits along with them he said  its lovely of you mammyits just  say it agin en keep on sayin it its all de pay a body kin want in dis worl en its mo den enough laws bless you honey when is slav aroun en dey buses me if i knows yous asayin dat way off yonder somers itll heal up all de sore places en i kin stan em  i do say it again mammy and ill keep on saying it too but how am i going to sell you youre free you know  much diffrence dat make white folks aint particlar de law kin sell me now if dey tell me to leave de state in six months en i dont go you draw up a paperbill o saleen put it way off yonder down in de middle o kaintuck somers en sign some names to it en say youll sell me cheap case yous hard up youll find you aint gwine to have no trouble you take me up de country a piece en sell me on a farm dem people aint gwine to ask no questions if is a bargain  tom forged a bill of sale and sold his mother to an arkansas cotton planter for a trifle over six hundred dollars he did not want to commit this treachery but luck threw the man in his way and this saved him the necessity of going upcountry to hunt up a purchaser with the added risk of having to answer a lot of questions whereas this planter was so pleased with roxy that he asked next to none at all besides the planter insisted that roxy wouldnt know where she was at first and that by the time she found out she would already have been contented  so tom argued with himself that it was an immense advantaged for roxy to have a master who was pleased with her as this planter manifestly was in almost no time his flowing reasonings carried him to the point of even half believing he was doing roxy a splendid surreptitious service in selling her down the river and then he kept diligently saying to himself all the time its for only a year in a year i buy her free again shell keep that in mind and itll reconcile her yes the little deception could do no harm and everything would come out right and pleasant in the end anyway by agreement the conversation in roxys presence was all about the mans upcountry farm and how pleasant a place it was and how happy the slaves were there so poor roxy was entirely deceived and easily for she was not dreaming that her own son could be guilty of treason to a mother who in voluntarily going into slaveryslavery of any kind mild or severe or of any duration brief or longwas making a sacrifice for him compared with which death would have been a poor and commonplace one she lavished tears and loving caresses upon him privately and then went away with her owner went away brokenhearted and yet proud to do it  tom scored his accounts and resolved to keep to the very letter of his reform and never to put that will in jeopardy again he had three hundred dollars left according to his mothers plan he was to put that safely away and add her half of his pension to it monthly in one year this fund would buy her free again  for a whole week he was not able to sleep well so much the villainy which he had played upon his trusting mother preyed upon his rag of conscience but after that he began to get comfortable again and was presently able to sleep like any other miscreant  the boat bore roxy away from st louis at four in the afternoon and she stood on the lower guard abaft the paddle box and watched tom through a blur of tears until he melted into the throng of people and disappeared then she looked no more but sat there on a coil of cable crying till far into the night when she went to her foul steerage bunk at last between the clashing engines it was not to sleep but only to wait for the morning and waiting grieve  it had been imagined that she would not know and would think she was traveling upstream she why she had been steamboating for years at dawn she got up and went listlessly and sat down on the cable coil again she passed many a snag whose break could have told her a thing to break her heart for it showed a current moving in the same direction that the boat was going but her thoughts were elsewhere and she did not notice but at last the roar of a bigger and nearer break than usual brought her out of her torpor and she looked up and her practiced eye fell upon that telltale rush of water for one moment her petrified gaze fixed itself there then her head dropped upon her breast and she said  oh de good lord god have mercy on po sinful meis sole down de river     chapter 17  the judge utters dire prophesy       even popularity can be overdone in rome along at

fools on this day      than in all the other days of the year put together this      proves by the number left in stock that one fourth of july      per year is now inadequate the country has grown so      puddnhead wilsons calendar   the summer weeks dragged by and then the political campaign opened opened in pretty warm fashion and waxed hotter and hotter daily the twins threw themselves into it with their whole heart for their selflove was engaged their popularity so general at first had suffered afterward mainly because they had been too popular and so a natural reaction had followed besides it had been diligently whispered around that it was curiousindeed very curiousthat that wonderful knife of theirs did not turn upif it was so valuable or if it had ever existed and with the whisperings went chucklings and nudgings and winks and such things have an effect the twins considered that success in the election would reinstate them and that defeat would work them irreparable damage therefore they worked hard but not harder than judge driscoll and tom worked against them in the closing days of the canvass toms conduct had remained so letterperfect during two whole months now that his uncle not only trusted him with money with which to persuade voters but trusted him to go and get it himself out of the safe in the private sitting room  the closing speech of the campaign was made by judge driscoll and he made it against both of the foreigners it was disastrously effective he poured out rivers of ridicule upon them and forced the big mass meeting to laugh and applaud he scoffed at them as adventurers mountebanks sideshow riffraff dime museum freaks he assailed their showy titles with measureless derision he said they were backalley barbers disguised as nobilities peanut peddlers masquerading as gentlemen organgrinders bereft of their brother monkey at last he stopped and stood still he waited until the place had become absolutely silent and expectant then he delivered his deadliest shot delivered it with icecold seriousness and deliberation with a significant emphasis upon the closing words he said he believed that the reward offered for the lost knife was humbug and bunkum and that its owner would know where to find it whenever he should have occasion to assassinate somebody  then he stepped from the stand leaving a startled and impressive hush behind him instead of the customary explosion of cheers and party cries  the strange remark flew far and wide over the town and made an extraordinary sensation everybody was asking what could he mean by that and everybody went on asking that question but in vain for the judge only said he knew what he was talking about and stopped there tom said he hadnt any idea what his uncle meant and wilson whenever he was asked what he thought it meant parried the question by asking the questioner what he thought it meant  wilson was elected the twins were defeatedcrushed in fact and left forlorn and substantially friendless tom went back to st louis happy  dawsons landing had a week of repose now and it needed it but it was in an expectant state for the air was full of rumors of a new duel judge driscolls election labors had prostrated him but it was said that as soon as he was well enough to entertain a challenge he would get one from count luigi  the brothers withdrew entirely from society and nursed their humiliation in privacy they avoided the people and went out for exercise only late at night when the streets were deserted     chapter 18  roxana commands       gratitude and treachery are merely the two extremities of      the same procession you have seen all of it that is worth      staying for when the band and the gaudy officials have gone      by

not      become you and me to sneer at fiji puddnhead wilsons      calendar   the friday after the election was a rainy one in st louis it rained all day long and rained hard apparently trying its best to wash that sootblackened town white but of course not succeeding toward midnight tom driscoll arrived at his lodgings from the theater in the heavy downpour and closed his umbrella and let himself in but when he would have shut the door he found that there was another person enteringdoubtless another lodger this person closed the door and tramped upstairs behind tom tom found his door in the dark and entered it and turned up the gas when he faced about lightly whistling he saw the back of a man the man was closing and locking his door from him his whistle faded out and he felt uneasy the man turned around a wreck of shabby old clothes sodden with rain and all adrip and showed a black face under an old slouch hat tom was frightened he tried to order the man out but the words refused to come and the other man got the start he said in a low voice  keep stillis yo mother  tom sunk in a heap on a chair and gasped out  it was mean of me and basei know it but i meant it for the best i did indeedi can swear it  roxana stood awhile looking mutely down on him while he writhed in shame and went on incoherently babbling selfaccusations mixed with pitiful attempts at explanation and palliation of his crime then she seated herself and took off her hat and her unkept masses of long brown hair tumbled down about her shoulders  it warnt no fault o yon dat dat aint gray she said sadly noticing the hair  i know it i know it im a scoundrel but i swear i meant it for the best it was a mistake of course but i thought it was for the best i truly did  roxana began to cry softly and presently words began to find their way out between her sobs they were uttered lamentingly rather than angrily  sell a pusson down de riverdown de riverfor de bes i wouldnt treat a dog so i is all broke down en wore out now en so i reckon it aint in me to storm aroun no mo like i used to when i uz trompled on en bused i dont knowbut maybe its so leastways is suffered so much dat mournin seem to come mo handy to me now den stormin  these words should have touched tom driscoll but if they did that effect was obliterated by a stronger oneone which removed the heavy weight of fear which lay upon him and gave his crushed spirit a most grateful rebound and filled all his small soul with a deep sense of relief but he kept prudently still and ventured no comment there was a voiceless interval of some duration now in which no sounds were heard but the beating of the rain upon the panes the sighing and complaining of the winds and now and then a muffled sob from roxana the sobs became more and more infrequent and at last ceased then the refugee began to talk again  shet down dat light a little more more yit a pusson dat is hunted dont like de light dahdatll do i kin see whah you is en dats enough is gwine to tell you de tale en cut it jes as short as i kin en den ill tell you what yous got to do dat man dat bought me aint a bad man hes good enough as planters goes en if he could a had

overseer but dat uz bad for me for de mistis she fine it out en arter dat i jist ketched it at every turndey warnt no mercy for me no mo  toms heart was firedwith fury against the planters wife and he said to himself but for that meddlesome fool everything would have gone all right he added a deep and bitter curse against her  the expression of this sentiment was fiercely written in his face and stood thus revealed to roxana by a white glare of lightning which turned the somber dusk of the room into dazzling day at that moment she was pleasedpleased and grateful for did not that expression show that her child was capable of grieving for his mothers wrongs and of feeling resentment toward her persecutorsa thing which she had been doubting but her flash of happiness was only a flash and went out again and left her spirit dark for she said to herself he sole me down de riverhe cant feel for a body long disll pass en go then she took up her tale again  bout ten days ago i uz sayin to

ghastly terror and he said to himself now im lost no matter what turn things take this man has said to me that he thinks there was something suspicious about that sale he said he had a letter from a passenger on the grand mogul saying that roxy came here on that boat and that everybody on board knew all about the case so he says that her coming here instead of flying to a free state looks bad for me and that if i dont find her for him and that pretty soon he will make trouble for me i never believed that story i couldnt believe she would be so dead to all motherly instincts as to come here knowing the risk she would run of getting me into irremediable trouble and after all here she is and i stupidly swore i would help find her thinking it was a perfectly safe thing to promise if i venture to deliver her up sheshebut how can i help myself ive got to do that or pay the money and wheres the money to come from iiwell i should think that if he would swear to treat her kindly hereafterand she says herself that he is a good manand if he would swear to never allow her to be overworked or ill fed or  a flash of lightning exposed toms pallid face drawn and rigid with these worrying thoughts roxana spoke up sharply now and there was apprehension in her voice  turn up dat light i want to see yo face better dah nowlemme look at you chambers yous as white as yo shirt has you see dat man has he ben to see you  yes  when  monday noon  monday noon was he on my track  hewell he thought he was that is he hoped he was this is the bill you saw he took it out of his pocket  read it to me  she was panting with excitement and there was a dusky glow in her eyes that tom could not translate with certainty but there seemed to be something threatening about it the handbill had the usual rude woodcut of a turbaned negro woman running with the customary bundle on a stick over her shoulder and the heading in bold type 100 reward tom read the bill aloudat least the part that described roxana and named the master and his st louis address and the address of the fourth street agency but he left out the item that applicants for the reward might also apply to mr thomas driscoll  gimme de bill  tom had folded it and was putting it in his pocket he felt a chilly streak creeping down his back but said as carelessly as he could  the bill why it isnt any use to you you cant read it what do you want with it  gimme de bill tom gave it to her but with a reluctance which he could not entirely disguise did you read it all to me  certainly i did  hole up yo han en swah to it  tom did it roxana put the bill carefully away in her pocket with her eyes fixed upon toms face all the while then she said  yos lyin  what would i want to lie about it for  i dont knowbut you is

rectify it by saying he remembered now that it was at noon monday that the man gave him the bill roxana said  yous lyin agin sho then she straightened up and raised her finger  now den is gwine to ask

nor arguments could help him any longerhe was in a vise with the screw turned on and out of it there was no budging his face began to take on an ugly look and presently he said with a snarl  well what could i do you see yourself that i was in his grip and couldnt get out  roxy scorched him with a scornful gaze awhile then she said  what could you do you could be judas to yo own mother to save yo wuthless hide would anybody blieve it noa dog couldnt you is de lowdownest orneriest hound dat was ever pupd into dis worlen is sponsible for itand she spat on him  he made no effort to resent this roxy reflected a moment then she said  now ill tell you what yous gwine to do yous gwine to give dat man de money dat yous got laid up en make him wait till you kin go to de judge en git de res en buy me free agin  thunder what are you thinking of go and ask him for three hundred dollars and odd what would i tell him i want it for pray  roxys answer was delivered in a serene and level voice  youll

money ill go to him myself en den hell sell you down de river en you kin see how you like it  tom rose trembling and excited and there was an evil light in his eye he strode to the door and said he must get out of this suffocating place for a moment and clear his brain in the fresh air so that he could determine what to do the door wouldnt open roxy smiled grimly and said  is got the key honeyset down you neednt cler up yo brain none to fine out what you gwine to doi knows what yous gwine to do tom sat down and began to pass his hands through his hair with a helpless and desperate air roxy said is dat man in dis house  tom glanced up with a surprised expression and asked  what gave you such an idea  you done it gwine out to cler yo brain in de fust place you aint got none to cler

 yes its diffrent from yon shet de light out en move alongheres de key  they were not followed tom trembled every time a late straggler brushed by them on the street and half expected to feel the cold steel in his back roxy was right at his heels and always in reach after tramping a mile they reached a wide vacancy on the deserted wharves and in this dark and rainy desert they parted  as tom trudged home his mind was full of dreary thoughts and wild plans but at last he said to himself wearily  there is but the one way out i must follow her plan but with a variationi will not ask for the money and ruin myself i will rob the old skinflint     chapter 19  the prophesy realized       few things are harder to put up with than the annoyance of      a good example puddnhead wilsons calendar

angelo told him about the homicide committed by luigi he would not have considered the act discreditable to luigi but the obstinate old man was not to be moved  wilson went back to his principal and reported the failure of his mission luigi was incensed and asked how it could be that the old gentleman who was by no means dullwitted held his trifling nephews evidence in inferences to be of more value than wilsons but wilson laughed and said  that is quite simple that is easily explicable i am not his dollhis babyhis infatuation his nature is the judge and his late wife never had any children the judge and his wife were past middle age when this treasure fell into their lap one must make allowances for a parental instinct that has been starving for twentyfive or thirty years it is famished it is crazed with hunger by that time and will be entirely satisfied with anything that comes handy its taste is atrophied it cant tell mud cat from shad a devil born to a young couple is measurably recognizable by them as a devil before long but a devil adopted by an old couple is an angel to them and remains so through thick and thin tom is this old mans angel he is infatuated with him tom can persuade him into things which other people cantnot all things i dont mean that but a good manyparticularly one class of things the things that create or abolish personal partialities or prejudices in the old mans mind the old man liked both of you tom conceived a hatred for you that was enough it turned the old man around at once the oldest and strongest friendship must go to the ground when one of these lateadopted darlings throws a brick at it  its a curious philosophy said luigi  it aint philosophy at allits a fact and there is something pathetic and beautiful about it too i think there is nothing more pathetic than to see one of these poor old childless couples taking a menagerie of yelping little worthless dogs to their hearts and then adding some cursing and squawking parrots and a jackassvoiced macaw and next a couple of hundred screeching songbirds and presently some fetid guinea pigs and rabbits and a howling colony of cats it is all a groping and ignorant effort to construct out of base metal and brass filings so to speak something to take the place of that golden treasure denied them by nature a child but this is a digression the unwritten law of this region requires you to kill judge driscoll on sight and he and the community will expect that attention at your handsthough of course your own death by his bullet will answer every purpose look out for him are you healedthat is fixed  yes he shall have his opportunity if he attacks me i will respond  as wilson was leaving he said  the judge is still a little used up by his campaign work and will not get out for a day or so but when he does get out you want to be on the alert  about eleven at night the twins went out for exercise and started on a long stroll in the veiled moonlight  tom driscoll had landed at hacketts store two miles below dawsons just about half an hour earlier the only passenger for that lonely spot and had walked up the shore road and entered judge driscolls house without having encountered anyone either on the road or under the roof  he pulled down his window blinds and lighted his candle he laid off his coat and hat and began his preparations he unlocked his trunk and got his suit of girls clothes out from under the male attire in it and laid it by then he blacked his face with burnt cork and put the cork in his pocket his plan was to slip down to his uncles private sitting room below pass into the bedroom steal the safe key from the old gentlemans clothes and then go back and rob the safe he took up his candle to start his courage and confidence were high up to this point but both began to waver a little now suppose he should make a noise by some accident and get caughtsay in the act of opening the safe perhaps it would be well to go armed he took the indian knife from its hiding place and felt a pleasant return of his wandering courage he slipped stealthily down the narrow stair his hair rising and his pulses halting at the slightest creak when he was halfway down he was disturbed to perceive that the landing below was touched by a faint glow of light what could that mean was his uncle still up no that was not likely he must have left his night taper there when he went to bed tom crept on down pausing at every step to listen he found the door standing open and glanced in what he saw pleased him beyond measure his uncle was asleep on the sofa on a small table at the head of the sofa a lamp was burning low and by it stood the old mans small cashbox closed near the box was a pile of bank notes and a piece of paper covered with figures in pencil the safe door was not open evidently the sleeper had wearied himself with work upon his finances and was taking a rest  tom set his candle on the stairs and began to make his way toward the pile of notes stooping low as he went when he was passing his uncle the old man stirred in his sleep and tom stopped instantlystopped and softly drew the knife from its sheath with his heart thumping and his eyes fastened upon his benefactors face after a moment or two he ventured forward againone stepreached for his prize and seized it dropping the knife sheath then he felt the old mans strong grip upon him and a wild cry of help help rang in his ear without hesitation he drove the knife homeand was free some of the notes escaped from his left hand and fell in the blood on the floor he dropped the knife and snatched them up and started to fly transferred them to his left hand and seized the knife again in his fright and confusion but remembered himself and flung it from him as being a dangerous witness to carry away with him  he jumped for the stairfoot and closed the door behind him and as he snatched his candle and fled upward the stillness of the night was broken by the sound of urgent footsteps approaching the house in another moment he was in his room and the twins were standing aghast over the body of the murdered man  tom put on his coat buttoned his hat under it threw on his suit of girls clothes dropped the veil blew out his light locked the room door by which he had just entered taking the key passed through his other door into the black hall locked that door and kept the key then worked his way along in the dark and descended the black stairs he was not expecting to meet anybody for all interest was centered in the other part of the house now his calculation proved correct by the time he was passing through the backyard mrs pratt her servants and a dozen halfdressed neighbors had joined the twins and the dead and accessions were still arriving at the front door  as tom quaking as with a palsy passed out at the gate three women came flying from the house on the opposite side of the lane they rushed by him and in at the gate asking him what the trouble was there but not waiting for an answer tom said to himself those old maids waited to dressthey did the same thing the night stevenss house burned down next door in a few minutes he was in the haunted house he lighted a candle and took off his girlclothes there was blood on him all down his left side and his right hand was red with the stains of the bloodsoaked notes which he has crushed in it but otherwise he was free from this sort of evidence he cleansed his hand on the straw and cleaned most of the smut from his face then he burned the male and female attire to ashes scattered the ashes and put on a disguise proper for a tramp he blew out his light went below and was soon loafing down the river road with the intent to borrow and use one of roxys devices he found a canoe and paddled down downstream setting the canoe adrift as dawn approached and making his way by land to the next village where he kept out of sight till a transient steamer came along and then took deck passage for st louis he was ill at ease until dawsons landing was behind him then he said to himself all the detectives on earth couldnt trace me now theres not a vestige of a clue left in the world that homicide will take its place with the permanent mysteries and people wont get done trying to guess out the secret of it for fifty years  in st louis next morning he read this brief telegram in the papersdated at dawsons landing        judge driscoll an old and respected citizen was assassinated       here about midnight by a profligate italian nobleman or a       barber on account of a quarrel growing out of the recent       election the assassin will probably be lynched  one of the twins soliloquized tom how lucky it is the knife that has done him this grace we never know when fortune is trying to favor us i actually cursed puddnhead wilson in my heart for putting it out of my power to sell that knife i take it back now  tom was now rich and independent he arranged with the planter and mailed to wilson the new bill of sale which sold roxana to herself then he telegraphed his aunt pratt        have seen the awful news in the papers and am almost       prostrated with grief shall start by packet today try to       bear up till i come  when wilson reached the house of mourning and had gathered such details as mrs pratt and the rest of the crowd could tell him he took command as mayor and gave orders that nothing should be touched but everything left as it was until justice robinson should arrive and take the proper measures as coroner he cleared everybody out of the room but the twins and himself the sheriff soon arrived and took the twins away to jail wilson told them to keep heart and promised to do his best in their defense when the case should come to trial justice robinson came presently and with him constable blake they examined the room thoroughly they found the knife and the sheath wilson noticed that there were fingerprints on the knifes handle that pleased him for the twins had required the earliest comers to make a scrutiny of their hands and clothes and neither these people nor wilson himself had found any bloodstains upon them could there be a possibility that the twins had spoken the truth when they had said they found the man dead when they ran into the house in answer to the cry for help he thought of that mysterious girl at once but this was not the sort of work for a girl to be engaged in no matter tom driscolls room must be examined  after the coroners jury had viewed the body and its surroundings wilson suggested a search upstairs and he went along the jury forced an entrance to toms room but found nothing of course  the coroners jury found that the homicide was committed by luigi and that angelo was accessory to it  the town was bitter against the misfortunates and for the first few days after the murder they were in constant danger of being lynched the grand jury presently indicted luigi for murder in the first degree and angelo as accessory before the fact the twins were transferred from the city jail to the county prison to await trial  wilson examined the finger marks on the knife handle and said to himself neither of the twins made those marks then manifestly there was another person concerned either in his own interest or as hired assassin  but who could it be that he must try to find out the safe was not opened the cashbox was closed and had three thousand dollars in it then robbery was not the motive and revenge was where had the murdered man an enemy except luigi there was but that one person in the world with a deep grudge against him  the mysterious girl the girl was a great trial to wilson if the motive had been robbery the girl might answer but there wasnt any girl that would want to take this old mans life for revenge he had no quarrels with girls he was a gentleman  wilson had perfect tracings of the finger marks of the knife handle and among his glass records he had a great array of fingerprints of women and girls collected during the last fifteen or eighteen years but he scanned them in vain they successfully withstood every test among them were no duplicates of the prints on the knife  the presence of the knife on the stage of the murder was a worrying circumstance for wilson a week previously he had as good as admitted to himself that he believed luigi had possessed such a knife and that he still possessed it notwithstanding his pretense that it had been stolen and now here was the knife and with it the twins half the town had said the twins were humbugging when they claimed they had lost their knife and now these people were joyful and said i told you so  if their fingerprints had been on the handlebut useless to bother any further about that the fingerprints on the handle were not theirsthat he knew perfectly  wilson refused to suspect tom for first tom couldnt murder anybodyhe hadnt character enough secondly if he could murder a person he wouldnt select his doting benefactor and nearest relative thirdly selfinterest was in the way for while the uncle lived tom was sure of a free support and a chance to get the destroyed will revived again but with the uncle gone that chance was gone too it was true the will had really been revived as was now discovered but tom could not have been aware of it or he would have spoken of it in his native talky unsecretive way finally tom was in st louis when the murder was done and got the news out of the morning journals as was shown by his telegram to his aunt these speculations were unemphasized sensations rather than articulated thoughts for wilson would have laughed at the idea of seriously connecting tom with the murder  wilson regarded the case of the twins as desperatein fact about hopeless for he argued that if a confederate was not found an enlightened missouri jury would hang them sure if a confederate was found that would not improve the matter but simply furnish one more person for the sheriff to hang nothing could save the twins but the discovery of a person who did the murder on his sole personal accountan undertaking which had all the aspect of the impossible still the person who made the fingerprints must be sought the twins might have no case with them but they certainly would have none without him  so wilson mooned around thinking thinking guessing guessing day and night and arriving nowhere whenever he ran across a girl or a woman he was not acquainted with he got her fingerprints on one pretext or another and they always cost him a sigh when he got home for they never tallied with the finger marks on the knife handle  as to the mysterious girl tom swore he knew no such girl and did not remember ever seeing a girl wearing a dress like the one described by wilson he admitted that he did not always lock his room and that sometimes the servants forgot to lock the house doors still in his opinion the girl must have made but few visits or she would have been discovered when wilson tried to connect her with the stealing raid and thought she might have been the old womans confederate if not the very thief disguised as an old woman tom seemed stuck and also much interested and said he would keep a sharp eye out for this person or persons although he was afraid that she or they would be too smart to venture again into a town where everybody would now be on the watch for a good while to come  everybody was pitying tom he looked so quiet and sorrowful and seemed to feel his great loss so deeply he was playing a part but it was not all a part the picture of his alleged uncle as he had last seen him was before him in the dark pretty frequently when he was away and called again in his dreams when he was asleep he wouldnt go into the room where the tragedy had happened this charmed the doting mrs pratt who realized now as she had never done before she said what a sensitive and delicate nature her darling had and how he adored his poor uncle     chapter 20  the murderer chuckles       even the clearest and most perfect circumstantial evidence      is likely to be at fault after all and therefore ought to      be received with great caution take the case of any pencil      sharpened by any woman if you have witnesses you will find      she did it with a knife but if you take simply the aspect      of the pencil you will say she did it with her teeth      puddnhead wilsons calendar   the weeks dragged along no friend visiting the jailed twins but their counsel and aunt patsy cooper and the day of trial came at lastthe heaviest day in wilsons life for with all his tireless diligence he had discovered no sign or trace of the missing confederate confederate was the term he had long ago privately accepted for that personnot as being unquestionably the right term but as being the least possibly the right one though he was never able to understand why the twins did not vanish and escape as the confederate had done instead of remaining by the murdered man and getting caught there  the courthouse was crowded of course and would remain so to the finish for not only in the town itself but in the country for miles around the trial was the one topic of conversation among the people mrs pratt in deep mourning and tom with a weed on his hat had seats near pembroke howard the public prosecutor and back of them sat a great array of friends of the family the twins had but one friend present to keep their counsel in countenance their poor old sorrowing landlady she sat near wilson and looked her friendliest in the nigger corner sat chambers also roxy with good clothes on and her bill of sale in her pocket it was her most precious possession and she never parted with it day or night tom had allowed her thirtyfive dollars a month ever since he came into his property and had said that he and she ought to be grateful to the twins for making them rich but had roused such a temper in her by this speech that he did not repeat the argument afterward she said the old judge had treated her child a thousand times better than he deserved and had never done her an unkindness in his life so she hated these outlandish devils for killing him and shouldnt ever sleep satisfied till she saw them hanged for it she was here to watch the trial now and was going to lift up just one hooraw over it if the county judge put her in jail a year for it she gave her turbaned head a toss and said when dat verdic comes is gwine to lif dat roof now i tell you  pembroke howard briefly sketched the states case he said he would show by a chain of circumstantial evidence without break or fault in it anywhere that the principal prisoner at the bar committed the murder that the motive was partly revenge and partly a desire to take his own life out of jeopardy and that his brother by his presence was a consenting accessory to the crime a crime which was the basest known to the calendar of human misdeedsassassination that it was conceived by the blackest of hearts and consummated by the cowardliest of hands a crime which had broken a loving sisters heart blighted the happiness of a young nephew who was as dear as a son brought inconsolable grief to many friends and sorrow and loss to the whole community the utmost penalty of the outraged law would be exacted and upon the accused now present at the bar that penalty would unquestionably be executed he would reserve further remark until his closing speech  he was strongly moved and so also was the whole house mrs pratt and several other women were weeping when he sat down and many an eye that was full of hate was riveted upon the unhappy prisoners  witness after witness was called by the state and questioned at length but the cross questioning was brief wilson knew they could furnish nothing valuable for his side people were sorry for puddnhead wilson his budding career would get hurt by this trial  several witnesses swore they heard judge driscoll say in his public speech that the twins would be able to find their lost knife again when they needed it to assassinate somebody with this was not news but now it was seen to have been sorrowfully prophetic and a profound sensation quivered through the hushed courtroom when those dismal words were repeated  the public prosecutor rose and said that it was within his knowledge through a conversation held with judge driscoll on the last day of his life that counsel for the defense had brought him a challenge from the person charged at the bar with murder that he had refused to fight with a confessed assassinthat is on the field of honor but had added significantly that he would be ready for him elsewhere presumably the person here charged with murder was warned that he must kill or be killed the first time he should meet judge driscoll if counsel for the defense chose to let the statement stand so he would not call him to the witness stand mr wilson said he would offer no denial murmurs in the house it is getting worse and worse for wilsons case  mrs pratt testified that she heard no outcry and did not know what woke her up unless it was the sound of rapid footsteps approaching the front door she jumped up and ran out in the hall just as she was and heard the footsteps flying up the front steps and then following behind her as she ran to the sitting room there she found the accused standing over her murdered brother here she broke down and sobbed sensation in the court resuming she said the persons entered behind her were mr rogers and mr buckstone  crossexamined by wilson she said the twins proclaimed their innocence declared that they had been taking a walk and had hurried to the house in response to a cry for help which was so loud and strong that they had heard it at a considerable distance that they begged her and the gentlemen just mentioned to examine their hands and clotheswhich was done and no blood stains found  confirmatory evidence followed from rogers and buckstone  the finding of the knife was verified the advertisement minutely describing it and offering a reward for it was put in evidence and its exact correspondence with that description proved then followed a few minor details and the case for the state was closed  wilson said that he had three witnesses the misses clarkson who would testify that they met a veiled young woman leaving judge driscolls premises by the back gate a few minutes after the cries for help were heard and that their evidence taken with certain circumstantial evidence which he would call the courts attention to would in his opinion convince the court that there was still one person concerned in this crime who had not yet been found and also that a stay of proceedings ought to be granted in justice to his clients until that person should be discovered as it was late he would ask leave to defer the examination of his three witnesses until the next morning  the crowd poured out of the place and went flocking away in excited groups and couples taking the events of the session over with vivacity and consuming interest and everybody seemed to have had a satisfactory and enjoyable day except the accused their counsel and their old lady friend there was no cheer among these and no substantial hope  in parting with the twins aunt patsy did attempt a goodnight with a gay pretense of hope and cheer in it but broke down without finishing  absolutely secure as tom considered himself to be the opening solemnities of the trial had nevertheless oppressed him with a vague uneasiness his being a nature sensitive to even the smallest alarms but from the moment that the poverty and weakness of wilsons case lay exposed to the court he was comfortable once more even jubilant he left the courtroom sarcastically sorry for wilson the clarksons met an unknown woman in the back lane he said to himself that is his case ill give him a century to find her ina couple of them if he likes a woman who doesnt exist any longer and the clothes that gave her her sex burnt up and the ashes thrown awayoh certainly hell find her easy enough this reflection set him to admiring for the hundredth time the shrewd ingenuities by which he had insured himself against detectionmore against even suspicion  nearly always in cases like this there is some little detail or other overlooked some wee little track or trace left behind and detection follows but here theres not even the faintest suggestion of a trace left no more than a bird leaves when it flies through the airyes through the night you may say the man that can track a bird through the air in the dark and find that bird is the man to track me out and find the judges assassinno other need apply and that is the job that has been laid out for poor puddnhead wilson of all people in the world lord it will be pathetically funny to see him grubbing and groping after that woman that dont exist and the right person sitting under his very nose all the time the more he thought the situation over the more the humor of it struck him finally he said ill never let him hear the last of that woman every time i catch him in company to his dying day ill ask him in the guileless affectionate way that used to gravel him so when i inquired how his unborn law business was coming along got on her track yethey puddnhead he wanted to laugh but that would not have answered there were people about and he was mourning for his uncle he made up his mind that it would be good entertainment to look in on wilson that night and watch him worry over his barren law case and goad him with an exasperating word or two of sympathy and commiseration now and then  wilson wanted no supper he had no appetite he got out all the fingerprints of girls and women in his collection of records and pored gloomily over them an hour or more trying to convince himself that that troublesome girls marks were there somewhere and had been overlooked but it was not so he drew back his chair clasped his hands over his head and gave himself up to dull and arid musings  tom driscoll dropped in an hour after dark and said with a pleasant laugh as he took a seat  hello weve gone back to the amusements of our days of neglect and obscurity for consolation have we and he took up one of the glass strips and held it against the light to inspect it come cheer up old man theres no use in losing your grip and going back to this childs play merely because this big sunspot is drifting across your shiny new disk itll pass and youll be all right againand he laid the glass down did you think you could win always  oh no said wilson with a sigh i didnt expect that but i cant believe luigi killed your uncle and i feel very sorry for him it makes me blue and you would feel as i do tom if you were not prejudiced against those young fellows  i dont know about that and toms countenance darkened for his memory reverted to his kicking i owe them no good will considering the brunet ones treatment of me that night prejudice or no prejudice puddnhead i dont like them and when they get their deserts youre not going to find me sitting on the mourners bench  he took up another strip of glass and exclaimed  why heres old roxys label are you going to ornament the royal palaces with nigger paw marks too by the date here i was seven months old when this was done and she was nursing me and her little nigger cub theres a line straight across her thumbprint how comes that and tom held out the piece of glass to wilson  that is common said the bored man wearily scar of a cut or a scratch usuallyand he took the strip of glass indifferently and raised it toward the lamp  all the blood sank suddenly out of his face his hand quaked and he gazed at the polished surface before him with the glassy stare of a corpse  great heavens whats the matter with you wilson are you going to faint  tom sprang for a glass of water and offered it but wilson shrank shuddering from him and said  no notake it away his breast was rising and falling and he moved his head about in a dull and wandering way like a person who had been stunned presently he said i shall feel better when i get to bed i have been overwrought today yes and overworked for many days  then ill leave you and let you get to your rest good night old man but as tom went out he couldnt deny himself a small parting gibe dont take it so hard a body cant win every time youll hang somebody yet  wilson muttered to himself it is no lie to say i am sorry i have to begin with you miserable dog though you are  he braced himself up with a glass of cold whisky and went to work again he did not compare the new finger marks unintentionally left by tom a few minutes before on roxys glass with the tracings of the marks left on the knife handle there being no need for that for his trained eye but busied himself with another matter muttering from time to time idiot that i wasnothing but a girl would do mea man in girls clothes never occurred to me first he hunted out the plate containing the fingerprints made by tom when he was twelve years old and laid it by itself then he brought forth the marks made by toms baby fingers when he was a suckling of seven months and placed these two plates with the one containing this subjects newly and unconsciously made record  now the series is complete he said with satisfaction and sat down to inspect these things and enjoy them  but his enjoyment was brief he stared a considerable time at the three strips and seemed stupefied with astonishment at last he put them down and said i cant make it out at allhang it the babys dont tally with the others  he walked the floor for half an hour puzzling over his enigma then he hunted out the other glass plates  he sat down and puzzled over these things a good while but kept muttering its no use i cant understand it they dont tally right and yet ill swear the names and dates are right and so of course they ought to tally i never labeled one of these thing carelessly in my life there is a most extraordinary mystery here  he was tired out now and his brains were beginning to clog he said he would sleep himself fresh and then see what he could do with this riddle he slept through a troubled and unrestful hour then unconsciousness began to shred away and presently he rose drowsily to a sitting posture now what was that dream he said trying to recall it what was that dream it seemed to unravel that puz  he landed in the middle of the floor at a bound without finishing the sentence and ran and turned up his light and seized his records he took a single swift glance at them and cried out  its so heavens what a revelation and for twentythree years no man has ever suspected it     chapter 21  doom       he is useless on top of the ground he ought to be under      it inspiring the cabbages puddnhead wilsons calendar       april 1 this is the day upon which we are reminded of what      we are on the other three hundred and sixtyfour      puddnhead wilsons calendar   wilson put on enough clothes for business purposes and went to work under a high pressure of steam he was awake all over all sense of weariness had been swept away by the invigorating refreshment of the great and hopeful discovery which he had made he made fine and accurate reproductions of a number of his records and then enlarged them on a scale of ten to one with his pantograph he did these pantograph enlargements on sheets of white cardboard and made each individual line of the bewildering maze of whorls or curves or loops which consisted of the pattern of a record stand out bold and black by reinforcing it with ink to the untrained eye the collection of delicate originals made by the human finger on the glass plates looked about alike but when enlarged ten times they resembled the markings of a block of wood that has been sawed across the grain and the dullest eye could detect at a glance and at a distance of many feet that no two of the patterns were alike when wilson had at last finished his tedious and difficult work he arranged his results according to a plan in which a progressive order and sequence was a principal feature then he added to the batch several pantograph enlargements which he had made from time to time in bygone years  the night was spent and the day well advanced now by the time he had snatched a trifle of breakfast it was nine oclock and the court was ready to begin its sitting he was in his place twelve minutes later with his records  tom driscoll caught a slight glimpse of the records and nudged his nearest friend and said with a wink puddnheads got a rare eye to businessthinks that as long as he cant win his case its at least a noble good chance to advertise his window palace decorations without any expense wilson was informed that his witnesses had been delayed but would arrive presently but he rose and said he should probably not have occasion to make use of their testimony an amused murmur ran through the room its a clean backdown he gives up without hitting a lick wilson continued i have other testimonyand better this compelled interest and evoked murmurs of surprise that had a detectable ingredient of disappointment in them if i seem to be springing this evidence upon the court i offer as my justification for this that i did not discover its existence until late last night and have been engaged in examining and classifying it ever since until half an hour ago i shall offer it presently but first i wish to say a few preliminary words  may it please the court the claim given the front place the claim most persistently urged the claim most strenuously and i may even say aggressively and defiantly insisted upon by the prosecution is thisthat the person whose hand left the bloodstained fingerprints upon the handle of the indian knife is the person who committed the murder wilson paused during several moments to give impressiveness to what he was about to say and then added tranquilly we grant that claim  it was an electrical surprise no one was prepared for such an admission a buzz of astonishment rose on all sides and people were heard to intimate that the overworked lawyer had lost his mind even the veteran judge accustomed as he was to legal ambushes and masked batteries in criminal procedure was not sure that his ears were not deceiving him and asked counsel what it was he had said howards impassive face betrayed no sign but his attitude and bearing lost something of their careless confidence for a moment wilson resumed  we not only grant that claim but we welcome it and strongly endorse it leaving that matter for the present we will now proceed to consider other points in the case which we propose to establish by evidence and shall include that one in the chain in its proper place  he had made up his mind to try a few hardy guesses in mapping out his theory of the origin and motive of the murderguesses designed to fill up gaps in itguesses which could help if they hit and would probably do no harm if they didnt  to my mind certain circumstances of the case before the court seem to suggest a motive for the homicide quite different from the one insisted on by the state it is my conviction that the motive was not revenge but robbery it has been urged that the presence of the accused brothers in that fatal room just after notification that one of them must take the life of judge driscoll or lose his own the moment the parties should meet clearly signifies that the natural instinct of selfpreservation moved my clients to go there secretly and save count luigi by destroying his adversary  then why did they stay there after the deed was done mrs pratt had time although she did not hear the cry for help but woke up some moments later to run to that roomand there she found these men standing and making no effort to escape if they were guilty they ought to have been running out of the house at the same time that she was running to that room if they had had such a strong instinct toward selfpreservation as to move them to kill that unarmed man what had become of it now when it should have been more alert than ever would any of us have remained there let us not slander our intelligence to that degree  much stress has been laid upon the fact that the accused offered a very large reward for the knife with which this murder was done that no thief came forward to claim that extraordinary reward that the latter fact was good circumstantial evidence that the claim that the knife had been stolen was a vanity and a fraud that these details taken in connection with the memorable and apparently prophetic speech of the deceased concerning that knife and the final discovery of that very knife in the fatal room where no living person was found present with the slaughtered man but the owner of the knife and his brother form an indestructible chain of evidence which fixed the crime upon those unfortunate strangers  but i shall presently ask to be sworn and shall testify that there was a large reward offered for the thief also and it was offered secretly and not advertised that this fact was indiscreetly mentionedor at least tacitly admittedin what was supposed to be safe circumstances but may not have been the thief may have been present himself tom driscoll had been looking at the speaker but dropped his eyes at this point in that case he would retain the knife in his possession not daring to offer it for sale or for pledge in a pawnshop there was a nodding of heads among the audience by way of admission that this was not a bad stroke i shall prove to the satisfaction of the jury that there was a person in judge driscolls room several minutes before the accused entered it this produced a strong sensation the last drowsy head in the courtroom roused up now and made preparation to listen if it shall seem necessary i will prove by the misses clarkson that they met a veiled personostensibly a womancoming out of the back gate a few minutes after the cry for help was heard this person was not a woman but a man dressed in womans clothes another sensation wilson had his eye on tom when he hazarded this guess to see what effect it would produce he was satisfied with the result and said to himself it was a successhes hit  the object of that person in that house was robbery not murder it is true that the safe was not open but there was an ordinary cashbox on the table with three thousand dollars in it it is easily supposable that the thief was concealed in the house that he knew of this box and of its owners habit of counting its contents and arranging his accounts at nightif he had that habit which i do not assert of coursethat he tried to take the box while its owner slept but made a noise and was seized and had to use the knife to save himself from capture and that he fled without his booty because he heard help coming  i have now done with my theory and will proceed to the evidences by which i propose to try to prove its soundness wilson took up several of his strips of glass when the audience recognized these familiar mementos of puddnheads old time childish puttering and folly the tense and funereal interest vanished out of their faces and the house burst into volleys of relieving and refreshing laughter and tom chirked up and joined in the fun himself but wilson was apparently not disturbed he arranged his records on the table before him and said  i beg the indulgence of the court while i make a few remarks in explanation of some evidence which i am about to introduce and which i shall presently ask to be allowed to verify under oath on the witness stand every human being carries with him from his cradle to his grave certain physical marks which do not change their character and by which he can always be identifiedand that without shade of doubt or question these marks are his signature his physiological autograph so to speak and this autograph can not be counterfeited nor can he disguise it or hide it away nor can it become illegible by the wear and mutations of time this signature is not his faceage can change that beyond recognition it is not his hair for that can fall out it is not his height for duplicates of that exist it is not his form for duplicates of that exist also whereas this signature is each mans very ownthere is no duplicate of it among the swarming populations of the globe the audience were interested once more  this autograph consists of the delicate lines or corrugations with which nature marks the insides of the hands and the soles of the feet if you will look at the balls of your fingersyou that have very sharp eyesightyou will observe that these dainty curving lines lie close together like those that indicate the borders of oceans in maps and that they form various clearly defined patterns such as arches circles long curves whorls etc and that these patterns differ on the different fingers every man in the room had his hand up to the light now and his head canted to one side and was minutely scrutinizing the balls of his fingers there were whispered ejaculations of why its soi never noticed that before the patterns on the right hand are not the same as those on the left ejaculations of why thats so too taken finger for finger your patterns differ from your neighbors comparisons were made all over the houseeven the judge and jury were absorbed in this curious work the patterns of a twins right hand are not the same as those on his left one twins patterns are never the same as his fellow twins patternsthe jury will find that the patterns upon the finger balls of the twins hands follow this rule an examination of the twins hands was begun at once you have often heard of twins who were so exactly alike that when dressed alike their own parents could not tell them apart yet there was never a twin born in to this world that did not carry from birth to death a sure identifier in this mysterious and marvelous natal autograph that once known to you his fellow twin could never personate him and deceive you  wilson stopped and stood silent inattention dies a quick and sure death when a speaker does that the stillness gives warning that something is coming all palms and finger balls went down now all slouching forms straightened all heads came up all eyes were fastened upon wilsons face he waited yet one two three moments to let his pause complete and perfect its spell upon the house then when through the profound hush he could hear the ticking of the clock on the wall he put out his hand and took the indian knife by the blade and held it aloft where all could see the sinister spots upon its ivory handle then he said in a level and passionless voice  upon this haft stands the assassins natal autograph written in the blood of that helpless and unoffending old man who loved you and whom you all loved there is but one man in the whole earth whose hand can duplicate that crimson signhe paused and raised his eyes to the pendulum swinging back and forthand please god we will produce that man in this room before the clock strikes noon  stunned distraught unconscious of its own movement the house half rose as if expecting to see the murderer appear at the door and a breeze of muttered ejaculations swept the place order in the courtsit down this from the sheriff he was obeyed and quiet reigned again wilson stole a glance at tom and said to himself he is flying signals of distress now even people who despise him are pitying him they think this is a hard ordeal for a young fellow who has lost his benefactor by so cruel a strokeand they are right he resumed his speech  for more than twenty years i have amused my compulsory leisure with collecting these curious physical signatures in this town at my house i have hundreds upon hundreds of them each and every one is labeled with name and date not labeled the next day or even the next hour but in the very minute that the impression was taken when i go upon the witness stand i will repeat under oath the things which i am now saying i have the fingerprints of the court the sheriff and every member of the jury there is hardly a person in this room white or black whose natal signature i cannot produce and not one of them can so disguise himself that i cannot pick him out from a multitude of his fellow creatures and unerringly identify him by his hands and if he and i should live to be a hundred i could still do it the interest of the audience was steadily deepening now  i have studied some of these signatures so much that i know them as well as the bank cashier knows the autograph of his oldest customer while i turn my back now i beg that several persons will be so good as to pass their fingers through their hair and then press them upon one of the panes of the window near the jury and that among them the accused may set their finger marks also i beg that these experimenters or others will set their fingers upon another pane and add again the marks of the accused but not placing them in the same order or relation to the other signatures as beforefor by one chance in a million a person might happen upon the right marks by pure guesswork once therefore i wish to be tested twice  he turned his back and the two panes were quickly covered with delicately lined oval spots but visible only to such persons as could get a dark background for themthe foliage of a tree outside for instance then upon call wilson went to the window made his examination and said  this is count luigis right hand this one three signatures below is his left here is count angelos right down here is his left now for the other pane here and here are count luigis here and here are his brothers he faced about am i right  a deafening explosion of applause was the answer the bench said  this certainly approaches the miraculous  wilson turned to the window again and remarked pointing with his finger  this is the signature of mr justice robinson applause this of constable blake applause this of john mason juryman applause this of the sheriff applause i cannot name the others but i have them all at home named and dated and could identify them all by my fingerprint records  he moved to his place through a storm of applausewhich the sheriff stopped and also made the people sit down for they were all standing and struggling to see of course court jury sheriff and everybody had been too absorbed in observing wilsons performance to attend to the audience earlier  now then said wilson i have here the natal autographs of the two childrenthrown up to ten times the natural size by the pantograph so that anyone who can see at all can tell the markings apart at a glance we will call the children a and b here are as finger marks taken at the age of five months here they are again taken at seven months tom started they are alike you see here are bs at five months and also at seven months they too exactly copy each other but the patterns are quite different from as you observe i shall refer to these again presently but we will turn them face down now  here thrown up ten sizes are the natal autographs of the two persons who are here before you accused of murdering judge driscoll i made these pantograph copies last night and will so swear when i go upon the witness stand i ask the jury to compare them with the finger marks of the accused upon the windowpanes and tell the court if they are the same  he passed a powerful magnifying glass to the foreman  one juryman after another took the cardboard and the glass and made the comparison then the foreman said to the judge  your honor we are all agreed that they are identical  wilson said to the foreman  please turn that cardboard face down and take this one and compare it searchingly by the magnifier with the fatal signature upon the knife handle and report your finding to the court  again the jury made minute examinations and again reported  we find them to be exactly identical your honor  wilson turned toward the counsel for the prosecution and there was a clearly recognizable note of warning in his voice when he said  may it please the court the state has claimed strenuously and persistently that the bloodstained fingerprints upon that knife handle were left there by the assassin of judge driscoll you have heard us grant that claim and welcome it he turned to the jury compare the fingerprints of the accused with the fingerprints left by the assassinand report  the comparison began as it proceeded all movement and all sound ceased and the deep silence of an absorbed and waiting suspense settled upon the house and when at last the words came they do not even resemble a thundercrash of applause followed and the house sprang to its feet but was quickly repressed by official force and brought to order again tom was altering his position every few minutes now but none of his changes brought repose nor any small trifle of comfort when the houses attention was become fixed once more wilson said gravely indicating the twins with a gesture  these men are innocenti have no further concern with them another outbreak of applause began but was promptly checked we will now proceed to find the guilty toms eyes were starting from their socketsyes it was a cruel day for the bereaved youth everybody thought we will return to the infant autographs of a and b i will ask the jury to take these large pantograph facsimilies of as marked five months and seven months do they tally  the foreman responded perfectly  now examine this pantograph taken at eight months and also marked a does it tally with the other two  the surprised response was  nothey differ widely  you are quite right now take these two pantographs of bs autograph marked five months and seven months do they tally with each other  yesperfectly  take this third pantograph marked b eight months does it tally with bs other two  by no means  do you know how to account for those strange discrepancies i will tell you for a purpose unknown to us but probably a selfish one somebody changed those children in the cradle  this produced a vast sensation naturally roxana was astonished at this admirable guess but not disturbed by it to guess the exchange was one thing to guess who did it quite another puddnhead wilson could do wonderful things no doubt but he couldnt do impossible ones safe she was perfectly safe she smiled privately  between the ages of seven months and eight months those children were changed in the cradlehe made one of this effectcollecting pauses and addedand the person who did it is in this house  roxys pulses stood still the house was thrilled as with an electric shock and the people half rose as if to seek a glimpse of the person who had made that exchange tom was growing limp the life seemed oozing out of him wilson resumed  a was put into bs cradle in the nursery b was transferred to the kitchen and became a negro and a slave sensationconfusion of angry ejaculationsbut within a quarter of an hour he will stand before you white and free burst of applause checked by the officers from seven months onward until now a has still been a usurper and in my finger record he bears bs name here is his pantograph at the age of twelve compare it with the assassins signature upon the knife handle do they tally  the foreman answered  to the minutest detail  wilson said solemnly  the murderer of your friend and mineyork driscoll of the generous hand and the kindly spiritsits in among you valet de chambre negro and slavefalsely called thomas a becket driscollmake upon the window the fingerprints that will hang you  tom turned his ashen face imploring toward the speaker made some impotent movements with his white lips then slid limp and lifeless to the floor  wilson broke the awed silence with the words  there is no need he has confessed  roxy flung herself upon her knees covered her face with her hands and out through her sobs the words struggled  de lord have mercy on me po misasble sinner dat i is  the clock struck twelve  the court rose the new prisoner handcuffed was removed    conclusion       it is often the case that the man who cant tell a lie      thinks he is the best judge of one puddnhead wilsons      calendar       october 12 the discovery it was wonderful to find      america but it would have been more wonderful to miss it      puddnhead wilsons calendar   the town sat up all night to discuss the amazing events of the day and swap guesses as to when toms trial would begin troop after troop of citizens came to serenade wilson and require a speech and shout themselves hoarse over every sentence that fell from his lipsfor all his sentences were golden now all were marvelous his long fight against hard luck and prejudice was ended he was a made man for good and as each of these roaring gangs of enthusiasts marched away some remorseful member of it was quite sure to raise his voice and say  and this is the man the likes of us have called a puddnhead for more than twenty years he has resigned from that position friends  yes but it isnt vacantwere elected  the twins were heroes of romance now and with rehabilitated reputations but they were weary of western adventure and straightway retired to europe  roxys heart was broken the young fellow upon whom she had inflicted twentythree years of slavery continued the false heirs pension of thirtyfive dollars a month to her but her hurts were too deep for money to heal the spirit in her eye was quenched her martial bearing departed with it and the voice of her laughter ceased in the land in her church and its affairs she found her only solace  the real heir suddenly found himself rich and free but in a most embarrassing situation he could neither read nor write and his speech was the basest dialect of the negro quarter his gait his attitudes his gestures his bearing his laughall were vulgar and uncouth his manners were the manners of a slave money and fine clothes could not mend these defects or cover them up they only made them more glaring and the more pathetic the poor fellow could not endure the terrors of the white mans parlor and felt at home and at peace nowhere but in the kitchen the family pew was a misery to him yet he could nevermore enter into the solacing refuge of the nigger gallerythat was closed to him for good and all but we cannot follow his curious fate furtherthat would be a long story  the false heir made a full confession and was sentenced to imprisonment for life but now a complication came up the percy driscoll estate was in such a crippled shape when its owner died that it could pay only sixty percent of its great indebtedness and was settled at that rate but the creditors came forward now and complained that inasmuch as through an error for which they were in no way to blame the false heir was not inventoried at the time with the rest of the property great wrong and loss had thereby been inflicted upon them they rightly claimed that tom was lawfully their property and had been so for eight years that they had already lost sufficiently in being deprived of his services during that long period and ought not to be required to add anything to that loss that if he had been delivered up to them in the first place they would have sold him and he could not have murdered judge driscoll therefore it was not that he had really committed the murder the guilt lay with the erroneous inventory everybody saw that there was reason in this everybody granted that if tom were white and free it would be unquestionably right to punish himit would be no loss to anybody but to shut up a valuable slave for lifethat was quite another matter  as soon as the governor understood the case he pardoned tom at once and the creditors sold him down the river      authors note to those extraordinary twins  a man who is not born with the novelwriting gift has a troublesome time of it when he tries to build a novel i know this from experience he has no clear idea of his story in fact he has no story he merely has some people in his mind and an incident or two also a locality and he trusts he can plunge those people into those incidents with interesting results so he goes to work to write a novel nothat is a thought which comes later in the beginning he is only proposing to tell a little tale a very little tale a sixpage tale but as it is a tale which he is not acquainted with and can only find out what it is by listening as it goes along telling itself it is more than apt to go on and on and on till it spreads itself into a book i know about this because it has happened to me so many times  and i have noticed another thing that as the short tale grows into the long tale the original intention or motif is apt to get abolished and find itself superseded by a quite different one it was so in the case of a magazine sketch which i once started to writea funny and fantastic sketch about a prince and a pauper it presently assumed a grave cast of its own accord and in that new shape spread itself out into a book much the same thing happened with puddnhead wilson i had a sufficiently hard time with that tale because it changed itself from a farce to a tragedy while i was going along with ita most embarrassing circumstance but what was a great deal worse was that it was not one story but two stories tangled together and they obstructed and interrupted each other at every turn and created no end of confusion and annoyance i could not offer the book for publication for i was afraid it would unseat the readers reason i did not know what was the matter with it for i had not noticed as yet that it was two stories in one it took me months to make that discovery i carried the manuscript back and forth across the atlantic two or three times and read it and studied over it on shipboard and at last i saw where the difficulty lay i had no further trouble i pulled one of the stories out by the roots and left the othera kind of literary caesarean operation  would the reader care to know something about the story which i pulled out he has been told many a time how the bornandtrained novelist works wont he let me round and complete his knowledge by telling him how the jackleg does it  originally the story was called those extraordinary twins i meant to make it very short i had seen a picture of a youthful italian freakor freakswhich wasor which wereon exhibition in our citiesa combination consisting of two heads and four arms joined to a single body and a single pair of legsand i thought i would write an extravagantly fantastic little story with this freak of nature for heroor heroesa silly young miss for heroine and two old ladies and two boys for the minor parts i lavishly elaborated these people and their doings of course but the tale kept spreading along and spreading along and other people got to intruding themselves and taking up more and more room with their talk and their affairs among them came a stranger named puddnhead wilson and a woman named roxana and presently the doings of these two pushed up into prominence a young fellow named tom driscoll whose proper place was away in the obscure background before the book was half finished those three were taking things almost entirely into their own hands and working the whole tale as a private venture of their owna tale which they had nothing at all to do with by rights  when the book was finished and i came to look around to see what had become of the team i had originally started out withaunt patsy cooper aunt betsy hale and two boys and rowena the lightweight heroinethey were nowhere to be seen they had disappeared from the story some time or other i hunted about and found themfound them stranded idle forgotten and permanently useless it was very awkward it was awkward all around but more particularly in the case of rowena because there was a love match on between her and one of the twins that constituted the freak and i had worked it up to a blistering heat and thrown in a quite dramatic love quarrel wherein rowena scathingly denounced her betrothed for getting drunk and scoffed at his explanation of how it had happened and wouldnt listen to it and had driven him from her in the usual forever way and now here she sat crying and brokenhearted for she had found that he had spoken only the truth that it was not he but the other of the freak that had drunk the liquor that made him drunk that her half was a prohibitionist and had never drunk a drop in his life and altogether tight as a brick three days in the week was wholly innocent of blame and indeed when sober was constantly doing all he could to reform his brother the other half who never got any satisfaction out of drinking anyway because liquor never affected him yes here she was stranded with that deep injustice of hers torturing her poor torn heart  i didnt know what to do with her i was as sorry for her as anybody could be but the campaign was over the book was finished she was sidetracked and there was no possible way of crowding her in anywhere i could not leave her there of course it would not do after spreading her out so and making such a todo over her affairs it would be absolutely necessary to account to the reader for her i thought and thought and studied and studied but i arrived at nothing i finally saw plainly that there was really no way but onei must simply give her the grand bounce it grieved me to do it for after associating with her so much i had come to kind of like her after a fashion notwithstanding she was such an ass and said such stupid irritating things and was so nauseatingly sentimental still it had to be done so at the top of chapter xvii i put a calendar remark concerning july the fourth and began the chapter with this statistic  rowena went out in the backyard after supper to see the fireworks and fell down the well and got drowned  it seemed abrupt but i thought maybe the reader wouldnt notice it because i changed the subject right away to something else anyway it loosened up rowena from where she was stuck and got her out of the way and that was the main thing it seemed a prompt good way of weeding out people that had got stalled and a plenty good enough way for those others so i hunted up the two boys and said they went out back one night to stone the cat and fell down the well and got drowned next i searched around and found old aunt patsy and aunt betsy hale where they were around and said they went out back one night to visit the sick and fell down the well and got drowned i was going to drown some others but i gave up the idea partly because i believed that if i kept that up it would arouse attention and perhaps sympathy with those people and partly because it was not a large well and would not hold any more anyway  still the story was unsatisfactory here was a set of new characters who were become inordinately prominent and who persisted in remaining so to the end and back yonder was an older set who made a large noise and a great todo for a little while and then suddenly played out utterly and fell down the well there was a radical defect somewhere and i must search it out and cure it  the defect turned out to be the one already spoken oftwo stories in one a farce and a tragedy so i pulled out the farce and left the tragedy this left the original team in but only as mere names not as characters their prominence was wholly gone they were not even worth drowning so i removed that detail also i took the twins apart and made two separate men of them they had no occasion to have foreign names now but it was too much trouble to remove them all through so i left them christened as they were and made no explanation
