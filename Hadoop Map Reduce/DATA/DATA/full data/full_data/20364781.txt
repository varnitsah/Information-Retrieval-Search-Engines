little affair has been concluded so amicably  ladies and gentlemen if you please nothing has happened  i havent interrupted anything have iany little celebration or anything of that sort  eve was one of the first to congratulate me     an amiable charlatan    chapter ithe man at stephanos  the thing happened so suddenly that i really had very little time to make up my mind what course to adopt under somewhat singular circumstances i was seated at my favorite table against the wall on the righthand side in stephanos restaurant with a newspaper propped up before me a glass of hock by my side and a portion of the plat du jour which happened to be chicken en casserole on the plate in front of me  i was in fact halfway through dinner when without a word of warning a man who seemed to enter with a lightfooted speed that considering his size was almost incredible drew a chair toward him and took the vacant place at my table my glass of wine and my plate were moved with smooth and marvelous haste to his vicinity under cover of the tablecloth a packeti could not tell what it containedwas thrust into my hand  sir he said raising my glass of wine to his lips i am forced to take somewhat of a liberty you can render me the service of a lifetime kindly accept the situation  i stared at him for a moment quite blankly then i recognized him and transferring at once the packet to my trousers pocket i drew another glass toward me and poured out the remainder of my halfbottle of hock so much at any rate i felt i had saved  i shall offer you presently my selfinvited guest continued with his mouth full of my chicken the fullest explanation i shall also ask you to do me the honor of dining with me i think i am right in saying that we are not altogether strangers  i know you very well by sight i told him i have seen you here several times before with a young lady  exactly he agreed my daughter sir  then for the sake of your daughter i said with an enthusiasm that was not in the least assumed i can assure you that whether as host or guest you are very welcome to sit at my table as for this packet  keep it for a few moments my young friend the newcomer interrupted just while i recover my breath that is all have confidence in me things may happen here very shortly sit tight and you will never regret it my name so far as you are concerned is joseph h parker tell me you are facing the door some one has just entered who is it  a stranger i replied a stranger to this place i am sure he is tall and dark he is a little lanternjaweda hatchetshaped face i should call it  my man right enough mr joseph h parker muttered dont seem to notice him particularly he added but tell me what he is doing  he seems to have entered in a hurry i announced and is now taking off his overcoat he is wearing i perceive a bowler hat a dinner jacket the wrongshaped collar and he appears to have forgotten to change his boots  thats cullen all right mr joseph h parker groaned youre a person of observation sir well ive been in tighter corners than thisthanks to you  who is mr cullen and what does he want i asked  mr cullen my guest declared sampling the fresh bottle of wine which had just been brought to him is one of those misguided individuals whose lack of faith in his fellows will bring him some time or other to a bad end my young friend sip that wine thoughtfullydont hurry over itand tell me whether my choice is not better than yours  possibly i remarked with a glance at the yellow seal your pocket is longer by the by your friend is coming toward us  it is not a question of pocket mr parker continued disregarding my remark it is a question of taste and judgment discrimination is perhaps the word i should use now in my younger dayseh whats that  the person named cullen had paused at my table his hand was resting gently upon the shoulder of my selfinvited guest mr parker looked up and appeared to recognize him with much surprise  you my dear fellow he exclaimed say im delighted to see youi am sure but would you mindjust a little lower with your fingers too professional a touch altogether  mr cullen smiled and from that moment i took a dislike to hima dislike that did much toward determining the point of view from which i was inclined to consider various succeeding incidents he was by no means a person of prepossessing appearance his cheeks were colorless save for a sort of yellowish tinge his mouth reminded me of the mouth of a horse his teeth were irregular and poor  yet there was about the man a certain sense of power his eyes were clear and bright his manner was imbued with the reserve strength of a man who knows his own mind and does not fear to speak it  i am sorry to interrupt you at your dinner mr parker he said his eyes traveling all over the table as though taking in its appointments and condition  of no consequence at all mr parker assured him in fact i have nearly finished if you are thinking of dining here let me recommend this chicken en casserole i have tasted nothing so good for days  mr cullen thanked him mechanically his mind however was obviously filled with other things he was puzzled  you must have a double about this evening i fancy he remarked i could have sworn i saw you coming out of a certain little house in adam street not a couple of minutes ago you know the little house i mean  mr parker smiled  seems as though that double were all right he said i am halfway through my dinner as you can see and im a slow eaterespecially in pleasant company shake hands with my friendmr paul walmsley mr cullen  my surprise at hearing my own name correctly given was only equaled by the admiration i also felt for my companions complete and absolute assurance mr cullen and i exchanged a perfunctory handshake which left me without any change in my feelings toward him  another of my mistakes i suppose mr cullen said quietly i am afraid on this occasion however that i must trouble you mr parker an affair of a few moments only i wont even suggest bow streetat present if you could take a stroll with meeven into luigis office would do  mr parker put down his knife and fork with a little gesture of irritation his broad goodnatured face was for the moment clouded say cullen he remonstrated dont you think youre carrying this a bit too far you know there isnt a man i enjoy a halfhours chat with more than you but in the middle of dinnerdinner with a friend too  i try to do my duty mr cullen interrupted and i am afraid that i am not at liberty to study your comfort  mr parker sighed heavily  do you mind walmsley having my plate kept warm and reminding the man that i ordered asparagus to follow my new friend remarked as he rose to his feet mr cullen wants a word or two with me in private and mr cullen is a man who will have his own way  i nodded as indifferently as possible and the two men walked off together toward the entrance then i summoned my waiter  bring me i ordered a fresh portion of chicken and order some asparagus to follow keep my friends chicken warm and order him some asparagus also  leaning back in my chair i tried to puzzle out the probable meaning of this somewhat extraordinary happening my acquiescence in the attitude that had been so suddenly forced upon me was owing entirely to one circumstance mr joseph h parker i had recognized at his first entrance as a regular habitu√© of the restaurant he was usually accompanied by a young lady who from the first moment i had seen her had produced an effect upon my not too susceptible disposition for which i was wholly unable to account but which was the sole reason why i had given up my club and all other restaurants and occupied that particular place for the last fortnight  i had put the two down as an american and his daughter traveling in england for pleasure and my continual presence at the restaurant was wholly inspired by the hope that some opportunity might arise by means of which i could make their acquaintance adventures in the ordinary sense of the word had never appealed to me i was privileged to possess many charming acquaintances among the other sex but not one of them had ever inspired me with anything save the most ordinary feelings of friendship and admiration  the opportunity i desired had now apparently come i had made the acquaintance of mr joseph h parkermade it in an unceremonious manner perhaps but still under circumstances that would probably result in his being willing to acknowledge himself my debtor i had a packet of something belonging to him in my pocket which was presumably valuable his friend mr cullen i detested and the reference to bow street puzzled me however i had no doubt that in a few minutes everything would be explained meantime i permitted myself to indulge in certain very pleasurable anticipations  in the course of about a quarter of an hour mr joseph h parker reappeared he came down the room humming a tune and apparently quite pleased with himself i took the opportunity of studying his personal appearance a little more closely he was not tall but he was distinctly fat he had a large double chin but a certain freshness of complexion and massiveness about his forehead relieved his face from any suspicion of grossness he had a large and humorous mouth delightful eyes and plentiful eyebrows his irongray hair was brushed carefully back from his forehead he gave one the idea of strength notwithstanding the disabilities of his figure he smiled contentedly as he seated himself once more at my table  really he began i scarcely know how to excuse myself mr walmsley however thanks to you we can now dine in comfort until now i fear i have taken your good offices very much for granted but i assure you it will give me the greatest pleasure to make your closer acquaintance and to impress upon you my extreme sense of obligation  you are very kind i replied by the by might i ask how you know my name  my young friend mr parker said eying with approval the fresh portion of chicken that had been brought him it is my business to know many things i go about the world with my eyes and ears open things that escape other people interest me your name is mr paul walmsley you are one of a class of men that practically doesnt exist in america you have no particular occupation that i know of save that you have a small estate in the country which no doubt takes up some of your time you have rooms in london which you occupy occasionally you probably write a littlei have noticed that you are fond of watching people  you really seem to know a good deal about me i confessed a little taken aback  i am not far from the mark am i  you are not i admitted  as regards your lack of occupation mr parker went on i am not the man to blame you for it there are very few things in life a man can settle down to nowadays to a person of imagination the ordinary routine of the professions and the ordinary curriculum of business life is a species of slavery we live in overcivilized times there seems to be very little room anywhere for a man to gratify his natural instincts for change and adventure  i murmured my acquiescence with his sentiments and my companion paused for a few minutes his whole attention devoted to his dinner  might one inquire i asked after a brief pause as to your own profession you are an american are you not  i am most certainly an american mr parker assented  in business i asked  mr parker looked round our table was comparatively isolated  i am an adventurer he replied mysteriously  i stared at him and repeated the word he beamed pleasantly upon me  an adventurer my daughter whom you have seen here with me is an adventuress we live by our wits and we do pretty well at it sometimes we live in luxury sometimes we are up against it good and hard the ritz one day you know and bloomsbury the next but lots of fun all the time  i looked at him a little blankly  to a certain extent i suppose you are joking i asked  to no extent at all he assured me by the by as regards that packet would you mind just slipping it under this newspaper  i withdrew it from my pocket and obeyed him at once mr parkers fingers seemed to play with it for a moment and i noticed at that moment what a strong and capable hand he seemed to have with fingers of unusual length and suppleness  a dark faced ma√Ætre dh√¥tel who presided over our portion of the room came up smiling with an inquiry as to our coffee he exchanged a casual sentence or two with mr parker bowed and passed on mr parker a moment later with a little smile lifted the newspaper the packet had disappeared he noticed my look of surprise and seemed gratified  a mere trifle that he declared i can assure you that i could have taken it out of your pocket if i had desired without your feeling a thing  wonderful i murmured feeling distinctly uncomfortable  just a gift he continued modestly we all have our talents you know i have ordered some special coffee  i was beginning to think rapidly now  by the by i asked what is mr cullens profession  he is a detective mr parker answered without hesitation and to my mind a singularly bad one for two months he has had what they call his eye on me between ourselves i think he will have his eye on me still in another two months time i am sure i hope so for i frankly admit that half the savor of life would be gone if my friend mr cullen were to finally give me up as a bad job and leave me alone  i suppose that something of what i was feeling was reflected in my face i had always considered myself a man of the world and i was interested enough in my fellows to enjoy mixing with all classes  but there was the girl  you are thinking my companion began softly  your friend i interrupted has just entered the restaurant he is coming toward this table  mr parkers expression never changed not a muscle twitched his tone was even careless  just as well perhaps he remarked that we worked that little conjuring trick  the detective stood once more at our table my instinctive dislike of him was now an accomplished thing i hated his smile of subdued triumph and all my fundamental ideas as to law and order were seriously affected by it i was distinctly on the side of my new acquaintance  i am sorry to interrupt this little feast mr cullen said but i shall have to trouble you both to come with me for a short time  mr parker carefully clipped the end of his cigar and leaned back in his chair while he lit it  my friend cullen he remonstrated i have no objection to offering myself up as a victim to your superabundant energy and trotting about with you wherever you choose but when it comes to dragging my friends into it i just want to say right here that i think you are carrying things a little too farjust a little too far sir  if either of you seriously object to my request mr cullen replied doggedly i can put the matter on a different basis  who is this friend of yours and why should we go anywhere with him i asked  mr parker shook his head mournfully  you may well ask he sighed you may not think it to look at his ingenuous and honest expression but the fact nevertheless remains that mr cullen is a misguided but zealous member of the sherlock holmes fraternity in short a detective  i rose to my feet with some alacrity  anything in the shape of an adventure i began  not much adventure about this mr parker interrupted gloomily brushing the ashes from his waistcoat and also rising we are probably going to be searched for spoons however if it must be  for the first time in my life i walked side by side with a detective he led us to the far end of the restaurant into an apartment usually used by the manager as a winetasting office and carefully closed the door behind us outside i caught the glimmer of a policemans helmet  every precaution taken you perceive mr parker remarked in case we should turn out to be desperate characters and appalled by the fear of discovery should be driven to make a personal attack upon mr cullen a myrmidon of the law is lurking near under those circumstances i shall eschew violence i shall submit myself peaceably to a second examination  i found the affair on the whole interesting i divested myself only of my coat and waistcoat and mr cullens fingers did the rest only a single and momentary frown betrayed his disappointment as ten minutes later he unlocked the door  gentlemen he said i owe you my most profound apologies  thats all right cullen mr parker observed patting him on the shoulder but lets have this thing straight now are we to be allowed to finish our dinner in peace or will you be turning up again with a new idea and if i take a box for the tivoli presently shall we have the pleasure of seeing you bob in upon us  so far as my present intentions are concerned mr cullen remarked grimly you may rely upon remaining undisturbed i am sorry mr walmsley he added turning to me to have been the cause of any annoyance to you this evening my advice to you is if you wish to escape these inconveniences through life to avoid the society of people whose character is known to the police  i shall get you for libel yet cullen mr parker declared pulling down his waistcoat  what ive done to annoy that man i cant imagine he went on impersonally mind he practises on meim convinced of it  mr cullen left us abruptly and quitted the restaurant i returned to our table with my new friend  really he said i scarcely know how to apologize to you mr walmsley this sort of thing amuses me as a rule but i must admit that mr cullen is apt to get on ones nerves a wellmeaning man mind but unduly persistent  i resumed my seat at the table i was feeling a little dazed opposite talking to two ladies was the smoothfaced ma√Ætre dh√¥tel into whose keeping i felt sure that packet had gone seated by my side was the gentleman who had assured me with the utmost selfpossession that he was an adventurer and standing in the doorway looking at us was the girl who for the last few weeks had monopolized all my thoughts who had played havoc to such a complete extent with the principles of my life that for her sake i was at that moment perfectly willing to range myself even among the outcasts of the world     chapter iithe coup in the gambling den  on seeing us the girl advanced into the room i called mr parkers attention to her and he rose at once to his feet it was a cold evening in april and she was wearing a long coat trimmed with some darkcolored fur and a hat also trimmed with fur but with something blue in it she was rather tall she had masses of dark brown hair a suspicion of a fringe and deep blue eyes she came toward us very deliberately with the same grace of movement i had watched and admired night after night she gave me a glance of the slightest possible curiosity as she approached then her father introduced us  this is mr paul walmsley my dear he saidmy daughter have you dined eve  she shook hands with me and smiled very charmingly  hours ago she replied i didnt mean to come out this evening but i was so bored that i thought i would try and find you  she accepted the chair i was holding and unbuttoned her cloak  you will have some coffee i begged  why that would be delightful she agreed i am so glad to find you with my father mr walmsley she continued i know he hates dining alone but this evening i had an appointment with a dressmaker quite late and i didnt feel a bit like dinner anyhow  you come here often dont you i ventured  very often indeed she replied you see it is not in the least entertaining where we are staying and the cooking is abominable then father adores restaurants do tell me what you have been talking about you two menall the evening  the truth mr parker remarked lighting another cigar my daughter knows that i speak nothing else it is a weakness of mine mr walmsley and i were exchanging notes as to our relative professions i told him frankly that i was an adventurer and you an adventuress i think by now he is beginning to believe it  she laughed very softlyalmost under her breath yet i fancied there was a note of mockery in her mirth  confess that you were very much shocked mr walmsley she said  not in the least i assured her  she raised her eyebrows ever so slightly  confess then she went on confess mr walmsley that in all your wellordered life you have never heard such an admission made by two apparently respectable people before  how do you know i asked that my life has been wellordered  look at yourself in the glass she begged  scarcely knowing what i did i turned round in my seat and obeyed her there is perhaps a certain preciseness about my appearance as well as my attire i am tall enoughwell over six feetbut my complexion still retains traces of my years in africa and of my fondness for outdoor sports my hair is straight and i have never grown beard or mustache i felt somehow that i represented the things which in an englishman are a little derided by young ladies on the other side of the water  i cant help my appearance i said a little crossly i can assure you that i am not a prig  our young friend mr parker intervened has certainly earned his immunity from any such title to tell you the truth eve he has already been my accomplice this evening in a certain little matter but for his help who knows that i might not have found myself up against it between us we have even had a little fun out of cullen  her expression changed she seemed for some reason none too well pleased  what have you been doing she asked me  i personally have been doing very little indeed i told her your father entered the restaurant in a hurry about an hour ago and found it convenient to seat himself at my table and help himself to my dinner he intrusted me also with a packet which i subsequently returned to him  it is now mr parker declared replying to his daughters anxious glance in perfectly safe hands  she sighed and shook her head at him  daddy she murmured plaintively why will you run such risks even mr cullen isnt an absolute idiot you know and there might have been some one else watching  mr parker nodded  you are quite right my dear he admitted to tell you the truth cullen was really a little smarter than usual this evening however theres always the luck you knowour luck if mr walmsley had turned out a different sort of manbut then i knew he wouldnt  she turned her head and looked at me she had a trick of contracting the corners of her eyes just a little which was absolutely bewitching  will you tell me why you helped my father in this way mr walmsley  i returned her regard steadfastly  it never occurred to me i said to do anything elseafter i had recognized him  she smiled a little my speech was obviously sincere i think from that moment she began to realize why i had occupied the little table opposite to the one where she so often sat with such unfailing regularity  what about a music hall mr parker suggested i hear theres a good show on right across the street here have you any engagement for this evening mr walmsley  none at all i hastened to assure him  we left the place together a few minutes later and found a vacant box at the tivoli arrived there however mr parker soon became restless he kept on seeing friends in the auditorium we watched him with his hat a little on the back of his head going about shaking hands in various directions  how long have you been in england i asked my companion  barely two months she replied do look at father wherever he goes its the same the one recreation of his life is making friends the people he is speaking to tonight he has probably come across in a railroad train or an american bar he makes lifelong friendships every time he drinks a cocktail and he never forgets a face  isnt that a little trying for you i asked  she laughed outright  if you could only see some of the people he brings up and introduces to me  we talked for some time upon quite ordinary subjects as the time passed on however and her father did not return it seemed to me she became more silent she told me very little about herself and the few personal things she said were always restrained i was beginning to feel almost discouraged she sat so long with a slight frown upon her forehead and her head turned away from me  miss parker i ventured at last something seems to have displeased you  it has she admitted  will you please tell me what it is i asked humbly if i have said or done anything clumsy give me a chance at any rate to let you see how sorry i am  she turned and faced me then  it is not your fault she assured me only i am a little annoyed with my father  why  i think she went on it is perfectly delightful that he should have made your acquaintance it isnt that at all but i do not think he should have made use of you in the way he did he is utterly reckless sometimes and forgets what he is doing it is all very well for himself but he has no right to expose you toto  to what risk did he expose me i demanded tell me miss parkerwas he absolutely honest when he told me he was an adventurer  absolutely  was i then an accomplice in anything illegal tonight  worse than illegalcriminal she told me  now my father had been a judge and i had a brother who was a barrister but the madness was upon me and i spoke quickly and convincingly  then all i have to say about it is that i am glad i declared  why she murmured looking at me wonderingly  because he is your father and i have helped him i answered under my breath  for a few moments she was silent she looked at me however and as i watched her eyes grow softer i suddenly held out my hand and for a moment she suffered hers to rest in it then she drew away a little  she was still looking at me steadfastly but something that had seemed to me inimical had gone from her expression  mr walmsley she said slowly i want to tell you i think you are making a mistake please listen to me carefully you do not belong to the order of people from whom the adventurers of the world are drawn what you are is written in your face i am perfectly certain you possess the ordinary conventional ideas as to right and wrongthe ideas in which you have been brought up and which have been instilled into you all your life my father and i belong to a different class of society there is nothing to be gained for you by mixing with us and a great deal to be lost  may i not judge for myself i asked  i fear she answered looking me full in the face and smiling at me delightfully you are just a little prejudiced  supposing i whispered i have discovered something that seems to me better worth living for than anything else i have yet found in the world i know ofif that something belongs to a world in which i have not yet liveddo you blame me if for the sake of it i would be willing to climb down even into  she held out her finger warningly i heard heavy footsteps outside and the rattle of the doorhandle  you are very foolish she murmured please let my father in  mr parker returned in high good humor he had met a host of acquaintances and declared that he had not had a dull moment as for the performance he seemed to have forgotten there was one going on at all  i am for supper he suggested i owe our friend here a supper in return for his interrupted dinner  supper by all means i agreed  remember that i am wearing a hat eve said we must go to one of the smaller places  in the end we went back to stephanos we sat at the table at which i had so often watched eve and her father sitting alone and by her side i listened to the music i had so often heard while i had watched her from what had seemed to me to be an impossible distance  mr parker talked wonderfully he spoke of gigantic financial deals in wall street of operations which had altered the policy of nations of great robberies in new york the details of which he discussed with amazing technical knowledge  he played tricks with the knives and forks balanced the glasses in extraordinary fashion and reduced our waiters to a state of numbed and amazed incapacity every person who entered he seemed to have some slight acquaintance with all the time he was acknowledging and returning greetings and all the time he talked  we spoke finally of gambling and he laughed heartily when i made mild fun of the gambling scare that was just then being written up in all the papers and magazines  so you dont believe in baccarat tables in london he said very good we shall see after we have supped we shall see  we stayed until long past closing time mr parker continued in the highest good humor but eve was subject at times to moods of either indifference or depression the more intimate note which had once or twice crept into our conversation she seemed now inclined to deprecate she avoided meeting my eyes more than once she glanced toward the clock  havent you an appointment tonight father she asked almost in an undertone  sure mr parker answered readily i have an appointment and i am going to take you and mr walmsley along  i am delighted to hear it i exclaimed quickly  ill teach you to make fun of the newspapers mr parker went on no gambling hells in london eh well we shall see  to my great relief eve made no spoken objection to my inclusion in the party when at last we left a large and handsome motor car was drawn up outside waiting for us  a taxicab mr parker explained is of no use to meof no more use than a hansom cab i have to keep a car in order to slip about quietly now in what part of london shall we look for a gambling hell mr walmsley i know of eleven name your own streetsomewhere in the west end  i named one at random  the very place mr parker declared the very place where i have already an appointment get in say you londoners have no idea what goes on in your own city  we drove to a quiet street not very far from the ritz hotel mr parker led us across the pavement and we entered a block of flats the entrance hall was dimly lit and there seemed to be no one about mr parker however rang for a lift which came promptly down  you two will stay here he directed for two or three minutes then the lift will come down for you  he ascended and left us there i turned at once to eve who had scarcely spoken a word during the drive from the restaurant  i do wish you would tell me what is troubling you miss parker i begged if i am really in the way of course you have only to say the word and ill be off at once  she held my arm for a moment the touch of her fingers gave me unreasonable pleasure  please dont think me rude or unkind she pleaded dont even think that i dont like your coming along with usbecause i do it isnt that only as i told my father before supper you dont belong you ought not to be seen at these places and with us for some absurd reason father seems to have taken a fancy to you it isnt a very good thing for you it very likely wont be a good thing for us  do please change your opinion of me a little i implored her i cant help my appearance but let me assure you i am willing to play the bohemian to any extent so long as i can be with you there isnt a thing in your life i wouldnt be content to share i ventured to add  she sighed a little petulantly she was halfconvinced but against her will  you are very obstinate she declared but of course youre rather nice  after that i was ready for anything that might happen the lift had descended and the porter bade us enter we stopped at the third floor in the open doorway of one of the flats mr parker was standing solid and imposing he beckoned us with a broad smile to follow him  to my surprise there were no locked doors or burly doorkeepers we hung up our things in the hall and passed into a long room in which were some fifteen or twenty people most of them were sitting round a chemin de fer table a few were standing at the sideboard eating sandwiches a darkhaired darkeyed sallowfaced man a trifle corpulent undeniably semitic who seemed to be in charge of the place came up and shook hands with mr parker  glad to see you sirand your daughter he said glancing keenly at them both and then at me this gentleman is a friend of yours  certainly mr parker replied i wont introduce you but ill answer for him  you would like to play  i will play certainly mr parker answered cheerfully my friend will watchfor the present at any rate  he waved us away himself taking a seat at the table i led eve to a divan at the farther corner of the room we sat there and watched the people there were many whose faces i knewa sprinkling of stockbrokers one or two actresses and half a dozen or so men about town of a dubious type on the whole the company was scarcely reputable i looked at eve and sighed  well what is it she asked  this is no sort of place for you you know i ventured  here it comes she laughed the real hidebound respectable englishman i tell you i like it i like the life i like the light and shade of it all i should hate your stiff english country houses your highly moral amusements and your dull daybyday life look at those peoples faces as they bend over the table  well i am looking at them i told her i see nothing but greed i see no face that has not already lost a great part of its attractiveness  perhaps she replied indifferently i will grant you that greed is the keynote of this place yet even that has its interesting side where else do you see it so developed where else could you see the same emotion actuating a number of very different people in an altogether different manner  for an adventuress i remarked you seem to notice things  no one in the world except those who live by adventures ever has any inducement to notice things she retorted that is why amateurs are such failures one never does anything so well as when one does it for ones living  the question is arguable i submitted  she shrugged her shoulders  every question is arguable if it is worth while she agreed carelessly look at all those people coming in  i dont understand it i confessed these places are against the law yet there seems to be no concealment at all why arent we raided  raids in this part of london only take place by arrangement she assured me this place will reach its due date sometime but every one will know all about it beforehand they are making a clear profit here of about four hundred pounds a night and it has been running for two months now when the raid comes mr rubensteini think that is his namecan pay his five hundredpound fine and move on somewhere else its wickedthe money they make here some nights  you seem to know a good deal about it i remarked  the place interests father she told me he comes here often  and you  sometimes i am not always in the humor  i looked at her long and thoughtfully her beauty was entirely the beauty of a young girl there were no signs of late hours or anxiety in her face she puzzled me more than ever  i wish i knew i said exactly what you mean when you call yourself an adventuress  she laughed  it means this she explained tonight i have money in my purse jewels on my fingers a motor car to ride home in in a weeks time if things went badly with us i might have nothing then father or i or both of us would go out into the world to replenish and from whomever had most of what we desired we should take as opportunity presented itself  irrespective of the law  absolutely  irrespective of your sense of right and wrong  my sense of right and wrong according to your standards does not exist  i gave it up she seemed thoroughly in earnest and yet every word she spoke seemed contrary to my instinctive judgment of her she pointed to the table  look she whispered these people dont seem as though they had all that money to gamble with do they look there must be at least a thousand or fifteen hundred pounds upon the table  it was just as she said these words that the thing happened from somewhere among the little crowd of people gathered round the table there came the sound of heavy stamping on the floor and in less than a moment every light in the room went out the place was in somber darkness then breaking the momentary silence there came from outside a shrill whistle again there was a silenceand then pandemonium in a dozen different keys one heard the same shout  the police  eve gripped my arm my matchbox was out in a moment and i struck a match holding it high over my head as it burned a queer little halo of light seemed thrown over the table the door was wide open and blocked with people rushing out the banker was still sitting in his place at first i seemed to have the idea that mr parker was by his side then to my astonishment i saw him at the opposite end of the table standing as though he had appeared from nowhere a stentorian voice was heard from outside  ladies and gentlemen if you please nothing has happened the lights will be on again immediately  almost as he spoke the place was flooded with light  the faces of the people were ghastly a babel of voices arose  where are the police  where are they  who said the police  the little dark gentleman whose name was rubenstein stood upon a chair  ladies and gentlemen he called out nothing whatever has happened nothing the electric lights went out owing to an accident which i will investigate it seems to have been a practical joke on the part of the lift man who has disappeared there are no police here please take your places the game will proceed  they came back a little reluctantly as though still afraid then suddenly the bankers hoarse voice rang out through the room all the time he had been sitting like an automaton now he was on his feet swaying backward and forward his eyes almost starting from his head  lock the doors the bank has been robbed the notes have gone mr rubenstein dont let any one go out i tell you there was two thousand pounds upon the table some one has the notes  there was a little murmur of voices and a shriek from one of the women as she clutched her handbag mr parker bland and benign rose to his feet  my own stake has disappeared he declared and the pile of notes i distinctly saw in front of the banker has gone i fear mr rubenstein there is a thief among us  mr rubenstein white as a sheet was standing at the door he locked it and put the key in his pocket  ladies and gentlemen he said play is over for tonight we are without a doubt the victims of an attempted robbery the lights were turned out from the controlling switch by the lift man who has disappeared i will ask you to leave the room one by one and for all our sakes i beg that any unknown to us will submit themselves to be searched  there was a little angry murmur mr rubenstein looked pleadingly round  ladies and gentlemen he begged you will not object i am sure i am a poor man two thousand pounds of my money has gone from that tableall the money i kept in reserve to make a bank for you if any one will return it now nothing shall be said but to lose it alli tell you it would ruin me  the perspiration stood out on his forehead he looked anxiously round as though seeking for sympathy mr parker came over to his side  say mr rubenstein he declared there isnt any one here who wants you to lose a fivepound notethats a sure thing but there is just one difficulty about this searching business how can you identify your notes if i for instance were to insist that i had brought with me two thousand pounds in banknotes in my pocketwhich let me hasten to assure you i didnthow could you deny it  my notes mr rubenstein replied feverishly all bear the stamp of lloyds bank and todays date they can all be recognized  in that case mr parker continued i recommend you mr rubenstein to insist upon searching every person here not thoroughly known to you and i recommend you ladies and gentlemen he added looking round to submit to be searched it will not be a very strenuous affair because no one can have had time to conceal the notes very effectively i think you will all agree with me that we cannot allow our friend who has provided us with amusement for so many nights to run the risk of a loss like this begin with me mr rubenstein noi insist upon it you know me better than most of your clients i think but i submit myself voluntarily to be searched  i thank you very much indeed sir mr rubenstein declared quickly it is very good of you to set the example he continued thrusting his hand into mr parkers pockets ah i see nothing herenothing notes in this pocketten twenty thirty not mine i seeno lloyds stamp gold a pleasant little handful of gold that mr parker i thank you sir if you will be so good as to pass into the next room  i brought eve up we were recognized as having been sitting upon the divan and mr rubenstein with a bow and extended hand motioned to us to pass on  you will visit us again i trust he said when we are not so disturbed  most certainly mr parker promised in our names most certainly mr rubenstein we will all come again good night  we walked out to the landing and descending the stairs reached the street and stepped into the motor car that was waiting for us it rolled off and turned into piccadilly  how much was it father eve asked suddenly from her place in the corner  i am not sure mr parker answered there is a matter of eight hundred pounds in my right shoe and a little more than that i think in my left the note down my back was i believe a hundredpound one quite a pleasant little evening and fairly remunerative the lift man will cost me a hundredbut he was worth it  i sat quite still i felt that eves eyes were watching me i set my teeth for a moment and i turned toward her my cigarette case in my hand  you dont mind i murmured as i lit a cigarette  she shook her head her eyes were still fixed upon me  where can we drop you mr parker inquired  if the evening is really over and there are no more excitements to come you might put me down at the milan court i told him if that is anywhere on your way  mr parker lifted the speaking tube to his lips and gave an order we glided up to the milan a few minutes later  i have enjoyed my evening immensely i assured eve impressively every moment of it and i do hope mr parker i added as i shook hands that you and your daughter will give me the great pleasure of dining with me any night this week if there are any other little adventures about here in which i could take a hand i can assure you i should be delighted i might even be of some assistance  they both of them looked at me steadfastly then eve at last glanced away with a little shrug of the shoulders and mr joseph h parker gripped my hand  say youre all right he pronounced you just ring up 3771a gerrard tomorrow morning between ten and eleven     chapter iiicullen gives advice  at ten oclock the following morning my telephone bell rang and a visitor was announced i did not catch the name given me and it was only when i opened the door to him in response to his ring that i recognized mr cullen in morning clothes which consisted in his case of a blue serge suit that needed brushing and a bowler hat of extinct shape he seemed to me if possible a little more objectionable than i had found him the previous night he presented himself however in a wholly nonaggressive spirit  mr walmsley he said as he took the chair to which i motioned him i have called to see you very largely in your own interests  i murmured something to the effect that i was extremely obliged  i have made inquiries concerning you he went on and i find that you not only have a blameless record but that you are possessed of considerable means and that you belong to a highly esteemed county family  and what of it mr cullen i asked  this he answered that i feel it my duty to warn you against the companions with whom you spent a portion of last evening  you mean mr and miss parker  i mean mr and miss parker  are you making any definite charges against this young lady and gentleman i inquired after a moments pause  very definite charges indeed he replied i warn you mr walmsley that this man and his daughter are in bad repute with us and to be seen associated with them is to bring yourself under police surveillance we had a special warning when they sailed from new york and since their arrival in london they have already been concerned in two or three very shady transactions  if they break the law i inquired why do you not arrest them  because i have had bad luckrotten bad luck mr cullen declared firmly i am perfectly convinced that this mr parker as he calls himself has been financing one of the greatest artists in banknote counterfeits ever known to the police i am perfectly convinced that mr parker left this young man in adam street last night with a packet of notes upon his person for which he had just paid two hundred pounds and if i could have arrested him then the game would have been up he dodged me by going into the cecil leaving by the back way and coming through the savoy but i picked him up again within two minutes of his reaching stephanos  obviously with your collusionyoull pardon me sir but there the facts arehe was seated at your table as though in the middle of a dinner i had him searched but there wasnt a thing on him i am not going to ask you what he did with the notes he hadwhether he palmed them off on you or notbut i will simply say that between the time of his entering stephanos and the time of my searching him he got rid of a thousand pounds worth of counterfeit notes  sounds very clever of him i remarked how do you know that he didnt get rid of them to some one in either the cecil or the savoy  because mr cullen explained he was followed by one of my men through both places and not lost sight of for a single second you see i made sure he would come to stephanos and i was on the other side of the strand but i had left a man in case he went the other way i tell you he was under the strictest surveillance the whole time except during the few minutesi might almost say secondswhen he disappeared in the restaurant  anything else against him i asked  i am not inclined mr cullen continued slowly to mention specifically the various cases that have come under my notice and in which i believe him to be concerned but among other things he is a frequenter of half the gambling houses in london and a tout for their owners trouble follows wherever he goes but mr walmsley mark my words i am not a man given to idle speech and i assure you that within a few weeksperhaps within a few daysi shall have him aye and the young lady too you dont want to be mixed up in this sort of business sir i am here to give you the advice to sheer off theyll only rob you and bring you too under suspicion  i lit a cigarette and stood on the hearthrug with my hands behind me  mr cullen i said it is of course very kind of you to come to me in this disinterested manner you dont seem to have anything to gain by it so i will accept your attitude as being a bona fide one i will if i may be equally frank with you i met both mr parker and his daughter last night for the first time  then that dinner was a plant mr cullen interrupted swiftly i knew it  i ignored the interruption  for the first time i repeated and i find them both most delightful companions as to how far our acquaintance may progress that is entirely a matter for chance to decide you have doubtless come here with very good motives but i see no reason why i should accept your statements concerning mr parker and his daughter you understand my suggestion is that you are mistaken until i have proved them to be other than they represent themselves to be i added with infinite subtlety i shall continue to derive pleasure from their society  mr cullen rose at once to his feet  my warning has been given sir he said it only remains for me now to wish you good morning and to assure you most regretfully that your name will be added to those whom scotland yard thinks it well to watch and that your movements from place to place will be noted  i trust that scotland yard will benefit i replied politely and showed him out  at half past ten i rang up 3771a gerrard the telephone was answered almost immediately by a man apparently a servant i inquired for mr parker and in a moment or two i heard his voice at the telephone  this is joseph h parker speaking who are you  i am paul walmsley you told me i might ring up between ten and eleven  sure was the prompt reply my dear fellow i am delighted to hear from you none the worse for our little adventure last night i hope  not in the least i assured him on the contrary i am looking forward to another  you shall have one was the delighted answer  what aboutwhat is it eve excuse me for one moment mr walmsley  mr parker was apparently dragged away from the telephone i waited impatiently he returned in a moment or two his voice sounded as though he were a little irritated  sorry he said i was going to make a little suggestion to you for this evening but my daughter here doesnt fall in with it they will have their own waythese girls  its very disappointing i said dont you think you could prevail on her  look here mr parker continued ill tell you what lets meet accidentally at dinner tonight ill talk eve round before then you drop into stephanos for dinner at about seventhirty then when you see us there you can come over and join us  thank you very much i replied heartily by the by i suppose you couldnt tell me your address i should like to send miss parker some flowers  mr parker obviously hesitated  better not he decided regretfullynot this morning at any rate eve is a bit peculiar and if you come into our little scheme and it goes wrong the less you know of us the better see you later  i did see mr parker later but not quite so late as the time appointed he was in the american bar at the milan when i looked in there just before luncheon and was talking to two of the most ferocious and objectionable looking ruffians i had ever seen in my life he glanced at me blandly but without any sign of recognition save that i fancied i caught the slightest twitch of his left eyebrow i took the hint and did not join him my reward came presently for after leaving the room with his two acquaintances mr parker strolled back again and coming straight over to me clapped me on the shoulder  this is capital he exclaimed we meet tonight  without a doubt i assured him  he drew me a little on one side  say he inquired scratching the side of his chin have you any objection to a bit of a scrap  not the slightest i replied so long as miss parker is out of it  good boy mr parker pronounced yes well keep her out of it all right i shall count on you then just keep yourself in reserve well talk it over at dinner time you just stroll in casually and ill call you over by the by he added lowering his voice did you see those two fellows i was with  i saw them i confessed they were just a trifle noticeable  mr parker came a little nearer to me he accentuated his words by beating on the palm of his left hand with two fingers of his right  absolutely my dear walmsley two of the most unmitigated and desperate ruffians on either continent  they looked it i agreed heartily  their record mr parker continuedtheir police record i meanis one of the most wonderful things ever put on paper the marvelous thing is how even for a few minutes they should be out of prison did you notice the one with the cast in his eye  i did i admitted  they used to call him angel jake mr parker proceeded confidentially he was sentenced to death once for shooting a policeman but there was some technicalityhe was tried in the wrong courtso he got off  a very interesting acquaintance i remarked with utterly wasted sarcasm  theyre fairly up to their necks in trouble both of them on the other side mr parker declared with relish and theyre kind o looking for it here  i took him by the arm and led him out of the bar into a retired corner of the smoking room we sat upon a divan and had the room almost to ourselves  how is miss parker this morning i asked  fine her father replied i told her about the flowers and it made her quite homesick girls miss that sort of thing you know and over here living under a sort of cloud as it were one cant risk making many friends  it was a very good opening for me and i took advantage of it  why do you choose to live under a cloud mr parker i asked  my dear fellow he replied earnestly i dont altogether choose i have been frank with you its my life  if it were only a question of money i began tentatively  a question of money mr parker interrupted isnt everything a question of money say what do you mean exactly  i mean that i admire your daughter siri admire her immensely i told him if shed have me id marry her tomorrow i am not what you would call a wealthy man but i have enough money for all reasonable purposes  mr parker was clearly staggered he stroked his waistcoat for a moment in an absent sort of way  this takes my breath away he exclaimed let us understand exactly what it means  it means i told him bluntly that ill make a settlement upon your daughter and give you enough to live on  he looked first at me and then at the carpet he began to whistle softly  and they always told me he murmured under his breath that you britishers were so cautious why you know nothing about us at all except what ive told you and goodness knows that isnt much of a recommendation besides i may not have told you half  i am willing to take my risk i declared i simply dont care once in a lifetime a man has that feeling for a woman if he is wise he goes nap on it i have never had it before and i am not going to let go i feel that if i do i may regret it all my life i dont want any other woman in this world except your daughter and what i possess in life worth having i am willing to give to make sure of her  mr parker sat for several moments in profound silence i could not make out what his mood was he seemed neither unduly depressed nor elated he was obviously puzzled howeverpuzzled to know precisely what to do or what to say he sat in the middle of the divan with one thumb in his waistcoat pocket and the other hand flat upon the table his round face was innocent of smile or frown yet i knew he was taking what i had said seriously though for some reason or other it did not seem to give him unqualified pleasure  well well he said at last youve spoken up like a man anywayand like a man who knows what he wants i cant tell how to answer you i have never lived on any one yet spongings never been in my line i have enjoyed living on my wits and eveshes a little that way too makes me kind of sorry ive let her go about with me so much its a wonderful cloak of respectability youd throw over us but im wondering whether its large enough  as my wife i began  oh yes youd gather her in all right to start with he interrupted but there are other things he added turning a little toward me and looking me in the face suppose she didnt turn out just as you thought shes a wild highspirited sort of creatureis eve she loves the music and the rattle of life i cant fancy her in one of those outoftheway godforsaken little mudholes you call an english village sitting in an earlyvictorian drawingroom all the afternoon waiting for the vicars wife to come to tea and taking a walk before dinner for entertainment with an umbrella and mackintosh  youve been reading jane austen i told him  never heard of her he replied promptly i oncebut never mind just keep this to yourself for a bit my boy if we come to any arrangement there are one or two things weve got on that we might have to drop well think this over so long until this evening  he bustled away then evidently anxious to escape any further conversation i went about my business which consisted of a visit to my lawyers and a couple of rubbers of bridge at my club before dinner  at half past seven precisely i strolled into stephanos i had scarcely taken my table before mr parker and eve entered contrary to his usual custom mr parker was wearing a dress coat white waistcoat and white tie and eve looked exquisite in a lownecked gown of white silk mr parker according to his promise at once beckoned me over  my dear boy he said i insist upon it that you sit down and dine with us last night i dined with you to be literal i ate off your plate tonight i return the compliment  i had no idea of refusing but i was watching eve with some anxiety her attitude seemed a little negative however she welcomed me pleasantly  well she asked is your conscience beginning to prick yet  my conscience i replied is about as imaginary a thing as my early victorian drawingroom i can assure you i have the most profound admiration for your father i think he is one of the cleverest men i ever met  she seemed a little taken aback my tone i felt quite sure was convincing  of course she remarked it is possible i have formed a wrong idea of englishmen i have met only one or two  i should say it is highly probable i agreed what scheme of villainy is before us tonight i claim a share in it at any rate  she shook her head  not tonight i am afraid  mr parker with the menu in front of him was busy with the waiter and a ma√Ætre dh√¥tel i dropped my voice a little  why not are you going to the theater  to the opera  you love music i asked  she leaned a little toward me her hair almost brushed my cheek as she whispered  we love jewelry  i flatter myself that not a muscle of my face moved  no place like the opera i remarked you should do well there with a little luck  this time i certainly scored she looked at me fixedly for a moment then she laughed softly  i want a pearl necklace she said  what about the one you have on  she held it out toward me  imitations unfortunately she sighed they may look very nice but they dont feel like the real thing  why cant i go to the opera with you i suggested  because there are no vacant seats anywhere near ours she replied you see we happen to know whom we are going to sit near  anyhow i think i shall go i decided i may be able to come and talk to you between the acts at any rate  mr parker having finished giving his orders joined in the conversation and we dined together quite cheerily for educated americans they seemed very ignorant of english life and i was not surprised to hear that it was their first visit to europe they listened with interest to a great deal that i told them it was only as we were preparing to leave the place that i asked mr parker a definite question  tell me i whispered have you really any plans for tonight  he nodded sure we are in luck just now theres nothing like backing it  are those fellows i saw you with this morning at the milan in it if so i am going to take miss parker away there are limits  he patted me on the back  that little affair is off for tonight at any rate a lady we are very anxious to meet is going to the opera the little girl wants a pearl necklace well we shall see  youve thought over what i said have you mentioned it to her  only kind of hinted at it its no good putting it too straight to her shes got the bit between her teeth and shell need to be humored  eve had gone to fetch her cloak and we were alone outside the door i looked at him steadfastlyhe was so very pink and white so very cheerful so utterly optimistic  youve never seen the inside of an english prison have you mr parker i asked  he stared at me blankly  i am not thinking about you or myself i went on shes so dainty and sweet she looks like a child who has never known an hour of rough usage in her life they wouldnt leave her much of that you know  i had certainly succeeded in making an impression this time mr parkers smooth forehead was wrinkled his face was clouded  you are right mr walmsley he admitted i wishi wish she would listen to reason well have a talk togetherthe three of ussoon youve no idea how difficult it is she doesnt know fearcant realize danger hush here she comes it will only set her against you if she thinks you are trying to influence me behind her back  mr parkers car was waiting and we drove together to covent garden i left them in the vestibule and went to call on some of my friends my sister had a box in the second tier and i was fortunate enough to find her there and alone with her husband almost directly underneath us in the stalls mr parker and eve were sitting and next mr parker was a woman wearing a pearl necklace i asked my sister her name she raised her lorgnette and looked over the side of the box  lady orstline she told me her husband is a south african millionaire  are those real pearls she is wearing i inquired  my dear paul she laughed why not her husband is enormously wealthy and they say that her jewels are wonderful unlike so many of those people she really does select very fine stones independent of size those pearls she is wearing now for instance are quite small but their luster is exquisite what an extraordinary fat man is sitting next her and what a pretty girl  americans i remarked  they look it she agreed quite the gibson type of girl isnt she  the curtain went up and we turned our attention to the stage as a rule i find music soothing but that night proved an exceptionperhaps because my moderately wellordered life had crumbled into pieces because i was conscious of a new and overmastering passionthe music appealed to me in an altogether different way my enjoyment was no longer impersonala matter of the brain and the judgment i felt the excitement of it throbbing in my pulses the gloomy halflit auditorium seemed full of strange suggestions i felt in real and actual touch with the great things that throbbed beneath i was no longer an auditora lookeron i had become a participator  the hours passed as though in a dream i talked to my sister and her husband and exchanged the usual gossip with their callers i even paid a call or two on my own account but i have no recollection of whom i went to see or what we talked about i had no chance to visit either mr parker or eve for neither of them left their places and they were in the middle of a row but i took good care that we were close together in the vestibule toward the end with a little shiver i saw that lady orstline was there toonext mr parker i was a few feet behind them both with my sister i found myself watching almost feverishly  as usual there was a block outside and the few yards between us and the door seemed interminable i had none of the optimism of those others i was filled with vague fears of some impending disaster suddenly with a shiver i recognized cullen scarcely a couple of yards away also watching wedged in among the throng his lips were drawn closely together his opera hat was well over his forehead his eyes never left mr parker he looked to me there like a leanfaced rat preparing for its spring  i followed the exact direction of his steadfast gaze and i became cold with apprehension lady orstline was just in front of me by her side was eve and immediately behind her mr parker i tried to lean over but in the crush it was impossible  some one you want to speak to paul my sister asked  theres a man thereif i can only get at him  the little crowd in front of us was suddenly thrown into disorder by having to let through two people whose carriage had been called we seemed to lose ground in the confusion for a moment or two later i noticed lady orstline standing outside the door and my heart sank as i realized that her neck was bare almost at the same instant i saw her hand fly up and heard her voice  my necklace she called out policeman dont let any one pass out my necklace has been stolenmy pearls  the confusion that followed was indescribable the doors were almost barricaded my sister and her husband and i were allowed through easily enough as we were known to be subscribers but almost every one else seemed to be undergoing a sort of crossexamination my brotherinlaw was disposed to be irritable  why cant the silly woman look after her jewels he exclaimed another advertisement i suppose  can we drop you anywhere paul my sister inquired or would you like to give us some supper  i had been staring out of the window there was not a sign anywhere of eve or her father nor had i been able to catch a glimpse of mr cullen  i am sorry i replied but i am supping with some friends at stephanos could you set me down there  my sister raised her eyebrows as she gave the order we were already in the strand  really paul she remonstrated at your time of lifeyou are thirty four years old mindi think you might leave stephanos to the other generation  second childhood i explained as i descended in any case i really have an appointment here give you supper any other night with pleasure many thanks  my first intention had been not to enter the place at all but to return at once to covent garden some impulse however prompted me to glance round the room first to my amazement eve and her father were already seated at their usual tableeve drawing off her gloves and her father with the wine list in his hand i made my way toward them i suppose my expression indicated a certain stupefaction for directly i got there eve began to laugh softly up into my face  we arent ghosts she declared did you think you were the only person who could leave the opera house in a hurry  i saw you in the vestibule i ventured i never saw you get away  no more did our friend cullen mr parker remarked smiling i really am beginning to feel sorry for that man we were within a yard or two of him and he was watching us good and hard i think he had an idea that eve had a weakness for pearls  oh dont i exclaimed rather sharply even in joke it isnt exactly wise is it with people passing all the time  joke mr parker repeated precious little joke about it i can assure you i dare say it looked simple enough to you but it was really quite a complicated business never mind eve has her pearlsand thats the great thing  then he thrust his hand into his trousers pocket and without the least attempt at concealment produced and plumped upon the table in front of him the pearl necklace which only a few minutes before i had seen upon the neck of lady orstline  look much better on eve when theyve been restrung wont they he observed gee whiz what lovely stones they are  put it away i gasped for heavens sake put it away  why should i he asked coolly  my heart suddenly seemed to stop beating i felt as though the end of the world had come with the light of triumph ablaze in his narrow black eyes mr cullen was standing by our table  good evening mr parker he said in a tone from which he struggled to keep the note of triumph good evening young lady  the hand of mr parker had suddenly covered the pearl necklace mr cullen was looking steadily toward it  i trust he continued that my arrival was not inopportune i havent interrupted anything have iany little celebration or anything of that sort  on the contrary we are always pleased to see you mr parker declared warmly sit right down mr cullen youll join us i trust we were just thinking of ordering a little supper  mr cullen shook his head perhaps he advised it would be better to postpone that order  postpone it mr parker repeated glancing at the clock why its late enough now good heavens is that the time  mr cullen and i both glanced at the clock at the other end of the room it was twenty minutes to twelve the detective looked back with a smile  you are a past master mr parker he said in the accomplishment that i believe in your country goes by the name of bluff but there are limits you know i shall have to ask you and your daughter and mr walmsley here to accompany me at once to bow street and he added suddenly leaning across the table move your right hand please dont make a disturbancefor luigis sake if you want trouble you can have it  mr parker raised his hand at once  trouble he echoed thats the last thing im looking for  mr cullen smiled grimly  ah i thank you he said a pearl necklace i see you must allow me to take charge of this please  mr parkers look of surprise was admirably done  that is my daughters necklace he explained the fastening has become loose  exactly mr cullen sneered i am now going to ask you all three to come with me without any further delay to bow street  this man is mad mr parker sighed leaning back in his placestark staring mad his interference with my meals is becoming unwarrantable  if you take my advice you will avoid a scene the detective said leaning a little over the table believe me i am not to be trifled with if you do not come willingly there are other means i am simply trying to avoid a disturbance in a public restaurant  mr parker rose reluctantly to his feet  eve dear he said i suppose we may as well obey this very autocratic person the sooner we go the sooner we shall be back to supper mr walmsley i owe you my most profound apologies i had no idea when i asked you to join us that you would become involved in anything disagreeable  dont mind me i begged him i am glad to come perhaps we had better get it over as soon as possible  we shall be back mr parker explained to luigi who had strolled up to see what was happening in twenty minutes prepare if you please three oyster cocktails some grilled cutlets and saut√© potatoes thank you luigi in twenty minutes mind  we passed out toward the entrance mr cullen was walking with almost professional proximity to his companion eve and i were a few steps in the rear  eve i whispered drawing her for a moment close to me remember that whatever comes of thiswhatever happensthere is no word i have ever said to you or to your father about you which i do not mean and shall not always mean  she looked at me a little curiously from the first her own demeanor had been singularly unmoved during the last few seconds however she had grown paler she suddenly took my hand and gave it a little squeeze  you really are a little more than nice she said  we drove to the police station and mr cullen ushered us at once into a private room where an inspector was seated at a table  mr hennessey sir he began i have a charge of theft against this man and his daughter i watched them at the opera house tonight at the entrance they were both of them hustling lady orstline as you may have heard she cried out suddenly that her pearl necklace had been stolen i rushed for these two but by some means or other they got away i followed them to stephanos restaurant and discovered them with the necklace on the table in front of them the man parker was showing it to the other two he attempted to conceal it but i was just in time  the inspector nodded  very good mr cullen he said where is the necklace  the detective produced it proudly and laid it upon the table before him the inspector dipped his pen in the ink  what is your name he asked mr parker  joseph h parker was the reply i am an american citizen and this is my daughter mr cullen appears to be a person of observation it is true we were at the opera it is perfectly true we were within a few yards of lady orstline when she called out that her necklace was stolen theres nothing remarkable about that however as we occupied adjacent stalls what i want to point out to you is though if youll allow me that the necklace i had on the table before me at stephanos when mr cullen suddenly popped round the screenthe necklace you are now looking at siris of imitation pearls valued at about ten pounds i bought it in the burlington arcade it belongs to my daughter and i was simply examining the clasp which is scarcely safe  there was a moments breathless silence to me mr parkers statement seemed too good to be true yet he had spoken with the easy confidence of a man who knows what he is about standing there the personification of respectability a trifle indignant a trifle contemptuous his words could not fail to carry with them a certain amount of conviction the inspector rang a bell by his side  what are your daughters initials he asked quickly  epeve parker mr parker replied look at the back of the gold clasp there you are he pointed outep  mr cullen and the inspector both bent over the necklace the inspector gave a brief order to a policeman  the initials on the clasp are certainly ep the inspector admitted slowly i do not pretend to be a judge of jewelry myself however i have sent for some one who is  a man in plain clothes entered the room the inspector beckoned to him showed him the necklace and whispered a question the man examined the pearls for barely five seconds then he handed them back  very nice imitation sir he pronounced theres a place in bond street where i should imagine these came from and another in the burlington arcade their value is from seven to ten pounds  the inspector dismissed him he handed the necklace back to mr parker and rose to his feet  i can only express my most profound regret sir he said on behalf of the force such a mistake is inexcusable mr cullen will i am sure join in offering you every apology  mr cullen was standing a few yards back he was biting his lip until it was absolutely colorless there was a look in his face that was quite indescribable  if i have made a mistake this time he muttered if i have been prematurei apologize butbut  mr parker turned to the inspector  you know he said i fancy this young mans got what they call on this side a down on me hes got an idea that im a crookfollows me about doesnt give me a moments peace in fact say mr inspector cant i put this thing right somehowtake him to my bankers  bankers mr cullen ejaculated softly the only use you have for a banker is to fleece him  mr cullen the inspector exclaimed frowning  i beg your pardon sir i am sorry if i forgot myself he turned abruptly toward the door i offer you my apologies mr parker he said looking back also the young lady butsome day the luck may be on my side  the door slammed behind him mr parker turned toward the inspector  that young man mr inspector he said complainingly puts altogether too much feeling into his work i may have been a bit sarcastic with him once or twice but if it comes to a lifelong vendetta or anything of that sort why hes beginning to look for troublethats all im getting sick of the sight of him if ever i lunch or dine out hes there if i go to a theater hes about whatever harmless amusement i go in for hes there looking on just give him a word of caution mr inspector im a goodtempered man but this cant go on forever  the inspector himself escorted us to the door  i beg mr parker he said that you will take no more notice of mr cullens little fit of temper as regards your complaint i promise you that i will talk to him seriously allow me to send for a taxicab for you oh i beg your pardonthat is your own car i only regret that we should have wasted a few minutes of your evening good night gentlemen good night madam  we left bow street amid many manifestations of courtesy and good will  where shall i tell him to go to sir the policeman asked as he closed the door  back to stephanos mr parker ordered  we glided down into the strand mr parker glanced at his watch  we shall just about make those grilled cutlets he remarked gives you kind of an appetitethis sort of thing say whats the matter with you mr walmsley  oh nothing particular i answered only i was just wondering what in the name of all thats miraculous can have become of lady orstlines necklace  we descended at stephanos and were ushered to our table where the oyster cocktails were waiting mr parker took my arm  perhaps he murmured you may even know that before you go to sleep tonight                                i thought of mr parkers words an hour or so later when i was preparing to undress i emptied first the things from my trousers pockets the feeling of something unfamiliar in one of them brought a puzzled exclamation to my lips i dragged it out and held it in front of me my heart gave a great leap the perspiration broke out upon my forehead my knees shook and i sat down on the bed without the slightest doubt in the world it was lady orstlines pearl necklace     chapter ivthe wooing of eve  i spent a very restless and disturbed night i rose at six oclock the following morning and at ten oclock i rang up 3771a gerrard my inquiry was answered almost at once by mr parker himself  is that you walmsley  it is i replied i have been waiting to ring you up since daylight i want you to understand  you come right round here mr parker interrupted soothingly no good getting fussy over the telephone  where to i asked you forget i dont know your address i should have been round hours ago if i had known where to find you  bless my soul no more you do we are at number 17 banton streetjust off oxford street you know  i am coming straightaway i replied  i was there within ten minutes the place seemed to be a sort of private hotel unostentatious and unprepossessing a hall porter whose uniform had seen better days and whose linen had seen cleaner ones conducted me to the first floor mr parker himself met me on the landing  come right in he invited i saw you drive up eve is in there  he ushered me into a large sitting room of the type one would expect to find in such a place but which by dint of many cushions flowers and feminine knickknacks had been made to look presentable eve was seated in an easychair by the fire she turned round at my entrance and laughed  wheres my necklace please she demanded  the necklace i replied as severely as i could is by this time on its way to lady orstlineif it is not actually in her hands  you mean to say you have sent it back mr parker exclaimed incredulously  certainly i replied i posted it to her early this morning  mr parkers expression was one of blank bewilderment  say do i understand you rightly he continued coming up and laying his great hand upon my shoulder you mean to say that after all we went through because of that miserable necklace youve gone and chucked it do you know it was worth twentyfive thousand pounds  i dont care whether it was worth twentyfive thousand pounds or twenty five thousand pennies retorted i it belonged to lady orstlinenot to you or your daughter or to me i know that you are a skillful conjurer and i wont ask you how it found its way into my pocket i am only glad i have had an opportunity of returning it to its owner  mr parker shook his head ponderously he turned to eve  this he said solemnly is the young man who asked leave to join us what do you think of him eve  nothing at all she replied flippantly he is absolutely useless  if you think mr parker went on we are in this business for our health i want you to understand right here that you are mistaken i never deceived you i told you the first few seconds we met that i was an adventurer i am i brought off a coup last night with that necklace and youve gone and queered it it isnt for myself i mind so much he concluded but theres the child there i was going to have the pearls restrung and let her wear them a bituntil the time came for selling them  look here i said let us understand one another its all very well to live by your wits to make a little out of people not quite so smart as you are to worry through life owing a little here and there borrowing a bit where you can and taking good care to be on the right side when theres a bargain going that i take it is more or less what is meant by being an adventurer but when it comes to downright thieving i protest the penalties are too severe i beg you mr parker to have nothing more to do with it  i went on speaking as earnestly as i could and laying my hand upon his shoulder  i ask you now what i asked you yesterday give me your daughter or if i cant win her all at once let me at any rate have the opportunity of meeting her and trying to persuade her to be my wife i promise you you shant have to do any of these things for a livingeither of you be sensible miss parkereve i begged turning to her and please be a little kind i am in earnest about this come on my side and help me persuade your father i am not wealthy perhaps as you people count money but i am not a poor man ill buy you some pearls  eve threw down the book she had been reading and leaned over the side of her chair looking at me she seemed no longer angry there was indeed a touch of that softness in her face which i had noticed once before and which had encouraged me to hope her forehead was a little puckered her dear eyes a little wistful she looked at me very earnestly but when i would have moved toward her she held out her hand to keep me back  you know she said i think you are quite nice mr walmsley i rather like this outspoken sort of lovemaking its quite out of date of course but it reminds me of mrs henry wood and crinolines and woolwork and all that sort of thing anyhow i like it andi rather like you too but you see its how longa matter of thirtysix hours since i met you first now i couldnt make up my mind to settle down for life with a man id only known thirtysix hours even if he is rash enough to offer to pension my father and remove me from a life of crime  the circumstances i persisted are exceptional you may laugh at it as much as you like but there are very excellent reasons why you should be taken away from this sort of life  she shrugged her shoulders a little dubiously  there again she protested i am not so sure that i want to be taken away from it i like adventuresi adore excitement in fact i must have it  you shall i promised ill take you to paris and monte carlo well go up to khartum and take a caravan beyond you shall go biggame shooting with me in africa ill take you where very few women have been before ill take you where you can gamble with life and death instead of this sordid business of freedom or prison well start for abyssinia in three weeks if you like ill find you excitementthe right sort ill take you into the big places where one feelsand the empty places where one suffers  her eyes flashed sympathetically for a moment  it sounds good she admitted and yetam i ungrateful i wonder theres no excitement for me except where men and women are im afraid im a daughter of babylon  doomed from her infancy to a life of crime i fear mr parker declared pinching a cigar he had just taken out of a box she loves the rapier playthe struggle with men and women takes risks every moment of the time and thrives on it all the same mr walmsley theres something very attractive about the way you are talking i am not going to let my little girl decide too hastily our sort of lifes all very well when we are number one and mr cullens number two we cant have the luck all the time though  i havent dared to mention it in plain words i answered because the thought the mere thought of what might happen to miss eve is too horrible but the risk is there all the time one doesnt deal in forged notes or steal pearl necklaces for nothing and youve an enemy in cullen if ever any one had he means to get you both and if you give him the least chance hell have no mercy  i looked at them anxiously the whole thing seemed to me so momentous neither of them showed the slightest signs of fear or apprehension mr parker with his newly lit cigar in the corner of his mouth was smiling a smile of pleasant contentment eve leaning back in her chair with her hands clasped round the back of her head was gazing at me with a bewitching little smile on her lips  i am not a bit afraid of mr cullen she declared softly  between you and me her father remarked knocking the ash from his cigar theres only one darned thing in this world we are afraid of and that thank the lord isnt this side of the atlantic  the smile faded from eves lips for a moment she closed her eyesa shiver passed through her frame  dont she begged weakly  i guess ill leave it at that her father agreed now this little proposition of yours mr walmsley has just got to lie by for a little timeperhaps only for a very short time its a kind of business for us to make up our minds to part with our liberty or any portion of it meanwhile if youd like to take eve for a motor ride round and meet me for luncheon why the cars outside and if eves agreeable i can pass the time all right  i looked at her eagerly she rose at once to her feet  why it would be charming if you have nothing to do mr walmsley she assented ill put my hat on at once  i have nothing to do at any time now but to respect your wishes i answered firmly and wait until you are sensible enough to say yes to my little proposition  she looked back at me from the door with a twinkle in her eyes  you know she said before i came over i was told that englishmen were rather slow i shall begin to doubt it you wouldnt describe yourself exactly as shy would you mr walmsley  i dont know about that i replied but we have other traits as well we know what we want very often we get it  mr parker rose to his feet he put his hand on my shoulder he was the very prototype of the selfrespecting conscientious prospective father inlaw  young fellow he confessed i shall end by liking you i drove with eve for about two hours we went out nearly as far as kingston and wound up in the heart of the west end i tried to persuade her to walk down bond street but she shook her head  to tell you the truth she confided i am not very fond of being seen upon the streets you know how marvelously clever dad is still we have been talked about once or twice and there are several people whom i shouldnt care about meeting  i sighed as i looked out of the window toward the jewelers shops  i should very much like i said to buy you an engagement ring  she laughed at me  you absurd person why i am not engaged to you yet  you are very near it i assured her anyhow it would be an awfully good opportunity for you to show me the sort of ring you like  she shook her head  not today she decided somehow or other i feel that if ever i do let you youll choose just the sort of ring i shall love without my interfering where did we say wed pick father up  here i answered as the car came to a standstill outside the cafe royal ill go in and fetch him  i found mr parker seated at a table with two of the most villainous specimens of humanity i had ever beheld they were of the same class as the men with whom he had been talking at the milan but still more disreputable he welcomed me however without embarrassment  just passing the time my dear fellow he remarked airily met a couple of acquaintances of mine will you join us  miss parker is outside in the car i explained if you dont mind i will go out and wait with her you can join us when you are ready  five minutesnot a moment longer i promise he called out after me sorry you wont join us  i took my place once more by eves side perhaps my tone was a little annoyed  your father is in there i said with two of the most disreputable looking ruffians i have ever seen crawling upon the face of the earth what in the world induces him to sit at the same table with them i cannot imagine  necessity perhaps she remarked very likely they are highly useful members of our industry  mr parker came out almost immediately afterward i suggested the ritz for luncheon they looked at each other dubiously  to be perfectly frank with you my dear fellow mr parker explained as he clambered into the car and took the place i had vacated by his daughters side it would give us no pleasure to go to the ritz we have courage both of usmy daughter and ias you may have observed for yourself but courage is a different thing from rashness we have been enjoying a very pleasant and not unlucrative time for the last six weeks with theernatural result that there are several ladies and gentlemen in london whom i would just as soon avoid the ritz is one of those places where one might easily come across them  the carlton princes claridges berkeley i suggested or what do you say to jules or the milan grillroom  mr parker shook his head slowly  if you really mean that you wish me to choose he said i say stephanos  as you will i agreed i only suggested the other places because i thought miss parker might like a change  we drove to stephanos it struck me that luigis greeting was scarcely so cordial as usual he piloted us however to the table usually occupied by mr parker on the way he took the opportunity of drawing me a little apart  mr walmsley sir he said can you tell me anything about mr parker and his daughter  anything about them i repeated  that they are americans i know he continued and that the young lady is beautifulwell one has eyes it is not my business to be too particular as to the character of those who frequent my restaurant but twice mr parker has been followed here by a detective and last night as you know they left practically under arrest it is not good for my restaurant mr walmsley to have the police so often about and if mr parker and his daughter are really of the order of those who pass their life under police supervision i would rather they patronized another restaurant  i only laughed at him  my dear luigi i protested be careful how you turn away custom mr parker is i should think no better or any worse than a great many of your clients  if one could but keep the police out of it luigi observed could you drop a word to the gentleman sir since i have seen them in your company i have naturally more confidence but it is not good for my restaurant to have it watched by the police all the time  ill see what can be done luigi i promised him  mr parker was twice called up on the telephone during luncheon time he seemed throughout the meal preoccupied and more than once with a word of apology to me he and eve exchanged confidential whispers i felt certain that something was in the air some new adventure from which i was excluded and my heart sank as i thought of all the grim possibilities overshadowing it  i watched them with their heads close together mr parker apparently unfolding the details of some scheme and it seemed to me that after all the wisest thing i could do was to bid this strange pair farewell after luncheon and return either to the country or cross over to paris for a few days and then a chance word a little look from eve a little touch from her fingers as it occurred to her that i was being neglected made me realize the absolute impossibility of doing anything of the sort  for a person of my habits of life and temperament i had certainly fallen into a strange adventure not only had eve herself come to mean for me everything that was real and vital in life but i was most curiously attracted by her terrible father i liked him  i liked being with him he was a type of person i had never met before in my life and one whom i thoroughly appreciated i sat and watched him during an interval of the conversation  geniality and humor were stamped upon his expression i am enjoying life he seemed to say to everybody come and enjoy it with me what a man to be walking the tight rope all the timeto be risking his character and his freedom day by day  if there is anything more on hand i said trying to make my tone as little dejected as possible i should like to be in it  mr parker scratched his chin  i am not sure that you really enjoy these little episodes  of course i dont enjoy them i admitted indignantly you know that i hate them i am miserable all the time simply because of what may happen to you and to miss eve  mr parker sighed  there you are you see he declared thats the one kink in your disposition sir which places you irrevocably outside the class to which eve and i belong now let me ask you this young man he went on what is the most dangerous thing youve ever done  ive played some tough polo i remembered  thatll do mr parker declared now tell me when you turned out you knew perfectly well that a broken leg or a broken armperhaps a cracked skullwas a distinct possibility did you think about this when you went into the game did you think about it while you were playing  of course i didnt i admitted  just so mr parker concluded triumphantly thats where the sporting instinct comes in you know a thing is going to amuse and excite you beyond that you do not think  but in this case i persisted i think it is your duty to think for your daughters sake  eve flashed upon me the first angry glance i had seen from her  i think she decided coldly it is not worth while discussing this matter with mr walmsley we are too far apart in our ideas he has been brought up among a different class of people and in a different way besides he misses the chief point if i werent an adventuress mr walmsley i might have to become a typist and daddy might have to serve in a shop dont you think that wed rather livereally live mindeven for a week or two of our lives than spend dull years as we have done upon the treadmill  i give it up i said there is only one argument left you know quite well that the pecuniary excuse exists no longer  she looked at me and her face softened  you are a queer person she murmured you are so very english so very set in your views so very respectable and yet you are willing to take us both  i am only thinking of marrying you i interrupted  well you were going to make daddy an allowance werent you  with great pleasure i assured her vigorously and i only wish youd take my hand now and wed fix up everything tomorrow we could go down and see my house in the country evei think youd love itand there are such things even in england you know as special licenses  you dear person she laughed i cant be rushed into respectability like this  perhaps that was really my first moment of genuine encouragement for there had been a little break in her voice something in her tone not altogether natural if only we had been aloneif even another summons to the telephone had come just then for her father fortune however was not on my side instead the waiter appeared with the bill and diverted my attention eve and her father whispered together the moment had passed  anything particular on this afternoon walmsley mr parker asked as he rose to his feet  not a thing i replied  i have just got to hurry off he explained a little matter of business eve has nothing to do for an hour or so  ill look after her if i may i interposed eagerly  dont be later than half past five eve her father directed as he went off and dont be tired  we followed him a few minutes later into the street a threatening shower had passed away the sky overhead was wonderfully soft and blue the air was filled with sunlight fragrant with the perfume of barrows of lilac drawn up in the gutter eve walked by my side her head a little thrown back her eyes for a moment half closed  but london is delicious on days like this she exclaimed what are you going to do with me mr walmsley  take you down to the archbishop of canterbury and marry you i threatened  she shook her head  i couldnt be married on a friday let us go and see some pictures instead  we went into the national gallery and wandered round for an hour she knew a great deal more about the pictures than i did and more than once made me sit down by her side to look at one of her favorite masterpieces  i want to go to bond street now she said when we left i think it will be quite all right at this time in the afternoon and there are some weird things to be seen there do you mind  we walked again along pall mall passing the carlton she suddenly clutched at my arm a little stifled cry escaped her the color left her cheeks we increased our speed presently she breathed a sigh of relief  heavens what an escape she exclaimed do you think he saw me  do you mean the young man who was getting out of the taxicab  she nodded  one of our victims she murmured daddys victim rather i didnt do a thing to him  i am quite sure he didnt see you i told her he was struggling to find change  she sighed once more the incident seemed to have shaken her  the worst of our sort of life is she confided that it must soon come to an end we have victims all over the place one of them is bound to turn up and be disagreeable sooner or later  i should say then i remarked that the moment is opportune for a registrars office and a trip to abyssinia  and leave daddy to face the music alone she objected it couldnt be done  we turned into a tea shop and sat in a remote corner of the place i had made up my mind to say no more to her that day but the opportunity was irresistible  there was a little desultory music a hum of distant conversation and eve herself was thoughtful i pleaded with her earnestly  eve i begged if only you would listen to me seriously i simply cannot bear the thought of the danger you are in all the time give it up dear this momenttoday well lead any sort of life you like well wander all over europeamerica if you say the word i am quite well enough off to take you anywhere you choose to go and still see that your father is quite comfortable youve made such a difference in such a short time  she was certainly quieter and her tone was softer she avoided looking at me  perhaps she said very gently this feeling you speak of would pass away just as quickly  there isnt any fear of that i assured her as i care for you now eve i must care for you always and you know its torture for me to think of you in troubleperhaps in disgrace as my wife you shall be safe youll have me always there to protect you i should like to take you even farther afield for a timeto india or japan if you likeand then come back and start life all over again  youre rather a dear she murmured softly i will tell you something at any rate i do care for youa littlebetter than ive ever cared for any one else but i cant decide quite so quickly  give up this adventure tonight i begged i hate to mention it eve but if moneyi put my checkbook in my pocket today if your father would only  she stopped me firmly  after the things you have told me she said i dont think i could bear to have him take your money today i cant quite do as you wish but what you have said shall make a difference i promise you i cant say more please drive me home now     chapter vmr samuelson  the moment i opened my paper the next morning the very announcement i had dreaded to find was there in large type i read the particulars breathlessly daring burglary in hampsteadlady loses two thousand pounds worth of jewelry the burglary had taken place at the house of a mr and mrs samuelson in wood grove hampstead it appeared that a dinner party had been given at the house during the evening which had engaged the attention of the whole of the staff of four servants and that for an hour or so the upper premises were untenanted  upon retiring to rest mrs samuelson found that her jewel case and the whole of her jewelry except what she was wearing had been stolen as no arrest had yet been made the references to the affair were naturally guarded the paragraph even concluded without the usual formula as to the police having a clew on the whole i put the paper down with a slight feeling of relief i felt that it might have been worse  i breakfasted at nine oclock after having read the announcement through again trying to see whether there was any possible connection between it and my friends then i lit a pipe and sat down to wait until i could ring up 3771a gerrard about ten oclock however my own telephone bell rang and i was informed that a gentleman who desired to see me was waiting below i told the man to send him up and in a moment or two there was a knock at my door in response to my invitation to enter a short dark jewishlooking person with olive complexion shiny black hair and black mustache presented himself he carried a very immaculate silk hat and was dressed with great neatness he had the air however of a man who is suffering from some agitation  mr walmsley i believe he asked mr paul walmsley  that is my name  know you by hearsay quite well sir my visitor assured me with a flash of his white teeth very glad to meet you indeed i have done business once or twice with your sister the countess of aynesleybusiness in curios you know my place i dare say in st james street my name is samuelson i could scarcely repress a little start which he was quick to notice perhaps youve been reading about that affair at my house last night he asked  that is precisely what i have been doing i admitted please sit down mr samuelson i wheeled an easychair up for him and placed a box of cigarettes at his elbow quite a mysterious affair i continued it is almost the first burglary i have ever read of in which the police have not been said to possess a clew  mr samuelson who seemed gratified by his reception lit a cigarette and crossed his legs displaying a very nice pair of patent boots with gray su√®de tops  it is a very queer affair indeed he told me confidentially the police have been taking a lot of trouble about it and a very intelligent sort of fellow from scotland yard has been in and out of the house ever since  any clew at all i asked  rather hard to say mr samuelson replied youll be wondering what ive come to see you about well ill just explain of course theres always the chance that some one may have entered the house while we were all at dinnercrept upstairs quietly and got away with the jewel case but this johnny i was telling you about from scotland yard seems to have got hold of a theory that has rather knocked me of a heap very delicate matter mr samuelson continued as you will understand when i tell you that he thinks it may have been one of my guests who was in the show  seems a little farfetched to me i remarked but one never knows  you see mr samuelson explained theres no back exit from my house without climbing walls and that sort of thing and it happened to be a particularly light evening as you may remember there are policemen at both ends of the road who seem unusually confident that no one carrying a parcel of any sort passed at anything like the time when the thing was probably done this is where the johnny from scotland yard comes in he has got the idea into his head that the jewels might have been taken away in the carriage of one of my guests  well i remarked i should have thought you would have been the best judge as to the probability of that you hadnt any strangers with you i suppose  only two mr samuelson replied we were ten altogether he went on counting upon his fingersand a very nice little party too first of all my wife and myself then mr and mrs max solomonsolomon the great fruiterers in covent garden you know man worth a quarter of a million of money and a distant connection of my wifevery distant worse luck then there was mr sidney hollingworth a young man in my office but he doesnt count because he stayed on chatting with me about business after the others had gone and he was with us when the theft was discovered then there was my wifes widowed sister mrs rosenthal we can leave her out thats six then there was alderman sir henry dabbs and his wife you may know the namelarge portmanteau manufacturers in spitalfields and certain to be lord mayor before long his wife was wearing jewelry herself last night worth i should say from twenty to twentyfive thousand pounds so my wifes little bit wouldnt do them much good eh  it certainly doesnt seem like it i admitted so far your list of guests seems to have been entirely reputable  the only two left mr samuelson concluded are an american gentleman and his daughter a mr and miss parker whom we met on the train coming up from brightona very delightful gentleman and most popular he was with all of us the young lady too was perfectly charming to hear him talk i should have put him down myself as a man worth all the money he needed and more and the young lady had got that trick of wearing her clothes and talking as though she were born a princess real style i should have saidboth of them still the fact remains that they came in a motor car with two menservants that it waited for them and that this detective from scotland yardmr cullen i think his name ishas fairly got his knife into them  and now i remarked smiling you are perhaps coming to the object of your visit to me  exactly mr samuelson admitted the fact of it is that in the course of conversation your name was mentioned i forget exactly how it cropped up but it did crop up mr parker it seems has the privilege of your acquaintanceat any rate he claims it now if his claim is a just one and if you can tell me mr parker is a friend of yourswhy that ends the matter so far as i am concerned i am not going to have my guests worried and annoyed by detectives for the sake of a handful of jewels i thank goodness i can afford to lose them if they must be lost and i can replace them this afternoon without feeling it now you know where we are mr walmsley you understand exactly why i have come to see you eh  i pressed another cigarette upon him and lit one myself  i do understand mr samuelson i told him and i appreciate your visit very much indeed i am exceedingly glad you came mr parker told you the truth he is a gentleman for whom i have the utmost respect and esteem i consider his daughter too one of the most charming young ladies i have ever met i am planning to give a dinner party within the course of the next few evenings purposely to introduce them to some of my friends with whom they are as yet unacquainted and i am hoping that almost immediately afterward they will be staying with my sister at her place down in suffolk  with the countess of aynesley mr samuelson said slowly  certainly i agreed i am quite sure my sister will be as charmed with them as i and many other of my friends are  mr samuelson rose to his feet brushed the cigarette ash from his trousers and took up his hat  mr walmsley he said holding out his hand i am glad i came you have treated me frankly and in a most gentlemanly manner i can assure you i appreciate it not under any circumstances would i allow friends of yours to be irritated by the indiscriminate inquiries of detectives the jewels can go hang sir  he shook hands with me and permitted me to show him out after which he marched down the corridor humming gayly to himself determined to have me understand that a trifling loss of two thousand pounds worth of jewelry was in reality nothing i stood for some time with my back to the fire smoking thoughtfully then the telephone bell rang my gloomier reflections were at once forgotten it was eve who spoke  good morning mr walmsley  good morning miss eve i replied  are you very busy this morning she asked  nothing in the world to do i answered promptly  then please come round she directed ringing off almost at once  i was there in ten minutes the hall porter who had not yet completed his morning toilet conducted me upstairs in the morning sunlight the whole appearance of the place seemed shabbier and dirtier than ever inside the sitting room however everything was different my own flowers had apparently been supplemented by many others mr parker as pinkandwhite as usual looking the very picture of content and good digestion was smoking a large cigar and reading a newspaper eve was seated at the writing table but she swung round at my entrance and held out both her hands  the flowers are lovely she murmured do go and sit downand talk to daddy while i finish this letter  i shook hands with mr parker he laid down the newspaper and smiled at me  a pleasant dinner last night i trust i inquired  his eyes twinkled  most humorous affair he declared i wouldnt have missed it for worlds  from a business point of view i began dryly  mr parker shook his head  mr samuelsons jewels he complained were like his wines all sparkle and outsideno body to them two thousand pounds indeed why we shall be lucky if we clear four hundred the mans coolness absolutely took me aback for a moment i simply stared at him hell be round to see you this morning sometime about my character mr parker proceeded  he has already paid me a visit i said grimly he was round at ten oclock this morning  you dont say mr parker murmured  he looked at me hopefully his expression was like nothing else but the wistful smile of a fat boy expecting good news  oh of course i told him the usual thing i admitted i told him you were a close personal friend a sort of amateur millionaire a person of the highest respectabilityeverything you ought to be in fact he went away perfectly satisfied and determined to have nothing to do with the guest theory  mr parker patted me on the shoulder  my boy he said i knew i could rely on you  i propose i continued elaborating upon the scheme that had come into my head on the way to do more than this for you i am asking some friends to dine tonight whom i wish you and your daughter to meet you will then be able to refer to other reputable acquaintances in london besides myself  eve turned round in her chair to listen mr parker whose first expression had been one of unfeigned delight suddenly paused  my boy he expostulated i dont want to take advantage of you do you think its quite playing the game on your friends to introduce to them two people like ourselves you know what it means  i know perfectly well i agreed but as some day or other im going to marry eve it seems to me the thing might as well be done  they were both perfectly silent for several moments they looked at each other there were questions in his faceother things in hers i strolled across to the window  if youd like to talk it over i suggested dont mind me all the same i insist upon the party  its uncommonly kind of you sure mr parker said thoughtfully the more i think it over the more i feel impressed by it but do you know theres something about the proposition i cant quite cotton to seems to me youve some little scheme of your own at the back of your head you havent got it in your mind have you that youre sort of putting us on our honor  i have no ulterior motive at all i declared mendaciously  eve rose to her feet and came across to me she was wearing a charming morning gown of some light blue material with large buttons tight fitting alluring and there was a little quiver of her lips a provocative gleam in her eyes which i found perfectly maddening  i think we wont come thank you she decided  why not  you see she explained i am rather afraid we might get you into no end of trouble with some of your most particular friends there are one or two people you know in london especially among the americans who might say the unkindest things about us  no one my dear eve i assured her stolidly shall say anything to me or to any one else about my future wife  for a moment her expression was almost hopeless she shook her head  i dont know what to do with him daddy she exclaimed turning toward her father in despair  im afraid youll have to marry him if he goes on mr parker declared gloomily that is he added as though he had suddenly perceived a ray of hope about the matter unless we should by any chance get into trouble first  meantime i ventured we will dine at eight oclock at the milan  mr parker groaned  at the milan he echoed worse and worse we shall be recognized for certain theres a man lives there whom i did out of a hundred pounds just a little variation of the confidence trick nothing he can get hold of you understand but he knows very well that i had him look here walmsley be reasonable hadnt you better drop this chivalrous scheme of yours young fellow  the dinner is a fixture i replied firmly can i borrow miss eve please i want to take her for a motor ride  you cannot sir mr parker told me eve has a little business of her ownor rather mineto attend to this morning  you are not going to let her run any more risks are you  mr parker frowned at me  look here young man he said she is my daughter remember i am looking after her for the present you leave that to me  eve touched me on the arm  really i am busy today she assured me i have to do something for daddy this morningsomething quite harmless and this afternoon i have to go to my dressmakers well come at eight oclock  well come on this condition mr parker suddenly determined my name is getting a little too well known and it isnt my own anyway well come as mr and miss bundercombe or not at all  why on earth bundercombe i demanded  for the reason i have just stated mr parker said obstinately parker isnt my name at all and between you and me i think i have made it a bit notorious now there is a mr bundercombe and his daughter who live out in a farwestern state of america whove never been out of their own country and who are never likely to set foot on this side shes a pretty little girljust like eve might be and hes a big handsome fellowjust like me so well borrow their names if you dont mind  you can come without a name at all so long as you come was my final decision as i took my leave     chapter vithe party at the milan  the dinner party which i arranged for in the milan restaurant was on the whole a great success my sister played hostess for me and confessed herself charmed with eve as indeed was every one else mr parkers stories kept his end of the table in continual bursts of merriment one little incident too was in its way exceedingly satisfactory mr and mrs samuelson were being entertained by some friends close at hand and they appeared very much gratified at the cordiality of our greeting i talked with mr samuelson during the evening and i felt that so far as he was concerned at any rate not a shadow of suspicion remained in his mind as to my two guests  we sat a long time over dinner eve was between a cousin of minewho was a member of parliament a master of foxhounds and in his way quite a distinguished personand the old earl of enterdean my godfather and they were both of them obviously her abject slaves no one seemed in the least inclined to move and it was nearly eleven oclock before we passed into the private room i had engaged where coffee and some bridge tables awaited us we broke up there into little groups i left eve talking to my sister and was on my way to try to get near her father when the countess of enterdean a perfectly charming old lady who had known me from boyhood intercepted me  my dear paul she said i cannot thank you enough for having given us the opportunity of meeting these most delightful americans and i really must tell you thisi had meant to keep it a secret but from you i cannot i knew all the time that the name of bundercombe was familiar to me and suddenly it came over me like a flash directly i asked mr bundercombe in what part of america his home was of course it was all clear to me what a small world it is do you know she concluded impressively that it was just these two people mr bundercombe and his daughter who were so amazingly kind to reggie when he was out in the states on his way to dickys ranch  i was for a moment absolutely thunderstruck  did youerremind mr bundercombe of this i asked  she shook her head she had the pleased smile of a benevolent conspirator  i will tell you why i did not paul she explained reggie is in town just for a few days i have sent him a telephone message and he is wild with delight he has only just arrived from scotland but i told him mr bundercombe and his daughter were here and he is rushing into his clothes as fast as he can and is coming round it will be so delightful for him to meet them again and i really must try to think myself what i can do to repay all their kindness to reggie  i felt completely at my wits end i saw the whole of my little scheme which up to now had proved so successful threatened with instant destruction lady enterdean passed on probably to take some one else into her confidence i crossed the room to the little group surrounding my friend and as soon as i got near him i touched him on the shoulder  just one word with you mr bundercombe i begged  the little circle of men let him through with reluctance i passed my arm through his and led him out toward the foyer  you seem i declared bitterly to have chosen the most unfortunate personality i wish to goodness you had remained mr parker this infernal name of yours bundercombe has got us into trouble  in what way he asked quickly  lady enterdean has just been to me i told him she has a son who has been traveling in the states and who was wonderfully entertained by two people of the name of bundercombe in the very place you told me to say you came from  well that goes all right mr parker remarked complacently were getting the credit for it  precisely i admitted the only trouble is that lady enterdean has just telephoned to her son to come down at once and renew his acquaintance with you and eve  mr parker whistled softly his face had become a blank  my we do seem to be up against it he confessed uneasily  the young man i continued will be here in ten minutesperhaps soonerprepared to grasp you both by the hand and exchange reminiscences  mr parker shook out a white silk handkerchief from his pocket and mopped his forehead  kind of warm out here he remarked ill just have to talk to eve for a minute or two  he had no sooner left me than i found i was absolutely compelled to devote myself to one or two of my guests who wished to play bridge and others of whom i had seen little at dinner time i kept looking anxiously round and at last the blow fell the door opened and lord reginald sidley was announced he looked eagerly round the room  hope you dont mind my butting in old chap he said as he shook hands with me the mater telephoned that old bundercombe and his daughter were here so i just rushed round as quick as i could regular bricks they were to me out west i dont see them anywhere  i glanced round the room just at that moment a waiter from the restaurant presented himself he brought me a card upon a salver  the gentleman asked me to give you this sir he announced  i picked it up on the back of a plain visiting card were a few hasty words scrawled in pencil  so sorrybut eve is not feeling quite herself and begged me to take her home at once quietly my respects and apologies to you and all your delightful guests  i read it out and passed it to reggie his face fell  if that isnt a sell he exclaimed fancy your knowing them isnt miss bundercombe a topper  she is certainly one of the most charming young women i ever met in my life i admitted  i am glad at any rate lady enterdean declared that they have found their way to london i shall make a point of calling on them myself tomorrow now paul you must go and play bridge they are waiting for you dont bother about me ill amuse myself quite well strolling round and talking to my friends i made up a rubber of bridge chiefly with the idea of distracting my thoughts presently while my partner was playing the hand i rose and crossed the room to the sideboard for some cigarettes i found lady enterdean peering about with her lorgnette fixed to her eyes apparently searching for something  lost anything lady enterdean i asked  a most extraordinary thing has happened my dear paul she declared resting her hand on the bosom of her gown i am perfectly certain it was there a quarter of an hour agomy cameo brooch you know the one that old sir henry brought home from italy  too large to lose anyway i remarked cheerfully as i joined in the search  we pulled aside a table and i almost collided with one of my most distinguished guestssir blaydon harrison kcb sir blaydon also with an eyeglass in his eye was moving discontentedly backward and forward kicking the carpet  silly thing he observed as he glanced up for a moment that little diamond charm of mine has slipped off my fob i saw it as we crossed the foyer from the restaurant  why what has happened to us all my sister joined in look at meive lost my pendant paul did you give us too much to drink or what  i am not sure that this was not the most awful moment of my life a cold shiver of fear suddenly seized me i looked from one to the other speechless if appearances had gone for anything at that moment i must indeed have looked guilty  most extraordinary i mumbled  oh the things will turn up all right without a doubt lady enterdean declared goodhumoredly could we have a couple of waiters in and search properly paul my knees are a little too old for this stooping  if youll please all wait a few minutes i begged earnestly ill go out and make inquiries sir blaydon take my place in that rubber of bridgetheres a good fellow ill have the restaurant searched too dont mind if i am away a few minutes  i hurried out as soon as the door of the private room was closed i made for the entrance of the restaurant as fast as i could sprint without hat or coat i jumped into a taxi and in less than ten minutes i was mounting the stairs of number 17 banton street with the hall porter blinking at me from his office i scarcely went through the formality of knocking at the door mr parker and eve were both standing at the table their heads close together at the sound of my footsteps and precipitate entrance mr parker swung round one hand was still behind him upon the table a white silk handkerchief was lying  my dear fellow he exclaimed my dear walmsley what has happened  i opened my lips and closed them again it really seemed impossible to say anything mr parkers expression had never been so boyish so earnest and yet so wistful eve was quivering with some emotion the nature of which i could not at once divine i felt very certain however that she had been remonstrating with her father  dont keep us in suspense my dear fellow mr parker implored what has gone wrong eve and i were justjust talking over your delightful party  and looking over the spoils i said grimly  i went a little farther into the room mr parker with a sigh abandoned his position he unclosed the fingers of his hand and removed the silk handkerchief i saw upon the table my aunts brooch my sisters pendant and sir blaydon harrisons diamond pig i said not a word i looked at them and i looked at mr parker he smiled weakly and scratched his chin  i didnt do so badly he essayed apologetically to tell you the truth i really hadnt meant  never mind what you meant i interrupted please give me those things back again at once  eve dropped them into the handkerchief twisted them up and passed them across to me  i told daddy it was rather a mean trick she sighed but really you know no people ought to carry about their valuables like that it was trying us a little too high wasnt it and dear reggiedid he arrive  for the first time i was really angry with eve  if you will allow me i said i will pursue this conversation tomorrow morning  i tore downstairs jumped into the waiting taxi and returned to the milan i entered the private room with a grave face evidently i was only just in time the rubber of bridge had been broken up and my guests were standing about in little groups talking i closed the door behind me and held up my hand  blanche i announcedlady enterdeani am delighted to say i have recovered everything  my dear boy how wonderfully clever of you  lady enterdean exclaimed how relieved i feel most satisfactory i am sure  she sat down promptly there was a little murmur of voices my guests gathered round me i drew a long breath and continued on my mendacious career  i have been closeted with the manager i explained it was one of the underwaitersthe little dark one who brought in the coffee the temptation seems to have been too much for him he confessed directly he was questioned he has restored everything and i thought it best to have him simply turned off without any fuss here is your pig sir blaydon your pendant blanche your brooch lady enterdean i am exceedingly sorry you should have had any anxietybut alls well that ends well i wound up weakly  every one was talking cheerfully the great topic now was one of ethics had i acted properly in not charging the waiter fortunately some one discovered a little later that it was twelve oclock and my little party broke up     chapter viione of us  i was not altogether surprised to receive on the following morning before i had finished breakfast a visit from reggie  cheero he said brightly as he seated himself in my easychair and tapped the end of one of my cigarettes upon the tablecloth i havent been up so early for months but i had to find you before you went out about these bundercombes  what about them  i want their address of course reggie continued the mater wants to call this afternoon and im all for seeing miss bundercombe again ripping girl isnt she  then prepare yourself for a disappointment my friend i advised glancing at the clock they left for paris by the nine oclock train this morning  reggie stared at me blankly  gone already  i nodded and invented a little difficulty with my coffee pot  theirs was only a flying visit i explained i was lucky to get hold of them for my dinner  im hanged if i understand this reggie remarked looking at me suspiciously why i spent the best part of three weeks with them in that godforsaken hole out west and they were as keen as mustard on my taking them round london how long have they been here  not long i answered sure you wont have some coffee  reggie ignored the invitation  theyve got my address and there are the directories he continued the funny part of it is too that i heard from mrs bundercombe a week or so ago and she never said a word about any of them coming over  they seem to have made their minds up all of a sudden i explained they spoke of it as quite a flying trip  reggie coughed and stared for a moment at the end of his boot  cant understand it at all he repeated devilish queer thing anyway i say paul youre sure its all right i suppose  all right what do you mean  between you and me he went ondont give it away outside this room you knowbut there have been rumors going about concerning an american and his pretty daughter over hereregular wrong uns theyve been up to all sorts of tricks and only kept out of prison by a fluke  youre not associating these people whoever they may be with mr and miss bundercombe i asked sternly  reggie gazed once more at the point of his boot  the thing is he remarked are your friends mr and miss bundercombe at all  dont talk rot  it may be rot reggie admitted slowly or it may not by the by where did you meet them  if you dont mind i answered we wont discuss them any longer  at least reggie insisted will you tell me this where have they been staying in london i shall go there and see whether they have left any address for letters to be forwarded  i shall tell you nothing i decided as a matter of fact i am finding you rather a nuisance  reggie picked up his hat  there is something more in this he said didactically than meets the eye  machiavellian i scoffed be off reggie  i had tea with eve that afternoon and broached the subject of reggies visit as delicately as i could  you remember lord reggie sidley i asked  lord reggie what eve exclaimed  sidley i repeated firmly he spent three weeks with you out at your home in okata his threatened arrival last night was the cause of your fathers precipitate retreat and yours  oh that young man eve remarked airily well what about him  he has been round to see me this morning i told herwanted your address  she sighed  london will be getting too hot for us soon she murmured am i engaged to him or anything  eve i said when are you going to let me announce our engagement  our what she demanded  engagement i repeated i have proposed to you two or three times i will do it again if you like  pray dont she begged you are not going to tell me are you she added looking at me with wideopen eyes that i have accepted you  you havent refused me i pointed out  if i havent she assured me it has been simply to save your feelings  i gulped down a little rising storm of indignation  you must marry sometime eve i said there isnt any one in america is there  there are a great many she assured me it was to get away from them as much as anything that i came over with father on this business trip  business trip i groaned  oh i dare say it all seems very disgraceful to any one like youyou who were born with plenty of money and have never been obliged to earn any and have mixed with respectable people all your life she exclaimed all the same let me tell you there are plenty of charming and delightful people going about the world earning their living by their witssimply because they are forced to there is more than one code of morals you know  i flatter myself that at this point i was tactful  my dear eve i reminded her you forget that i have joined the gangi mean i corrected myself hastily that i have offered to associate myself with you and your father in any of your enterprises i am perfectly willing to give up anything in life you may consider too respectable at the same time i must say there are limits so far as you are concerned  she pouted a little  i hate being out of things she said  no need for you to be altogether i continued  now if i could institute a real big affair in the shape of a bucketshop swindle in which your father and i could play the principal parts and you become merely a subordinate such as a typist or somethingwhat about that eh  it doesnt sound very amusing for me she objected how much should we make  thousands i assured her if it were properly engineered  i think she said reflectively that father would be very glad of a few thousands just now he says the market over here for such little trifles as we have come across is very restricted  i groaned under my breath in imagination i could see mr parker bartering with some shady individual for lady enterdeans cameo brooch i reverted to our previous subject of conversation  eve i went on i hate to seem tediousbut the question of our engagement still hangs fire  you persistent person she sighed tell me if i married you would all those people we met last night be nice to me  of course they would i assured her they are only waiting for a word from you i think they must have an idea already i am not in the habit of giving dinner parties with a young lady as guest of honor  she was thoughtful for a few moments and her eyes lit up with reminiscent humor  dear me she murmured if only they knew they hadnt any suspicions i suppose about thosethose little trifles  none i replied i put it all on to a waiter  how clever of you you really do seem to be a most capable personand so masterful i begin to fear that some day youll have your own way  her eyes laughed at me there was something softly provocative in thema new and kinder light i bent over her and kissed her she sat quite still  mr walmsley  its usual among engaged couples i pleaded  is it she remarked coldly doesnt the man as a rule wait to be quite sure he is engaged  not in this country i declared i have heard that americans are rather shy about that sort of thing englishmen  oh bother englishmen she exclaimed stamping her foot i dont believe a word ive ever heard about them i suppose now i shall have to marry you  i dont see any way out of it i agreed readily  she held up her finger the door was quietly opened mr parker entered  he was followed by the most utterly objectionable and repulsivelooking person i have ever set eyes on in my lifea young man thin and of less than medium height flashily dressed in cheap clothes with patent boots and brilliant necktie his cheeks were sallow and his eyes deeply inset were closer together than any i have ever seen  my dear mr parker exclaimed let me present mr mossmy daughter sir mr walmsleyalso one of us i have been privileged mr parker continued dropping his voice a little to watch mr moss at work this afternoon and i can assure you that a more consummate artist i have never seenin wall street at a racetrack meeting or anywhere else  mr moss smiled deprecatingly and jerked his head sideways  the old uns pretty fly he remarked as he laid his hat on the table  i am very glad to know mr moss of course eve said but i am not in the least in sympathy with theerbranch of our industry he represents you know daddy its much too dangerous and not a bit remunerative  to a certain extent my dear her father admitted i am with you not all the way though one needs of course to discriminate personally i must admit that the nerve and actual genius required in finger manipulation have always attracted me  mr moss paused with his glass halfway to his lips he jerked his head in the direction of mr parker  he is one for the gab aint he he remarked confidentially to me  for the life of me at that moment i could not tell whether to leave the room in a fit of angry disgust or to accept the ludicrous side of the situation and laugh fortunately for me perhaps i caught eves eye in which there was more than the suspicion of a twinkle i chose therefore the latter alternative mr moss watched us for a moment curiously  what might your line be guvnor he asked as he set down his glass  oh anything thats going i replied carelessly city work is rather my specialty  i know mr moss exclaimed quickly slapup offices thousands of letters a day full of postal orders shutters up suddenlyand bunco fine appearance for the job he added admiringly  eve sat down and began to laugh softly to herself she had a habit of laughing almost altogether with her eyes in a way that expressed more genuine enjoyment than anything i have ever realized she rocked herself gently backward and forward mr moss looked at us both a little suspiciously  seem to be missing the joke a biti do he remarked  eve sat up and was instantly grave  it is your clearsighted way of putting things she explained softly you seem to understand people so thoroughly  i dont generally make no mistake about the number of beans in the game mr moss observed in a selfcongratulatory tone i can tell a crook from a mug a bit quicker than most  i have suggested to mr moss my dear mr parker intervened turning toward us with beaming face just a little early dinnersay at stephanosjust as we are you know will this be agreeable to you  certainly eve assented promptly  mr moss will tell us some of his little adventures mr parker continued with satisfaction considering that he has had twelve years continual work i think youll all agree with me that his is a wonderful record he has been compelled to enter into a little involuntaryer retirement only once during the whole of that time  mr moss looked a little puzzled  he means lagged dont he he remarked a light breaking in on him only once in my lifeand that for a trifling beanoa ladys bag and a couple of wipes i tell you its no joke nowadays though they do watch you the profession aint what it was  you will come with us wont you mr walmsley eve begged turning to me  i shall be delighted i answered with strenuous mendacity did you say stephanos or what do you think of one of these places closer at hand i was told of a little restaurant in soho the other day where the cooking is remarkable  im all for stephanos mr moss declared grinning and the sooner the better one of the neatest pieces of business i ever did in my life i brought off there in the old bar to tell you the truth im getting a bit peckish  there is no reason mr parker agreed why we should not dine at once it is very nearly seven oclock what do you say  yoicks tallyho for the strand mr moss exclaimed with spirit  we started offfour in a taxi it was mr moss who with florid politeness handed eve to her seat and it was mr moss who entertained us on the way with light conversation     chapter viiiat the alhambra  luigis face when he met the parkers and myself at the entrance of the restaurant was a study his polite bow and smile of welcome seemed suddenly frozen on his face as his eyes fell upon mr moss mr moss was still wearing his hat which was a black bowler with a small brim set at a jaunty angle a little on one side and affording a liberal view of his black curls underneath his linen failed completely to stand the test of the clear soft light of the restaurant and one might have been excused for entertaining certain doubts with regard to the diamond pin in his mauve tie and the ring that flashed from his not overwhite hand as he tardily removed his headgear  bit of all rightthis place mr moss remarked handing his hat to luigi wholl have a short one with me before we feed  luigi passed the hat from the tips of his fingers to a subordinate he showed us a table quite silently handed the menu over to a ma√Ætre dh√¥tel and promptly departed looking round a little nervously i could see him gazing at us from his sanctum over the top of the blind  mr moss i see has american tastes mr parker declared he likes an ap√©ritif before dinner leave it to me please  mr parker ordered a somewhat extensive dinner throughout the meal we listened to a series of adventures in which the hero was always mr moss we heard of wonderful hauls and wonderful escapes detectives outwitted exploits that reminded me more of the motor bandits of paris than of our own sober capital  mr parkers attention never flagged halfway through the meal mr moss suddenly put down his knife and fork he broke off in the middle of a fascinating narration of an episode during which he had jujutsued one detective knocked another down locked them both in an empty room and strolled away with a cigar abstracted from the case of one of them and his pockets full of uncut emeralds with his mouth open he was gazing fixedly across the room there was a considerable change in his tone  ware tec he said sharply  we all looked in the direction he indicated and we all recognized mr cullen who was apparently returning with interest our observation i saw a grim smile upon his lips as he disappeared for a moment behind the menu card for a man who had in his time treated detectives in such a cavalier way mr moss change of color and subdued manner was a little extraordinary he cheered up however after a little while  our friend cullen mr parker murmured seems to have taken quite a fancy to this restaurant  used to be on my lay mr moss remarked hes much too big a duke now for the street though they say he gets nearly all the highclass forgery and swindling cases  we have come into contact with him ourselves mr parker observed genially seems to me theres a kind of want of snap about him compared with our american detectives but i dare say he knows his business  is your father really enjoying this i asked eve  he absolutely loves it she replied  i sighed  and i think she added suddenly you are behaving beautifullyi almost love you for it  i looked at her quickly and i felt rewarded for all i had gone through her attitude toward me was subtly different somehow i felt that i was being permitted a glimpse of the real eve her eyes were soft she patted my hand under the table i could almost have shaken hands with mr moss  what about a music hall afterward i proposed in the fullness of my heart shall i send for stalls at the alhambra  my proposal was received with unanimous approval our departure from the restaurant a few minutes later evoked almost as much comment as our arrival mr moss led the way his hands in his trousers pockets and a large cigar pointing toward the ceiling protruding from the corner of his mouth his slight uneasiness with regard to the whereabouts of his hat having been dispelled by its appearance before we finished our meal he placed it on his head at its usual angle before we left the room  mr parker took his arm as they passed out and i saw mr cullens eyes follow them from behind his newspaper the two got into a taxi and eve and i followed them in another an arrangement that mr moss appeared to regard with disfavor eves hand stole into mine as we drove off  do you know she said seriously i think its perfectly horrid to drag you about in such company its all very well for us because we belong and we are in a strange city but i saw some of your friends look at you and whisper they must think you are mad  so long as you are in it dear i assured her i dont care where i go or with whom  you dont look like that a bit you know she sighed  as for the rest i went on if you are really sorry for mewhy then end it your father could spare us for a little time  i could see she was becoming serious again lights flashed upon her face i felt a sudden wave of pity mingled with my love for her after all there were times when her anxiety must have been almost insupportable  eve dearest i whispered you must let me take you away from this you must you are too good and sweet ever to mix with these peopleto live this life  she half closed her eyes for a moment when she looked at me again she was laughing  youre a dear boy she said now help me out please we have arrived we found four stalls reserved for us near the front at the music hall and after settling a slight preliminary difficulty owing to mr moss reluctance to parting with his hat we sat down to enjoy the performance mr moss seemed a little disappointed too that his bright and snappy order for drinks to the powdered official who showed us to our places was not at once executed but otherwise he made himself very much at home  we had been there perhaps half an hour when i saw a sudden change in his demeanor which was almost at once reflected in the serious expression that had stolen into mr parkers benign countenance an old gentleman whitehaired with rubicund face and a jovial air had taken the seat next to them he had the appearance of having come from the country and of having spent a happy day in town even from where i sat i could see protruding from his breastpocket a brown leather pocketbook  i watched them as though fascinated the change in mr moss was amazing his reckless air of enjoyment had departed he was still smoking but he was all alert like a cat ready to spring mr parker too was interested i saw him whisper something in mr moss ear and i felt a cold foreboding of what was going to happen  im for a drink  mr moss declared in a rather loud tone come on guvnor  they both rose the old gentleman drew in his legs to let them pass though i watched with fixed eyes i was absolutely unable to follow their movements but when they had passed the old gentleman i could see from where i sat that his pocketbook was gone  did you see that i whispered to eve  she shook her head  the old gentlemans pocketbook i groaned theyve got it  eve for a moment sat quite still she too seemed nervous i was looking away again at the retreating figures of mr parker and mr moss suddenly my heart sank i saw the old gentleman spring to his feet and hurry after them and i saw too at the end of the line of stalls mr cullen and a companion standing waiting i rose quickly to my feet  im afraid theres going to be some trouble i said to eve let me go and see if i can help it looks as though the whole thing were a trap  i followed quickly it is only fair to mr cullen to say that he conducted the affair with great discretion and with every consideration for the feelings of the management he stopped mr parker and mr moss as they reached the end of the line of stalls  please come with me he said i have something to say to you outside  mr moss showed signs of an attempt to escape he stooped for a minute as though to run but a kick from mr parker induced him to alter his mind  wotcher want he asked belligerently  the old gentleman had now reached them redfaced and incoherent he addressed himself to mr cullen and i no longer had any doubt whatever that the affair was a plant of the detective  ive been robbed of my pocketbook he exclaimed one of these two has got itbrushed up against me just now on the way out of the stalls wheres the manager  only a few people in the immediate vicinity were conscious that anything at all unusual was happening the promenade just at that particular spot was almost deserted  this gentleman is certainly mistaken mr parker declared with dignity neither my friend nor myself knows anything about his pocketbook  i am sorry mr cullen said politely but i shall have to trouble you to come with me to bow street at onceand you too sir he added addressing the old gentleman i am a police officer and we will go into the matter there you will agree with me that it is well not to make a disturbance here i have two assistants with me  he indicated by a little gesture two men who had emerged from somewhere in the background  i will go with the utmost pleasure mr parker consented at the same time this gentleman has obviously been drinking and his charge is absurd  it was precisely at this moment that i felt something hard pressed against my hand with a dexterity that was nothing short of miraculous mr parker who apparently was standing with his hands in his pockets had suddenly forced one of them through some secret opening in his coat  in those few seconds it seemed to me i lived a year i had no time to thinkno time to realize that if i failed nothing could save my appearance at bow street on the following morning as a common pickpocket i gripped the pocketbook from his hand and without changing a muscle dropped it into the yawning overcoat pocket of the bucolic gentleman  the moment was over and passed mr parker with a movement forward had covered my proceedings i had been face to face with death years before but i had never felt quite the same thrill  this way gentlemen if you please mr cullen directed softly  you will not object to my accompanying you i asked  certainly not mr cullen replied i in fact am not sure that it would not be my duty to ask you to come  one moment i begged  mr cullen paused  the gentleman who made this charge i went on seems to me to be in a very uncertain condition might i suggest that before you commit yourself to taking these people to the police station you just make sure he really has been robbed of his pocketbook  had it here the old gentleman declared right in this pocket look for yourselfgone  the old gentleman scarcely seems to me i remarked to be in a fit condition to know which pocket it was in  mr cullen who had been walking carefully between him and the other two smiled in a superior way  please feel in all your pockets he told his accomplice  the old gentleman obeyed suddenly he stopped short a blank expression came into his face  what have you got there i asked  he brought it out with illconcealed reluctance it was without doubt the pocketbook i shall never forget mr cullens face he was bereft of words he stared at it as though he had seen it come up through the floor mr moss simply stood with his mouth open mr parker alone appeared unmoved by any emotion of surprise his manner was seriousalmost dignified  i want you to take this from me straight mr cullen he said i am not a man who loses his temper easily but youre trying us a bit high  mr cullen remained for a moment or two speechless he looked at me and drew a long breath i knew perfectly well what he was thinking he had had a man on either side of mr parker and mr moss the only person who could have transferred that pocketbook was myself i could see him readjusting his ideas as to my moral character  mr parkergentlemen he said removing his hat pray accept my apologies you are free to return to your seats whenever you choose this gentleman was evidently mistaken he added speaking with withering sarcasm and turning sharply toward his coadjutor you oughtnt to come to these places in your present condition sir take my advice and get along home at once  the bucolic gentleman who had completely lost his appearance of inebriety mumbled a few incoherent words and departed after his departure mr parker assumed a more genial attitude  well well i suppose you only did your duty sir he remarked with a resigned sigh we were on our way to the bar will you join us mr cullen  i did not hear the detectives reply but somehow or other we all drifted there mr moss at once found an easychair which he pronounced to be a bit of all right and in which he assumed an easy and elegant attitude mr parker mr cullen and i completed the circle which now included a professional gutterthief a disappointed detective mr parker and myself it was a unique moment in my life  the wine affected the spirits of no one except perhaps mr moss and him when we finally broke up our party we thought it advisable to get rid of in quick order to my surprise mr parker seemed in a particularly despondent frame of mind he needed pressing even to come to supper  you were quickwitted walmsley he admitted as we rolled away in the car quickwitted ill admit that but you were dead clumsy with your fingers i could see what you were doing from the back of my head  really i murmured well i suppose that sort of thing is a gift i only know that i hope i may never have to do it again  mr parker sighed  i fear he said that your troubles with us will soon be over eve has been telling me about that young idiot of an englishman who visited the bundercombes out in okata if there was one man whose name i thought i was safe to make use of it was joe bundercombe  it seems i admitted to have been an unfortunate choice what do you think of doing about it  mr parker apparently had no immediate answer ready for me during our brief ride in the motor and in the early stages of supper he was afflicted by a taciturnity that made him almost negligible as a companion and then suddenly a light broke over his face he had the appearance of a shipwrecked mariner who suddenly catches sight of land in the offing his lips were a little parted his boyish face all aglow  walmsley my dear fellow he exclaimed eve dear the problem is solved raise your glasses and drink with me heres farewell to mr joseph h parker and miss parker and a welcome to mr and miss bundercombe of okata  thats all very well i said but reggie will be on your track  mr parker beamed on eve and me  we shall see he declared didactically     chapter ixthe exposure  the next morning at twelve oclock i took a taxicab round to banton street the hall porter who was beginning to know me well seemed a little surprised at my appearance  is the young lady upstairs i asked  he was distinctly taken aback  mr parker and his daughter have gone he told me i stopped on my way to the stairs  gone i repeated  went off this morning he continued two taxicabs full of luggage  arent they coming back  no signs of it  did they leave any address  none  are you sure i persisted please ask at the office  the porter left me for a moment but returned shaking his head  mr parker said there would be no messages or letters and accordingly he left no address  i turned slowly away the hall porter followed me he was drawing something from his waistcoat pocket  i wouldnt do a thing he declared to get mr parker into any trouble for a nicer freerhanded gentleman never came inside the hotel but i dont know as theres much harm in showing you this being as youre a friend i picked it up in the sitting room after theyd gone  he held out a cablegram before i realized what i was doing i had read it it was handed in at new york  look out hsailed last saturday  pretty badly scared of hhe was the hall porter remarked ten minutes after that cablegram came they were hard at it packing  i gave the man a tip and drove back to my rooms where i spent a restless morning then lunched at my club and returned to the milan afterward only in the hope that i might find there a note or a message there was nothing however just as i was starting to go out the telephone bell rang i took up the receiver it was eves voice  is that mr walmsley  it is i admitted how are you eve  quite well thank you  still in london  certainly would you like to come and have tea with me  rather i replied enthusiastically where are you  hiding  thats all right i replied i shant give it away where shall i find you  well she said we talked it over and decided that the best hiding place was one of the larger hotels we are at the ritz  ill come right along if i may  very well she agreed ask for mr bundercombe  i groaned under my breath but i made no further comment and in a very few minutes i presented myself at the ritz hotel i was escorted upstairs and ushered into a very delightful suite on the second floor eve rose to meet me from behind a little teatable she was charmingly dressed and looking exceedingly well mr bundercombe on the other hand who was walking up and down the apartment with his hands behind his back was distinctly nervous he nodded at my entrance  how are you walmsley he said how are you  i am quite well sir thank you i replied a little stupefied  say im afraid we are making a great mistake here he went on anxiously weve slipped a point too near to the wind this time  if youll allow me to tell you exactly what i think i ventured frankly i think you have made a mistake theres that matter of reggie sidley he was worrying me all yesterday morning to find out where you were and when i evaded the point he told me straight that he didnt believe you were the bundercombes at all he is always in and out of this place and if he sees your name on the registeror his mother lady enterdean sees itit seems to me its about all up  a piece of bravado i must admit mr parker muttereda piece of absolute bravado but theres the young woman whos responsible he added shaking his fist at eve i may have suggested our coming to your party as the bundercombes but it was eves idea that we put up this little piece of bluff now im all for paris he went on insinuatingly  at that precise moment i felt that there was nothing i wanted so much as to get eve away from the ritz and i fell in with the scheme  well all go i suggested i havent had a week in paris for a long time  eve handed me my tea  dont count me in she begged i never felt less inclined to move from anywhere if being eve bundercombe means living at the ritz i think id rather go on the life of an adventuress is after all just a little strenuous and i am tired of living on the thin edge of nothing  perhaps before you know where you are mr bundercombe remarked gloomily youll be living on the thin edge of a little less than nothing  there was a knock at the door we all looked at one another a magnificent person with powdered hair breeches and silk stockings presented himself  lord reginald sidley he announced  in walked reggie he was correctly attired for calling and he carried a most immaculate silk hat in his hand i fully expected to see him drop it on the floor but he did nothing of the sort he laid it upon a small table paused for one second to shake his fist at me and advanced toward eve with both hands outstretched  at last i have found you then he exclaimed miss bundercombe well i am glad to see you  hello reggie she answered sweetly what a time youve been looking us up  he was taken aback  well i like that he gasped andhow are you mr bundercombe  glad to see you mr bundercombe replied cheerlessly  the meeting had taken place and i seemed to be the only person in the room who was suffering from any sort of shock reggie was still holding one of eves hands and was almost incoherent  come i like that i like that he exclaimed a long time looking you up indeed why didnt you let me know you were here there hasnt been a line from you or from your father we couldnt believe it when we heard that you had been at the dinner the other evening i was never so disappointed in my life  i gripped mr bundercombe by the arm and led him firmly to one side  look here i said is your name bundercombe  it is he admitted gloomily  are you a millionaire i persisted  multi he groaned  then what the blazeswhat the  i stopped short once more the door was openedthis time without the formality of a knock if mr bundercombe had seemed anxious and depressed before it was obvious now that the worst had happened all the cheerful life seemed to have faded from his goodhumored face he had literally collapsed in his clothes even eve gave a little shriek  upon the threshold stood mr cullen and by his side a lady who might have been anywhere between fifty and sixty years old she was dressed in a particularly unattractive checked traveling suit with a little satchel suspended from a shiny black leather band round her waist she wore a small hat that was much too juvenile for her and from the back of it a blue veil which she had pushed on one side hung nearly to the floor her complexion was very yellow she had a square jaw and through her spectacles her eyes glittered in a most unpleasant fashion her greeting was scarcely conciliatory  so ive got you at last have i say this is a pretty chase youve led me do you know ive had to desert my post as president of the great amalgamated meeting of the free women of the west to come and look after you two do you know that three thousand women had to listen to a substitute last thursdayand after id spent two months getting my facts for them do you know that youre the laughingstock of okata  no one asked you to come mother eve remarked with a sigh  asked me to come indeed the newcomer retorted look at you both ive heard all about your doings this gentleman by my side has told me a few things ill talk to you presently young woman but say is there anywhere on the face of this earth such a miserable addleheaded lunatic as that man whom its my misfortune to call my husband  she shook her fist at mr bundercombe who seemed to have become still smaller then she looked at me and at reggie who was standing with his mouth wide open she fixed upon us as her audience  look at him she went on stretching out her hands theres a respectable american for you for thirty years he works as a man should for its what a mans made forand thanks to his wifes help and advice he prospers look at him i ask you a baby can see that he hasnt the brains of a chicken yet there he standsjoseph h bundercombe of bundercombes reapers with eight million dollars worth of stock to his name  i saw reggies eyes go up to the ceiling and i knew he was dividing eight million dollars by five an expression almost of reverence passed into his face as he achieved the result we none of us felt the slightest inclination to interrupt mrs bundercombes long skinny forefinger drew a little nearer to her victim then she coughedthe short dry cough of the professional speakerand continued  wouldnt you believe that was success enough for any reasonable mortal wouldnt you say that with a wife holding an honored and great position in the state and his daughter by his side hed settle down out there and live a respectable decent life not he first of all he wants to travel  what does he do then but take up what he calls a hobby he buys and gloats over every silly detective story that was ever written practises disguises and making himself up as he calls it takes lessons in conjuring haunts the police courts consorts with criminalsin short behaves like a great overgrown child in his own native city where the name of bundercombefrom the feminine standpointrealizes everything that stands for freedom and greatness the time came when it was necessary for me to put down my foot once and for all i called him to me  joseph henry bundercombe i saidthere must be an end to this there shall be he promised the next day he and eve my misguided stepdaughter were on their way to europe and i am credibly informed they cheated a commercial traveler at cards on the way to new york that i find him at liberty now it seems to me is entirely owing to the clemency and kindness of this gentleman who recognized my description at scotland yard and brought me here  say all im prepared to admit about that is that it was somehow fortunate mr bundercombe remarked with a sudden revival of his old self that it fell to my lot to have mr cullen investigate some of my small adventures  mr bundercombe said cullen severely i think you will do well to listen to your wife and to take her advice there are one or two of these little affairs you must remember that are not entirely closed yet  mr bundercombe sighed he adopted an attitude of resignation  well cullen he replied if my career of crime is really to come to an end i dont want to bear you any ill will well just take a stroll downstairs and talk about it  mrs bundercombe with a quick movement to the left blocked the way  that means a visit to the bar she declared i know you mr bundercombe youll stay right here and listen to a little more of what ive got to say who this gentleman may be i dont at present know she went on turning suddenly upon me but i am agreeable to listen to his name if any one has the manners to mention it  walmsley madam i told her quickly paul walmsley i have the honor to be engaged to marry your stepdaughter  mrs bundercombe looked at me in stony silence twice she opened her lips and i am quite sure that if words had come they would have been unkind ones twice apparently however her command of language seemed inadequate  so youre going to marry an englishman she said glaring at eve  i am going to marry mr walmsley mother eve agreed sweetly he has been such a kind friend to us during the last few daysand i rather fancy i shall like living on this side  dear me dear me i hadnt heard of this mr bundercombe remarked with interest you and i will go downstairs and have a little chat about it mr walmsley  he made another strategic movement toward the door which was promptly and effectually frustrated by his wife  no you dont mrs bundercombe prohibited ive a good deal more to say yet i havent been dragged over the ocean three thousand miles to have you all slip away directly i arrive a nice state of things indeed my husband joseph h bundercombe a suspect at scotland yard followed everywhere by detectives and my daughter  stepdaughter please eve interrupted  stepdaughter thentalking about marrying a man shes probably known about twentyfour hours and met at a bar or in a thieves kitchen or something of the sort if you must marry an englishman she continued with rising voice why dont you marry lord reginald sidley there his father is an earl anyway  his uncles one reggie put in gloomily jerking his head toward me old walmsleys all right  eve patted his hand  good boy she said you know i never encouraged youdid i reggie  encouraged me he protested i think on the whole you said the rudest things to me i ever heard in my lifefrom a girl anyway i imagine he added taking up his hat that its up to me to leave this little domestic gathering  ill see you out mr bundercombe declared with alacrity  mrs bundercombe with her eyes steadily fixed upon her husband stepped back until she blocked the doorway  my dear hannah  your dear nothing she interrupted ruthlessly  you just sit down by the side of your daughter there and let me tell you both what i think of you and what im going to do about it  i think i suggested a little taxi driveyour mother and father no doubt have a great deal to say to one another and you can receive your little lecture later  eve assented at once and mrs bundercombe for some reason or other only entered a faint protest against our departure it was about five oclock in the afternoon and the streets were crowded with every description of vehicle the sun was still warm there was a faint pink light in the sky a perfume of lilac in the air from the windowboxes and flowerbarrows i took eves fingers in mine and held them i think she knew that something in the nature of an inquisition was coming for she sat very demure her eyes fixed on the road ahead  eve i asked how about mrs samuelsons jewels  they were returned to her from a repentant criminal eve murmured  and the forged banknotes made by the young man in the adelphi  they were all destroyed as fast as father could buy them she explained he has found the boy a post now with some printer in america  and the two thousand pounds at the gaming clubthat first night  daddy made it three and sent it to a hospital he thought it would do them more good  you know youre a shocking pair i said severely  paul she sighed you never can know how dull it was at okata  im jolly glad it was i told her it gives me a better chancedoesnt it  and well give daddy a good time whenever we can she pleaded  always i promised hes one of the best  hes so clever too  clever without a doubt i admitted only i think perhaps we might get him to use his talents in a more orthodox way by the by i added putting my head out of the window i think its getting a little chilly  i ordered the taxi closed and we returned to the hotel the hall porter drew me on one side confidentially  mr bundercombe and the other gentleman sir he announced are waiting for you in the bar     chapter xa broken partnership  by what certainly seemed to be at the time a stroke of evil fortune i invited mrs bundercombe and eve to lunch with me at princes restaurant a few days after our return from the country mrs bundercombe was graciously pleased to accept my invitation but she did not think it necessary to alter in any way her usual style of dress for the occasion  we sailed into princes thereforeeve charming in a lemoncolored foulard dress and a black toque mrs bundercombe in an okata dressmakers conception of a tailormade gown in some hard steelray material and a hat whose imperfections were perhaps mercifully hidden by a veil which instead of providing a really reasonable excuse for its existence by concealing some portion of mrs bundercombes features streamed down behind her nearly to her feet  the ma√Ætre dh√¥tel who welcomed me and showed to our table found his little flow of small talk arrested by that first glimpse of our companion he accepted my orders in a chastened manner and i noticed his eyes straying every now and then as though in fearsome fascination to mrs bundercombe who was sitting very upright at the table with her bony fingers stretched out and a good deal of gold showing in her teeth as she talked with eve in a high nasal voice concerning the absurd food invariably offered in english restaurants  then suddenly her flow of language ceasedthe bombshell fell mrs bundercombes face became unlike anything i have ever seen or dreamed of even eves eyes were round and her expression dubious i turned my head  some three tables away mr bundercombe was lunching with a young ladya stranger to us all she was not only a stranger to us all but though she was remarkably good looking there were indications that she scarcely belonged to our world  all three of us remained silent for a moment then i coughed and took up the wine list  what should you like to drink mrs bundercombe i asked in attempted unconcern  mrs bundercombe adjusted her spectacles severely and transferred her regard to me i felt somehow as though i were back at school and had been discovered in some ignominious escapade  you are aware paul she replied that i drink nothing save a glass of hot water after my meal the subject of drink does not interest me i appeal to you now as a future member of the family fetch mr bundercombe here  i shook my head  mrs bundercombe i said leaning over the table your husband during his stay in london plunged freely into the bohemian life of our city i will answer for it that he did so simply in pursuance of that hobby of which we all know i am convinced  paul mrs bundercombe interrupted her voice if possible a little more nasal even than usual will you fetch mr bundercombe here or must i rise from my seat in a public place and remove him myself fromfrom that hussy  i appealed to eve  eve i begged please reason with your stepmother there are certain situations in life that can be faced in one way only mrs bundercombe will no doubt have a few words to say to her husband on his return let her keep them until then  paul is right eve declared do take our advice she continued turning to her stepmother let us eat our luncheon quite calmly i am perfectly certain dad will have some very good reason to give for his presence here with that young lady  mrs bundercombe rose to her feet i hastened to follow her example we stood confronting one another  it is either you or i paul she insisted  then it had better be myself i groaned  i deposited my napkin on the table and made my way toward mr bundercombe i smiled pleasantly at him and bowed apologetically toward his companion  sorry i said under my breath but i am afraid mrs bundercombe means to make trouble  mr bundercombe looked at me with a gloriously blank expression his manner was not without dignity  i regret to hear he replied that any person by the name of mrs bundercombe is looking for trouble i scarcely see however how i am concerned in the matter you have the advantage of me sir  i stared at him and stooped a little lower  shes tearing mad i whispered you dont want a scene couldnt you make an excuse and slip away  mr bundercombe frowned at me he glanced at the young lady as though seeking for some explanation  is this young gentleman known to you miss blanche he inquired  she set down her glass and shook her head  never saw him before in my life she declared whats worrying him  hitherto mr bundercombe said my somewhat unusual personal appearance has kept me from an adventure of this sort but i clearly understand that i am now being mistaken for some one else your references to a mrs bundercombe sir are greek to me my name is parkermr joseph h parker  do you mean to keep this up i protested  mr bundercombe beckoned to the ma√Ætre dh√¥tel who came hastily to his side  do you know this gentleman he asked  the ma√Ætre dh√¥tel bowed  certainly sir he answered with a questioning glance toward me this is mr walmsley  then will you take mr walmsley back to his place mr bundercombe begged he persists in mistaking me for some one else i am not complaining mind he added affably no complaint whatever i am quite sure the young gentleman is genuinely mistaken and does not mean to be in any way offensive only my digestion is not what it should be and these little contretemps in the middle of luncheon are disturbing run away sir please he concluded waving his hand toward me  the ma√Ætre dh√¥tel looked at me and i looked at the ma√Ætre dh√¥tel then i glanced at mr bundercombe who remained quite unruffled finally i bowed slightly toward the young lady and returned to my place  well mrs bundercombe snapped  it seems i said that we were mistaken that isnt mr bundercombe at all  mrs bundercombes face was a study  is this a jest she demanded severely  i wish it were i replied anyhow mrs bundercombe you must really excuse me but there is nothing more i can do the gentleman whom i addressed insisted upon it that his name was mr joseph h parker no doubt he was right these likenesses are sometimes very deceptive i added feebly  mrs bundercombe rose to her feet i made no effort to stop her in fact her action filled me with pleasurable anticipations she walked across to the table at which mr bundercombe was seated eve and i both turned in our places to watch  poor daddy eve murmured under her breath why couldnt he have chosen a smaller restaurant he is going to catch it now  i think ill back your father i observed he is quite at his best this morning  the exact words that passed between mr bundercombe and his wife we alas never knew she turned her left shoulder pointedly toward the young woman whom she had designated as a hussy and talked steadily for about a minute and a half at mr bundercombe the history of what followed was reflected in that gentlemans expressive face he appeared to listen at first in amazement afterward in annoyance and finally in downright anger when at last he spoke we heard the words distinctly  madam he said i dont know who you are and i object to being addressed in a public place by ladies who are strangers to me be so good as to return to your seat you are mistaking me for some one else my name is joseph h parker  for a lady who had won renown upon the platform as a debater mrs bundercombe seemed afflicted with considerable difficulty in framing a suitable reply and while she was still a little incoherent mr bundercombe softly summoned the ma√Ætre dh√¥tel it may have been my fancy but i certainly thought i saw a sovereign slipped into the hand of the latter  charles mr bundercombe confided my luncheon is being spoiled by people who mistake me for a gentleman who i believe does bear a singular resemblance to me my name is parker this lady insists upon addressing me as mr bundercombe i do not wish to make a disturbance but i insist upon it that you conduct this lady to her place and see that i am not disturbed any more  the ma√Ætre dh√¥tels attitude was unmistakable within the course of a few seconds mrs bundercombe was restored to us i thought it best to ignore the whole matter and plunged at once into a discussion of gastronomic matters i have ordered i began some maryland chicken  then you can eat it mrs bundercombe snapped not a mouthful of food do i take in this place with that painted hussy sitting by josephs side a few feet away oh ill fix him when i get him home  she drew a little breath between her teeth but she was as good as her word she refused all food and sat with her arms folded glaring across at mr bundercombes table my admiration for that man of genius was never greater than on that day so far from hurrying over his luncheon he seemed inclined to prolong it  there was no lack of conversation between him and his companion they even lingered over their coffee and they were still at the table when eve and i had finished and mrs bundercombe was sipping the hot water the only thing that passed her lips during the entire meal i paid the bill and rose mrs bundercombe after a moments hesitation followed us  eve and i thought of going into the academy for a few minutes i said tentatively as we reached the entrance hall  mrs bundercombe plumped herself down on a highbacked chair within a yard of the door  i she announced shall wait here for joseph  i realized the futility of any attempt to dissuade her so we left her there spent an hour at the academy and did a little shopping on our way back an idea occurred to me we reentered the restaurant mrs bundercombe was still sitting there in a corner of the hall  thinks he can tire me out perhaps she remarked in an explanatory manner well he just cantthats all  i moved a few steps farther in and glanced down the restaurant then i returned  but my dear mrs bundercombe i said your husband has gone long ago he went out the other way i am not surebut i believe we saw him in bond street quite three quarters of an hour ago  there is another way out mrs bundercombe asked hastily  certainly there is i told her into jermyn street  why was i not told she demanded rising unwillingly to her feet  really i assured her i didnt think of it  she followed us out we all walked down piccadilly  will you please she said direct me to a teashop  i pointed one out to her she left us without a word of farewell eve and i turned down into the haymarket  nice example your parents are setting us i remarked  eve sighed  i wish i knew what dad was up to she murmured  at that moment we met him he came strolling along his silk hat a little on the back of his head a cigar in his mouth his hands grasping his cane behind his back bundercombe or parker i inquired as we came to a standstill on the pavement  he grinned  nasty business that he remarked cheerfully why dont you keep to the ritz or the berkeley anyway he added his tone changing im glad i met you paul i want your help in a little matter  i shook my head  quite out of the question i declared emphatically  dont forget that paul is an mp dad eve said severely you mustnt attempt to bring him into any of your little affairs  on this occasion mr bundercombe expostulated i am on the side of the law mr cullen whom i am probably going to see presently will be my brotherinarms  what do you need me for then i asked  as to absolutely needing you perhaps i dont mr bundercombe admitted on the other hand its a very interesting little affair and one in which you could take a hand without compromising yourself  what about eve i inquired  not this time mr bundercombe replied the only risk there is about the affair he explained is that it is just possible there may be a bit of a scrap  whats the program i asked  tonight at home at ten oclock can you manage it  rather i answered if eve doesnt mind this is the night you promised to go with your mother to a lecture somewhere isnt it i reminded her  she nodded  very well she consented resignedly so long as you dont let him get hurt dad  no fear of that mr bundercombe declared cheerfully if they go for any one theyll go for me so long young people at ten oclock paul  at precisely the hour agreed upon that evening i presented myself at mr bundercombes house in princes gardens i noticed that the manner of the servant who admitted me was subdued and there was a peculiar gloom about the place very few lights were lit and the farther portion of the house of which one could catch a glimpse from the little circular hall seemed entirely deserted i was shown at once into mr bundercombes study upon the ground floor mr bundercombe was seated at a writing table with his face toward the door he greeted me with a friendly nod and pointed to a little table upon which stood an abundant display of cigars and cigarettes of all brands  i helped myself and lit a cigarette  may i know something of this evenings program i asked  spoil the whole show mr bundercombe objected earnestly just play the part of assistant audience and stick this into your pocket will you  he threw toward me a very small revolver that he had produced from a drawer  only the last three chambers are loaded he remarked youll have to click three times if you do use it i dont think youll need to though take a stall and watch the fun ill tell you only this you remember bone stanley as he was called in those daysthe man who was sent to prison for fifteen years for bank robbery and for shooting the manager down hammersmith way it was the fellow was an american  i remember it quite well i assented he was tried for murder and convicted of manslaughter  mr bundercombe nodded  he was released this afternoon hell be here in a few minutes  here i exclaimed  mr bundercombe nodded but did not offer any further explanation coupled with a certain gravity of expression he had the appearance of a schoolboy for whom a feast was being set out quite a pleasant little evening we are going to have he promised you wait  i frowned a little uneasily  you are quite sure youre not letting me in for  mr bundercombe plunged into the middle of my little protest  youre all right paul he assured me cullens in the house at the present moment and there are two other detectives with him they are letting me run this thing simply because i know more about it than they do and for certain reasons im not giving my whole hand away dont you worry paul youll be all right this time listen  we heard a very feeble ring at the bell mr bundercombe nodded  thats stanley he whispered sit down  a man was shown into the room a moment later i leaned forward in my chair so as to see more distinctly the hero of one of the most famous cases that had ever been tried in a criminal court of his renowned good looks there was little left he stood there still tall with high cheekbones furtive eyes and long mouth he wore good clothes his linen was irreproachable and he kept his gloves on nevertheless the stamp of the prison was upon him  mr stanley mr bundercombe said good i am glad you were prevailed upon to come  i am still wholly in the dark as to what this means the newcomer remarked  ill tell you in a very few sentences mr bundercombe promised will you sit down  i prefer to stand stanley replied until i know exactly in whose house i am and what your interest in me is  very well mr bundercombe agreed here is my history my name is joseph h bundercombe i am an american manufacturer i have made a fortune in manufacturing bundercombes reaping machines you may call it a hobby if you like but i have always been interested in criminals and criminal methodsnot the lowest type but men who have pitted their brains against others and robbed them  as soon as i arrived in this country i found an interest in inquiring into the identities of american criminals imprisoned over here with a view to helping any deserving cases your name came before me i studied your case i became interested in it i learned that your time was almost up a chance inquiry revealed to me a state of things that i determined to bring before your knowledge  you sent me a telegram mr stanley interrupted as i was stepping on the steamer at southampton i have returned to london for your explanation  you will probably mr bundercombe remarked genially be thankful all your life that you did now listen  who is this person mr stanley asked indicating me he is my prospective soninlaw mr paul walmsley mr bundercombe explained a member of parliament i have asked him to be present because i may need a little support and also because it may help to convince you that i am in earnest  twenty years ago mr stanley you came to the conclusion that honest methods were of little use to any one seeking to make a large fortune you joined with two other men richard densmore and philip harding in a series of semicriminal conspiracies  you pooled all your moneyyou had the most and you determined that if you could not make a living honestly you would rob those with less brains than yourself when half your capital was gone this hammersmith bank robbery was planned and took place you were the only one caught and you held your tongue like a man but all the same you were used as a cats paw  in what way stanley asked softly  you all three had revolvers you all three arranged that they should be uncharged cartridges were put into yours without your knowledge you held up your revolver and pressed the trigger believing it to be empty the others knew better you shot the bank manager and in the stupefaction that followed you became an easy captive the others escaped  stanley moved a little on his feet his lips were slightly parted his eyes fixed upon mr bundercombe  what story is this you are telling me he muttered  a true one mr bundercombe continued  now listen the total amount in possession of your two confederates when you went into prison was under a thousand pounds you heard from them periodically as struggling paupers harding met you out of prison he was almost in rags they were at the end of their resources he told you he gave you a hundred pounds to procure which he assured you with tears in his eyes they had almost beggared themselves it was to enable you to leave the country and make a fresh start  you were even grateful you shook him by the hand you left him at the hotel at southampton only an hour before you got my telegram  what of it stanley asked  nothing except this mr bundercombe concluded your two partners were so scared at the result of the hammersmith affair and at your sentence that they turned over a new leaf they went into business as outside stockbrokerswith your capital the agreement as to a third profits was still in force they had what i can describe only as the devils own luck i should say their total capital today is at least fifty thousand pounds  the time came for you to be released they had no idea of parting with a third of their money and taking you into the business all the time they had deceived you they continued the deception harding met you as a poor man but for me you would have been on your way to south africa by this time with a hundred pounds in your pocket  is what you are telling me the truth stanley demanded  absolutely mr bundercombe declared i stumbled across the truth in making inquiries concerning you and your probable future i had meant as a matter of fact to put up a little money of my own to give you a fresh start in the course of these inquiries i happened to run across a young woman who had been a typist in hardings office it was from her i learned the truth as he rose in the world harding seems to have treated the girl badly a little kindness and a little attention on my part and i learned the truth she placed me in possession of the whole story after we had lunched together today  stanley at last took the chair he had so long refused he sat with his arms folded  and i kept my mouth closed he muttered it was their job i would no more have pulled the trigger of my revolver than i would have shot myself if i had known it was they who put the cartridges there  he sat for a moment quite still mr bundercombe rang the bell  the gentlemen i am expecting he said will be here in a moment you can show them in directly they arrive  the man bowed and withdrew mr bundercombe turned to his visitor  i have made the acquaintance he continued of these two men your late partnerssought them out and made it purposely they are coming here to see me tonight they fancy that it is just a friendly call they know that i have money to invest i have even made use of them employed them to buy for me bonds of my own choosing they think it is an affair of a little business chat perhaps and a restaurant supper pull yourself together stanley go into that corner behind the curtain wait your time  stanley rose slowly to his feet his face was drawn as though with pain  it isnt so much the money he muttered only i thoughti fancied they would have been there to meet me to shake me by the hand to stay with me and they wanted to push me off out of the country  he opened his lips a little wider and swore softly but vindictively then the bell rang mr bundercombe hastened to push him out of sight we heard the sound of strange voices in the hall when the door was opened it was obvious that the whole house was lit up from somewhere in the distance came the soft music of a piano  mr harding and mr densmore were announced i looked at them curiously they were both most correctly dressed in evening clothes they both had somehow the hard expression of worldly men tempered not altogether pleasantly by symptoms of good living they greeted mr bundercombe with bluff heartiness he gave them each a hand  now my friends he said welcome to my house paul he added turning to me let me introduce my two friends mr harding and mr densmoremr paul walmsley mr walmsley has just been returned for the western division of bedfordshire  they greeted me with more than affability mr harding assured me he had read my speeches mr densmore thought no one was more to be envied than a man who had the gifts that secured for him a seat in parliament  its early yet mr bundercombe declared genially lets sit down tell me a little about english business it interests me you bought those chilean bonds all right i see they are up an eighth tonight  a good purchase mr bundercombe mr harding assured him a very good purchase after all though theres not much money to be made out of those government things now weve a little affair of our ownwhat do you say densmore he broke off looking toward his partner we could afford to let mr bundercombe come in a little way with us i think  mr densmore nodded  not more than five he said warningly remember what you promised the rothschild people  mr harding nodded and crossed his knees he lit a cigar from the box mr bundercombe passed round  this sounds interesting the latter remarked i dare say mr walmsley too has a little spare money for investment  mr densmore sighed though his eyes were brightening  its too good a thing he explained confidentially to let the world into between ourselves theres a fortune in it and we want to keep it among our friends  he drew a dummy prospectus from his vest pocket and began a longwinded recital of some figures in which i was not particularly interested mr bundercombe however appeared to be greatly impressed by what he heard  gentlemen he said theres just one little thing american business methods and english are different in one respect in my country weve got a sort of official guide that tells us exactly whom we are dealing with and what their means are now i know you are good fellows and it seems to me ill be glad to go into this little affair with you but we are strangers financially arent we now if you were americans i should say to you whats your rating and youd tell me because youd know that i could look it up in a business guide in ten minutes  perfectly sound mr harding admittedperfectly neither my partner nor i have anything to conceal last christmas we were worth just over sixty thousand pounds and since then weve made a bit  youve no other partner mr bundercombe inquired  certainly not mr harding replied  then what about our friend stanley mr bundercombe asked quietly  almost as he spoke stanley walked into the middle of the little group i have never in the whole course of my life seen two men so thoroughly and entirely amazed mr harding dropped his cigar on the carpet where he let it remain they stared at stanley as though they were looking upon a ghost both men seemed somehow to have lost their confident bearing seemed to have shrunken into smaller less assertive meaner beings  sixty thousand pounds mr bundercombe went ononethird of which belongs to stanley here  absurd harding faltered  nothingnothing of the sort densmore declared  mr bundercombe very carefully lit another cigar then he rang the bell harding rose to his feet he was not looking in the least like the sleek opulent gentleman who had entered the room a few minutes before  whats that for he demanded pointing to the bell  the door was already opened mr bundercombe indicated the young lady who stood upon the thresholdthe lady with whom he had been lunching that day at princes  i only wished to have the pleasure mr bundercombe explained of presenting you two gentlemenmr harding especiallyto this young lady  blanche mr harding exclaimed  mr densmore muttered something under his breath  my dear miss blanche said mr bundercombe moving toward the door i will not ask you to stay as our interview is scarcely perhaps a pleasant one i simply wished you to show yourself so that mr harding and his friend might understand how useless certain denials on their part would be my servant will now place you in a taxi and if you will do me the honor of calling here at eleven oclock tomorrow morning i think i can promise you a satisfactory termination to this little affair  the girl patted him on the shoulder  thats all right bundy she declared i hope youll take me out to lunch again as for him she added her eyebrows coming together and looking toward harding perhaps hell understand now how well it pays to be a liar  she turned round and left the room amid a stricken silence mr bundercombe came back to his place  gentlemen he said i will be brief with you it has given me the utmost pleasure to arrange this little meeting on behalf of my friend mr stanley in the room on the other side of the passage is waiting my lawyer who will draw up a renewal of your partnership deed with mr stanley upon terms that we can discuss amicably in the room behind this is waiting a particular friend of minemr cullen a detective  remember mr bundercombe added his voice suddenly very stern and threatening that through all the years that manyour rightful partner has been in prison through all the agony of his trial the humiliation of his sentence the name of neither one of you has passed his lips is it your wish that the truth shall now be told  they shrank back harding was pale to the lips densmore was shivering  very well gentlemen mr bundercombe concluded if i send for the lawyer mr cullen can go if you choose mr cullen the lawyer can go  mr harding moistened his lips with his tongue we will make an arrangement he said we have been wrong now that i see you here stanley he continued looking up with the first show of courage either of them had exhibited i am ashamed it was a dirty trick forget it after you were lagged we decided to turn over a new leaf and be honest weve been honestinside the law at any rateand weve made money come and take your share of it and forgive  we were brutes densmore agreed  they were both bending over stanley somehow or other his hands stole out to them mr bundercombe and i strolled outside  you might tell mr cullen that we shall not require him this evening mr bundercombe instructed the butler bring a bottle of champagne and tell the gentleman from wymans  wymans and his clerk that we shall be ready for them in ten minutes     chapter ximr bundercombes wink  i scarcely recognized mr cullen when he first accosted me in the courtyard of the milan at no time of distinguished appearance a certain carelessness of dress and gait had brought him now almost on a level with the loafer in the street his clothes needed brushing he was unshaved and he looked altogether very much in need of a bath and a new outfit  may i have a word with you mr walmsley he asked standing in the middle of the pavement in front of me and blocking my progress toward the strand  i hesitated for a moment his identity was only just then beginning to dawn upon me  mr cullen i exclaimed  at your service sir  i turned round and led the way back into the court  this is not a professional visit i trust i said as we passed into the smoke room  not entirely sir mr cullen admitted at the same time he paused and looked out the window steadily for a moment as though in search of inspiration  i trust i began hastily that mr bundercombe has not  precisely about him sir that i came to see you mr cullen interrupted i am bound to admit that a few weeks ago there was no man in the world i would have laid my hands on so readily that day at the ritz however changed my views completely i feel he added with a dry smile that i got more than level with mr bundercombe when i sent for his wife  so it was you who sent the cables that brought her over i remarked  but please remember sir he begged apologetically that i had never seen the lady i sent the cables confidently anticipating that she would disclaim all knowledge of mr bundercombe when she arrived and i realized that she was actually his wife i forgave him freely for all the small annoyances he had caused me my visit to you this morning in fact is entirely in his interests  what has mr bundercombe been up to now i asked nervously  nothing seriousat any rate that i know of mr cullen assured me for the last fortnightever since mrs bundercombes arrival in fact mr bundercombe has somehow or other managed to keep away from all his old associates and out of any sort of mischief last night however i was out on dutyi havent had time to go home and change my clothes yetin a pretty bad part shadowing one of the most dangerous swell mobsmen in europea man you may have heard of sir he is commonly known as dagger rodwell  i hastily disclaimed any acquaintance with the person in question  tell me though i begged what this has to do with mr bundercombe  just this mr cullen explained i ran my man to ground in a place where i wouldnt be seen except professionallyand with him was mr bundercombe  they were not engaged i asked quickly in any lawbreaking escapade at the time i trust  mr cullen shook his head reassuringly  rodwell only goes in for the very big coups he said two or three in a lifetime if he brought them off would be enough for him all the same theres something planning now and hes fairly got hold of mr bundercombe hes a smoothtongued rascalabsolutely a gentleman to look at and speak to what i want you to do sir if youre sufficiently interested is to take mr bundercombe away for a time  interested i groaned hell be my fatherinlaw in a couple of months  then if you want him to attend the ceremony sir mr cullen advised earnestly youll get him out of london hes restless you may have noticed that yourself hes spoiling for an adventure and dagger rodwell is just the man to make use of him and then leave him high and drythe booby for us to save our bacon with i dont wish any harm to mr bundercombe sirand thats straight until the day i met mrs bundercombe at liverpool i am free to confess that i was feeling sore against him today thats all wiped out we had a pleasant little time at the ritz that afternoon and my opinion of the gentleman is that hes the right sort im here to give you the office sir to get him away from londonand get him away quick i may know a trifle more than ive told you or i may not but youll take my advice if you want to escape trouble  ill do what i can i assured him a little blankly to tell you the truth i have been fearing something of this sort during the last few days especially his daughter tells me he has been making all sorts of excuses to get away ill do what i canand many thanks mr cullen let me offer you something  mr cullen declined anything except a cigar and went on his way i called a taxi and drove round to the very delightful house the bundercombes had taken in princes gardens i caught mr bundercombe on the threshold he would have hurried off but i laid a detaining hand on his arm  come back with me if you please i begged i have some news i need to consult you all  mr bundercombe glanced at his watch his manner was a little furtive he was not dressed as usualin frock coat white waistcoat and silk hat a costume that seemed to render more noticeable his great girth and smooth pinkandwhite facebut in a blue serge doublebreasted suit a bowler hat and a style of neckgear a little reminiscent of the bowery something in his very appearance seemed to me a confirmation of mr cullens warning he looked at his watch and muttered something about an appointment  i promise not to keep you more than a very few minutes i assured him come along  i kept my arm on his and led him back into the house  eve is in the morning room he whispered lets go in quietly and perhaps we shant be heard  we crossed the hall on tiptoe in the manner of conspirators before we could enter the room however our progress was arrested by a somewhat metallic cough mrs bundercombe in a gray tweed coat and skirt of homely design a black hat and black gloves with a satchel in her hand from which were protruding various forms of pamphlet literature appeared suddenly on the threshold of the room she had insisted upon having allotted for her private use and which she was pleased to call her study  mr bundercombe she exclaimed portentously taking no notice whatever of me  my dear he replied  may i ask the meaning of your leaving the house like a truant schoolboy at this hour of the morning and in such garb demanded mrs bundercombe eying him severely through her pincenez is your memory failing you joseph henry did you or did you not arrange to accompany me this morning to a meeting at the offices of the womens social federation  i fear ieri had forgotten the matter mr bundercombe stammered an affair of businessi was rung up on the telephone  mrs bundercombe stared at him she said nothing expression was sufficient she turned to me  eve is in the morning room mr walmsley she said i presume your visit at this hour of the morning was intended for her  precisely i admitted i will go in and see her  i opened the door and mr bundercombe rather precipitately preceded me if he had contemplated escape however he was doomed to disappointment mrs bundercombe followed us in she reminded us of her presence by a hard cough as eve saluted me in a somewhat lighthearted fashion  mind theres mother eve whispered with a little grimace tell me why you have come so early paul are you going to take me out motoring all day or are you going to the dressmakers with me i really ought to have a chaperon of some sort you know and mother is much too busy making friends with the leaders of the cause over here  she made a face at me from behind a vase of flowers mrs bundercombe apparently thought it well to explain her position  i find it she said absolutely incumbent upon me while on a visit to this metropolis to cultivate the acquaintance of the women of this country who are in sympathy with the great movement in the states with which i am associated it is expected of me that i should make my presence over here known  naturally i agreed naturally mrs bundercombe i see by the papers that you were speaking at a meeting last night that reminds me i went on that i really did come down this morning on rather an important matter and perhaps it is as well that you are all here as i should like your advice i have received an invitation to stand for the division of the county in which i live  they all looked puzzled  to stand for parliament i mean i hastily explained to them it seems really rather a good opportunityas of course i am fairly well known in the district and the majority against us was only seventy or eighty at the last election  say thats interesting mr bundercombe declared putting down his hat i didnt know you were by way of being a professional man though  im not i replied you wouldnt call politics a profession exactly  mr bundercombe was more puzzled than ever his hand caressed his chin in familiar fashion  well its one way of making a living isnt it he asked we call it a profession on our side  it isnt a way of making a living at all i assured him it costs one a great deal more than can be made out of it  mr bundercombe stopped scratching his chin  mrs bundercombe sat down opposite me and i was perfectly certain that she would presently have a few remarks to offer eve was looking delightfully interested  say im not quite sure i follow you mr bundercombe observed i am with you all right when you say that the direct pecuniary payment for being in parliament doesnt amount to anything but whats your pull worth eh  my what i inquired  dash it all mr bundercombe continued a little testily i only want to get at the common sense of the matter you are thinking of trying for a seat in parliament and you say the four hundred a year you get for it is nothing well of course its nothing what i want to know is just what you get out of it indirectly you get the handling of so much patronage i suppose what is it worth to you and how much is there  i spent the next five minutes in an eloquent attempt to explain the difference between english and american politics mr bundercombe was partly convinced but more than ever sure that he had found his way into a country of halfwitted people eve however was much quicker at grasping the situation  i think its perfectly delightful paul she declared i have read no end of stories of english electioneering and they sound such fun i want to come down and help i have tons of new dressesand i can read up all about politics going down on the train  that brings me i went on to the real object of my visit i want you and your fatheri want you all i added heroicallyto come down with me to bedfordshire and help you were coming anyway next week for a little time you know i want to carry you off at once  mrs bundercombe who had been only waiting for her opportunity broke in at this juncture  young man she said impressively mr walmsley before i consent to attend one of your meetings or to associate myself in any way with your cause i must ask you one plain and simple question and insist upon a plain and simple answer what are your views as to woman suffrage  the views of my party i answered with futile diplomacy  enunciate as briefly as possible but clearly what the views of your party are mrs bundercombe bade me  i wont have him heckled eve protested coming over to my side  i coughed  we are entirely in sympathy i explained with the enfranchisement of women up to a certain point we think that unmarried women who own property and pay taxes should have the vote  rubbish mrs bundercombe exclaimed firmly we want universal suffrage we want men and women placed on exactly the same footing politically and socially  that i said i am afraid no political party would be prepared to grant at present  then save as an opponent i can attend no political meetings in this country mrs bundercombe declared rising to her feet with a fearsome air of finality  i sighed  in that case i confessed i am afraid it is useless for me to appeal to you for help perhaps you and your father i added turning to eve  let them go down to you in the country by all means mrs bundercombe interrupted for my part though my visit to europe was wholly undesired was forced upon me in fact by dire circumstances she added emphatically glaring at mr bundercombesince i am here i find so much work ready to my hand so much appalling ignorance so much prejudice that i conceive it to be my duty to take up during my stay the work which presents itself here i accordingly shall not leave london  mr bundercombe cheered up perceptibly at these words  i am rather busy myself he said but perhaps a day or two  i thrust my arm through his  i rely upon you to help me canvass i told him a lot is done by personal persuasion  canvass mr bundercombe repeated reflectively say just what do you mean by that  it is very simple i assured him you go and talk to the farmers and voters generally and put a few plain issues before themwell post you up all right as to what to say then you wind up by asking for their votes and interest on my behalf  i do thatdo i mr bundercombe murmured talk to them in a plain straightforward way eh  thats it i agreed a man with sound common sense like yourself could do me a lot of good  mr bundercombe was thoughtful i am convinced that at that moment the germs of certain ideas which bore fruit a little later on were born in his mind i saw him blink several times as he gazed up at the ceiling i saw a faint smile gradually expand over his face a premonition of trouble even at that moment forced itself on me  youll have to be careful you know i explained a little apprehensively youll have to keep friends with the fellows all the time they wouldnt appreciate practical jokes down there and the law as to bribery and corruption is very strict  mr bundercombe nodded solemnly  if i take the job on he said you can trust me it seems as though there might be something in it  youll come down with me then i begged both of you come this afternoon the dressmakers can follow you eve it isnt faran hour in the train and twenty minutes in the motor we may have to picnic a little just to start with but i know that the most important of the servants are there ready and waiting  pray do not let me stand in your way mrs bundercombe declared rising my time will be fully occupied i wish you good morning mr walmsley i have an appointment at a quarter to twelve you can let me know your final decision at luncheontime  she left the room mr bundercombe eve and i exchanged glances  how far away did you say your place was paul mr bundercombe asked  right in the country i told himtakes you about an hour and a half to get there  i think well come mr bundercombe decided looking absently out the window and watching his wife eloquently admonish a taxicab driver who had driven up with a cigarette in his mouth yes im all for it  my little party at walmsley hall was in most respects a complete success my sister was able to come and play hostess and eve was charmed with my house and its surroundings mr bundercombe however was a source of some little anxiety on the first morning when we were all preparing to go out he drew me on one side  paul he saidhe had with some difficulty got into the way of calling me by my christian name occasionally i want to get wise to this thing where does your political boss hang out  we havent such a person i told him  he seemed troubled the more he inquired into our electioneering habits the less he seemed to understand them  whats your platform anyway he asked  i handed him a copy of my election address which he read carefully through with a large cigar in the corner of his mouth he handed it back to me with a somewhat depressed air  seems to kind of lack grit he remarked a little doubtfully why dont you go for the other side a bit more  look here i suggested mindful that eve was waiting for me you run down and have a chat with my agent youll find him just opposite the town hall in bildborough theres a car going down now  im on he agreed anyway i must get to understand this business  he departed presently and returned to luncheon with a distinctly crestfallen air he beckoned me mysteriously into the library and laid his hand upon my shoulder in friendly fashion  look here paul he said is it too late to change your ticket  change my what i asked him  change your platformor whatever you call it youre on the wrong horse paul my boy even your own agent admits itthough i never mentioned your name at first or told him who i was all the people round here with votes are farmers agricultural laborers and small shopkeepers your platforms of no use to them  well thats what weve got to find out i protested personally i am convinced that it is  now look here mr bundercombe argued these chaps though they seem stupid enough are all out for themselves they want to vote for whats going to make life easier for them whats the good of sticking it into em about the empire between you and me i dont think they care a fig for it then all this talk about military servicegee they aint big enough for it disestablishment toowhat do they care about that you let me write your address for you promise em a land bill promise them the food on their tables at a bit less stick something in about a reduction in the price of beer ive seen the other chaps address and its a corker mostly lies but thundering good ones you let me touch yours up a bit  where have you been i asked a strange misgiving stealing into my mind have you been talking to mr ansell like this  ansell no whos he mr bundercombe inquired  my agent  mr bundercombe shook his head  chap i palled up with was called harrison  i groaned  youve been to the other fellows agent i told him the agent for the radical candidate  mr bundercombe whistled  you dont say he murmured well ill tell you what it is paul there are no flies on that chap hes a real nippy little workerthats what he is if you take my advice he went on persuasively youll swap well make it worth his while to come over ive seen your mr ansellif thats his name i saw the name on a brass plate and i saw him come out of his officestiff starched sort of chap with a thin face and gray side whiskers  thats the man i admitted he and his father before him and his grandfather have been solicitors to my people for i dont know how many years  he looked it mr bundercombe declared a withered old skunk if ever there was one you want a live man to see you through this paul you let me go down and sound harrison this afternoon no reason that i can see why we shouldnt use this fellows address too if we can make terms with him  look here i said politics over on this side dont admit of such violent changes my address is in the printers hands and ive got to stick to it and ansell will have to be my agent whatever happens it isnt all talk that wins these elections the walmsleys are well known in the county and weve done a bit for the country during the last hundred years this other fellowhorrocks his name ishas never been near the place before i grant you hes going to promise a lot of very interesting things but thats been going on just a little too long the people have had enough of that sort of thing i think youll find theyll put more trust in the little we can promise than in that rigmarole of harrisons  mr bundercombe shook his head doubtfully  well he sighed im only on the outside edge of this thing yet i must give it another morning  we had a pleasant luncheon party at which mr bundercombe was introduced to some of my supporters with whomas he usually did with every onehe soon made himself popular eve and i then made our first little effort at canvassing eves methods differed from her fathers  i am so sorry she said as she shook hands with a very influential but very doubtful voter of the farmer class but i dont know anything about english politics so i cant talk to you about it as id like to but you know i am going to marry mr walmsley and come to live here and it would be so nice to feel that all my friends had voted for him if you have a few minutes to spare mr brown would you please tell me just where you dont agree with paul i should so much like to hear because he tells me that if once you were on his side he would feel almost comfortable  mr brown who had always met my advances with a grim taciturnity that made conversation exceedingly difficult proceeded to dissertate upon one or two of the vexed questions of the day i ventured to put in a few words now and then and after a time he invited us in to tea when we left he was more gracious than i had ever known him to be  and you must vote for mr walmsley eve declared at the end of her little speech of thanks because i want so much to have you come and take tea with me on the terrace at the house of commonsand i cant unless paul is a member can i  bribery and corruption mr brown laughed however well see certainly i have been very much pleased to hear mr walmsleys views upon several matters when did you say the village meeting was mr walmsley  thursday night i replied  well ill come he promised  youll take the chair i begged nothing could do me more good than that and i feel sure if you look at things i was going to be very eloquent but eve interrupted me  let me sit next to you please she said looking up at him with her large unusually innocent eyes  oh wellif you like mr brown assented  we drove off down the avenue in complete silence when we had turned the corner eve gave a little sigh  paul she declared i dont think theres anything ive ever come across in my life thats half so much fun as electioneering please take me to the next most difficult  if eve was a success however mr bundercombe was to turn out a great disappointment he came home a little later for dinner looking very gloomy  paul he said as we met for a moment in the smoking room paul ive sad news for you  i am sorry to hear it i replied  ive looked into this little matter of politics he continued ive looked into it as thoroughly as i can and i cant support you youre on the wrong side my boy ive shaken hands with mr horrocks and thats the man wholl get the votes in this constituency ive promised to do what i can to help him  i was a little taken aback  youre not in earnest i exclaimed  dead earnest mr bundercombe regretted  the chaps convinced me i feel its up to me to lend him a hand  but surely i expostulated even if you cannot see your way clear to help me theres no need for you to go over to the enemy like this youre not obliged to interfere in the election at all are you  mr bundercombe sighed  matter of principle with me he explained i must be doing something i cant canvass for you ill have to look round a bit for the other chap  i really dont see i began just a little annoyed why you should feel called upon to interfere in an english election at all unless it is to help a friend  mr bundercombe looked at me and solemnly winked  say thats the dinner gong he announced cheerfully lets be getting in  but i dont quite understand  mr bundercombe repeated the wink upon a smaller scale i followed him into the drawingroom still in the dark as to his exact political position  the movements of my prospective fatherinlaw were for the next few days wrapped in a certain mystery he arrived home one evening however in a state of extreme indignation as usual when anything had happened to upset him he came to look for me in the library  my boy he said of all the godforsaken outoftheworld benighted holes this bildborough of yours absolutely takes the cake for sheer ignorance for sheer thickheaded bumptious arrogant ignorancegive me your farmers  whats wrong i asked him  wrong listen he exclaimed almost dramatically in this districtin this whole district mindthere is not a single farmer who has heard of bundercombes reapers  i farm a bit myself i reminded him and i had never heard of them  mr bundercombe went to the sideboard and mixed himself a cocktail with great care  bundercombes reapers he said as soon as he had disposed of it are the only reapers used by live farmers in the united states of america canada australia or any other country worth a cent  that seems to hit us pretty hard i remarked have you got an agent over here  sure mr bundercombe replied i dont follow the sales now so i cant tell you what hes doing but weve an agent hereand any country that doesnt buy bundercombes reapers is off the line as regards agriculture  what are you going to do about it i asked  do mr bundercombe toyed with his wine glass for a moment and then set it down what i have done he announced is this i have wired to my agent i have ordered him to ship half a dozen machinesif necessary on a special trainand i am going to give an exhibition on some land i have hired over by little bildborough the day after tomorrow  thats the day of the election i exclaimed  you couldnt put it off i suppose he suggested thats the day ive fixed for my exhibition at any rate i am giving the farmers a free lunch slapup affair its going to be i can tell you  i am afraid i answered with a wholly wasted sarcasm that the affair has gone too far now for us to consider an alteration in the date  well well we must try not to clash mr bundercombe said magnanimously how long does the voting go on  from eight until eight i told him  mr bundercombe was thoughtful  its a long time to hold them he murmured  to hold whom i demanded  mr bundercombe started slightly  nothing nothing by the by do you know a chap called jonashenry jonas of milton farm  i should think i do i groaned hes the backbone of the opposition the best speaker theyve got and the most popular man  mr bundercombe smiled sweetly  is that so he observed well well he is a very intelligent man i trust ill be able to persuade him that any reaper he may be using at the present moment is a jay compared to bundercombesthis seasons model  i trust you may i answered a trifle tartly i am glad youre likely to do a little business but you wont mind my reminding youwill you that you really came down here to give me a leg up with my election and not to sell your machines or to spend half your time in the enemys camp  mr bundercombe smiled it was a curious smile which seemed somehow to lose itself in his face then the dinner gong sounded and he winked at me slowly again i was conscious of some slight uneasiness it began to dawn upon me that there was a scheme somewhere hatching that mr bundercombes activity in the camp of the enemy might perhaps have an unsuspected significance i talked to eve about this after dinner but she reassured me  father talks of nothing but his reaping machines she declared besides i am quite sure he would do nothing indiscreet only yesterday i found him studying a copy of the act referring to bribery and corruption dads pretty smart you know  i do know that i admitted i wish i knew what he was up to though  the next day was the last before the election the little market of bildborough was in a state of considerable excitement several openair meetings were held toward evening eve and i returning from a motor tour of the constituency called at the office of my agent we chatted with mr ansell for a little while and then he pointed across the square  theres an american there he said that the other side seems to have got hold of hes their most popular speaker by a long way but i gather theyre a little uneasy about him didnt i have the pleasure of meeting him at your house  mr bundercombe i sighed he came down here to help me  mr ansell put on his hat and beckoned mysteriously  come out by the back way he invited we shall hear him he is going to speak from the little platform there  by crossing a hotel yard a fragment of kitchen garden and a bowling green we were able to come within a few yards of where mr bundercombe with several other of mr horrocks supporters was standing upon a small raised platform two local tradesmen and one helper from london addressed a few remarks of the usual sort to an apathetic audience which was rapidly increasing in size it was only when mr bundercombe rose to his feet that the slightest sign of enthusiasm manifested itself eve looked at me with a pleased smile  just look at all of them she whispered how they are hurrying to hear dad speak  thats all very well i grumbled but he ought to be doing this for me  her fingers pressed my arm  listen she said  mr bundercombes style was breezy and his jokes were frequent he stood in an easy attitude and spoke with remarkable fluency his first few remarks which were mainly humorous were cheered to the echo the crowd was increasing all the time presently he took them into his confidence  when i came down here a few days ago we heard him say i came meaning to support my friend mr walmsley groans and cheers thats all right boys mr bundercombe continued theres nothing the matter with mr walmsley but i come from a country where theres a bit more kick about politics and i pretty soon made up my mind that the kick wasnt on the side my young friend belongs to  now just listen to this as one business man to another i tell you that i asked mr walmsley the first night i was here what are you getting out of this why are you going into parliament he didnt seem to understand he pleaded guilty to a fourhundredayear fee but told me at the same time that it cost him a great deal more than that in extra charities i asked him what pull he got through being in parliament and how many of his friends he could find places for all he could do was to smile and tell me that i didnt understand the way things were done in this country he wanted to make me believe that he was anxious to sit in parliament there and work day after day just for the honor and glory of it or because he thought it was his duty  you know im an american business man and that didnt cut any ice with me so i dropped in and had a chat with mr horrocks i soon came to the conclusion that the candidate im here to support tonight is the man who comes a bit nearer to our idea of practical politics over on the other side of the pond mr horrocks doesnt make any bones about it he wants that four hundred a year in fact he needs it ironical cheers he wants to call himself mp because when he goes out to lecture on socialism hell get a tenguinea fee instead of five on account of those two letters after his name  furthermore his is the party that understands what i call practical politics every job thats going is given to their friends and if there arent enough jobs to go round why they get one of their statesmen to frame a billwhat you call your insurance bill is one of them i believe in which there are several hundred offices that need filling and there you are  mr ansell and i exchanged glances the enthusiasm that had greeted mr bundercombes efforts was giving place now to murmurs and more ironical cheers one of his coadjutors on the platform leaned over and whispered in mr bundercombes ear mr bundercombe nodded  gentlemen he concluded im told that my time is up i have explained my views to you and told you why i think you ought to vote for mr horrocks ive nothing to say against the other fellow except that i dont understand his point of view mr horrocks i do understand hes out to do himself a bit ogood and its up to you to help him  a determined tug at mr bundercombes coattails by one of the men on the platform brought him to his seat amid loud bursts of laughter and more cheers eve gripped my arm and we turned slowly away  its a privilege i declared solemnly to have ever known your father if i only had an idea what he meant about those reaping machines you couldnt give me a hint i suppose eve she shook her head  better wait  in the excitement of that final day i think both eve and i completely forgot all about mr bundercombe it was not until we were on our way back from a motor tour through the outlying parts of the district that we were forcibly reminded of his existence quite close to little bildborough the only absolutely hostile part of my constituency we came upon what was really an extraordinary sight our chauffeur of his own accord drew up by the side of the road eve and i rose in our places  in a large field on our left was gathered together apparently the whole population of the district in one corner was a huge marquee through the open flaps of which we could catch a glimpse of a sumptuously arranged cold collation on a long table just outside covered with a white cloth was a vast array of bottles and beside it stood a man in a short linen jacket who struck me as being suspiciously like fritz the bartender at one of mr bundercombes favorite haunts in london  toward the center of the field seated upon a ridiculously inadequate seat on the top of a reaping machine was mr bundercombe he had divested himself of coat and waistcoat and was hatless the perspiration was streaming down his face as he gripped the steering wheel he was followed by a little crowd of children and sympathizing men who cheered him all the time  at a little distance away on the other side of a red flag henry jonas the large farmer of the district and the speaker on whom my opponent chiefly relied was seated upon a similar machine in a similar state of undress it was apparent however even to us that mr bundercombes progress was at least twice as rapid as his opponents  what on earth is it all about i exclaimed absolutely bewildered  eve who was standing by my side clasped her hands round my arm  it seems to me she murmured sweetly as if dad were trying his reaping machine against some one elses  i looked at her demure little smile and i looked at the field in which i recognized very many of my staunchest opponents then i looked at the marquee the table there must have been set for at least a hundred people suddenly i received a shock seated underneath the hedge hatless and coatless with his hair in picturesque disorder was mr jonas cousin also a violent opponent of my politics and a nonconformist he had a huge tumbler by his side whichseeing mehe raised to his lips  good old walmsley he shouted out no politics today much too hot come in and see the reaping match  he took a long drink and i sat down in the car  you know i said to mr ansell who was standing on the front seat therell be trouble about this  mr ansell was looking a little grave himself  is mr bundercombe really the manufacturer of that machine he asked  of course he is eve replied its the one hobby of his lifeor rather it used to be she corrected herself hastily even now when he begins talking about his reaping machine he forgets everything else  mr ansell hurried away and made a few inquiries meanwhile we watched the progress of the match every time mr bundercombe had to turn he rocked in his seat and retained his balance only with difficulty at every successful effort he was loudly cheered by a little group of following enthusiasts mr ansell returned looking a little more cheerful  everything is being given by the bundercombe reaping company he announced and mr bundercombes city agent is on the spot prepared to book orders for the machine it seems that mr bundercombe has backed himself at ten to one in tenpound notes to beat mr jonas by half an hour each taking half the field  whos ahead eve asked excitedly  mr bundercombe is well ahead mr ansell replied and they say that he can do better still if he tries it looks rather mr ansell concluded dropping his voice as though he were trying to make the thing last out afterward they are all going to sit down to a free mealthat is if any of them are able to sit down he added with a glance round the field hello heres harrison  mr harrison recognizing us descended from his car and came across he shook hands with eve at whom he glanced in a somewhat peculiar fashion  mr walmsley he said a week ago we were rather proud of having inveigled away one of your adherents all i can say at the present moment is that we should have been better satisfied if you had left mr bundercombe in town  why hes been speaking against me at nearly every one of your meetings i protested  thats all very well mr harrison complained but hes not what i should call a convincing speaker he is a democrat all right and a peoples manand all the rest of it but he hasnt got quite the right way of advocating our principles i have been obliged to ask him to discontinue public speaking until after the election the fact of it is i really believe hes cost us a good many more votes than hes gained all he says is very well but when he sits down one feels that our people are all for what they can get out of itand yours are prepared to give their services for nothing  whats all this mean i asked waving my hand toward the field  mr harrison looked at me very steadily indeed then he looked at eve i can only hope that my own expression was as guileless as eves  i told you about that hint we were obliged to give mr bundercombe mr harrison went on i suppose this is the result of it he seems to have bewitched the whole of little bildborough theres jonas there who was due to speak in four places todayhe will take no notice of anybody i walked by the side of his machine begging him to get down and come and keep his engagements and he took no more notice of me than if id been a rabbit  theres his cousin who has more hold upon the nonconformists of the district than any man i knowsitting under a hedge drinking out of a tumbler there are at least a score of men with their eyes glued on that tent who ought to be hard at work in the district i am beginning to doubt whether theyll even be in in time to vote  well we must be getting on anyway i said see you later mr harrison  mr harrison nodded a little gloomily and we glided off eve squeezed my hand under the rug  isnt dad a dear she murmured in my ear  eve was one of the first to congratulate me when late that night the results came in and i found that by a majority of twentyseven votes i had been elected the member for the division  arent you glad now paul dear that we brought father down to keep him out of mischief she whispered  mr bundercombe himself held out his hand  paul he said i congratulate you my boy i was on the other side but i can take a licking with the best of them congratulate you heartily  he held out his hand and gripped mine once more he winked     chapter xiithe emancipation of louis  at about half past ten the following morning i turned into princes gardens to find a fourwheel cab drawn up outside the door of mr bundercombes house on the roof was a dressing case made of some sort of compressed cane and covered with linen accompanying it was a black tin box on which was painted in white letters hannah bundercombe president wsf standing by the door was a footman with an article in his hand that i believe is called a grip which in the present instance i imagine took the place of a dressing case  i surveyed these preparations with some interest the temporary departure of mrs bundercombe would i felt have an enlivening influence upon the establishment as i turned in at the gate mrs bundercombe herself appeared she was followed by a young woman who looked distinctly bored and whom i was not at first able to place mrs bundercombe was in a state of unusual excitement  say mr walmsley she began and her voice seemed to come from her foreheadit was so shrill and nasal how long will it take me to get to st pancras  i looked at the fourwheeler on the roof of which another servant was now arranging a typewriter in its tin case  i should say about thirtyfive minutesin that i replied a taxi would do it in a quarter of an hour  none of your taxis for me mrs bundercombe declared warmly i am not disposed to trust myself to a piece of machinery that can be made to tell any sort of lies i like to pay my fare and no more if thirtyfive minutes will get me to st pancras then i guess ill make my train  you are leaving us for a few days i remarked suddenly catching a glimpse of a face like a round moon beaming at me from the window  i have received a dispatch mrs bundercombe announced drawing a letter with pride from an article that i believe she called her reticule signed by the secretary of the womens league of freedom asking me to address their members at a meeting to be held at leeds tonight  very gratifying i murmured  how the woman knew that i was in england mrs bundercombe continued carefully replacing the missive i cannot imagine but i suppose these things get about in any case i felt it my duty to go some of us mr walmsley she added regarding me with a severe air think of little else save the various pleasures we are able to cram into our lives day by day others are always ready to listen to the call of duty  i wish you a pleasant journey mrs bundercombe i said raising my hat i suppose i shall find eve in  no doubt you will she snapped  i glanced at the depressed young woman  i am taking a temporary secretary with me mrs bundercombe explained recent reports of my speeches in this country have been so unsatisfactory that i have lost confidence in the press i am taking an experienced shorthandwriter with me who will furnish the various journals with a verbatim report of what i say  much more satisfactory i am sure i agreed edging toward the house i wish you a successful meeting mrs bundercombe you mustnt miss your train  and i trust mrs bundercombe concluded as she turned to enter the cab that if you accompany eve in her shopping expeditions today or during my absence you will not encourage her in any fresh extravagances  i made my way into the house and entered the morning room as the cab drove off mr bundercombe and eve were waltzing mr bundercombe paused at my entrance and wiped his forehead he was very hot  a little ebullition of feeling my dear paul he explained on seeing you you met mrs bundercombe you have heard the news  i gathered i remarked that mrs bundercombes sense of duty is taking her to leeds  mr bundercombe breathed a resigned sigh  we shall be alone he announced with illconcealed jubilation if we have any luck at all for three days one never knows though i propose that we celebrate tonight unless he added with a sudden gloom you two want to go off and dine somewhere alone  not likely i assured him quickly  daddy eve exclaimed reproachfully  mr bundercombe cheered up  then if youre both agreeable he proposed let us go and pay luigi a visit i have rather a fancy to show him a reestablished mr bundercombe you know i sometimes think he went on that luigi was beginning to regard me with suspicion  there isnt any doubt about it i observed dryly  we will dine there tonight mr bundercombe decided that is if you two are willing  i hesitated for a moment eve was looking at me for my decision  i really see no reason why we shouldnt go there i said i have to take eve to some rather dull relatives for luncheon and i suppose we shall be shopping afterward it will brighten up the day  we will give luigi no intimation of our coming mr bundercombe suggested with relish we shall be in no hurry so we can order our dinner when we arrive there at eight oclock  at eight oclock i agreed  more presents paul eve informed me taking my arm come along and help me unpack isnt it fun  luigis reception of us that night was most gratifying he escorted us to the best table in the place from which he ruthlessly seized the mystic label that kept it from the onslaughts of less privileged guests he congratulated me upon my parliamentary honors and my engagement in the same breath  it was perfectly clear to me that luigi knew all about us he addressed mr bundercombe with an air of deep respect in which was visible too an air of relieved apprehension he took our order himself with the aid of an assistant ma√Ætre dh√¥tel at whom mr bundercombe glanced with some surprise  where is louis he inquired  goneleft luigi answered  mr bundercombe was obviously disappointed  say is that so he exclaimed why i thought he was a fixture been here a long time hadnt he  nearly twelve years luigi admitted  has he got a restaurant of his own mr bundercombe asked  luigi shook his head  on the contrary sir he replied i think louis has gone off his head he has taken a very much inferior post at a very inferior place a restaurant of a different class altogethernot at all comme il faut a little place for the multitudegiatrons in soho the foolishness of it for all his old clients must be useless no one would eat in such a hole it is most mysterious  we dined well and gayly mr bundercombe renewed many restaurant acquaintances and i am quite sure he thoroughly enjoyed himself every now and then however a shadow rested on his face watching him i felt quite certain of the reason it was only during the last few weeks that i had begun to realize the immense good nature of the man he was worrying about louis  we sat there until nearly ten oclock when we rose to go mr bundercombe turned to us say he asked a little diffidently would you people object to just dropping in at this giatrons or will you go off somewhere by yourselves and meet me afterward  we will go wherever you go dad eve declared we are not going to leave you alone when we do have an evening off  i should like to find out about louis myself i interposed i always thought he was the best ma√Ætre dh√¥tel in london  we drove to giatrons and found it in a back streeta shabby unpretentiouslooking place with a front that had once been white but that was now grimy in the extreme the windows were hung with little curtains in the french fashion whose freshness had also long departed the restaurant itself was low and teeming with the odor of past dinners at this hour it was almost empty several untidylooking waiters were rearranging tables in the middle of the room louis was standing  he recognized us with a little start though he made no movement whatever in our direction he was certainly a changed being he stood and looked at us as though we were ghosts mr bundercombe waved his hand in friendly fashion it was not until then that louis with marked unwillingness came forward to greet us  come to see your new quarters louis mr bundercombe said cheerfully find us a table and serve us some of your special coffee we will dine here another evening  louis showed us to a table and handed us over to the care of an unwholesomelooking german waiter with only a very brief interchange of courtesies and then with a word of excuse he darted away mr bundercombe looked after him wonderingly  the coffee was brought by the waiter and served without louis reappearance the effect of his absence on mr bundercombe however was only to make him more determined than ever to get at the bottom of whatever mystery there might be  just tell louis the ma√Ætre dh√¥tel i wish to speak to him he instructed the waiter  the man departed ten minutes passed but there was no sign of louis mr bundercombe sent another and more imperative message this time louis obeyed it as he crossed the room a little hesitatingly toward us it was almost sad to notice the alteration in his appearance at luigis he had been so smart so upright so well dressed here he was a changed being his hair needed cutting his linen was no longer irreproachable his clothes were dusty and out of shape the man seemed to have lost all care of himself and all pride in his work when at last he reached the table mr bundercombe did not beat about the bush  louis he said we have been to stephanos tonight for the first time for some weeks i came along here to see you because of what luigi told me now you can just take this from me youve got to tell me the truth theres something wrong with you what is it  louis extended his hands he was making his one effort  there is nothing wrong with me he declared i left stephanos toas they say in this countrybetter myself i am in charge herenext to monsieur giatron himself if monsieur giatron should go back to italy i should be manager it seemed like a good post perhaps i was foolish to leave  louis mr bundercombe protested i guess i didnt come round here to listen to lies you and i had some little dealings together and i feel ive the right to insist on the truth now then dont give us any more troubletheres a good fellow if youd rather talk to me alone invite me into the office or behind that desk  louis looked round the room which was almost empty save for the waiters preparing the tables for supper  mr bundercombe he said with a little gesture of resignation it is because of those dealings that i came to trouble  mr bundercombe eyed him steadily  go on he ordered  louis moved closer still to the table  it was those banknotes mr bundercombe he confessed you gave me one packet to be destroyed in the kitchen i obeyed but i looked at them first never did i see such wonderful work those notesevery one seemed real every one as i put it into the fire gave my heart a pang  and then the other timewhen you slipped them under the table to me because mr cullen was about i took them too to the fire i destroyed one two three four fiveone dozentwo dozen and then i came to the last two or three and my fingersthey went slow i could not bear it i thought what could be done my wife she was not well i could send her to italy i owe a little bill the tipsthey had not been good lately behold there was one tenpound note left when all the others were destroyed i put him in my waistcoat pocket  go on mr bundercombe said encouragingly no one is blaming you upon my word it sounds natural enough  louis voice grew a little bolder  for some time i hesitated how to change it then one day i came here to see my friend giatronwe came together from italy i hand him the note i ask him please change he give me the change and i stay to have a drink with the head waiter who is a friend of mine presently giatron comes out he calls me into the office then i begin to tremble he looks at me and i tremble more  then he knows that he have got me giatrons a very cruel man mr bundercombe he make hard terms he made me give up my good place at luigis he made me come here and be his head man he gives me half as much as luigi and there are no tips besides which the place offends me every moment of the day the service the food the wineseverything is cheap and bad i take no pride in my work  i go to giatron and i pray him to let me go but not so i know my work well he thinks that i will bring clients nowhere else could he get a head man so good as i at the wages of a common waiter so i stay herea slave  the mans story was finished in a sense it seemed ordinary enough and yet both eve and i felt a curious thrill of sympathy as he finished there was something almost dramatic in the mans sad voice his depressed bearing the story of this tragedy that had come so suddenly into his life one looked round and realized the truth of all he had said one realized something even of the bitterness of his daily life  mr bundercombe sipped his coffee thoughtfully  tell me why you did not come to me or write louis he asked  the man stretched out his hands  but it was to you sir that i had broken my word he pointed out when you gave me that first little bundle you looked at me so steadfastlywhen you told me that every scrap was to be destroyed and i promisedi promised you faithfully and you asked me afterward about that last batch you said to me louis you are sure that they are all quite gone remember that there is trouble in the possession of them and i told you a lie  mr bundercombe coughed and poured himself out a little more of the coffee  louis he declared you are a fool you are a blithering idiot you are a jackass it never occurred to me before i am the guilty one for placing such a temptation in your way now wheres this monsieur giatron of yours  louis looked at him wonderingly there was a dawn of hope in his face blended with a startled fear  he arrives in ten minutes he announced he comes down for the supper he is here  mr bundercombe glanced round a stout man with a black mustache had entered the room his eyes fell at once on the little group mr bundercombe turned round  so that is monsieur giatron  louis bowed mr bundercombe beckoned the proprietor to approach  an old patron of luigis mr bundercombe explained introducing himselfcome round to see our friend louis here  delighted i am very sure mr giatron exclaimed bowing to all of us it will be a great pleasure to us to do the very best possible for any of louis friends  mr bundercombe rose to his feet he pointed to the little glassframed office at the other side of the room  mr giatron he said i have always been a great patron of louis you and i must have a chat will you not invite us into your little office and show us whether there is not something better to be found than this coffee we will take a glass of brandy together and drink success to your restaurant  giatron hastened to lead the way eve in response to a glance from her father remained at the table but i followed mr bundercombe we went into the office giatron himself placed three glasses upon the desk and produced from a cupboard a bottle of what appeared to be very superior brandy mr bundercombe sipped his with relish then he glanced at the closed door  mr giatron he began i have been having a chat with louis he has told me of his troublestold me the reason for his leaving luigi and accepting this post with you  giatron paused with the bottle suspended in midair he slowly set it down a frown appeared on his face  mind you mr bundercombe continued i am not sympathizing with louis if what he said is true i am inclined to think you have been very merciful  giatron recovered his confidence  he triedlouis triedmy old friend he complained to take advantage of me to enrich himself at my expense by means of a false note  that is the only point mr bundercombe said  was the note bad do you know i can scarcely bring myself to believe it  the restaurant keeper smiled very deliberately he produced a great bunch of keys from his pocket and opened the safe which stood in a corner of the office mr bundercombe whispered a scarcely audible word in my ear and became absorbed once more in the brandy presently giatron returned he laid on the desk and smoothed out carefully what was to all appearances a tenpound note  if you will examine that carefully sir he begged you will see that it is the truth that note he is very well made but he is not a good bank of england note  mr bundercombe slowly adjusted his glasses placed the note in front of him and smoothed it carefully with his large hand this is very interesting he murmured allow me to make a close examination ive seen some highclass printing in my  giatron started as though he were shot and jumped round toward me with unpardonable clumsiness i had upset my glass in leaning over to look at the note  im awfully sorry i exclaimed glancing ruefully at my trousers would you give me a napkin quickly  giatron hastened to the door of the office and called to a passing waiter the napkin was soon procured and i rubbed myself dry the restaurant keeper returned to the desk at mr bundercombes side  all i can say mr bundercombe declared as he drew away from the note which he had been examining is that i do not wonder you were deceived mr giatron this note is the most perfect imitation i have ever seen in my life a wicked piece of work sir  you recognize the fact however that the note is beyond question counterfeit mr giatron persisted  i fear you are right mr bundercombe admitted there is a slight imperfection yes yesa very bad business mr giatron we must come here often and try to see whether we cannot make you a second luigi  giatron returned to the safe with the note which he carefully locked up  very excellent brandy mr bundercombe pronounced warmly you will see a great deal more of us my friend i promise you that we shall haunt you  mr giatron bowed to the ground  you are always very welcomeand the young lady  we rejoined eve paid our bill and made our way to the door louis looking very pathetic was in the background mr bundercombe beckoned to him  louis you can give your shark of an employer a weeks notice tonight i have the note in my pocket he whispered its cost me a good one but i owed you that on monday week louis i shall order my dinner from you at luigis  the mans face was wonderful he came a little closer he was shaking at the knees his hands were trembling and his mouth was twitching mr bundercombe he pleaded hoarsely you would not deceive me  mr bundercombe looked at him steadfastly  on my honor louis the note is in my pocket already torn in four pieces when i put my hand into my waistcoat pocket to pay my bill in three minutes it will be in a hundred piecesgone you need have no fear the note mr giatron is guarding so carefully is a very excellent tenpound note of my own  at a quarter to eight on the following monday week mr bundercombe and i entered luigis restaurant louis himself advanced to greet usthe old louis whose linen was irreproachable whose bearing and deportment and gracious smile all denoted the louis of old mr bundercombe ordered dinner and beckoned louis to come a little nearer  was there any trouble he inquired  for me no louis replied but monsieur giatronnever never have i seen a man like it he fetched out the note now he said i take your notice you take mine ring up the police or shall i  then i tell him i say i dont believe the note bad at all he laughed at me he got it from the safe and laid it on the desk not bad he jeered not bad then he stood looking at it  mr bundercombe i see his face change his mouth came wide open his eyes looked as though they would drop out he bend over that note he looked at it and looked at it and then he looked at me  i dont believe that note ever was bad i say i told you when you charged me i didnt believe it that is why i have made up my mind to give you notice to go away from here and if that note is bad then you can put me in prison  monsieur giatronhe went back to the safe he rummaged round among a pile of papers and soon he came out again he was looking pastycolored louis he said some one has been very clever you can go to hell and so mr bundercombe louis wound up beaming here i am     chapter xiiithe shorn lamb  i never remembered seeing mr bundercombe look more cheerful than when at his urgent summons i left eve in the drawingroom and made my way into the study he was standing on the hearthrug with the tails of his morning coat drooping over his arms and an expression on his face that i can only describe as cherubic seated on chairs a yard or so away from him were two visitors of whom at first glance i formed a most unfavorable opinion one was a flashily dressed middleaged man with fair mustache puffy cheeks and a superfluity of jewelry the other i might at first have taken for an undertakers mute he had an exceedingly red nose watery eyes and was dressed in deep mourning  paul mr bundercombe said let me introduce you to captain duncan bannister and mr cheape his solicitor  the two men rose and bowed in turn i found it difficult to maintain a tolerant attitude but i did my best  these two gentlemen mr bundercombe continued cheerfully have come round to blackmail me  sir captain bannister exclaimed with a great show of anger  mr bundercombe the person called mr cheape echoed  they made rather a poor show of it however mr bundercombe wholly unperturbed by their righteous indignation smiled still benignly upon them  come come he expostulated this is a business interview why mince words  captain bannister rose to his feet he turned toward me  mr bundercombe he explained either willfully or otherwise misinterprets the object of our coming it is possible that his nationality may have something to do with it i have always understood that the standard among americans with regard to affairs of honor is scarcely so high as in this country  mr bundercombe has a habit of taking a commonsense view of things i remarked i cannot criticize his attitude because i am ignorant of the particulars since he has sent for me however i presume that i am to be informed  quite soquite so mr bundercombe murmured you go ahead captain bannister you tell your story  my story captain bannister said is told in a very few words i made the acquaintance of mr bundercombe in the smoking room at the milan some months ago we met several times and on one occasion i presented him to a friend of mine the widow of a colonel in the indian army mrs delaporte  at this stage mr bundercombe who was quite irrepressible winked at me slowly i took no notice of him whatever  on the particular evening to which i refer captain bannister continued it was suggested by mrs delaporte i think that we should go round to her rooms and play chemin de fer there were five of us altogethermr bundercombe mrs delaporte myself a mr dimsdale and the honorable montague pelham a young gentleman of the best family when we arrived at mrs delaportes rooms however it transpired that mr bundercombe was wholly ignorant of chemin de fer and the game was accordingly changed to poker  in the course of the game i was shocked to detect mr bundercombe cheating for mrs delaportes sake i conceived it best to try and hush up the matter entirely i looked upon mr bundercombe as a card sharper of the ordinary type and i simply blamed myself for having introduced him to my friends i accordingly made some excuse to terminate the party  did any one else besides yourself i inquired observe this alleged irregularity  both mrs delaporte and mr dimsdale distinctly saw the very flagrant piece of cheating that first attracted my attention captain bannister declared they understood at once the position when i suggested the termination of the game our party broke up hurriedly since that day i have not seen mr bundercombe  i turned toward my prospective fatherinlaw mr bundercombe for the first time was looking a little annoyed  do you mean to tell me he said addressing captain bannister that both that young jay dimsdale and mrs delaporte saw me pass up that ace  without a doubt captain bannister assented a little taken aback  guess my fingers must be getting a bit clumsy mr bundercombe sighed well well there the matter is  but mr bundercombe i asked seriously what have you to say in reply to captain bannisters statement  dont seem to me theres much to be said mr bundercombe replied  but he accuses you of cheating i exclaimed  oh i cheated all right mr bundercombe admitted readily  captain bannister turned toward me triumphantly  after that confession from mr bundercombe before witnesses he said i do not imagine that our case will require very much more proof  i was completely nonplussedmr bundercombes confession was so ready his demeanor so unalterably goodtempered i went on to ask however what certainly seemed to me the most important question under the circumstances  if you were content captain bannister i inquired to let the matter drop a few months ago why are you here now  aha mr bundercombe exclaimed put his finger on the crux of the whole affair straight off smart young fellow my soninlaw that is to be now then captain bannister and mr cheape speak up like men and let us know the truth you let me walk out of that flat captain bannister and were jolly glad to see the back of me why this visit with a legal adviser and both of you with faces as long as fiddles  captain bannister ignored mr bundercombe and addressed me  mr bundercombe he said calling himself by the by mr parker as an american card sharper was of no interest to us we were simply ashamed and disgusted to think that we should have permitted such a person the entree to our society when we discovered however that instead of being a professional card sharper captain bannister continued with emphasis mr bundercombe enjoys a recognized position in society and that he is reputed to be a man of great wealth the affair assumes an altogether different complexion  worth going for aint i mr bundercombe chuckled  i feel sure mr walmsley captain bannister continued that some portion of your sympathy at any rate as an english gentleman of social distinction will be with us in this matter the affair we were content to let drop against mr parker the adventurer we feel it our duty to pursue against mr bundercombe the millionaire  we would save time i remarked coldly if you were to put your demands into plain words what is it you want or expect from mr bundercombe  not what you appear to think sir captain bannister replied stiffly we require from mr bundercombe a written confession and his resignation from the sidney club  the what club i asked dubiously  the sidney club captain bannister repeated with dignity the club in question may not be very large but it is quite well known and i had the misfortune to act as mr bundercombes sponsor there  i glanced toward my prospective fatherinlaw he nodded  they put me up for some sort of a pothouse he admitted and i handed over a tenner i think it was for my subscription rotten little hole somewhere near the haymarket ive never been in since ill resign with pleasure  and write a confession of your misdemeanor sir captain bannister persisted  mr bundercombe scratched his chin  ill write an account of the whole affair he remarked dryly  captain bannister took up his hat  i regret he declared that mr bundercombes attitude does not encourage a continuation of this conversation we will not detain you further gentlemen  mr cheape also rose they moved toward the door  much obliged to you for calling mr bundercombe said hospitably drop in and have a little game of cards with me any afternoon you like i am a bit out of practice but i fancy i am still in your class  captain bannister turned round suddenly he replaced his hat upon the table and stood with folded arms  sir he announced i have changed my mind you have insulted me five minutes ago i was prepared to treat you like a gentleman i would have accepted your resignation from the sidney club and your written apology now i have changed my mind you have slandered me both by imputation and directly  how much mr bundercombe asked cheerfully  five thousand pounds captain bannister answered firmly  how much more if i call you a lying cardsharping swindler mr bundercombe demanded with unabated good humor  captain bannister looked dangerous but he ignored the question  you have your terms sir he said unless you are prepared to hand over the sum of five thousand pounds my solicitor mr cheape here will at once commence proceedings against you with reference to the affair in mrs delaportes flat remember we have four witnesses to bring into court as to your having cheatednot including your soninlaw here who heard your confession for any countercharge you might be disposed to make captain bannister concluded you have not a single scrap of evidence  got me on toast havent they paul mr bundercombe observed cheerfully five thousand pounds is a lot of money captain bannister he added ill pay your taxi fare back to wherever you came from thats my best offer  captain bannister turned toward the door  come along mr cheape he said you know my address sir talk this matter over with yourwith mr walmsley if you please if we hear nothing from you on monday morning a writ will be issued  before monday mr bundercombe declared in a hollow voice my body will be found in the thames kick em out walmsley and look after the coats in the hall  i infused a shade more civility into my leavetaking than mr bundercombes words invited as soon as the door was closed behind the two men i returned to the study mr bundercombe was still standing upon the hearthrug but the smile had faded from his lips he looked at me a little anxiously  rotten lot of thieves he remarked i told you they were here for blackmail  its a beastly affair i pointed out gloomily you see theyve nothing to lose with a lawyer whos standing in with them in taking the case into court and youre just up for a couple of very good clubs what did happen  simple as abc mr bundercombe explained you see these two fellows dimsdale and pelham really looked like mugs i knew that bannister was a wrong un from the first and mrs delaporte of course was in the thing when they proposed a game of cards i chipped in thinking to watch the fun when we started playing dimsdale and pelham were the losers then they began to get at me bannister palmed a king into his hand and i palmed an ace that seemed fair enough eh  mr bundercombes expression as he looked at me was the expression of an appealing child i bit my lip  a minute or two later i tumbled to the whole situation he went on dimsdale and pelham werent jays at all it was a gang of four and they raked me in for the mug after id tumbled to that i must confess i took some interest in the game if they had given me another quarter of an hour i should have won every chip there was going my boy mr bundercombe went on a sudden grin transfiguring his expressive countenance it was worth a fortune to see their faces  i was a bit out of practice but i guarantee id make a living with my fingers and a pack of cards anywhere yet and defy detection i had em all guessing before long and paul you should have seen their faces when they tumbled to it i tell you they bundled me out in doublequick time and i laughed all the way home four sharks to pitch upon me as a victim  he began to laugh again but the sight of my grave face checked him he at once assumed the appearance of a penitent  where did you come across them again i asked  i met mrs delaporte the other day he said down at ranelagh we chatted a little while i couldnt feel any illwill against the woman id enjoyed my evening so thoroughly then some people stopped and talked to me and she found out who i was soon afterward she began to throw out hints of a willingness to marry again perhaps i wasnt very tactful anyway she seemed a little huffed when she left meand here we are say do you think those joshers can do anything  it rather depends i replied upon their own reputations youd better let me make a few inquiries ill have to get off now eves waiting ill call round and see my solicitor later in the day  shame to bother you mr bundercombe regretted so long  the affair mr bundercombe had treated with his customary light heartedness seemed likely to develop most unpleasantly within fortyeight hours he was the recipient of a writ from the firm of solicitors with which mr cheape was connected and though inquiries went to prove that captain bannister mrs delaporte and their associates were certainly not people of the highest respectability there was yet nothing definite against them my solicitor to whom i took mr bundercombe most regretfully advised him to settle out of court  the friends mr bundercombe is now making and may make in later life the lawyer remarked will certainly not appreciate the adventurous spirit thaterinduced him to make acquaintances among a certain class of people therefore in the interests of my client mr walmsley as well as your own mr bundercombe he concluded i am afraid i must advise you very much against my own inclinations to settle this matter  mr bundercombe left the lawyers office thoroughly depressed  it isnt the money he declared gloomily its being bested by this little gang of thieves that irritates me  i am sure i told him that mr wymans advice is sound if the case goes into court and comes up before the committeeeven of a rotten club like the sidneyi am afraid you would have to withdraw your membership from the other places and you might find the affair continually cropping up and causing you annoyance  mr bundercombe heaved a mighty sigh  well weve got two days left he said if nothing happens before then ill pay up                                mr bundercombe rang me up on the morning of the last day appointed for his decision  weve got a conference on paul he announced dejectedly will you come round here for me at a quarter to eleven  i assented and arrived at the house in princes gardens a few minutes before that time eve met me in the hall  please tell me dear she begged as she drew me into the morning room why daddy is so lowspirited  it isnt anything serious i assured her its just a little trouble arising from one of his adventures we shall get out of it all right  poor daddy she exclaimed i am sure he has had no sleep for two nights i heard him walking up and down his room  well it will all be over today i promised after all it only means a little money  daddy does so hate to get the worst of anything she sighed and i am afraid from the looks of his face that this time hes in a fix  i am afraid so too i agreed never mind we have done the best we can and we are going to settle it up once and for all today perhaps hell tell you about it afterward  we heard a door slam and mr bundercombes voice  he is asking for you eve whispered hurry along and come back as soon as youve got this business over  i found mr bundercombe exceedingly chastened but in all other respects his usual self  we are calling for mr wymans he said in lincolns inn fields and afterward we are going round to mrs delaportes flat we are going to meet bannister there and his lawyer  why do we concern ourselves in the matter at all i asked as we drove off i dont see why we cant leave the lawyers to do this final settlement  mr bundercombe shook his head  you leave too much to lawyers in this country he remarked we generally like to see the thing through ourselves over at home even if we take a lawyer along this is an unpleasant business if you like but theres no good in shirking it  we called for mr wymans and drove on to mrs delaportes flat we were at once admitted into an overheated and overperfumed room and found captain bannister mrs delaporte and mr cheape awaiting us their demeanor betokened anxiety mrs delaporte alone made a little conversation and the habits of a lifetime asserting themselves she made eyes at mr bundercombe  mr bundercombe however conducted himself very much like the deacon of a chapel in the presence of his minister his natural good humor seemed to have departed his manners matched the unusual solemnity of his attire  madam he said bowing to mrs delaporte mr cheape and captain bannister i have suggested this conference because i believe in settling these affairs myself and not leaving everything to lawyersno disrespect to present company i have made an idiot of myself and i am ready to pay a certain amount  mr cheape rose to his feet he was sitting in front of a writing desk with a clean sheet of paper in front of him as though prepared to take notes of the proceedings  so that there may be no possible misunderstanding he intervened my clients will take not a penny less than the five thousand pounds mentioned  and i mr bundercombe declared sadly but very firmly will not give a penny more than four thousand pounds  mr cheape shrugged his shoulders as though to intimate that the conference was at an end captain bannister made a few remarks to the effect that if he had not been a moderate man and willing to conduct the affair in a gentlemanly manner he should have asked for ten thousand mrs delaporte alluded to five thousand pounds as though the amount represented the outcome of a days shopping it was astonishing how little they seemed to regard the value of money  now mr bundercombe went on if ive brought you all together here on false pretenses i am sorry theres nothing to be done in that case but to say good morning and meet in the law court but he added striking the back of a chair with his clenched fist and looking more like napoleon than i had ever seen him i swear by the word of joseph h bundercombe which has never yet been broken that i will not hand over one cent more than four thousand pounds  the protests were this time a little weaker mr bundercombe sat with folded arms with his eyes fixed upon the ceiling and an air of being altogether disinterested in the proceedings while the three who comprised the other party whispered together  presently mr cheape rose to his feet  mr wymans he began punctiliously addressing the lawyer first and mr bundercombe my clients are only too anxious to end this unhappy matter they feel that their demands have been most moderate but at my advice they have consented to accept a reduction of five hundred pounds  mr bundercombe rose heavily to his feet  mr wymans he said and paul come along i do not bargain i wish you all good morning  he turned toward the door and we followed him it was already opened when we were called back captain bannister and mr cheape were whispering eagerly together mr cheape rose once more to his feet  in order to prove he announced how entirely devoid my clients are of mercenary considerations they agree mr bundercombe to accept the sum of four thousand pounds  mr bundercombe put down his hat again then he drew a sheet of paper from his pocket  condition number one then he observed is now agreed upon we proceed to condition number two mrs delaporte captain bannister and mr cheape he went on earnestly i have been guilty of an indiscretion the proof of which is in your hands having decided to make london my home for a time i desire once and for all to extinguish all possibility of this affair ever cropping up again in any shape or form  mr cheape rose to his feet  sir he said to mr bundercombe my clients will give you their written undertaking that the affair shall be consigned to oblivion  mr bundercombe waved him down  my reasons for feeling so strongly on the matter he continued will be appreciated by you captain bannister as a man of position and in societycaptain bannister bowedwhen i tell you that my future sonin law mr walmsley mp has proposed me for membership in two of the most exclusive clubs in london this affair therefore must be killed beyond any manner of doubt i am handing over to you four thousand pounds which is a very considerable sum but in return for it i desire that my future immunity be purchased by your signatures to this document  mr cheape rose at once to his feet a document he observed let me read it mr bundercombe handed it over mr cheape read it out aloud  we the undersigned desire to apologize most sincerely to mr joseph h bundercombe for any allegations we have made against him with regard to a certain episode that took place on march eighteenth or thereabout in the flat of mrs delaporte we admit that we were mistaken in the supposition which we certainly entertained at the timethat mr bundercombe had been guilty of cheatingand we withdraw such allegations unreservedly and tender our apologies  ridiculous captain bannister exclaimed  absurd mrs delaporte echoed  i may add mr cheape joined in that i could not possibly recommend my clients to sign such a document  mr bundercombe took up his hat  when i started out this morning he declared i felt convinced that this conference would come to nothing i told mr wymans here that i was prepared to settle but on my own termsand my own terms only i dont want any undertaking not to molest me in the future that isnt good enough i want to be able to show a document such as you have there which completely exculpates me from any charge that might at any time be brought and without it he added once more bringing his fist down upon the back of the chair i do not part with one penny of my four thousand pounds  mr cheape read out a document he himself had prepared but mr bundercombe waved it away  come paul he said to me with a sigh come mr wymans i disclaim all responsibility for the failure of this conference i have done my best it cannot matter a snap of the fingers to our friends here in what form the document is couched that they give me in exchange for my four thousand pounds since they are so particular about a trifle i have finished with them  he led the way toward the door and there was an appearance of finality about his tone and shoulders exceedingly convincing we had reached the threshold and were indeed indulging in a little skirmish as to who should pass through the door first when mr cheapes resigned voice checked us  my clients he announced slowly will sign your document mr bundercombe they protestthey protest vigorously against its wording but they are anxious to show you in how largespirited and gentlemanly a manner they wish this affair to be concluded once more they yield  mr bundercombe without any signs of exultation returned to his former place put down his hat upon the chair and drew a checkbook from his breast coat pocket  if you will give me a seat and a pen he said i will write you a check for the amount  captain bannister stared at the checkbook he glanced at mr cheape and mr cheape very vigorously shook his head  i am sorry he objected but my clients cannot think of accepting a check in settlement of this matter  mr bundercombe began to show symptoms of annoyance  bless my soul he exclaimed isnt the check of joseph h bundercombe good enough for you  mr cheape laid his hand soothingly upon mr bundercombes shoulder  it isnt that we doubt your check sir he pointed out but in a transaction of this sort it is best that no evidences of a lasting nature should exist a check is not as you know legal tender and a check my clients certainly could not accept  mr bundercombe folded up his checkbook and replaced it in his pocket  then what are you going to do about it he asked  where is your bank mr cheape inquired  in pall mall mr bundercombe answered  then i am afraid mr cheape decided there is nothing for it but to ask you to repair there and cash your own check  mr bundercombe rose to his feet  all right he agreed i suppose we had better finish the affair while we are about it one of you had better come with me  captain bannister promptly volunteered he and i and mr bundercombe descended the stairs and entered the car we pulled up in a few minutes at the door of mr bundercombes bank  will you come in with me mr bundercombe invited turning to captain bannister  captain bannister excused himself  i will wait here with mr walmsley he said if you will allow me  mr bundercombe departed inside the bank and reappeared in the course of a few moments his breast coat pocket was bulging on our way back he drew out five packets of banknotes which he counted carefully captain bannister watched him out of the corner of his eye with a hungry expression we were only absent from the flat altogether about a quarter of an hour and the rest of the affair was promptly settled the notes were counted by mr cheape the document signed by captain bannister and mrs delaporte  i am sure captain bannister declared holding the notes in his left hand that no one can be more glad than mrs delaporte and myself that this little affair has been concluded so amicably if you will allow me mr bundercombe to offer you a little refreshment mr bundercombe sighed  well he said i suppose its all in the days work for you people i dont mind admitting though money wasnt so easily earned in my days that i can watch four thousand pounds go without feeling it thank you thatll do nicely he added accepting the brandyandsoda captain bannister handed him  mr wymans looked on with stern disapproval and i must say i sympathized with him mr bundercombe however not only drained the glass with relish but accepted the outstretched hand of captain bannister and afterward shook hands also with mrs delaporte  if you are passing at any time she whispered in his ear  i had had enough of it and i dragged mr bundercombe away we drove back to princes gardens in somewhat ominous silence mr wymans would have taken his leave but mr bundercombe begged him to come into the library  one moment he insisted james he said addressing the butler mr wymans will stay to lunch one moment  mr bundercombe went to the telephone mechanically he handed me the additional receiver he asked for a number and presently received a reply  say is that captain bannister i am speaking to he said i thought i recognized the voice this is mr bundercombe yes yesno theres nothing wed forgotten i just rang you up though to give you a word of advice you want to be just a leetle careful where you try to change those notes  what do you mean sir i heard captain bannister demand in startled accents what do you mean mr bundercombe  well mr bundercombe continued those notes are just about the cleverest things i ever came across but after all they arent exactly the genuine article i got four thousand pounds worth of them from a young fellow i was interested in and i had them put in a safe at my bank so that no one should get into any trouble it just occurred to me since we began our little negotiations that i saw a good way of making use of them i had only four thousand pounds worth so i had to beat you down a bit however thatll be all right captain only as i say use them a bit carefully jove aint he making the telephone sing mr bundercombe added turning to me i guess ill ring off he put down the receiver once more the accustomed smile was creeping over his face mr wymans was looking dazed the butler had entered the room with the cocktails  say paul mr bundercombe expostulated you didnt really think i was parting with four thousand pounds to a sloppy gang like that did you i knew a young chap who was very clever at making those notes he explained to mr wymans i liked him and converted him and i sent him over to the states where hes got a good situation and is working honestly for his living this was the remainder of his stock i had em lying in the safe deposit of the bank meaning some day to destroy em youve got that apology all right  mr wymans slowly smiled he raised his glass to his lips  you are a very clever man mr bundercombe he said     chapter xivmr bundercombes love affair  mr bundercombe who notwithstanding his wifes temporary absence in the country had not been in the best of spirits for several days during the course of our t√™te√†t√™te dinner at luigis became suddenly and unexpectedly animated the change in him was so noticeable that i leaned forward in my place to see what could have produced it  two people had entered the restaurant and were in conversation now with luigi about a table mr bundercombe who in the affairs of everyday life had no idea of concealing his feelings was regarding them with every appearance of lively interest  paul he whispered you must notice these two people watch them theres a good fellow  they took their places at a table almost opposite ours the girl though she was more quietly and tastefully dressed and seemed to me to be better looking i recognized at once as mr bundercombes companion at princes restaurant on one memorable occasion  the man i had never seen before he appeared to be of about medium height slim with a sallow skin dark sleepy eyes which suggested the foreigner a mouth that straight and firm though it was turned up a little at the corners as though in contradiction of his somewhat indolent general appearance he was exceedingly welldressed and carried himself with the quiet assurance of a man accustomed to moving in the world  most interesting mr bundercombe murmured having with an effort withdrawn his eyes from the pair the girl you doubtless recognize she was once a typist in the office of messrs harding  densmore she was quite lately as i dare say you remember able to give me some very useful information in fact it is through her that mr stanley did not leave this country for south africa with a hundred pounds in his pocket  and the man i asked  mr bundercombe was thoroughly enjoying himself he drew his chair a little closer to mine and waited until he was quite sure that no one was within earshot  the man he replied is one of the worlds most famous criminals  he doesnt look it i remarked glancing across the room with some interest  mr bundercombe smiled  great criminals are not all of the same type he reminded me reprovingly that is where you people who dont understand the cult of criminology make your foolish mistakes our friend opposite is without a doubt of gentle though not of aristocratic birth i know nothing of his bringing up but his instincts do all that is necessary for him the first time i saw him was in one of the criminal courts in new york he was being tried for his life for an attempted robbery in fifth avenue and the murder of a policeman he defended himself and did it brilliantly in the end he got off there is scarcely a person however who doubts but that he was guilty  i looked across at the subject of our discussion with renewed interest  he shot him i suppose i asked  on the contrary mr bundercombe replied he throttled him the man has the sinews of an ox the second time i saw him was at a dancinghall in new york he was there with a very gay party indeed but one of them the wealthiest mysteriously disappeared rodwelldagger rodwell was his nicknamecame to england i saw him once or twice just before i visited you down in bedfordshire cullen warned me off him however wouldnt let me have a word to say to him  he doesnt sound the best companion in the world for your little typist friend i remarked  mr bundercombe glanced across the room and at that moment the girl noticed him she bowed and waved her hand mr bundercombe responded gallantly  i fancy he murmured that she can take care of herself come i really feel that i am in an interesting atmosphere once more  mr bundercombes deportment was certainly more cheerful for the last week or two he had been depressed he had paid visits with eve and myself and devoted a reasonable amount of time to his wife the demands on his complete respectability however had been irksome he was too obviously finding no savor in life  i really was not altogether sorry at first to notice the improvement in his spirits though my sentiments changed when a little later in the evening the girl opposite left her place and came over to us she greeted mr bundercombe with the most brilliant of smiles and he held her hand quite as long as was necessary he presented me and i learned that her name was miss blanche spencer  i must not stay long she said laughing the gentleman i am with is a sort of cousin of mine and we dont get on very well but i mustnt be rude  mr bundercombe and she seemed to have a good deal to say to each other and presently i noticed that their heads were drawing closer together the girl dropped her voice she was proposing something to which mr bundercombe was listening with keen interest i heard him sigh  if it werent for certain changes he explained regretfully i guess i wouldnt hesitate a moment but  i heard a whispered reference to myself as his daughters fianc√© and an allusion to the continued presence of his wife in london she nodded sympathetically  now if there were any other way mr bundercombe concluded in which i could still further show my gratitude to you personally for a certain little matter why im all for hearing about it i consider the balance is still on my side  she laughed  youre really rather a dear she declared do you know i am thinking of starting in business for myself  where and what as mr bundercombe inquired  i shook open an evening paper and heard no more the girls leavetaking however a few minutes later was both reluctant and impressive i felt it my duty to allude to the matter as soon as we were alone  you know sir i said this helping young women to set up in business is a proceeding thats very likely to be misunderstood over here i am not in the least sure that even eve would quite approve  mr bundercombe smiled the smile of a man of the world  one cant tell ones womenkind everything he declared grandiloquently  i was a little puzzled i felt convinced that mr bundercombe was concealing something from me  furthermore i continued feeling it my duty to speak frankly to my future fatherinlaw a man of your position needs to be very careful when he has financial transactions with a goodlooking young woman like miss blanche the young lady herself might take advantage of it  mr bundercombe appeared to be giving my words full consideration  well well he said a little vaguely we shall see i dont mind telling you though paul that i would have nothing to say to her first suggestionon your account my boy theres a scheme on foot in which her interesting companion is concerned which needs financing i havent the least doubt that it is something entirely interestingprobably a mammoth jewel robbery or something of the sort  i looked across at the man who seemed to be reproaching the girl for her long absence almost at that moment he looked up and our eyes met for a brief instant there seemed to be nothing in his gaze beyond a measure of polite and not too pointed interest nevertheless when i looked away i begged mr bundercombe to call for the bill  i have had enough of this place i declared a little abruptly next time eve goes to bed with a headache i shall take you to the club                                i was walking down bond street with eve one morning when my suspicions as to mr bundercombe and a certain matter were first roused as we neared the piccadilly end i distinctly saw him vanish through a doorway on the lefthand side he was most carefully dressed and carried in his hand a long paper parcel that could contain nothing but flowers upon some excuse i prevailed upon eve to cross the road there was one small brass plate only on the side of the entrance through which mr bundercombe had disappeared it was scarcely larger than my hand and on it was engraved in very elegant characters blanche manicure  i made no comment at the time but curiously enough that afternoon as we sat out under the trees at ranelagh eve referred to the subject of her parent do you notice paul she asked how much less we see of dad lately  he does seem to have been out a good deal i admitted  she glanced at me  you havent any idea i suppose  the glance and her tone were quite sufficient for me i hastened to disclaim all responsibility for mr bundercombe  your father i assured her has never treated me with less confidence whatever he may be doing at present he is doing let me assure you entirely on his own responsibility  then i think if you dont mind please she begged you must try and get him to take you into his confidence of course she went on watching idly a polo team canter into the field i do not wish you to feel that he is in any way a responsibility on the other hand it does seem so queer paul he has taken to dressing most carefully and he leaves the house regularly every morning at ten oclock  youve no clew at all as to what he does with himself i asked  none she replied except that i never saw any one with such overmanicured nails as his i never knew him to go to a manicurist in my life but he is obviously going to one nearly every day now or he couldnt keep the polish on if that helps in any way  it might i admitted with a sigh  there he is eve exclaimed suddenly coming toward us too do please take this opportunity paul and see if you can find out anything you see a week ago he seemed bored to tears and now he has just that happy contented expression which he wears all the time when he is really engaged in something outrageous i will go and talk to your sister i think she is over there with captain green  mr bundercombe greeted me heartily and at once directed my attention to a small tent where cool drinks were being served i suffered him to lead me in that direction and placed myself in his hands as regards the selection of a suitable beverage we found a small table and sat down havent seen much of you lately sir i began  huh thats because i dont spend three parts of my time in milliners shops mr bundercombe replied  where are you spending most of your time i asked determined to take the bull by the horns  mr bundercombe set down his glass  ive been expecting this he remarked pleasantly eves been setting you on to pump me eh  i nodded  thats exactly it i admitted we are due to be married in ten days we are neither of us anxious for anything in the way of an unfortunate incident  mr bundercombe appeared to view with surprise the advent of a second tumbler he reconciled himself to its arrival however and handed money to the attendant  i realize the position entirely my dear fellow he assured me i am glad you have opened the subject up i have been bursting to tell you all about it but i have hesitated for fear of being misunderstood  i glanced at his nails  of course i observed slowly the position of an elderly gentleman with a marriageable daughter and a wife i went on bravely who finances a young lady interested in manicuring in an establishment in bond street is liable to misinterpretation  mr bundercombe was a little taken aback he hid his face for a moment behind the newly arrived tumbler  kind of observant arent you he remarked  i saw you in bond street this morning i told him you and a paper parcel you were entering the establishment i believe of mademoiselle blanche whoever she is  small place london mr bundercombe sighed were youeralone  i was with eve i replied but she did not see you and i did not mention the matter  my boy mr bundercombe decided i shall take you wholly into my confidence i am engaged in a big affair my heart sank  i can only pray to heaven i said fervently that the d√©nouement of this affair will not take place within the next ten days  on the contrary mr bundercombe answered leaning back in his chair and looking at me with the flat of one hand laid on the table and the palm of the other on his left knee on the contrary he repeated the d√©nouement is due tomorrow  glad you didnt consider us i observed gloomily  mr bundercombe smiled  i find myself in this last affair he remarked airily occupying what i must confess for me is a somewhat peculiar position i am on the side of the established authorities i am in the castiron position of the man who falls into line with the law of the land in other words you behold in me so far as regards this affair respectability and rectitude personified i may even choose to give our friend mr cullen a leg up  i was relieved to hear it and told him so  i presume i said that mademoiselle blanche of bond street is identical with the young lady who talked to us at stephanos the other night  say youre becoming perfectly wonderful at the art of deduction my future fatherinlaw declared same person  she seems quite attractive i admitted with a taste for pink roses i think  mr bundercombe appeared to regard my remark as frivolous he moved his chair however and brought it closer to mine  i dare say you remember he went on how the young lady proposed to me that night that i should finance a little venture in which she and her sleepyeyed friend opposite were interested  i nodded  yes i remember that  from that mr bundercombe continued she went on to suggest that i should help her in the ambition of her life which it seems was to take a single room for manicuring a few clients in an ordinary way i should have refused that too and if she had been hard up begged to be allowed to oblige her with a trifling loanand ended the matter in that way the reason i didnt was simply because i felt convinced that her desire to require a single room in the manicure business was somehow associated with the scheme she had at first suggested therefore i temporized i appeared to be interested i asked her in what locality she wished to commence business she never hesitated there was only one place she wanted and that was the room shes got just to test her i took her to see really slapup premises in another part of bond street she pretended to look at them but never took the slightest interest it was just one room she wantedand one room only  i realized that both she and her friend were either too desperately hard up to engage that room or else they were particularly anxious to do it in some one elses name that was quite enough for me i engaged the room  i glanced once more at mr bundercombes nails you at any rate i remarked have been a faithful customer  paul mr bundercombe continued i am playing a part i am playing the part of a silly old fool it isnt easy sometimes but i am keeping it up i spend a good part of my time in that beastly little parlor having my nails done over and over again the girl is bored to death and ithough i flatter myself i dont show iti guess im bored to death too ive kept it up all right until now and the job comes off tomorrow miss blanche is convinced that my interest in her is sentimental and she has occasionally not been quite so careful as she might have been i have picked up here and there certain small details that enable me to form a very fair idea as to the nature of this venture in which i was invited to participate the last few days i have been hesitating whether i should take you into my confidence or not as it happens you have forced it have you anything particular to do tomorrow  i thought for a moment nothing very much until the late afternoon when i go down to the house i replied  then tomorrow you shall see the end of this thing with me mr bundercombe promised if luck goes our way you will find we shall have quite a pleasant few minutes  eve put her head in at the tent and we hastened to join her she drew me a little on one side  i think its all right i told her  i am so glad she replied and paul hadnt you better drop dad a hint that mrs bundercombe will be home tomorrow i think hed better have the shine taken off his nails                                at twelve oclock the next morning i met mr bundercombe by appointment in the burlington arcade we strolled slowly round into bond street mr bundercombe was for him unusually serious he looked about him all the time with swift careful glances as we turned into bond street his pace became slower and slower within a yard or two of the spot where i had first seen him disappear he paused and under pretense of talking earnestly to me he looked up and down and across the street with keen careful glances  at last with a sudden turn he led the way into the passage together we ascended the stairs on a door almost opposite to us at the end of the landing was another little brass plate on which was engraved the name of mademoiselle blanche mr bundercombe took a latchkey from his pocket and opened the door which he carefully closed after him  no one here i remarked  not yet mr bundercombe said a little grimly from now onward you will be able to understand certain things miss blanche informed me that today she had an invitation to go into the country it was the only way i could discover the day in which they were planning to bring off the coup if i had been an occasional visitor she might have risked my coming and finding her away since however i presented myself every morning at eleven oclock she was forced to tell me you understand as much as that  perfectly  you see where we are then mr bundercombe continued has any reason occurred to you for the young ladys unalterable decision that no other spot in the whole of london would do for her manicure parlor  i looked out the window  we are next door to tarterans i observed  mr bundercombe smiled approvingly  we are within a few yards he said of the jewelers shop that contains more valuable gems than any other establishment in the world we are at the present moment within forty yards of a million pounds worth of jewels when you come to reflect upon the character and the past of our friend dagger rodwell you will understand the significance of that fact  i was beginning to share mr bundercombes obvious excitement i too had the feeling that we were on the brink of an adventure he made me stand up against the wall by the side of the window so that i could see down into the street he himself was farther back in the room  follow my lead closely in everything paul he directed meantime keep your eye glued on the pavement if things turn out as i expect there will be a gray touring motor car outside tarterans shop in the course of a few minutes from that car will descend dagger rodwell he will enter tarterans watch then as though your very life depended upon it  i squeezed myself against the wall and looked down upon the neverending procession the street was continually blocked with motor cars and taxicabs on the other side of the way streams of people were moving all the time i recognized many acquaintances even in those few minutes and then suddenly i saw the gray motor car i held out my hand to mr bundercombe  without the slightest attempt at concealment the man mr bundercombe had called dagger rodwell alighted from the motor and stood for a moment looking into the windows of tarterans shop before he entered he was faultlessly dressed in morning clothes smoking a cigarette and carrying a silverheaded cane  after some hesitation he entered the shop mr bundercombe drew a little breath he had been looking at another part of the street  now things are beginning to move he observed softly come here paul  he pulled aside a little curtain behind which was a sort of cubiclean easy chair a manicurists stool and a table  step inside here he whispered quickly  i obeyed him and in an instant he had entered a similar one we were scarcely there before i heard the sound of a key in the door through a chink in the curtain i saw miss blanche she pushed back the latch and stood for a moment as though listening her face turned toward the stairs up which she had come  if i had had any doubt but that tragedy was afoot that morning it would have been banished by a glance at her face she was terribly pale her hands were shaking rapidly she withdrew the pins from her hat hung it upon a peg and smoothed her hair in front of the lookingglass then though her hands were trembling all the time she filled a bowl with hot water and arranged a manicure set on a little table  once or twice she stopped to listen once as though drawn by some fascination she was powerless to resist she moved to the window and looked down into the street mr bundercombe remained motionless and i followed his example at the back of my cubicle was a window from which i could still gain a view of the pavement the streets were thronged with people and i noticed that the motor car which at first i had missed was standing in a side street almost opposite  suddenly i saw the man for whose reappearance i was so earnestly waiting step casually out on to the pavement he attempted to cross the street and was quickly lost to sight in a tangle of vehicles a second later i could have sworn that i saw him back again at the entrance to the passage below  then i heard a shout from the pavement and i distinctly saw him clamber into the motor car which shot off as though it had started in fourth speed an elderly gentleman who had rushed from the shop was halfway across the street already there was a chorus of shouts traffic was momentarily suspended a policeman started running down the side street then i turned away from the window there were sounds closer at handa footstep on the stairs swift and gentle  in a moment the door of the little manicure room was opened and closed dagger rodwell stood there pale and breathless not a word passed between him and the girl he dashed into the third of the little cubicles and it seemed to me that in less than thirty seconds he reappeared  the change was marvelous he was wearing a tweed suit and a gray homburg hat his eyeglass had gone even his collar and tie seemed different he sat down before the girl and held out his hand they listened there was plenty of commotion in the streetno sound at all on the stairs  weve done it he muttered theyre after the car theyll catch dolly  hell bluff it out she whispered  sure dont let your hands tremble like that you little fool were safe i tell you get on with your work  now the two were three or four yards away from the cubicle in which i was but almost within a couple of feet of mr bundercombes from where i was sitting i saw suddenly a strange thing i saw mr bundercombes left arm shoot out from behind the curtain in a moment he had the man by the throat his other hand traveled over his clothes like lightning  it was all over almost before i could think rodwell was on his feet with a livid mark on his throat and mr bundercombe had stepped back with a little shining revolver in his hand which he was carefully stowing away in his pocket  sorry to be a trifle hasty mr rodwell he said i saw the shape of this little weapon in your pocket and it didnt seem altogether agreeable to me we are not great at firearms over this side you know  blanche and rodwell stared at him to complete their stupefaction i stepped out of my cubicle  what sort of a game is this rodwell muttered though he was pale to the lips blanche  he turned toward her with sudden fierceness she sat there wringing her hands  mr bundercombe she exclaimed feebly mr bundercombe  so this is your silly old fool is it rodwell hissed this is the old fool you could twist round your finger who found the money for your manicure parlor and who was in love with you eh what are you anyway he added turning furiously upon mr bundercombe a cop is this why you were trying to put up to me a few weeks ago  mr bundercombe waved aside the accusation  nothing of the sort he declared  then what is it you want rodwell demanded is it a share of the swag youre after  mr bundercombe shook his head  i am afraid he sighed there will not be any swag  rodwells face was the most vicious thing i had ever looked on yet he kept his head mr bundercombe and i were an impossible proposition to an unarmed man  in the first place mr bundercombe said i must congratulate you most heartily on your scheme i saw your double bolt across the road and jump into the car everyones eyes were upon him they never saw you slip round into the passage your double is i presume well supplied with an alibi and evidences of respectability  rodwell nodded shortly  its his own car and hes an automobile agent he replied hed been in the next shop the people there will be able to swear to himhe gave them plenty of trouble on purpose  and you mr bundercombe murmured have the necklace  i have rodwell snapped what about it ive got to divide with the girl here how much do you want  only the necklace mr bundercombe replied  mr rodwells geographical description of where he would see mr bundercombe first is too lurid for print mr bundercombe however only shook his head with a gentle smile upon his lips  if youre not a cop and you wont stand in what in the name of glory are you rodweil spluttered at last  i am afraid i must describe myself as a meddler mr bundercombe confessed an intervener i stand midway between the law and the criminal i sympathize wholly with neither i admire the skill and courage you have shown today but i also sympathize with the head of that establishment whom you have relieved of possibly many thousand pounds worth of diamonds i could not  rodwell made his effort but mr bundercombe was more than ready intervention on my part was quite unnecessary mr bundercombes left arm shot out like a pistonrod and the unfortunate victim of his blow remained on the carpet with his hand to his cheek  quite in order of course mr bundercombe remarked but absolutely useless boxing was my only sport when i was a young man to say nothing of my remarkably athletic young companion it wont do rodwell youd better hand over the jewels give them to miss blanche and shell hand them to me theyre in a morocco case i think in your trousers pocket  rodwell produced them sullenly  its your fault you miserable little fool he muttered to blanche i ought to have known better than to have let you into the thing fancy taking him for a mug  mr bundercombe smiled a pleased smile  come come he said things are not so bad you might have been caught  arent you going to give information rodwell asked quickly  not a thought of it mr bundercombe assured him catching the case rodwell threw toward him i want so far as possible to see both sides happy here paul put these in your pocket he added turning to me if you take my advice rodwell he concluded youll stay where you are until i return i promise you that mr walmsley and i will return alone and that i will give no intimation of your presence here to any person whatsoever  rodwell was puzzled he rose slowly to his feet however and walked toward the basin at the other end of the apartment  all right he agreed sullenly i shall be here  mr bundercombe and i descended into the street i was feeling a little dazed mr bundercombe led the way into the tarteran establishment which was still in a state of disorder he asked to speak to the principal who came forward still looking very perturbed  sorry to hear of this robbery mr bundercombe said have they caught the fellow  they caught the man in the motor car the manager groaned but he had no jewels on him and my people cant swear to him he seems to have a very coherent story  have you communicated with the police mr bundercombe asked  the manager stretched out his hand  four of them are in the place now he answered a little despairingly whats the good the fellows got away hes got the finest necklace in the shop with him gems worth twenty thousand pounds  mr bundercombe nodded sympathetically  have you offered a reward yet  we cant do everything in ten minutes the manager replied a little testily we shall offer one of course  what amount are you prepared to go to mr bundercombe asked  the man looked at him eagerly  do you mean sir he began  mr bundercombe stretched out his hands  you may search me he interrupted i have nothing in the way of jewels on me my name is joseph h bundercombe and i have a house in princes gardens this is my soninlawtobe mr walmsley mp for bedfordshire  the manager bowed  i know you quite well sir he said and mr walmsley of course both he and many of his relatives are valued clients of ours but about the jewels  what reward do you offer  five hundred pounds was the prompt reply more if necessary  mr bundercombe smiled approvingly  circumstances he explained of a peculiar nature into which i am quite sure it will suit your purpose not to inquire have enabled me to claim the reward and to restore to you the jewels  the manager gripped him by the arm  come into the office at once he begged  we followed him into a little room at the back of the shop he was trembling all over  no questions asked mr bundercombe insisted  not the shadow of one the manager agreed i dont care ifpardon me sirif you stole them yourself the loss of those jewels would do the firm more harm than i can explain to you  mr bundercombe turned toward me and i produced the case the manager seized it eagerly opened it turned on the electric light and closed the case again with a great sigh of relief he held out his hand  mr bundercombe he said i dont care how you got these i have been robbed three times and put the matter into the hands of the policeand never recovered a single stone id shake hands with the man who stole them so long as i got them back how will you have the reward sir  notes if you can manage it mr bundercombe replied  the manager went to his safe and counted over notes and gold to the amount of five hundred pounds which mr bundercombe buttoned up in his pockets  i ask you now sir he said for your word of honor that you will not have us followed or make any further inquiries into this affair  it is givenfreely given the manager promised when you leave this establishment i shall turn my back to you you may hand over the notes to whosoever you like upon the pavement outside and it wont concern me nor he added shall i tell the police for at least half an hour that i have the necklace they deserve a little extra trouble for letting the fellow get away  mr bundercombe and i left the shop and ascended the stairs leading to the manicure parlor rodwell who had bathed his face and made a complete change of toilet was pacing up and down the little room blanche too was there still pale and weeping  now mr bundercombe began as he carefully closed the door behind him i told you a few minutes ago i was neither on your side nor on the side of the law i am about to prove it i have returned the jewels to tarterans no questions to be asked and ive got the reward there you are young lady he added placing the roll of notes and a handful of gold in her hand you have given me a week or so of intense interest and amusement there is your reward for it if you want to divide it with your friend its nothing to do with me take it and run along so far as regards this little establishment the rent is paid for another three months but so far as regards my connection with it i think i neednt explain  that youve been fooling me the girl interrupted a faint smile at the corners of her lips do you know sometimes i suspected that you werent in earnest and then one day i saw your wifeand i wasnt sure  good morning mr bundercombe said severely come along paul     chapter xvlord porthonings lesson  mr bundercombe laid his hand compellingly on my arm whos the wizenedup little insect with a snarl on his face he inquired of me earnestly  my slight impulse of irritation at such a description applied to one of my wedding guests passed when i looked up and saw the person to whom mr bundercombe had directed my attention i recognized the adequacy of the wording  that i replied is the earl of porthoning  kind of connection isnt he mr bundercombe inquired  i nodded  his son married my sister  mr bundercombe regarded him with a certain wistfulness which i did not at that moment understand just then lord porthoning made his way toward us as i watched him approach i realized more than ever the justice of mr bundercombes description he was undersized bent nearly double and on his wizened face and shining out of his narrow black eyes was an indescribable expression of malevolence even the smile with which he greeted me had something unpleasant in it  well paul he exclaimed well my boy so youre hooked at last are you  considering that i was enjoying a few minutes respite in my task of helping eve receive our wedding guests the statement though crude was obvious enough  glad to see you lord porthoning i said lying miserably do you know my fatherinlaw mr bundercombe  mr bundercombe extended his ready hand which my connection however appeared not to see  yes yes he admitted some one pointed him out to me i asked who on earth it could be no offense mind lord porthoning continued but i hate all americans and our connections with them i have been looking at your presents paul a poorish lota poorish lot now i was at dick stanleys wedding last weekmarried colonel morrisons daughter you know never saw such jewelry in my life four necklaces and a tiara from the duchess of westshire that must have been worth a cool ten thousand pounds  i am sorry my wedding presents do not meet with your approval i remarked personally i think it is very kind of my friends to send me anything at all  rubbish paul rubbish my amiable connection interjected irritably dont talk like an idiot you know they send you things because theyve got to youve been through it yourself must have cost you a pretty penny in your time sending out wedding presents now you reap the harvest  i suppose i observed dryly that yours is the reasonable point of view  absolutely my dear fellowabsolutely lord porthoning declared of course you couldnt expect quite the same enthusiasm on the part of your friends when you marry a young lady who is a stranger to all of them and who comes from the backwoods of america cant think how it is you young englishmen can marry nothing nowadays unless it shows its legs upon the stage or has a transatlantic drawl i am going in to see if the champagne theyre opening now is any better the first glass i had was horrid  my fatherinlaw watched him disappear through the crowd and stood patiently by my side while i exchanged greetings with a few newly arrived friends  say he observed presently as soon as an opportunity rose for private conversation hes a pleasant old gentleman that connection of yours  glad you think so i answered i dont call myself a badnatured fellow and today i feel inclined to be friends with every one but i tell you frankly i cant bear the sight of lord porthoning he has to be asked but hes like a wet blanket wherever he goes  mr bundercombe glanced round a moment then he leaned toward me his manner was earnestalmost pleading  paul he said dropping his voice to a whisper dont you think its up to us to give a disagreeable little worm like that a bit of a lesson eh his lordship has his own way too much now if youll leave it to me ill give him just a kind of a scarea shakeup you knowno real harm just teach him perhaps not to open his mouth so much what do you say paul  i turned and looked at my fatherinlaw his expression was that of a schoolboy begging for a holiday his head was a little on one side his lips were parted in an insinuating smile it was a weak moment with me so far as such a term can be applied to such an event the wedding ceremony which was just over had been a great success eve had looked simply as beautiful as a beautiful girl can look on the one morning of her life  my fatherinlaw had been dignified and correct in his behavior and a merciful misadventure of mrs bundercombe with a policeman three days previously which had led to her being arrested with a hammer in her satchel had finally resulted in her being forced to partake of the hospitality of holloway for the period of fourteen days in fact everything just then with me was couleur de rose  the presents my crabbed connection spoke of so lightly had been supplemented only an hour before by surely the most magnificent wedding offering from my fatherinlaw that any man could havethe house in which we were and the whole of the furniture it was hard to refuse mr bundercombe anything before i knew exactly what had happened my smile had answered his  well i said i rely upon your discretion mr bundercombe a little lesson would certainly do porthoning no harm  whereupon mr bundercombe fearing apparently that i might change my mind vanished among the crowd and the matter to tell the truth disappeared from my mind for a short time i was surrounded by friends and the occasion joyful though it was possessed a certain unique sentimentality that i found sufficiently absorbing eve brought me the latest telegram from mrs bundercombe which we read together  insist upon ceremony being postponed am commencing hunger strike shall be with you in three days  your stepmothers intentions i remarked to eve may be excellent but i dont think theyll bring her so far as the austrian tyrol  eves eyes were lit with laughter a moment later however she sighed  poor dad she murmured im afraid hell have a terrible time when she does come out  hed have a worse if she knew i rejoined half to myself  eve looked at me suspiciously she drew a little nearer  paul she whispered in my ear is it true that the inspector who had her followed all that morning was a friend of dads i shook my head  i am giving nobody away i replied firmly of course there were certain troubles to be got over in connection with your mothers presence today you remember her saying for instance that she would break every bottle of wine she found being served  eve nodded  perhaps she murmured with a half smile it is for the best where is dad  i glanced round the room and at that moment i saw mr bundercombe making signs to me from the doorway i hurried toward him and he drew me out into the hall  things are in train paul he announced cheerfully now all i want from you is just the smallest amount of help in this little affair  i looked at him blankly i had forgotten all about lord porthoning  its a very small share indeed mr bundercombe continued pleadingly but such as it is its up to you to take it on at this moment there the little insect goes into the cloakroom he has gone for his hat and coat all youve got to do is just to follow him and ask him to come back for one moment that little room on the left across the hall is empty bring him into that leave the rest to me  youre not going too far are you i asked you see after all the old blackguard is a sort of connection  mr bundercombe laid his hand on my shoulder  my boy he said there will be nothing but just a little incident that you can tell to eve and laugh about on your way to the station that i promise you  i nodded and crossed the hall lord porthoning was preparing to leave have my car called up he ordered the footman from the doorstep mind im not going to hang about on the pavement in this sun for any one if thats the motor waiting for the young people itll have to get out of the way lord porthonings car at once young fellow hello paul he added come to see me off eh  could i have just one word with you lord porthoning i begged as casually as possible  be quick then if i havent wished you happiness its because i cant see what chance you have of getting it but i suppose youre like all other young fools on their wedding dayyou think the suns shining only for you  i am afraid i retorted a little nettled that i had not noticed the absence of your good wishes i wish to speak to you on another matter  lord porthoning turned quickly and looked at me there was a change in his expression that puzzled me  well out with it he snapped  i pointed to the door across the hall  i want you to step this way i said firmly  i expected an irritable outburst but to my surprise he turned and preceded me toward the door we entered the room and found mr bundercombe there alone lord porthoning looked from one to the other of us his heavy gray eyebrows were drawn together his face was the embodiment of a snarl  now what in the name of all thats reasonable he began in his hard rasping voice made you bring me in here i dont want to better my acquaintance with that old man your fatherinlaw id a good deal rather hed stayed in his own country i dont like the looks of himi hate fat men dont keep me waiting here paul if you want my advice ill give it to you if you want anything else you wont get it  mr bundercombe had moved softly round until he was standing with his back to the door his manner was the one he had assumed so successfully in churchdignified almost solemn  paul he said i asked you to invite this person in here because now that you are eves husband i felt that the interests of your family must be considered before my own inclinations in my country we treat all men alike and i am bound to say that if youd been married to eve out in okata and id seen any old skunk whether hed been an earl or what he looks likea secondhand clothes dealersneaking eves presents id have had him in prison before youd reached the station  mr bundercombe i exclaimed horrified it seemed to me that my father inlaw was carrying this affair too far  lord porthoning from whom i had expected a torrent of fierce abuse stood looking at us both with an expression no written words could portray his cheeks were ashen his hands which were crossed upon the knob of his cane were shaking mr bundercombe extended his right hand  sir he concluded sternly for the sake of the conventions of the country in which i find myself and bearing in mind your connection with my soninlaw i have kept the police out of this interview be so good as to hand over to paul the emerald brooch you have secreted in your coat pocket  the pall of silence seemed suddenly removed lord porthoning leaned forward then he began to talk any sympathy i might have felt for him any feeling i may have had that my fatherinlaws retributive scheme was of too drastic a nature vanished before he had finished the first three sentences mr bundercombe upon whom he heaped abuse of the most virulent character remained unmoved when at last lord porthoning paused for breath i turned toward my fatherinlaw  what does this mean i asked  it means mr bundercombe explained that this gentleman who finds my daughters presents so inadequate was actually leaving your house with an emerald brooch belonging to eve in the righthand pocket of his coat  lord porthoning was once more incoherent this time however i stopped him i was already heartily sick of the affair but at this stage i could not back out  lord porthoning i said there is no necessity for such vigorous denials the matter is easily arranged you had better permit me to examine the pocket in question  ill see you and your common bully of a fatherinlaw in hell before i allow either of you to touch me or my clothing my pleasant connection declared fiercely get out of my way both of you and be thankful if you dont have to answer for this outrage in a police court  he swaggered toward the door mr bundercombe who had appeared to stand on one side suddenly caught him by the shoulders  feel in his righthand pocket paul he bade me  i did so and promptly produced the brooch lord porthonings eyes seemed almost to start from his head i could see that he suddenly became limp in mr bundercombes grasp his eyes were fixed on the jewels and his amazement was undeniable mr bundercombe winked at me over his head  what is the meaning of this lord porthoning i demanded as sternly as i could  my courage was failing me i felt that the joke after all had been a severe one lord porthoning seemed almost on the point of collapse his eyes never once left the brooch which i was holding  i didnt take it he gasped i swear i didnt take it  i was anxious now to finish the affair  lord porthoning i said i will take your word you say you never took the brooch very well we will assume for the sake of the family that it found its way into your pocket by accident  lord porthoning felt his forehead there were big drops of sweat standing out there there was something in his extreme agitation that was in a way incomprehensible he edged toward the door  i didnt take it he muttered let me go let me get away  mr bundercombe stood on one side my hand was on the handle of the door i looked at my fatherinlaw questioningly my sympathies were now almost with the enemy but i felt bound to see the affair through  it was you who discovered this little accident i remarked i think you will agree with me that it is best to say nothing more about it  mr bundercombe once more winked at me solemnly over the head of my stricken connection  i quite agree with you paul he said under the circumstances we will let nothing happen to disturb the festivities and harmony of the day lord porthoning certainly will not object if we just satisfy ourselves that the brooch was the only instance ofmomentary aberration shall we call it  if lord porthonings attitude had been a little mysterious before it was absolutely incomprehensible now he stood suddenly upright and brandished his cane over his head  if either of you touch me he shouted fiercely ill break your skulls this is blackmail ill send for the police let me go  his sudden fit of anger justifiable though it certainly seemed on the face of it nevertheless took both mr bundercombe and myself by surprise the former indeed was in the act of opening the door when he paused once more he caught my connection by the collar and thrust his hand into the other coat pocket when he withdrew it it was filled with rings a bracelet and a pendant  he threw them silentlya glittering heapon the table without a word he thrust his hand in once more and brought out a little black ivory carving of a japanese monk which was perhaps one of the most valuable of my offerings  there was a blankness in mr bundercombes expression that i could not understand  i frowned it seemed to me the affair had now gone much too far lord porthoning had staggered to a chair and was sitting there with his face buried in his hands he was a stricken man i turned to my fatherinlaw  this is too much of a good thing sir i whispered angrily the brooch was all right enough so far as it went and he deserved a lesson but these other things  a look in mr bundercombes face suddenly froze the words upon my lips he leaned over toward me  paul he declared earnestly on my honor i put nothing into his pocket except the brooch i knew no more of those things he added pointing to the table than you did  i was speechless lord porthoning looked up i had never seen a face quite like his in my life one side of it seemed drawn with pain he checked a sob his fingers gripped at the air as he spoke  paul he begged hysterically dont give me away i give you my word of honori give you my word as a porthoningi cant help it you know what they call the damned thing when women have itkleptomania isnt it i tell you i cant see these things without that same horrible fascinating cruel instinct my hands are on them before i know it but he broke off its sending me mad paul for as i live i never put hands on that brooch  how long has this been going on i asked almost mechanically perhaps you are the reason that it has become the fashion to send detectives to guard wedding presents  i am the reason lord porthoning confessed his voice shaking paul somehow i believei believe this has stopped it youll kill the instinct listen you are off directly let this gentleman your father inlaw come round to my house i will restore to him i swear every article i have ever taken in this fashion he can find out the owners by degrees and i promise that i will never again attend a wedding reception so long as i live  outside i could hear them calling for me i glanced at the clock it was within a few minutes of the time fixed for our departure mr bundercombe nodded to me  very well i agreed it shall be as you say  ill wait here lord porthoning said in a trembling tone mr bundercombe can come back for me after he has seen you off he can go home with me in the motor taketake care of those things  mr bundercombe covered them over with an antimacassar we left lord porthoning sitting there and went out into the hall where eve was already waiting mr bundercombe was a little unnerved but he pulled himself together  word of honor paul he declared i never saw the old rat take a thing i simply landed him with the brooch it was not until he was going out that i caught a glimpse of those other things in his pocket  we drove off ten minutes later i looked out of the motor as we swung round into the main thoroughfare behind the window of the little sitting room i saw the pale almost ghastly face of lord porthoning he caught my eye and waved his hand weakly  on the pavement in front of the striped awning stood mr bundercombe large beaming both hands outstretched eve waved her handkerchief as we finally disappeared she glanced toward me  has dad been up to anything paul she asked he has just that kind of satisfied expression that always used to terrify me  like a cat licking its whiskers after a stolen saucer of milk i suggested  she laughed  you mustnt make fun of dad she begged hes such a dear  i shall never attempt to make fun of your father i assured her fervently i think he is quite the most remarkable man i ever met and now
