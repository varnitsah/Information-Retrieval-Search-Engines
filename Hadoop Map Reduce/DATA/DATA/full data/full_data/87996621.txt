cloak  she is dressed in a high evening      frock of some soft white material  her movements are quick and      substantial  her face full of no nonsense is decided and      sincere with deepset eyes and a capable wellshaped      forehead  shredding of her gloves she warms her hands       in the doorway appear the figures of two men  the first is      rather short and slight with a soft short beard bright soft      eyes and a crumply face  under his squash hat his hair is      rather plentiful and rather grey  he wears an old brown ulster      and woollen gloves and is puffing at a handmade cigarette  he      is anns father wellwyn the artist  his companion is a      wellwrapped clergyman of medium height and stoutish build with      a pleasant rosy face rather shining eyes and rather chubby      cleanshaped lips in appearance indeed a grownup boy  he is      the vicar of the parishcanon bertley   bertley  my dear wellwyn the whole question of reform is full of difficulty

wellperhaps not  you know ann i admire that fellow wonderful power ofoftheory  how a man can be so absolutely tidy in his mind  its most exciting  ann  has any one begged of you today  wellwyn

all we can spare to make the undeserving deserving  hes a professor he ought to know  but old hoxtons always dinning it into me that we ought to support private organisations for helping the deserving and damn the undeserving  well thats just the opposite  and hes a jp tremendous experience  and the vicar seems to be for a little bit of both  well what the devil  my trouble is whichever im with he

no stability       there comes a fluttering knock on the outer door  as the sound      slowly enters his consciousness he begins to wince as though      he knew but would not admit its significance  then he sits      down covering his ears  the knocking does not cease  wellwyn      drops first one then both hands rises and begins to sidle      towards the door  the knocking becomes louder  wellwyn  ah dear  tt  tt  tt       after a look in the direction of anns disappearance he opens      the street door a very little way  by the light of the lamp      there can be seen a young girl in

opens it and listens with a sort of      stealthy casualness  he returns whistling but not out loud      the girl has finished taking off her stockings and turned her      bare toes to the flames  she

the fire  wellwyn returns with a candle a      canarycoloured bath gown and two blankets  wellwyn  now then  he precedes her towards the door of the models room  hsssh  he opens the door and holds up

table cuts a large slice of cake knocks on the door and hands it in  chowchow  then as he walks away he sights the opposite door  welldamn it what could i have done  not a farthing on me he goes to the street door to shut it but first opens it wide to confirm himself in his hospitality  night like this       a sputter of snow is blown in his face  a voice says      monsieur pardon  wellwyn recoils spasmodically  a figure      moves from the lamppost to the doorway  he is seen to be young      and to have ragged clothes  he speaks again you do not      remember me monsieur  my name is

     an old and dirty wing card  as inch by inch he has advanced      into the doorway the light from within falls on him a tall      gaunt young pagan with fair hair and reddish golden stubble of      beard a long ironical nose a little to one side and large      grey rather prominent eyes  there is a certain grace in his      figure and movements his clothes are nearly dropping off him  wellwyn  yielding to a pleasant memory  ah  yes  by the fountain  i was sitting there and you came and ate a roll and drank the water  ferrand  with faint eagerness  my breakfast  i was in poverty veree bad off  you gave me ten francs  i thought i had a little the right wellwyn makes a movement of disconcertion  seeing you said that if i came to england  wellwyn  um  and so youve come  ferrand  it was

general view perhaps  well heartily  come in  very glad to see you again  ferrand  brushing his arms over his eyes pardon monsieuryour goodnessi am a little weak  he opens his coat and shows a belt drawn very tight over his ragged shirt  i tighten him one hole for each meal during two days now  that gives you courage  wellwyn  with cooing sounds pouring out tea and adding rum have some of this  itll buck you up  he watches the young man drink  ferrand  becoming a size larger  sometimes i think that i will never succeed to dominate my life monsieurthough i have no vices except that i guard always the aspiration to achieve success  but i will not roll myself under the machine of existence to gain a nothing every day  i must find with what to fly a little  wellwyn  delicately yes yesi

rapidly rolling a cigarette  if i had not found you monsieuri would have been a little hole in the river tonight i was so discouraged  he inhales and puffs a long luxurious whif of smoke  very bitterly  life  he disperses the puff of smoke with his finger and stares before him  and to think that in a few minutes he will be born  monsieur  he gazes intently at wellwyn the world would reproach you for your goodness to me  wellwyn  looking uneasily at the door into the house  you think so  ah  ferrand  monsieur if he himself were on earth now there would be a little heap of gentlemen writing to the journals every day to call him sloppee sentimentalist  and what is veree funny these gentlemen they would all be most strong christians  he regards wellwyn deeply  but that will not trouble you monsieur i saw well from the first that you are no christian  you have so kind a face  wellwyn  oh  indeed  ferrand  you have not enough the pharisee in your character  you do not

bit  i wonder if youd like these trousers theyveertheyre not quite       he passes through the door into the house  ferrand stands at      the fire with his limbs spread as it were to embrace it      smoking with abandonment  wellwyn returns stealthily dressed      in a jaeger dressinggown and bearing a pair of drawers his      trousers a pair of slippers and a sweater  wellwyn  speaking in a low voice for the door is still open  can you make these do for the moment  ferrand  je vous remercie monsieur  pointing to the screen may i retire  wellwyn  yes yes       ferrand goes behind the screen  wellwyn closes the door into      the house then goes to the window to draw the curtains  he      suddenly recoils and stands petrified with doubt  wellwyn  good lord       there is the sound of tapping on glass  against the      windowpane is pressed the face of a man wellwyn motions to him      to go away  he does not go but continues tapping  wellwyn      opens the door  there enters a square old man with a red      pendulous jawed shaking face under a snow besprinkled bowler      hat  he is holding out a visiting card with tremulous hand  wellwyn  whos that  who are you  timson  in

workbasket and takes      from it a needle and cotton       while he is so engaged ferrand is sizing up old timson as one      dog will another  the old man glass in hand seems to have      lapsed

     he sits down in the firelight curls up a foot on his knee and      taking out a knife rips the stitching of a turnedup end of      trouser pinches the cloth double and puts in the preliminary      stitch of a new hemall with the swiftness of one wellaccustomed      then as if hearing a sound behind him he gets up quickly and      slips behind the screen  mrs megan attracted by the cessation      of voices has opened the door and is creeping from the models      room towards the fire  she has almost reached it before she      takes in the torpid crimson figure of old timson she halts and      puts her hand to her chesta queer figure in the firelight      garbed in the canarycoloured bath gown and rabbitswool      slippers her black matted hair straggling down on her neck      having quite digested the fact that the old man is in a sort of      stupor mrs megan goes close to the fire and sits on the little      stool smiling sideways at old timson  ferrand coming quietly      up behind examines her from above drooping his long nose as if      enquiring with it as to her condition in life then he steps back      a yard or two  ferrand  gently pardon mamoiselle  mrs megan  springing to her feet  oh  ferrand  all right all right  we are brave gents  timson  faintly roused  old up there  ferrand  trust in me mamoiselle       mrs megan responds by drawing away  ferrand  gently  we

stove      she recoils  then standing her ground calls in a voice      sharpened by fright daddydaddy  timson stirring uneasily and struggling to his feet  all right im comin  ferrand  have no fear madame       in the silence that follows a clock begins loudly striking      twelve  ann remains as if carved in atone her eyes fastened      on the strangers  there is the sound of someone falling      downstairs and wellwyn appears also holding a candle above his      head  ann  look  wellwyn  yes yes my dear  itit happened  ann  with a sort of groan  oh  daddy       in the renewed silence the

         curtain     act ii  it is four oclock in the afternoon of new years day  on the raised dais mrs megan is standing in her rags with bare feet and ankles her dark hair as if blown about her lips parted holding out a dishevelled bunch of violets  before his easel wellwyn is painting her  behind him at a table between the cupboard and the door to the models room timson is washing brushes with the movements of one employed upon relief works  the samovar is hissing on the table by the stove the tea things are set out  wellwyn  open your mouth       mrs megan opens her mouth  ann  in hat and coat entering from the house  daddy       wellwyn goes to her and released from restraint mrs megan      looks round at timson and grimaces  wellwyn  well my dear       they speak in low voices

you can shut your mouth now       mrs megan shuts her mouth but opens it immediately to smile  wellwyn  spasmodically  ah  now thats what i want  he dabs furiously at the canvas  then standing back runs his hands through his hair and turns a painters glance towards the skylight  dash lights gone  off you get childdont tempt me       mrs megan descends  passing towards the door of the models      room she stops and stealthily looks at the picture  timson  ah  would yer  wellwyn  wheeling round  want to have a look  wellcome on       he takes her by the arm and they stand before the canvas

the coin goes towards the models room      she looks back at wellwyn as if to draw his eyes to her but he      is gazing at the picture then catching old timsons sour      glance she grimaces at him kicking up her feet with a little      squeal  but when wellwyn turns to the sound she is demurely      passing through the doorway  timson  in his voice of dubious sobriety  ive finished these yer

his forehead certainly sir  i quite understand  im not that sort as i think ive proved to yer comin here regular day after day all the week  theres one thing i ought to warn you perhapsi might ave to give this job up any day       he makes a faint demonstration with the little brush then puts      it absentmindedly into his pocket  wellwyn  gravely  id never stand in the way of your bettering yourself timson  and by the way my daughter spoke to a friend about you today  i think something may come of it  timson  oh  oh  she did  well it might do me a bit o good  he makes for the outer door but stops  that foreigner  e sticks in my gizzard  its not as if there wasnt plenty o pigeons for im to pluck in is own gawdforsaken country  reglar jay thats what i calls im  i could tell yer something       he has opened the door and suddenly sees that ferrand himself      is standing there  sticking out his lower lip timson gives a      roll of his jaw and lurches forth into the street  owing to a      slight miscalculation his face and raised arms are plainly      visible through the window as he fortifies himself from his      battle against the cold  ferrand having closed the door      stands with his thumb acting as pointer towards this spectacle      he is now remarkably dressed in an artists squashy green hat a      frock coat too small for him a bright blue tie of knitted silk      the grey trousers that were torn wellworn brown boots and a      tan waistcoat  wellwyn  what luck today  ferrand  with a shrug  again i have beaten all london monsieur not one bite  contemplating himself  i think perhaps that for the bourgeoisie there is a little too much colour in my costume  wellwyn  contemplating him  lets seei believe ive an old top hat somewhere  ferrand  ah  monsieur merci but that i could not  it is scarcely in my character  wellwyn  true  ferrand  i have been to merchants of wine of tabac to hotels to leicester square  i have been to a society for spreading christian knowledgei thought there i would have a chance perhaps as interpreter  toujours meme chose we regret we have no situation for yousame thing everywhere  it seems there is nothing doing in this town  wellwyn  ive noticed there never is  ferrand  i was thinking monsieur that in aviation there might be a career for mebut it seems one must be trained  wellwyn  afraid so ferrand  ferrand  approaching the picture  ah  you are always working at this  you will have something of very good there monsieur  you wish to fix the type of wild savage existing ever amongst our high civilisation  cest tres chic ca  wellwyn manifests the quiet delight of an english artist actually understood  in the figures of these good citizens to whom she offers her flower you would give the idea of all the cage doors open to catch and make tame the wild bird that will surely die within  tres gentil  believe me monsieur you have there the greatest comedy of life  how anxious are the tame birds to do the wild birds good  his voice changes for the wild birds it is not funny  there is in some human souls monsieur what cannot be made tame  wellwyn  i believe you ferrand       the face of a young man appears at the window unseen      suddenly ann opens the door leading to the house  ann  daddyi want you  wellwyn  to ferrand  excuse me a minute       he goes to his daughter and they pass out  ferrand remains      at the picture  mrs megan dressed in some of anns discarded      garments has come out of the models room  she steals up      behind ferrand like a cat reaches an arm up and curls it      round his mouth  he turns and tries to seize her she      disingenuously slips away he follows  the chase circles the      tea table  he catches her lifts her up swings round with      her so that her feet fly out kisses her bentback face and      sets her down  she stands there smiling the face at the      window darkens  ferrand  la valse       he takes her with both hands by the waist she puts her hands      against his shoulders to push him ofand suddenly they are      whirling  as they whirl they bob together once or twice and      kiss  then with a warning motion towards the door she      wrenches herself free and stops beside the picture trying      desperately to appear demure  wellwyn and ann have entered      the face has vanished  ferrand  pointing to the picture  one does not comprehend all this monsieur without well studying  i was in train to interpret for mamoiselle the chiaroscuro  wellwyn  with a queer look  dont take it too seriously ferrand  ferrand  it is a masterpiece  wellwyn  my daughters just spoken to a friend professor calway hed like to meet you  could you come back a little later  ferrand  certainly mamoiselle  that will be an opening for me i trust  he goes to the street door  ann  paying no attention to him  mrs megan will you too come back in half an hour  ferrand  tres bien mamoiselle i will see that she does  we will take a little promenade together  that will do us good       he motions towards the door mrs megan all eyes follows him      out  ann  oh  daddy they are rotters  couldnt you see they were having the most high jinks  wellwyn  at his picture  i seemed to have noticed something  ann  preparing for tea  they were kissing  wellwyn  tt  tt  ann  theyre hopeless all threeespecially her  wish i hadnt given her my clothes now  wellwyn  absorbed  something of wildsavage  ann  thank goodness its the vicars business to see that married people live together in his parish  wellwyn  oh  dubiously  the megans are roman catholicatheists ann  ann  with heat  then theyre all the more bound  wellwyn gives a sudden and alarmed whistle  ann  whats the matter  wellwyn  didnt you say you spoke to sir thomas too  suppose he comes in while the professors here  theyre cat and dog  ann  blankly  oh  as wellwyn strikes a match the samovar is lighted  taking up the nearly empty decanter of rum and going to the cupboard  its all right  he wont  wellwyn  well hope not       he turns back to his picture  ann  at the cupboard  daddy  wellwyn  hi  ann  there were three bottles  wellwyn  oh  ann  well  now there

much  ought to have kept it locked up  ann  you ought to keep him locked up       there is heard a mild but authoritative knock  wellwyn  heres the vicar  ann  what are you going to do about the rum

 thank gomoses  bertley  faintly surprised  from what i hear hes not really a bad youth  afraid he bets on horses  the great thing wellwyn with those poor fellows is to put your finger on the weak spot  ann  to herselfgloomily  thats not difficult  what would you do canon bertley with a man whos been drinking fathers rum  bertley  remove the temptation of course  wellwyn  hes done that  bertley  ah  thenwellwyn and ann hang on his words  then i shoulder  ann  abruptly  remove him  bertley  before i say that ann i must certainly see the individual  wellwyn  pointing to the window  there he is       in the failing light timsons face is indeed to be seen      pressed against the window pane  ann  daddy i do wish youd have thick glass put in  its so disgusting to be spied at  wellwyn going quickly to the door has opened it  what do you want  timson enters with dignity  he is fuddled  timson  slowly arskin yer pardonthought it me duty to come backfound thish yer little brishel on me  he produces the little paint brush  ann  in a deadly voice  nothing else       timson accords her a glassy stare  wellwyn  taking the brush hastily  thatll do timson thanks  timson  as i am ere can i do anything for yer  ann  yes you can sweep out that little room  she points to the models room  theres a broom in there  timson  disagreeably surprised  certainly never make bones about a little extranever ave in all me life  do it at onsh i will  he moves across to the models room at that peculiar broad gait so perfectly adjusted to his habits  you quite understand me couldnt bear to ave anything on me that wasnt mine       he passes out  ann  old fraud  wellwyn  in and on  mark my words hell restore thebottles  bertley  but my dear wellwyn that is stealing  wellwyn  we all have our discrepancies vicar  ann  daddy  discrepancies  wellwyn  well ann my theory is that as regards solids timsons an individualist but as regards liquids hes a socialist  or vice versa according to taste  bertley  no no we mustnt joke about it  gravely  i do think he should be spoken to  wellwyn  yes but not by me  bertley  surely youre the proper person  wellwyn  shaking his head  it was my rum vicar  look so personal       there sound a number of little tattat knocks  wellwyn  isnt that the professors knock       while ann sits down to make tea he goes to the door and opens      it  there dressed in an ulster stands a thin cleanshaved      man with a little hollow sucked into either cheek who taking      off a grey squash hat discloses a majestically bald forehead      which completely dominates all that comes below it  wellwyn  come in professor  so awfully good of you  you know canon bentley i think  calway  ah  how dyou do  wellwyn  your opinion will be invaluable professor  ann  tea professor calway       they have assembled round the tea table  calway  thank you no tea milk  wellwyn  rum       he pours rum into calways milk  calway  a littlethanks  turning to ann  you were going to show me some one youre trying to rescue or something i think  ann  oh  yes  hell be here directlysimply perfect rotter  calway  smiling  really  ah  i think you said he was a congenital  wellwyn  with great interest  what  ann  low  daddy  to calway yes ii think thats what you call him  calway  not old  ann  no and quite healthya vagabond  calway  sipping  i see  yes  is it do you think chronic unemployment with a vagrant tendency  or would it be nearer the mark to say vagrancy  wellwyn  pure  oh  pure  professor  awfully human  calway  with a smile of knowledge  quite  ander  ann  breaking in  before he comes theres another  bertley  blandly  yes when you came in we were discussing what should be done with a man who drinks rumcalway pauses in the act of drinkingthat doesnt belong to him  calway  really  dipsomaniac  bertley  wellperhaps you could tell usdrink certainly changing thine to mine  the professor could see him wellwyn  ann  rising  yes do come and look at him professor calway hes in there       she points towards the models room  calway smiles      deprecatingly  ann  no really we neednt open the door  you can see him through the glass  hes more than half  calway  well i hardly  ann  oh  do  come on professor calway  we must know what to do with him  calway rises  you can stand on a chair  its all science       she draws calway to the models room which is lighted by a      glass panel in the top of the high door  canon bertley also      rises and stands watching  wellwyn hovers torn between      respect for science and dislike of espionage  ann  drawing up a chair  come on  calway  do you seriously wish me to  ann  rather  its quite safe he cant see you  calway  but he might come out       ann puts her back against the door  calway mounts the chair      dubiously and raises his head cautiously bending it more and      more downwards  ann  well  calway  he appears to besitting on the floor  wellwyn  yes thats all right       bertley covers his lips  calway  to anndescending  by the look of his face as far as one can see it i should say there was a leaning towards mania  i know the treatment       there come three loud knocks on the door  wellwyn and ann      exchange a glance of consternation  ann  whos that  wellwyn  it sounds like sir thomas  calway  sir thomas hoxton  wellwyn  nodding  awfully sorry professor  you see we  calway  not at all  only i must decline to be involved in argument with him please  bertley  he has experience  we might get his opinion dont you think  calway  on a point of reform  a jp  bertley  deprecating  my dear sirwe neednt take it       the three knocks resound with extraordinary fury  ann  youd better open the door daddy       wellwyn opens the door  sir thomas hoxton is disclosed in a      fur overcoat and top hat  his square wellcoloured face is      remarkable for a massive jaw dominating all that comes above      it  his voice is resolute  hoxton  afraid i didnt make myself heard  wellwyn  so good of you to come sir thomas  canon bertley  they greet  professor calway you know i think  hoxton  ominously  i do       they almost greet  an awkward pause  ann  blurting it out  that old cabman i told you ofs been drinking fathers rum  bertley  we were just discussing whats to be done with him sir thomas  one wants to do the very best of course  the question of reform is always delicate  calway  i beg your pardon  there is no question here  hoxton  abruptly  oh  is he in the house  ann  in there  hoxton  works for you eh  wellwyn  eryes  hoxton  lets have a look at him       an embarrassed pause  bertley  wellthe fact is sir thomas  calway  when last under observation  ann  he was sitting on the floor  wellwyn  i dont want the old fellow to feel hes being made a show of  disgusting to be spied at ann  ann  you cant daddy  hes drunk  hoxton  never mind miss wellwyn  hundreds of these fellows before me in my time  at calway  the only thing is a sharp lesson  calway  i disagree  ive seen the man what he requires is steady control and the bobbins treatment       wellwyn approaches them with fearful interest  hoxton  not a bit of it  he wants one for his knob  brace em up its the only thing  bertley  personally i think that if he were spoken to seriously  calway  i cannot walk arm in arm with a crab  hoxton  approaching calway  i beg your pardon  calway  moving back a little youre moving backwards sir thomas  ive told you before convinced reactionaryism in these days       there comes a single knock on the street door  bertley  looking at his watch  dyou know im rather afraid this may be our young husband wellwyn  i told him halfpast four  wellwyn  oh  ah  yes  going towards the two reformers  shall we go into the house professor and settle the question quietly while the vicar sees a young man  calway  pale with uncompleted statement and gravitating insensibly in the direction indicated  the merest sense of continuitya simple instinct for order  hoxton  following  the only way to get order sir is to bring the disorderly up with a round turn  calway turns to him in the doorway  you people without practical experience  calway  if youll listen to me a minute  hoxton  i can show you in a mo       they vanish through the door  wellwyn  i was afraid of it  bertley  the two points of view  pleasant to see such keenness i may want you wellwyn  and ann perhaps had better not be present  wellwyn  relieved  quite so  my dear       ann goes reluctantly  wellwyn opens the street door  the      lamp outside has just been lighted and by its gleam is seen      the figure of rory megan thin pale youthful  ann turning at      the door into the house gives him a long inquisitive look      then goes  wellwyn  is that megan  megan  yus  wellwyn  come in       megan comes in  there follows an awkward silence during      which wellwyn turns up the light then goes to the tea table      and pours out a glass of tea and rum  bertley  kindly  now my boy how is it that you and your wife are living apart like this  megan  i dunno  bertley  well if you dont none of us are very likely to are we  megan  thats what i thought as

knock on the door  wellwyn  well now come  here she is       he points to the door and stands regarding megan with his      friendly smile  megan  with a gleam of responsiveness  i might perhaps to please you sir  bertley  appropriating the gesture  capital i thought we should get on in time  megan  yus       wellwyn opens the door  mrs megan and ferrand are revealed      they are about to enter but catching sight of megan      hesitate  bertley  come in  come in       mrs megan enters stolidly  ferrand following stands apart      with an air of extreme detachment  megan after a quick glance      at them both remains unmoved  no one has noticed that the      door of the models room has been opened and that the unsteady      figure of old timson is standing there  bertley a little awkward in the presence of ferrandto the megans  this begins a new chapter  we wont improve the occasion no need       megan turning towards his wife makes her a gesture as if to      say here  lets get out

the dais towards      the door which wellwyn holds open for him  timson  mechanically  where to sir       receiving no answer he passes out touching his hat and the      door is closed  wellwyn  ann       ann goes back whence she came       bertley steadily regarding mrs megan who has put her arm up      in front of her face beckons to ferrand and the young man      comes gravely forward  bertley

ferrand  it wasnt the square thing  ferrand  with dignity  monsieur i feel that i am in the wrong it was stronger than me       as he speaks sir thomas hoxton and professor calway enter      from the house  in the dim light and the full cry of      argument they do not notice the figures at the fire  sir      thomas hoxton leads towards the street door  hoxton  no sir i repeat if the country once commits itself to your views of reform its as good as doomed  calway  i seem to have heard that before sir thomas  and let me say at once that your hittymissy cartload of bricks regime  hoxton  is a deuced sight better sir than your grandmotherly methods  what the old fellow wants is a shock  with all this socialistic mollycoddling youre losing sight of the individual  calway  swiftly you sir with your devil take the hindmost have never even seen him       sir thomas hoxton throwing back a gesture of disgust steps      out into the night and falls heavily professor calway      hastening to his rescue falls more heavily still       timson momentarily roused from slumber on the doorstep sits      up  hoxton  struggling to his knees  damnation  calway  sitting  how simultaneous       wellwyn and ferrand approach hastily  ferrand pointing to timson  monsieur it was true it seems they had lost sight of the individual       a policeman has appeared under the street lamp  he picks up

behind him  ann returning begins to      brush the professors sleeve  wellwyn  turning from the door where he has stood looking after the receding timson  poor old timson  ferrand  softly  must be philosopher monsieur they will but run him in a little       from the models room mrs megan has come out shepherded by      canon bertley  bertley  lets see your christian name is  mrs megan

backs and gravely hissing  as he approaches      them they speak with a certain unanimity  hoxton  my theory  calway  my theory  bertley  my theory       they stop surprised  wellwyn makes a gesture of discomfort      as they speak again with still more unanimity  hoxton  my  calway  my  bertley  my       they stop in greater surprise  the stage is blotted dark

of straw and paper bags  through the door can be seen the butt end of a stationary furniture van with its flap let down  to this van three humblemen in shirt sleeves and aprons are carrying out the contents of the studio  the hissing samovar the teapot the sugar and the nearly empty decanter of rum stand on the low round table in the fastbeinggutted room  wellwyn in his ulster and soft hat is squatting on the little stool in front of the blazing fire staring into it and smoking a handmade cigarette  he has a moulting air behind him the humblemen pass embracing busts and other articles of vertu  chief hman  stopping and standing in the attitude of expectation  weve about pinched this little lot sir  shall we take thereservoir       he indicates the samovar  wellwyn  ah abstractedly

humblemen go out  there is the sound of horses being      started and the butt end of the van disappears  wellwyn stays      on his stool smoking and brooding over the fare  the open      doorway is darkened by a figure  canon bertley is standing      there  bertley  wellwyn  wellwyn turns and rises  its ages since i saw you  no idea you were moving  this is very dreadful  wellwyn  yes ann found

catching her scarf blows it out      beneath her firm young chin  wellwyn returning to the fire      stands brooding and gazing at his extinct cigarette  wellwyn  to himself  bad lotlow type  no method  no theory       in the open doorway appear ferrand and mrs megan  they      stand unseen looking at him  ferrand is more ragged if      possible than on christmas eve  his chin and cheeks are      clothed in a reddish golden beard  mrs megans dress is not      so woebegone but her face is white her eyes darkcircled      they whisper  she slips back into the shadow of the doorway      wellwyn turns at the sound and stares at ferrand in      amazement  ferrand  advancing  enchanted to see you monsieur  he looks round the empty room  you are leaving  wellwyn  noddingthen taking the young mans hand  how goes it  ferrand  displaying himself simply  as you see monsieur  i have done of my best  it still flies from me  wellwyn  sadlyas if against his will  ferrand it will always fly       the young foreigner shivers suddenly from head to foot then      controls himself with a great effort  ferrand  dont say that monsieur  it is too much the echo of my heart  wellwyn  forgive me  i didnt mean to pain you  ferrand  drawing nearer the fire  that old cabby monsieur you rememberthey tell me he nearly succeeded to gain happiness the other day       wellwyn nods  ferrand  and those sirs so interested in him with their theories he has worn them out  wellwyn nods  that goes without saying and now they wish for him the lethal chamber  wellwyn  startled  how did you know that       there is silence  ferrand  staring into the fire  monsieur while i was on the road this time i fell ill of a fever  it seemed to me in my illness that i saw the truthhow i was wasting in this worldi would never be good for any onenor any one for meall would go by and i never of itfame and fortune and peace even the necessities of life ever mocking me       he draws closer to the fire spreading his fingers to the      flame  and while he is speaking through the doorway mrs      megan creeps in to listen  ferrand  speaking on into the fire  and i saw monsieur so plain that i should be vagabond all my days and my days short i dying in the end the death of a dog  i saw it all in my fever clear as that flamethere was nothing for us others but the herb of death  wellwyn takes his arm and presses it  and so monsieur i wished to die  i told no one of my fever  i lay out on the groundit was verree cold  but they would not let me die on the roads of their parishesthey took me to an institution monsieur i looked in their eyes while i lay there and i saw more clear than the blue heaven that they thought it best that i should die although they would not let me  then monsieur naturally my spirit rose and i said so much the worse for you  i will live a little more  one is made like that  life is sweet monsieur  wellwyn  yes ferrand life is sweet  ferrand  that little girl you had here monsieur  wellwyn nods in her too there is something of wildsavage  she must have joy of life  i have seen her since i came back  she has embraced the life of joy  it is not quite the same thing  he lowers his voice she is lost monsieur as a stone that sinks in water  i can see if she cannot  as wellwyn makes a movement of distress  oh  i am not to blame for that monsieur  it had well begun before i knew her  wellwyn  yes yesi was afraid of it at the time       mrs megan turns silently and slips away  feerrand  i do my best for her monsieur but look at me  besides i am not good for herit is not good for simple souls to be with those who see things clear  for the great part of mankind to see anythingis fatal  wellwyn  even for you it seems  ferrand  no monsieur  to be so near to death has done me good i shall not lack courage any more till the wind blows on my grave since i saw you monsieur i have been in three institutions  they are palaces  one may eat upon the floorthough it is truefor kingsthey eat too much of skilly there  one little thing they lackthose palaces  it is understanding of the uman heart  in them tame birds pluck wild birds naked  wellwyn  they mean well  ferrand  ah  monsieur i am loafer wasterwhat you likefor all that  bitterly  poverty is my only crime  if i were rich should i not be simply veree original ighly respected with soul above commerce travelling to see the world  and that young girl would she not be that charming ladee  veree chic you know  and the old timsgood oldfashioned gentlemandrinking his liquor well eh

monsieur do you know this  you are the sole being that can do us goodwe hopeless ones  wellwyn  shaking his head  not a bit of it im hopeless too  ferrand  eagerly  monsieur it is just that  you understand when we are with you we feel somethingherehe touches his heart  if i had one prayer to make it would be good god give me to understand  those sirs with their theories they can clean our skins and chain our abitsthat soothes for them the aesthetic sense it gives them too their good little importance  but our spirits they cannot touch for they nevare understand  without that monsieur all is dry as a parched skin of orange  wellwyn  dont be so bitter  think of all the work they do  ferrand  monsieur of their industry i say nothing  they do a good work while they attend with their theories to the sick and the tame old and the good unfortunate deserving  above all to the little children  but monsieur when all is done there are always us hopeless ones  what can they do with me monsieur with that girl or with that old man  ah  monsieur we too ave our qualities we othersit wants you courage to undertake a career like mine or like that young girls  we wild oneswe know a

themit is life itself they would enclose  he draws up his tattered figure then bending over the fire again  i ask your pardon i am talking  if i could smoke monsieur       wellwyn hands him a tobacco pouch and he rolls a cigarette      with his yellowstained fingers  ferrand  the good god made me so that i would rather walk a whole month of nights hungry with the stars than sit one single day making round business on an office stool  it is not to my advantage  i cannot help it that i am a vagabond  what would you have  it is stronger than me  he looks suddenly at wellwyn monsieur i say to

doorway come a police constable and a loafer      bearing between them the limp white faced form of mrs megan      hatless and with drowned hair enveloped in the policemans      waterproof  some curious persons bring up the rear jostling      in the doorway among whom is timson carrying in his hands the      policemans dripping waterproof leg pieces  ferrand  starting forward  monsieur it is

chafes the girls hands and forehead and pours some      between her lips  but there is no response from the inert      body  ferrand  her soul is still away monsieur       wellwyn seizing the decanter pours into it tea and boiling      water  constable  its never drownin sirher head was hardly under i was on to her like knife  ferrand  rubbing her feet  she has not yet her philosophy monsieur at
