         illustrated by f a anderson  the penn publishing company philadelphia  copyright 1915 by the penn publishing company                         to                    w h t     a lover of the open and his three boys     this book is affectionately dedicated     illustration he saw something move     introduction   to those who have read the preceding volumes in this series the boy scouts of woodcraft camp the boy scouts on swift river and the boy scouts on lost trail some of the characters in the present volume will be familiar to me they are old friends in whose struggles and adventures i have taken the keenest personal interest  in this the fourth and concluding volume i have endeavored to portray in some small measure the life of the trapper who in solitude and loneliness pits his skill against the cunning of the furbearers and his courage and fortitude against the forces of nature in her harshest and most relentless mood to bring to my young readers a sense of the mystery of the great life eternal that broods over the wilderness to an even greater degree when its waters are fettered in ice and its waste places wrapped in snow than when it rejoices in its summer verdure to show that the standards a man or a boy sets for himself are as binding upon him in remote places where none may see as in the midst of his fellow men and lastly to demonstrate what a powerful factor in the development of character and true manhood are the oath and law of the boy scouts of america when subscribed to in sincerity and conscientiously observed  man or boy is never so true to himself as when in intimate contact with nature adventures such as herein described may not fall to your lot oh boy reader but be assured that whenever you heed the call of the red gods and hit the long trail you will find adventure of a degree awaiting you and you will return stronger physically and mentally for having come in closer contact with the elemental forces which we term nature      the author     contents          i an interrupted dream        ii pat sees white magic       iii the blue tortoise patrol        iv help         v off for woodcraft        vi snowshoes and

the boy scouts in a trappers camp     chapter i  an interrupted dream   walter upton pushed aside books and papers yawned stretched yawned again then settled back in his chair comfortably his hands clasped behind his head  im glad that vacation is only one week off he murmured school is all right and i know im going to be mighty sorry when schooldays end for good just the same this infernal grind to get a scholarship does get a fellows goat sometimes if i dont win it i dont see how i can go to college next year unless i can find some way to earn the money poor old dad that slump in stocks pretty nearly bowled him over lucky i thought of this scholarship when he tried to tell me that unless business picked up he couldnt send me to college next year it sure did me good to see the shine in his eyes when i told him about this and that i was going to win it hes a great old scout and im going to get it now if for nothing more than to see that shine in his eyes again my but its a tough old grind wonder how it would seem to go to a prep school like hal harrison and not have to think about money and where it is going to come from i guess scholarships dont bother hal any wonder if he is coming home for the christmas winter vacation  idly walter allowed his eyes to wander over the walls of his den it was a snug little room simply furnished with a spring cot which was a bed by night and a couch by day a desk a deepcushioned morris chair a revolving desk chair a footrest and two well filled bookcases the walls were covered with photographs nearly all of them were of outdoor scenes most of them of his own taking for he was an expert with the camera a number were enlargements neatly framed among these was the famous flashlight made during his first summer at woodcraft camp which had furnished the evidence to put red pete the outlaw and poacher behind the bars there too were the splendid portraits they were nothing less of the bull moose of swift river a lasting tribute to the nerve of plympton the tenderfoot comrade of that memorable cruise  there were studies of deer and other wild animals views of woodcraft camp of scenes along swift river and of the various camps and points of interest on lost trail the relocating of which by walter and his four fellow scouts of the lone wolf patrol had won for them the distinction of a special letter of commendation from national headquarters of the boy scouts of america  above the door hung a hardused set of boxing gloves crossed above one window were a pair of snowshoes while above the other window were a pair of fencing foils in one corner each in its case were two fishingrods a rifle and a tennis racquet in the opposite corner leaned a scout staff and a couple of canoe paddles a great horned owl stared unblinkingly down from the top of one of the plain oak bookcases on the wall just back and above it was fastened a small banner having the head of a wolf worked in black against a white background and bearing the one word persistence it was the lone wolf banner which had been carried on that nevertobeforgotten search for lost trail by unanimous vote of the patrol it had been presented to upton at the conclusion of the trip in recognition of successful leadership  several small silver cups on the bookcases and half a dozen medals pinned to a little square of black velvet on one wall attested to wellwon victories in various lines of sport the books on the shelves were what one might expect in such surroundings well selected stories of adventure and exploration treatises on hunting fishing and outdoor sports a very complete nature library handbooks on woodcraft camping first aid forestry and surveying a wellthumbed scout manual and other books which attested to the owners love of the great outdoor world but these were not all a whole shelf was devoted to history and another to selections from standard american and english authors including several of our best loved poets  altogether it was a room such as a keen redblooded broadminded boy might well delight in upton did delight in it everything in it held some special significance or sentiment for him and now as his eyes idly roved from one object to another one memory after another was stirred within him at last his eyes rested on the snowshoes and remained there  wonder if ill get a chance to use those things this winter he muttered little old new york doesnt know much about that kind of footgear i suppose pat has worn out two or three pairs since he gave me those and here i havent had em on but once in three years and then there was hardly snow enough for an excuse i guess id be some tenderfoot all right all right on those things up in the woods good old pat wonder what hes doing its a long time since ive heard from him well i ought not to kick over a little extra grind hes trying to get an education and support himself and help his folks at the same time wish he could come down here for the vacation what fun it would be to show him around and listen to his remarks on the big city it would be almost as much fun as going into the big woods in the winter fact is i envy him right now and ill bet he doesnt envy me a pennys worth  swiftly his thoughts reverted to his first meeting with pat malone chore boy and bully of a sawmill village in the north woods and of the thrashing he had given the young woodsman in spite of the latters advantage in weight and strength  it was all in the know how imagine me trying to do it now he chuckled why pat could take me across his knee just as he did the youngster who mistook him for a deer and put a bullet through his hat last fall ive never seen anybody take to an idea as pat did to scouting he just soaked it up it was the principle of the thing that got him right from the start and not just the fun that goes with it and just see what its done for him i dont know of any one its done so much for unless  almost unconsciously walter turned to stare through the gathering dusk at a photograph on the nearer of the two bookcases a pair of frank eyes kindly but keen looked down at him from a face good to see the face of a boy of about his own age it was a handsome face and the beauty lay not in regularity of features but in the strength of character and purpose written in every line it was the face of hal harrison son of a multimillionaire and comrade and fellow scout in the fun and adventures of the last three summers it was the sudden remembrance of hal that had caused the abrupt break in the trend of his thought not even for the poor rough tough young bully of the woods had scouting done more than it had for this other lad brought up in the lap of luxury his every whim gratified toadied to petted spoiled from opposite extremes of the social strata it had brought these two together on the common ground of true brotherhoodthe brotherhood of democracy it had discovered to the young savage for pat was little more than that his own manhood it had stripped from hal the cad the veneer of false social rank based on wealth and found there also a man and now these twothe one whom he had fought and the one whom he had despisedupton regarded not only as comrades and brother scouts but almost as chums  some such thoughts as these were floating through his mind as he sat there in the soft dusk of winter twilight it was just the hour for dreaming the dreams which every boy loves to dream half thought half idle fancy he tried to picture what the future might hold for himself and for these two comrades hal would be a captain of industry it could hardly be otherwise he would inherit vast wealth he would in time take charge of the great enterprises which his father had built up would he apply to their management the principles of which as a scout he was now so earnest a champion pat dared to dream of some day becoming a naturalist would he succeed remembering what pat had been and what he now was walter somehow felt that he would as for himself he could not see his own career with a like clearness he would like  tingalingling it was the telephone in the hall with a start walter came back to earth and the present he went to answer the call picking up the receiver he called hello for a moment there was no response but he caught a sound as of voices and something that sounded like a laugh then over the wire came a rich brogue that caused walter to nearly drop the phone  hello misther leader i have to reporrt the discovery av the city av noo yorrk and the losing av mesilf entoirely  pat you big red headed son of erin are you really in new york when did you get in where are you are you  aisy aisy now have ye not learned thot ye can make but wan bullseye at a shot shure i be in noo yorrk an tis proud the city ought to be av the honor i be doin ut  quit your kidding pat and tell me where you are and when you came and all about it interrupted walter  shure wasnt i afther telling ye thot i be in noo yorrk protested pat in a grieved tone tis at the illigant home av an illigant gintleman thot i be but begorra i forgot entoirely to blaze the trail and i dont know how i got here at all at all  there was a sound of a scuffle and a smothered laugh then another voice broke in  hello old scout  there was no mistaking that voice and upton grinned more broadly than before as he replied  hello hal it sure does me good to hear your voice i might have known whose illigant home pat is honoring where did you find him and why didnt you tell me didnt expect you home until the end of next week funny thing but i was thinking of you two fellows when the phone rang same old pat isnt he gee but its good to hear the voices of you two fellows now when do i see you and where  right after dinner well drive around and pick you up and then give pat a glimpse of the great white way replied hal answering the last questions first ive had this all planned for a month by way of a surprise i have a week more vacation than you do and i got in just in time to meet pats train had hard work to persuade him to come but i got him at last say got any plans made for your vacation  nary a plan been waiting to hear from you replied walter  good ive got the greatest little stunt you ever heard of to tell you about tonight pat suggested it and i had to promise to try to put it through before he would agree to come down here weve got to go clean up for dinner now but well be around about eight oclock so long until then  so long replied walter and hanging up the receiver he whooped joyously and proceeded to execute a war dance that ended with a crash as a rug slipped under his feet and he came down in a heap it happened that at that very instant his father just home from the office opened the hall door briskly and a second later landed on walter with a force that brought a grunt from each he had tripped over one of the boys sprawling legs as quickly as he could disentangle himself walter scrambled to his feet concern was written in every line of his face as he extended a helping hand to mr upton  oh dad are you hurt he cried anxiously  mr uptons eyes twinkled goodhumoredly as he replied only in my dignity but tell me son why all this hilarity that led to the utter downfall of the house of upton i heard you break loose and was hurrying to share in it  its a shame declared walter contritely as he brushed off his fathers coat i ought to know better than to be acting like a wild indian in the house fact is i had just got some mighty good news over the phone guess what  hal is coming home for the vacation hazarded mr upton promptly for these two father and son were chums and he knew just how eagerly walter had hoped for hals homecoming  right and wrong both whooped walter youre a good little guesser dad but you didnt guess enough this time hes home already and pats with him  pat pat who a puzzled frown wrinkled mr uptons forehead  pat malone of course as if there was more than one pat they got in half an hour ago and theyre coming around here after dinner to get me  mr uptons face lighted with a smile of pleasure thats splendid he declared its news worth getting upset for how ever did hal lure that young giant out of his beloved woods  i dont know replied walter all i know is that he is here and the rest well find out when they get here hope hes going to stay through vacation itll be no end of fun showing pat around wish you could be with us  i wish i could replied mr upton smiling suppose we eat dinner now so that you will be ready for them when they arrive  promptly at eight oclock a big touring car drew up in front of the house and walter was down the steps before the two figures in the tonneau could disentangle themselves from the robes three voices mingled in a joyous shout there was a swift clasping of hands in the scout grip and then the three boys started up the steps to the open door where mr upton stood waiting with outstretched hand  welcome to our city pat he cried heartily  thank you sir if everybody receives such a welcome as i have had it is no wonder that we cannot keep people in the woods  walter actually gaped open mouthed at pat there was not a trace of accent pat caught the look and his blue eyes twinkled suddenly he whirled and hit upton a resounding whack between the shoulders with his open palm did i not tell ye thot whin i got the leaves out av me hair and the irish out av me shpach i would come and here i be tell me now do ye want to foight twas the reception i was afther giving ye whin ye first came to the woods and tis no more than roight thot ye should trate me the same whin i land in noo yorrk  walter ran a calculating eye over the brawny young woodsman six feet in his stockings and broad in proportion and backed away i waive the privilegeout of politeness said he with a low bow  tis loike noo yorrk to be gentle with the helpless shure tis a foine settlemint and foine people in ut retorted pat  i am interested to learn how hal induced you to come here pat said mr upton as he ushered them into the library  hal chuckled i trapped him said he i set a trap and baited it and he walked right into it dont you think im some little trapper  you certainly are declared mr upton while pat grinned lets hear all about it  well first i made sure that i could get passes from dad you know he controls the railroad to upper chain dad was tickled to death with the idea even offered to send up his private car you know hes a great admirer of pat then for a bait i arranged through a friend to get an introduction for pat to some of the head people out at bronx park and at the american museum of natural history i knew that he just couldnt pass that chance up but to make sure i wrote to doctor merriam at woodcraft camp and of course he joined the conspiracy right away for a clincher i promised pat that walt and i would spend walts vacation with him up in the woods  walter came out of his chair with a bound whats that he cried say it again  i said that to get pat down here i promised him that weyou and iwould spend a week in the woods with him this winter is that perfectly clear hal spoke slowly and with emphasis  it sounds clear but it isnt replied walter glancing at his father with a rueful smile he was thinking of the expense and that as things then were he could not afford the trip  hal intercepted the glance and understood oh yes it is said he it is perfectly clear we leave here next week friday night and you and pat are my guests until we reach upper chain the next morning then the three of us become the guests of doctor merriam at woodcraft camp for a day or two and after that you and i will be the guests ofguess who  walter shook his head he was a trifle dazed by the way in which hal took everything for granted  pat and his partner cried hal while pat grinned broadly pats trapping this winter instead of lumbering and were going to spend a week in a real trappers camp and snowshoe and have no end of fun wont it be great walt may go maynt he mr upton  mr upton laughed aloud i wouldnt dare say no in the face of such completely organized plans he confessed of course he may go its a splendid idea and i suspect that when he comes back for the next term of the school year he will be feeling so fine that nothing can stop him from winning that scholarship he has set his heart on and has been working so hard for  then its all settled cried hal pat is going to stay and go back with us and while he is here it is up to us to show him what new york is like well begin by showing him the great white way tonight get your coat and hat walt the car is waiting wont you go with us mr upton  not this time thank you hal replied mr upton i have an engagement for this evening though i would much rather join you youngsters than keep it i feel that i am to lose something really worth whilea rare pleasure  and the loss is equally ours sir said pat as they rose to don their coats  once more walter eyed pat quizzically it was clear that the young irishman had been pursuing his studies under doctor merriam to good advantage without the rich brogue it was a new and wholly different pat but he forbore to make any comment and in a few minutes they were off to show pat one of the most wonderful scenes in the world new yorks famous broadway by night     chapter ii  pat sees white magic   mindful of the lasting effect of first impressions hal had contrived to give pat no opportunity to get more than a fleeting glimpse of crowded streets and glaring lights he had met pat at the train which had not arrived until the early winter evening had set in hurried him to a big touring car with curtains drawn and then whirled him away to the palatial harrison home on riverside drive without giving him a chance to sense more than a glare of lights and that confusion of sounds which constitutes the voice of a great city the same car had brought them to walters modest home while they had been making their brief call there the chauffeur under hals orders had put back the top of the machine so that as they descended the steps pat did not recognize the car at all in fact until that day pat had never so much as seen a motor car a buckboard being the most stylish equipage of which upper chain could boast  arrah tis black magic exclaimed pat as he settled himself comfortably between hal and walter in the tonneau convinced at last that he was really in the same car which had brought him there  and were going to show you some white magic cried hal as he leaned forward to give orders to the chauffeur  a quick run through side streets comparatively deserted at this hour brought them to broadway at the junction with sixth avenue turning north the dazzling splendor of the great white way burst upon the startled eyes of the young woodsman his companions heard him catch his breath with a little gasp then he closed his eyes for the space of a few seconds opening them slowly as if he suspected them of playing him tricks an instant later he seized a leg of each of his companions just above the knee with a grip that brought both halfway to their feet with a little yell of surprised protest  tis true then and no drame said he as he settled back with a little sigh of relief sure and had i pinched mesilf i would not have believed me own sinse av feeling white magic did yez call ut sure tis the city av enchantment  it was a rare bit of thoughtfulness on hals part to give pat such an introduction to americas greatest city whatever the disillusionment in the garish light of day he would always think of new york as he saw it for the first timea fairy city of twinkling lights the street crowded with pleasure seekers the great buildings towering into the sky with all harsh and rigid lines softened by the protecting shadows and above all the moving pictures in many colored lights of the advertising signs these were indeed a revelation to the young woodsman and he was soon oblivious to all else the usual ready tongue was silent only once did he speak after the first outbreak and this was when the car was stalled for a few minutes where he had a full view of the famous chariot race from ben hur as he saw that wonderful picture leap out of the darkness between two flaming torches the driver leaning from his chariot and shaking the lines above the four galloping horses pat leaned forward with tense eager face then the picture disappeared and he dropped back with a little sigh  i knew ut was not true he murmured half to himself staring at the blank space between the lighted pillars a second later the picture again flashed out of the darkness and the young irishman relapsed into a silence that was not broken until having gone up one side and down the other of the great white way hal proposed they spend the remainder of the evening at a theater but this pat vetoed and he did it so tactfully as to remove all possible sense of disappointment which hal might have felt  ye may fill a cup no more than full said he and one drap more would be making the cup av me joy run over tis poor shcoutcraft to be wasteful even av pleasure and by the same token the scout thot tries to see everything at wance remimbers nothing i have seen the white magic and thot be enough for wan noight tis just the two faces av yez i would be seein now and hearing the voices av yez to remoind me thot i be still pat malone av the north woods  well go back to my house and spend the rest of the time in my den with the pictures and other things to help make us think we are back in the woods declared walter im crazy to know about this scheme you fellows have cooked up for the vacation and all the news from the woods what do you say  suits me to a dot replied hal promptly id rather have a good old gabfest than see the best show in the city and if pat feels that way too its all settled  fifteen minutes later the three boys were lounging comfortably in uptons den and pat was undergoing a regular bombardment of questions  hows doctor merriam demanded walter  the big chief is just as fine and a little finer than ever replied pat dropping his brogue hes one grand man theres none grander blesses the earth with the touch of his feet ive been living with him at woodcraft ever since you fellows left except for a week or two at a time on the trap line and if ever i amount to anything it will be because of doctor merriam tis he that has taken the irish from my tongue though not from the heart of me shure i be as good an irishman as iver and the saints defind me if i iver be anything else he added with a twinkle at this lapse into his mother tongue  youre a wonder pat broke in walter i wouldnt have believed that even doctor merriam could have taken that burr off your tongue what did he do it witha file gives me a funny feeling as if you were not you at all every time i hear you speak without it feel sort ofwell you knowlike an old friend had disappeared andandi dont think i quite like it  pats face suddenly sobered and rising to his feet he strode over to where upton sat tilted back in his chair his feet on the desk and swung a big fist hard as nails perilously close to uptons nose take ut back ye little spalpeen he commanded take ut back and tell me ye loike me betther for what i am than for what i was  walter ducked in mock fear the sudden move threw him off balance and with a crash he and the chair went over backward one of pats big hands clutched him by the collar and lifted him to his feet an exaggerated sigh from the young giant followed i dont know but that ye be roight afther all he said mournfully the first toime we met ye gave me the best thrashing av me loife and i loved ye for ut now i have but to shake me fist to put ye down for the count shure tis not i that was and yet if i be not i that was who be i that i be the humorous blue eyes grew tense and earnest there was a new note in the deep vibrant voice as he continued  i am still pat malone and proud of it if i am not the old pat i am proud of that too and what i am today is due to walt upton doctor merriam and the boy scouts of america it was walt who first blazed the trail for me it is doctor merriam who is teaching me how to follow it and it is the principles of the boy scouts which have brought out whatever of good there is in me i tell you fellows if there is any one thing that i am proud of it is that i am a scout  same here interrupted hal scouting hasnt done any more for you than it has for me  you fellows are surprised because i can speak the kings english without wholly murdering it as i used to and as i have a sneaking idea you liked to hear me continued pat let me tell you it has cost me something ive talked to the trees all day long when ive been alone on the trap linejust practicing and even now its easier to slip into the old way than to stick to the new dont for a minute think that i am ashamed of the old i love it and i always will but ive begun to understand what education means and this is the first step it isnt easy dont think it i have to keep guard on this slippery tongue every minute i believe its harder than it would be to learn a foreign language its up to you fellows to help me while i am here ive used the old brogue tonight because i knew you liked to hear it but im not going to any more unless it slips out when i am excited or my feelings get the best of me now this is enough about myself what are the plans for the rest of my stay here  hold on protested upton you havent told us a thing about the woods or what luck youve had trapping or what has become of alec smith or what we are going to do if we go up there or who your partner is now fire away and well make plans afterward what are the woods like now  two feet of snow and ten below zero when i left and the beauty of them is not for the tongue to tell but for eyes to see its even whiter magic than you have shown me this night and i am not going to spoil it by trying to tell what it is like replied pat  and the trapping  fair to good  whos your partner you havent said a word about him  an old woodsman and trapper i scraped acquaintance with hes a little rough but when you get to know him i think youll like him there was a twinkle in pats eyes which neither hal nor walter caught  now tell us about alec smith and well let you off how is that broken leg and what is he doing say he must have felt good when black charley confessed to having knifed the mick looked pretty bad for alec for a while didnt it is he living up to all those good resolutions he made  you bet he is pat answered the last question first after big jim and i got him out to woodcraft camp he stayed there doing odd jobs around the camp until that leg was strong enough for him to go into a lumber camp as cook he was there a month and then quit for the trap line the last i heard of him he was somewhere up in the smugglers hollow country and i guess probably hes there yet you remember he had some traps cached up there legs as good as it ever was and he swears and believes it too that walt here is the greatest little doctor that ever came into the woods hell talk any one who will listen deaf dumb and blind on the boy scouts and i believe hed cut his right hand off any time for doctor merriam alecs all right  and big jim whats jim doing and how is he  hes the same old jim hes the boss of the atwater lumber camp this winter with two crews under him and out to make a record cut if the weather holds good hell come pretty near to doing it jims the best logging boss as well as the best guide in the north woods now what are you fellows going to do with me in noo yorrk  thats mostly up to hal im afraid replied upton ruefully you see i have to go to school next week tomorrow is saturday and a holiday of course so ive got that free no i havent either come to think i promised to take my patrol out for a hike tomorrow afternoon and i dont quite see how i can avoid it now because there is no way of getting word to the fellows unless he paused and scowled thoughtfully i have it he exclaimed scout mcnulty has a phone in his house and ill send him around to notify the others tomorrow morning that the hike is off  he jumped to his feet to go to the phone but pat stopped him whats the matter with us going on that hike he demanded  instantly walters face lighted with pleasure will you are you sure you want to he cried the boys have heard so much about you that they will be tickled silly to have a real live sure enough guide from the woods with them we were planning to go out to bronx park and try a little winter woodcraft and  that settles it if its bronx park im right with you my son unless hal has something else planned interrupted pat in that case why i be in the hands av me frind of course  suits me declared hal promptly well take pat downtown in the morning and show him the sights and take him into scout headquarters then well go out to the park and show him that your blue tortoises are not so slow as he may think from the name well frame up something else for the evening thats a bully scheme ill bet that pat will be jealous of that patrol of yours walt before we get through just you put em on their mettle and give him something to tell that patrol of his at upper chain about i suppose youre still leader of the bull moose pat  pat shook his head yes and no said he you see ive been away so much that i had to resign a patrol to be what it should be needs a leader on the job every minute and so one of the boys at the sawmill is leader now and hes a good one too hes a scout of the first class and is working for merit badges now hes got five alreadypersonal health physical development taxidermy signaling and stalkingand has won a medal for saving life when i happen to be at home i just give them my valuable advice pat grinned  oh weve got some little patrol up there in the woods and im just waiting to be shown what your city scouts have got on us he concluded  that takes care of tomorrow then said hal well plan doings next week so that walt can be with us out of school hours then friday night well head for the good old woods my but that does sound good to me ten days up among the big trees where theres snow enough to make a footprint without having to photograph it in order to prove it isnt a fake where the foxes and the other critters with nice fur coats are sitting round waiting to put their little footsies in our traps where      the red gods dwell     neath a mystic spell     the red flame glows     and the red blood flows     and a mans a man     for a little span  a sofa pillow full in the face cut short this poetic outbreak followed by an inquiry from pat as to hals experience on snowshoes  never had em on in my life but im crazy to replied that exuberant youth bought a pair yesterday purpose for the trip dont look to me as if it can be much of a trick to walk on em  did you buy any liniment to go with them asked pat  hal looked puzzled liniment what for he demanded  oh just to be prepared you know a good scout always is prepared replied pat evasively at the same time tipping walter a wink  meaning what persisted hal  its a long long way to tipperary especially on snowshoes was pats enigmatic reply id lay in a good supply of that liniment if i were you  hal made a wry face at pat quit your kidding said he well take a gallon of liniment if you say so now tell us what else well need do we take guns  pat shook his head then seeing a look of disappointment in both faces he hastened to say that the closed season was now on for all game excepting rabbits and hares and if they wanted to hunt these they might take their 22 caliber rifles in fact he wasnt sure but this would be a good idea as bunnies were plentiful and hunting them on snowshoes might afford some excellent sport  what about fish will there be a chance to do some fishing through the ice asked hal  pat smiled at hals eagerness there are just as big pickerel under the ice as ever swam he averred and if you are willing to do some real work and chop out holes i think i can promise you some whales without the trouble of swimming for them  there was a general laugh at this thrust at hal whose adventure with a big pickerel during which he and plympton had been capsized from a raft was one of the nevertobeforgotten incidents of the search for lost trail  but you havent told us yet just where we are going where your camp is you know walter broke in  just then the honk honk of an automobile sounded from the front of the house  theres the car cried hal well have to be getting a move on or pat will lose his beauty sleep and be in no shape for tomorrow well be round at 930 sharp in the morning walter i dont want to get pat up too early  early pat fairly snorted arrah now do yez play all night and slape all day in noo yorrk he demanded     chapter iii  the blue tortoise patrol   sparrer otherwise edward muldoon smallest scout in the blue tortoise patrol darted back from the corner to the group waiting about the uptown entrance to the subway  hes coming he shrilled an two guys wid him de one wid de dough an de biggest rube yer ever put yer peepers on  the announcement was electrifying and there was an immediate rush to look down the street  its walt and harrison all right but who in the dickens is that with them and where did they find him exclaimed ned patterson  gee look at the size of him hes a rube all right by the looks of him but id hate to tell him so muttered chick parsons  red headed and irish at that say fellers well have some fun with him chortled jack norwood  quit your kidding and fall in for a salute snapped assistant leader mcnulty  instantly the patrol lined up and as walter approached hal on one side and pat on the other seven hands were raised as one in the scout salute it was returned by the three older lads  somebodys wised him to de game all right whispered the irrepressible sparrer to his neighbor as his sharp eyes took note of the fact that pat had saluted quite as if accustomed to it mebbe he belongs to some rube patrol  there was a nudging of elbows and here and there a half smothered giggle as the youngsters sized pat up and noticed the awkward fit and rough material of his store suit the celluloid collar and the flaming red fourinhand clumsily tied in the eyes of his young critics he was branded by these things quite as much as if he had worn a placard just from the country  green goods right from the farm whispered chick to sparrer i dare you to ask him how the caows are  whether or not sparrer would have taken the dare will never be known for at that instant upton introduced the big stranger and the effect was magical to say the least i want you fellows to shake hands with some one you already know all about corporal malone of the lone wolf patrol which had the honor of finding lost trail last fall and one of the best guides in the north woods said he he and harrison whom you all know are going with us on the hike this afternoon and if you chaps feel as i do about it you know that we are the luckiest patrol in new york city pat shake hands with assistant leader mcnulty  then in turn the others were presented ending with sparrer pats blue eyes twinkled as his big hand closed over the little one put out to him tis irish ye be said he and tis the same blood flows in me own veins pwhat iver would the worrld do widout the irish the blue tortoise patrol should be proud thot it has a son av st patrick  it is laughed upton now fellows the blue tortoise yell for the best scout i knowpat malone  the yell was given with a will and caused many a head to turn in the hurrying throng and many a smile for the trim uniformed youngsters faces alight with eagerness for their afternoon outing were good to see laughing and joking the patrol squeezed into the crowded subway express and they were off for bronx park the wonderful great playground where for a five cent fare one is lifted as by magic from the heart of the city to the heart of the country  as the train roared through the great tunnel pat scanned the individual members of the patrol with manifest approval they were a cleancut sturdy looking lot of boys ranging in age from thirteen to sixteen mcnulty the assistant leader being the only one of that age and they were a representative lot two were the sons of welltodo merchants one was the son of a broker another was from the modest home of a patrolman on the police force a fifth was the son of a subway guard and the remaining two were bernstein whose features unmistakably stamped him as a hebrew of the upper class and sparrer muldoon newsboy and street gamin  pats interest promptly centered in the latter and he took the first opportunity to ask about him and how he happened to be associated with others seemingly so far above him in the social scale upton smiled  there isnt any social scale among scouts you know said he  pat nodded i ought to know he agreed if there were pat malone wouldnt be this very minute the guest of the son of a millionaire but i wasnt one of a regular patrol of fellows better off tell me something about this imp you call sparrer and how you dared take him into this bunch he seems to fit all right so far as i can see  sure he fits replied walter i put it up to the fellows themselves and they invited him to join first time i ran into sparrer made me think of the first time i met you he had just trimmed the life out of a bully half a head taller than himself for stealing the papers of a little jew  pats eyes began to dance appreciatively go on he commanded  he had a black eye and a bloody nose and he was as dirty a little heathen as ever you laid eyes on but he sure packed a healthy punch in each fist and knew where to put em to judge by the looks of the bully who was sneaking away with a whole crowd of newsies jeering at him sparrer didnt pay any attention to the rest of em but went over to the little jew and gave him half of his own stock of papers to make up for the ones the bully had taken and which had been destroyed in the scrap when the youngster tried to thank him sparrer swore at him and he could swear in those days believe me that was the irish in him trying to cover up a good deed  a bye afther me own heart murmured pat  the whole affair or rather the motive underneath it struck me as so scoutlike that i thought id try to get acquainted continued upton  good boy says i  wots it to you says he oill smash yer the same way fer a nickel yer big dude that tickled the bunch and they began to egg him on and guy me until i saw that if i didnt want to be mixed up in a common street scrap id better retreat which i did ingloriously later i managed to scrape acquaintance with him and by making some inquiries i found out that his mother is a widow and he was helping support the family that he had a reputation as a scrapper and that though he swore like a pirate smoked and chewed tobacco as most of these street gamins do he was strictly honest and was a terror to the bullies of his neighborhood also that hed rather fight than eat just by chance i discovered that his ambition was to become a soldier but he was worried for fear he never would be big enough hes small for his age stunted for lack of good food when he was a kid i guess next to going into the army he wanted to be a prizefighter i talked scouting to him a little but he didnt seem interested until one day i happened along in full uniform that got him i suppose it looked next best to being a soldier then i told him all about my patrol and what we were doing and what scouting stands for and he gulped it all down like a hard run buck trying to drink a lake dry  gee oid like dat but it aint for poor blokes the loikes of me said he that gave me an idea there was a vacancy in the patrol and at the next meeting i put it right straight to the fellows i told them all about sparrer and got em interested and then i just kind of hinted at the brotherhood and democracy idea of scouting and what a mighty good turn it would be if sparrer could be given a chance to get into the game and then dropped the subject the hint worked all right theyre a pretty good bunch these fellows they talked it all over and then they came around and asked me if i supposed sparrer would like to join the blue tortoise patrol i told them that i was sure he wouldnt if he suspected that the invitation was charity on their part they chewed this over for a while and then came around and said that they really would like to take him in and there wasnt any charity about it i took the invitation to sparrer and he went up in the air like a rocket just as i knew he would  say yer cant put no stuff loike dat over on me said he wot do yer tink oi am to fall fer a steer loike dat dat bunch of highbrows aint wantin me trainin in dere camp youse has been on de level wid me now hand it ter me straightwots de game  i did my best to make him see that the invitation was sincere and explained all over again how there is no social distinction between scouts and how money and that sort of thing doesnt count but i couldnt break through his pride id about given up when i had a happy thought sparrer said i i thought you were a dead game sport but i guess youve got a streak of yellow in you after all some of these fellows are from fine homes and some are not but theyre white right through and theyve got more sand than you have they dare to take you in on the same footing that they are on and you havent got the nerve to show em that you are just as good as they are  that got him the long and short of it was he agreed to come around to my house the next night and meet the bunch and he did the fellows were good scouts all right and treated him on the level just as if he were one of em when he saw those photos of mine and the snowshoes and paddles and the rest of the junk and heard about the good times the bunch was having he was eager to be a scout but he wouldnt say that he would join the patrol it wasnt until about three weeks later when he came around in full uniform and said that he would like to be a blue tortoise that i tumbled to what the trouble had been he wouldnt join until he could at least look as well as the rest and hed been working over time and saving every penny to get that uniform i guess he was right at that the fellows wouldnt have cared but he cared and being dressed like the rest made him feel more as if he belonged with the crowd  again pat nodded his full understanding of the youngsters feelings  sparrer took to scouting like a duck to water upton continued he cut out tobacco and swearing and being naturally quick from his life in the streets he learned quickly and passed the tenderfoot and second class tests quicker than anybody else in the patrol hes a first class scout now and a mighty good one he is so full of life and fun that it wasnt any time at all before he was one of the most popular fellows in the patrol and when hes on hand he keeps things moving the hardest thing he has to overcome is slang you know he was brought up in the streets its his mother tongue im afraid the boys dont help him much they like to hear him but hes doing his best and now hes going to night school of course ive told him all about you and the fight youve made and i rather fancy hes made something of a model and hero of you  the saints forbid exclaimed pat nevertheless he looked pleased  bronx park all out sang out the guards  once out of the car the patrol fell into line and with upton in the lead headed for the park once inside the turnstiles he called a conference you fellows know what we planned to do today he began but that was before we knew that we were to have the honor of corporal malone as our guest you know he is something of a naturalist and there are a lot of animals and birds and snakes and things here that i expect he is anxious to see i propose that we show him around instead of doing the field work we had planned  mr leader pat saluted as he spoke the beasties and the burrds will not know what they are missing if they have no chance to inspect green goods today  chick started violently remembering his remark to sparrer and the latter maliciously punched him in the ribs and ducked to hide a grin but i know what i shall miss if you do not carry out your plans and i have no mind to be handed that kind of a lemon i have all next week to look at the beasties and only this afternoon to see how little a city patrol knows of scouting arrah now tis mesilf belaves ye be afraid to be showing me how much betther the scouts av upper chain be than the scouts av the great city av noo yorrk  that settles it cried upton when the general laugh had subsided well show him that the blue tortoise patrol isnt afraid to take a dare from any one and well show him a few stunts to make his bull moose up there in the woods turn green with envy youre on your mettle now fellows well go over to the wildest and most lonesome part of the park and divide into two companies pat can take one and be the enemy which has made a successful raid and made its getaway hal can go with him because he knows the country as well as any of us well give them ten minutes start and then go in pursuit theres enough snow in patches to make snowballs any one hit on the arms or legs is wounded a hit on the throwing arm puts that man out of the fighting but he is still at liberty a hit on either leg puts a man out of action but he may hide if he can within a radius of a hundred feet of the place where he was hit a hit on the head or any part of the body puts a man wholly out of action and he becomes a first aid man to take care of the wounded you fellows have played the game before and i presume each of you has a red cross arm band to pin on when you are hit so that you will be recognized as a noncombatant  there was a general assent and upton continued our camp will be at the point we start from if the enemy can elude us and get back and capture the camp they win if we run them down and defeat them or defeat them in a battle at the camp we win any man taken prisoner becomes a member of the other side scouts sent out by either side will make full reports not only of signs of the enemy but of the country and its conspicuous characteristics and animals and birds which are seen pat you can pick your side you get three besides hal  pats first choice was sparrer to the youngsters secret delight he then chose mcnulty and bernstein and the two companies pat at the head of one and upton at the head of the other started at the scout pace for the scene of action arrived there a camp was marked off and pat and his company at once started off to make the most of the ten minutes allotted them meanwhile upton laid out his plan of campaign the camp had been chosen with a view to defense on two sides were dense thickets of bushes from which it would be practically impossible to throw a snowball moreover to reach these thickets it would be necessary for the enemy to cross a bare hilltop which meant that surprise from that quarter was virtually out of the question on the third side was an outcropping ledge of rock behind which the defenders could take shelter the fourth side was open but could not be approached without the enemy being in sight for some time moreover in the flat open country beyond there was no snow hence the enemy attacking from that direction would not be able to replenish their ammunition upton decided that two men were ample for defense and at once set all hands to work making a supply of snowballs from the patches of snow still lingering in the thickets promptly at the end of ten minutes chick parsons was sent out as scout to try to pick up the enemys trail at the point where they had disappeared from view with instructions to signal what he should discover norwood was sent in the opposite direction to look for signs on the chance that the enemy had circled as soon as they were out of sight patterson and chambers were left to guard camp and upton climbed to the top of the little hill which flanked the camp and from which point he could get signals from both scouts the game was on     chapter iv  help   every member of the blue tortoise patrol was on edge eager to show pat that though they were city born and bred they still knew something of practical woodcraft and the art of tracking also of the even more difficult art of covering up tracks but it was ordained that things should be otherwise that day and that the big woodsman should witness a real and not an artificial test of scout resources and pluck  chick studying what struck him as a suspiciously broad trail leading west from the point where the enemy had last been seen and suspecting a ruse was startled by the faint sound of a whistle to the north it was the patrol signal for help and was used only in case of an emergency or when as in the present game a scout was in danger of capture by the opposite side and wanted to summon aid his first thought was that one of his own side had run onto the enemy and was summoning help then he remembered that he was the only one who had gone out on that side of camp and so it was manifestly impossible that this could be  wonder if thats a trick to lead us into an ambuscade he muttered listening with growing suspicion again he heard the signal and there was something in the sound of it that banished all idea of trickery somethings happened to one of the fellows he exclaimed and scrambled up a knoll to his left where he could get a fairly clear view far in the distance toward the outer boundary of the park he saw a figure which the instant he came in sight began to signal with a whistle in the morse code  motor smash on road help cops he spelled out raising his own whistle he signaled o k and saw the distant figure turn and race away at top speed  phew he gasped must be bad if they need the cops that must mean they need an ambulance he whirled toward camp and caught sight of a figure on the hill just back of it it was upton watching for signals and chick knew that he must have heard him whistle the o k once more raising the whistle he repeated the message adding the location of the accident as nearly as he could judge he heard upton whistle for norwood and then saw him bound down into the hollow where the camp lay a minute later patterson the best runner in the patrol sprang into view headed for the park administration buildings at top speed satisfied that help would come in the shortest possible time chick picked up his staff and started swiftly for the point where he had seen sparrer disappear for it was he who had first signaled  meanwhile pat hal and the three members of the blue tortoise patrol who had started out with them were working with might and main at the scene of the accident and in their hearts praying that help would reach them speedily it was one of those disasters which in these days have become so common that often they receive no more than a paragraph or two in the daily papers two automobiles had come together on a turn in a road at this time of year little frequented and the smaller of the two had turned turtle the other a powerful roadster had escaped with but trifling damage and the driver of it had not even paused to ascertain the results of the collision but had thrown on full power and left the scene at racing speed  the accident had occurred at a point about one hundred yards from where pat and sparrer were about to emerge from a thicket of bushes lining the drive and at the sound of the crash they sprang out an instant later a big roadster tore past and they caught a fleeting glimpse of a strained white face behind the big steering wheel and beyond partly raised and half turned to look back a furcoated figure evidently that of a young man for just a second his face turned toward them then hastily turned away but that brief glimpse was enough to show them that it bore the stamp of guilty fear  pat confessed later that the whole thing was so sudden and so wholly foreign to anything within his experience that he was too confused to think or act quickly not so sparrer his life in the streets of new york had made him no stranger to accidents of a more or less tragic nature and he had seen too many violators of the law seeking to escape the consequences of their own acts not to grasp the situation instantly  they are trying to make a getaway he snapped get de number  this was greek to pat whose acquaintance with automobiles was too recent for him to appreciate the importance of a license number at a time like this but sparrer had not practiced taking automobile numbers in the rush hours at madison square for nothing it had been only fun there by way of training his eyes to quick and sure observation now as a result eye and brain worked in unison and almost automatically and despite the speed of the car he got the number as surely as if it had been at a standstill  illustration he jotted down the number  jersey car deyll beat it fer across de river said he as he jotted down the number in his notebook did yer pipe dere monikers oid know dem in a tousand now lets see wot happened to de others  they started on a run for the overturned car and as they drew near the sound of moaning from the wreck gave wings to their feet a small touring car was bottom up at the side of the road a rear wheel off at one side half among the bushes and half in the road lay the body of a young woman whether dead or simply unconscious they did not take time to find out if dead there was nothing for them to do if unconscious she could receive attention later the moans from beneath the wrecked car told them that there was where aid was needed first  the driver a middleaged man was pinned under the steering post which was bent and rested across his chest in such a way that while the full weight of the car did not fall on it still it was crushing in the ribs on one side one leg was doubled under him in a way that denoted a bad break his face was badly cut by the glass of the windshield and what was worse the crimson stream gushing in little spurts from a jagged gash on one arm fortunately thrust beyond the edge of the car proclaimed a severed artery  that must be stopped immediately at all costs before any attempt was made to get the man out or he would bleed to death both boys saw this on the instant and without a word pat stooped and gripped the arm above the cut bringing to bear all the strength of his powerful fingers the effect was immediately apparent the wound still bled but no longer in those fateful jets sparrer meanwhile had snatched off his neckerchief and was preparing a tourniquet from a shrub by the roadside he cut a stout stick a foot long then hastily made search for a smooth pebble finding none he started to feel in his pockets for some small object that would serve his purpose when his alert glance fell on pats mackinaw whipping out his knife once more he cut one of the big smooth buttons from the mackinaw tying the handkerchief loosely around the injured arm just above where pat was gripping it he slipped the button in so that it rested directly on the artery then putting the stick under the handkerchief on the outer side he rapidly twisted it until the pressure of the button on the artery was sufficient to stop the flow of blood and pat could release his grip the stick was then tied so that it could not untwist and they were ready for the next move  by this time harrison mcnulty and bernstein had come up they had not been so far away but that they had heard the crash then too sparrer had whistled for help as soon as he had seen the extent of the disaster the quick wits of the newsboy trained to acute sharpness in the school of the streets peculiarly fitted him to take command of the situation also familiarity with suffering and with scenes of violence made him less susceptible to the shock of the grim spectacle before them than was the case with his comrades and he now assumed leadership by right of fitness indeed he did it quite unconsciously and his comrades quite as unconsciously accepted the situation and turned to him for directions  we got to git de cops and an amblance youse guys git de man out from under de car and oill chase fer de cops without waiting another second he plunged through the bushes and started in the direction of the camp which lay in almost a direct line with the park administration buildings the nearest point at which he could be sure of getting help he knew the lay of the land perfectly and he reasoned that by this time one or more of the other party would be out on the trail and that if he could signal them and they in turn signal those behind valuable time would be saved so on the first high ground he stopped to blow the help signal with the result already noted to gain time he made his message as brief as possible motor smash told the nature of the accident helpcops told the urgency of the case and the need of police aid he counted on uptons knowledge of the way things are handled in a big city to make the message as clear as if he took precious time to spell out the full story and when he heard chicks o k he turned back confident that help would reach them in the shortest time possible  nor was his confidence misplaced as soon as upton got the message from chick he understood the situation exactly getting down into the hollow where the camp was he issued orders the others had heard chicks message and knew where the accident had occurred get over to the administration building as fast as you can run he ordered patterson tell em to notify the police and put in an ambulance call if you meet a mounted cop on the way tell him it may be life or death so run for a record  patterson was off before the last words were out of uptons mouth upton with the other two boys at his heels at once started for the scene of the accident running at top speed halfway to his goal patterson caught sight of a mounted policeman hailed him with a shrill yell and brought him at a gallop briefly he told his story and the officer was away to put in a call for an ambulance and get help  meanwhile the boys at the wreck had been working with might and main pats great strength had stood them in good stead and they had managed to raise the car sufficiently to free the victim and draw him out the cushions and robes were pulled out of the wreck and on these the still unconscious woman and the man were laid by the time upton and his comrades panting for breath reached the scene both victims had been made as comfortable as possible the first aid kits had been opened and temporary bandages were being applied where most needed in this work the newcomers at once took a hand  seeing that his assistance was not needed sparrer had busied himself elsewhere he went along the road for some little distance in each direction studying the ground carefully the top surface of the ground had softened a little in the sun and in places the wheel marks were visible this was especially true of the wrecked car as this had been fitted with chains it was comparatively easy to trace the course of this car and sparrer was soon satisfied in regard to it on the wheel marks of the other car he spent more time and he had just completed his examination as two mounted police dashed up swinging down from their horses they made hasty examination of the victims  good work boys said one of them youve done all that can be done so far as i can see until the ambulance gets here now then which of you is the leader  upton stepped forward tell us what you know about the accident commanded the officer  i know nothing about it replied upton curtly everything was practically as you see it now when i reached here pat did any of your party see the thing happen  pat shook his head none of us saw it but two of us were right handy when it happened and were on the spot in less than two minutes said he addressing the policemen we heard the crash and saw a car which seemed to be trying to get away and then we saw this car overturned when we got here the young woman was lying by the side of the road half in the bushes and out of her senses just as she is now the man was pinned under the car and bleeding like a buck that has just felt the knife we stopped that as soon as we could and then got him out muldoon there can tell you more than i can because he saw more than i did he proved himself a better scout  sparrer flushed with pleasure praise from this source meant more to him than it would have from any one else and at a sign from one of the officers he stepped forward to tell what he knew  we was in de bushes said he about a hundred yards up de road when we heard de smash an jumped out just in time to lamp a big gray roadster wid two guys in it making dere getaway and dey was beatin it fer fair  dont suppose you thought to get the number interrupted one of the officers  sparrer grinned as he fished out his notebook sure oi got it said he jersey car and dey was beatin it fer de ferry loike new york was bad fer de health no cops around same as usual sparrer winked at the other boys probly dey think dey made dere getaway and dey would have if some real scouts hadnt happened to be around  one of the officers had reached for the notebook and hastily glanced at the number ill phone this number in and see if we cant head off that car while you take care of things here said he as he vaulted into the saddle and a second later was off at full gallop  go on with your story commanded the other  dey aint no more cept while de others was getting the man out from under de car oi signaled to de fellows over across de park to get word to youse and dey done it replied sparrer quite as if his quickwitted handling of the matter was as commonplace as his grammar was bad  the man didnt come to and make any statement  the boys shook their heads hes been just as you see him now said pat with a pitying glance at the injured man  the officer shook his head too bad said he that there wasnt a witness if we nab those fellows theyll swear that it was this fellows fault their running away will make it look bad for them but theyll frame up some sort of cock and bull story about being so frightened that they didnt realize what they were doing and without evidence their word will be as good as the other mans if the latter doesnt recover sufficiently to make a statement and the young lady doesnt either the case will fall through was that car right where it is now when you first saw it  say drawled sparrer scornfully do youse tink we had nothing to do but to pick up a ton or two of scrap and lug it round  the policeman grinned you chaps seem to be equal to about anything said he i didnt know but that you had moved the car in getting that fellow out unless he was knocked over here by the collision it appears that he was on the right side of the road  sure thing retorted sparrer he was on de right side of de road and driving easy de other blokes was burning up de road and tried to make de turn wide dey skidded and sideswiped de little car and it turned turtle dats all dey is to it  he spoke with such an air of finality that the officer looked at him suspiciously i thought you said none of you saw this happen said he  none of us did but even a cop orter be able ter see what has happened retorted sparrer he walked back up the road a short distance heres de marks of de chains he called an deys all on de right side of de road heres a place where de ground is pretty soft but de tracks are cleancut if de car had been beatin it de mud would have been trown more now lamp de tracks comin de other way  he led the way around the curve in the opposite direction pointing out soft spots where the tracks of a heavy car without chains were clearly visible little globules of mud had been thrown some distance on both sides conclusive evidence that the car was being driven at high speed the curve was rather sharp and the tracks showed that the car had started to take it wide but at the scene of the accident had been pulled sharply to the right and had skidded striking the smaller machine and causing it to turn turtle for those with eyes to see the whole story was written out on the road surface and yet the tracks were comparatively faint because the surface had softened only where the sun had lain longest and might easily have been overlooked by those not trained to close observation  the officer looked at sparrer curiously hurry up and grow sonny said he we need you on the force  sparrers retort was interrupted by the clang of a gong as an ambulance dashed up the young surgeon made a hasty examination of the two victims and then as they were lifted into the ambulance he turned to the group of boys and spoke crisply  you fellows have done just the things to be done and all that could be done here if this man lives hell owe his life to you if you hadnt known enough to get a tourniquet on that arm at once he would have bled to death by this time officer i hope you will report the good work of these scouts if there was nothing more to scouting than the teaching of first aid to the injured it would be a great thing  he swung up on the rear of the ambulance and as it dashed away raised his hand in the scout salute which was promptly returned by the patrol meanwhile the officer was taking down the names and addresses of the boys as they would in all probability be needed later as witnesses in court when he had finished upton ordered the patrol to fall in  i guess fellows said he that none of us feels much like continuing our game after whats happened what do you say if we spend the rest of the afternoon showing pat around the park those in favor say aye  the vote was unanimous as soon as it had been taken pat stepped forward mr leader said he i want to say just a few words  speech speech shouted half a dozen together  pats face lighted with a grin and his eyes began to dance arrah now yez be looking for a bear in the wrong tree said he for there be no silver on me tongue and me thoughts be too bashful to be dressed in worrds so tis no spache yez will be getting from me this day then abruptly he dropped the brogue mr leader you started out this day to show me what city scouts can do and you have shown me in a way that none of us dreamed of i take off my hat to the blue tortoise patrol that was as good scouting as ever i have seen and weve got some scouts up where i come from they can do stunts in the woods that probably would make you fellows green with envy if you could see them if you were to come up there in the woods i expect that they would laugh at you behind your backs just as you would laugh at them if they should come down here as nearly as i can make out that seems to be the way with the worldto laugh at others who happen to be different in speech or ways or dress you city boys call a country boy a rube and green just because his ways are different from your ways and he isnt wise to the things that you are he thinks just the same way of you when you visit him in the country what i have seen today has taught me a lesson out in the woods i know just what to do how to do it and when to do it no matter what happens when i started out with you today i smiled down inside at the idea of you being able to show me anything in the way of scouting i wished i had the bull moose patrol here to show you what real scouting is like  then that accident happened and found me as helpless as a newborn babe but sparrer here was right on the job from the jump he had the number of that car before i had it through my head what had happened and he knew just what to do next i expect that it would have been the same with any of the rest of you in his place anyway ive been shown the very finest kind of scoutcraft and that little smile i started with has turned to pride im proud to be out with the blue tortoise patrol as fine a bunch of real scouts as i know of and i am particularly proud of my friend sparrer muldoon i might be able to give him some points on tracking a deer or a moose or even a man in the woods but when it comes to tracking a crazy motorcar sparrer has got my number i would like to propose mr leader three cheers for scout muldoon  the cheers were given with a will and with a rousing tiger at the end to the confusion of sparrer then upton called for the patrol yell for pat malone and in that sparrer found vent for his own feelings these preliminaries out of the way the patrol fell in to escort pat about the park and show him the hardier animals which winter outofdoors nor was their courtesy without gain to themselves for the young naturalists comments as they visited one enclosure after another revealed an intimate knowledge of the characteristics and habits not only of those species with which he was familiar in their native wilds but of many which he was now seeing for the first time which was a revelation to his young admirers chick wasnt far wrong when he whispered to norwood  we aint showing him anything hes showing us  it was an afternoon never to be forgotten by the blue tortoise patrol and it was an equally memorable one for pat and when they parted that night there was a mutual respect and liking which found expression in the hearty grip of scout brotherhood     chapter v  off for woodcraft   edward muldoon otherwise sparrer surreptitiously pinched himself to make sure that he was not dreaming he newsboy from the lower east side of new york who had never been farther from it than coney island riding in a brilliantly lighted pullman coach on his way into the great woods of which he had dreamed so much since he became a scout and of which he had only the vaguest idea it couldnt be  and yet it was the roar of the wheels told him that it was the very feel of the luxurious seat in which he was sitting told him that it was and to clinch the fact and at the same time make it harder to believe there were his three companions upton his patrol leader harrison and pat malone whom he had secretly made his hero yes it was all true and yet he couldnt get rid of the idea that sooner or later he would wake up and find it all a beautiful dream  the fact is this trip was in the nature of a christmas present from their first meeting pat had taken a great fancy to the street gamin he recognized a kindred spirit instinctively he realized that the difference between sparrer and himself at the same age was mainly one of environment the youngsters sturdy independence and selfreliance his quick wit even his impudence struck responsive chords in the young woodsman sparrer was what he himself would have been had his nursery been a new york east side tenement instead of the log cabin of a mill settlement in the lumber district of the north woods  the night after the motor accident the three older boys had been discussing sparrer and his prompt resourcefulness pat dropped a remark that he wished with all his heart that he could have the youngster in the woods with him for a couple of weeks  lets take him with us it would be no end of fun cried hal on the spur of an inspiration  upton shook his head it would be bully if we could but im afraid we cant said he  why not demanded hal i can get a pass for him and between us i guess we can take care of him it wont cost him a cent  thats just it declared upton there is nothing on two legs in new york more independent than eddie muldoon hell scrap for his rights as long as he can swing a fist but the minute you try to hand him anything for nothing hell turn you down hard and cold sparrer pays his way or he dont go and wild horses couldnt drag him he would stand for the pass all right because he would be on the same footing as the rest of us but if we tried to give him anything in the way of an outfit and it goes without saying that he hasnt anything suitable for the weather we are likely to have up there he would kick like barnums trick mule thats one thing i like about the little beggar and when you come right down to it independence is one of the fundamental principles of scouting  once more hal was inspired i have it fellows he cried well make him a christmas present of the trip he cant refuse a christmas gift if it is put to him right ill get the passes and chip in toward whatever he needs in the way of outfit you two can make up the rest hell be pats guest when he gets there the same as walt and myself so he cant kick on that youre all my guests on the train anyway so i dont see how sparrers independence is going to be hurt a little bit  that will be great if we can put it across declared upton and i for my part would like nothing better than to have the youngster along it would be the event of a lifetime for him  so it was decided that upton should use all his diplomatic powers to persuade sparrer that he was needed for the largest success of the party his success was the result of a great deal of argument helped out by the boys own longing to know what the woods life of which he so often dreamed really was like so now here they were actually on their way four as happy boys as ever set forth in quest of pleasure  the week had been a busy one pat had spent a good part of it at bronx park and the american museum of natural history where his letters of introduction and his own ready wit and evident thirst for knowledge had made him a welcome visitor during the rest of the time there had been something doing every minute hal had seen to that upton had dug at his books as if that scholarship hung on that one weeks work as for sparrer he had worked early and late that he might leave a few extra coins to make christmas for the brother and two sisters at home  did you telephone the hospital before we left asked hal turning to upton as they waited for their berths to be made up  walter nodded did it the last thing before i left the house he replied the young lady is practically all right now and has gone home her father is getting along nicely and it is only a matter of time when he will be right as ever by the way their story is exactly as sparrer had it looks like a sure case against the owner of that other car i understand that they are going to bring suit for damages i suppose that means that well have to go on the witness stand when the thing comes off  lucky they caught those fellows at the ferry  do you suppose theres any truth in that claim by the owner of the car that it was a joy ride by unknown parties who had taken the car without his consent or knowledge hal asked  looks pretty fishy to me replied upton still he may get away with it understand that neither of the victims can identify the men in the other car you remember that curve is pretty sharp and they were hit almost before they saw the other car let alone who was in it sparrer and pat seem to be the only ones who even had a glimpse of the scoundrels and that a mighty brief one if there is any identifying done i guess it is up to you two fellows think you can do it  not i declared pat with emphasis i could shwear to the number of points on a jumping buck in the brush but nary a thing could i shwear to about that ingine av destruction  how about you sparrer demanded hal  if oi was one of them artist guys oi could draw you a picture of both of them let me put my peepers on them and oill shwear to them in a tousand replied the newsboy with such an air of finality that there was no doubt in the minds of his companions that he could do just what he said he could  well youre likely to have a chance if that case goes to court upton remarked for my part i hope you can do it id like to see those fellows get whats coming to em i move we turn in now for weve got to get up at an unearthly hour its bad enough to turn out before daylight in the summer but it makes me shiver to think what it will be at this time of year brrrr  pat laughed if youre going out on the trap line you may as well get broken in to early rising at once we often have some miles behind us by the time the sun is up said he however i guess youre right about turning in im ready for one  it seemed to sparrer that he had hardly closed his eyes when some one shook him and he tumbled out of his berth to find the others in the dressing room hurriedly getting into their clothes they had no more than time to dress and gather up their baggage and various parcels before the train stopped they had reached upper chain  as they stepped down into the night for day had not yet begun to break upton recalled his first arrival there a rather lonely youngster uncertain that this was the right place it had been summer then but everything had been shrouded in a heavy night mist and the chill of the high altitude had struck clear to the marrow in his bones he had been a tenderfoot then his only knowledge of woodcraft what little he had gleaned from books he remembered how the mystery of the great woods had swept over him and engulfed him even as did the night mist and how insignificant he had felt even now after three years of experience in camp and on the trail he felt something of that same spirit of awe and he knew that it would always be thus it was the tribute exacted by nature from the true devotee entering her temples  he glanced curiously at sparrer wondering what responsive chords might be struck in the soul of this waif of the great city but it was too dark to see his features clearly and he could only dimly surmise something of the younger lads feeling from sparrers quick intake of breath as the dark heavy coaches of the train rumbled off into the night leaving them standing between two walls of white overhead a myriad of stars burned like jewels never had they seemed so near so brilliant so alive the snow thrown high on either side of the tracks for there was a siding at this point was above their heads the stillness was almost oppressive now that the train was beyond hearing  pat stretched his arms and drew a long breath of the cold rarified air then expelled it in an audible sigh of supreme content  arrah now tis me foist breath av real air in a week and the two lungs av me aching for ut said he shure twill make the likes av ye grow to a mans size in a week me bantam and thots more than noo yorrk will be doing for ye in a loifetoime giving sparrer a hearty slap on the back hal i thought those passes read to upper chain and here we be dropped in a snowbank ill be after making complaint to the management for inconveniencing four gentlemen and reducing them to the ranks of common laborers  the others laughed as they followed pats example and shouldered their duffle to tramp the hundred yards up to the station for they had been in the rear car in a few minutes they were in the bare little waiting room in the middle of which a big stove was radiating welcome heat and exchanging greetings with the night operator who having wired the arrival and departure of the train was preparing to go home for there would be no more traffic for many hours he shook hands warmly with walter and hal whom he recognized at once as woodcraft camp boys was introduced to sparrer and jollied pat on what he was pleased to term his new york airs  i reckon your mother is waiting for you pat said he i saw a light over at the house when i came along youre welcome to stay here until daylight but i expect shes looking for you over there  i wrote her wed be there to breakfast but not to get up any earlier on that account replied pat his eyes danced shure the ould lady thinks her son has been in the hands av the inimy and cannot rest aisy til she sees for herself that not a hair av his red head has been left in nooyorrk god bless her well go over there and relieve her mind  in speaking of his mother as the ould lady there was nothing disrespectful on the part of pat in reality it was a term of endearment the stars were beginning to pale as the boys made their way in single file along a narrow path through the snow toward the yellow gleam of a light set in the window of one of the rough frame houses that made up the village pat led straight for this  hello exclaimed upton in surprise have you deserted the old cabin  sure replied pat and there was just a suggestion of pride in his voice the mother was a long time between log walls but now the saints be praised she do be living in one of the illigant mansions of upper chain and by that token is a member of the aristocracy moved in last fall  by this time they had reached the house and at the sound of voices the door was thrown open and mrs malone stood in the doorway looking out eagerly it was a warm irish greeting that the boys received and hal who never had met her before understood where pat got his humor and ready tongue he at once dropped into his old brogue entirely and while mrs malone bustled about putting a hot breakfast on the table pat told her of his adventures in the great city as only he could from time to time she interrupted with comments so like pats own ready repartee that between the two the boys were kept in a gale of laughter  eating breakfast by lamplight is a new experience to me declared hal as they sat down to bacon corn bread just from the oven flapjacks with thick maple syrup and coffee  tis pwhat yez will be doing every day for the next week and lucky if yez get the breakfast as good a wan as this anyway declared pat  they had just finished the meal when pats younger brother and two little sisters shyly joined them they were neatly dressed and walter was immensely tickled with pats manifest pride in them it had been decided to spend the day there to prepare for the trip into the woods and also to give pat a day at home they would take the train the next morning over to lower chain a twenty minute run and from there they would have to depend on their own good legs to take them the twelve miles on the lake to woodcraft camp one of pats first inquiries had been as to whether there had been any snow during his absence and great was his satisfaction to learn that there had not he explained that that meant clear ice on the lake for the heavy snows had come early this year before the lake froze and they would be able to make practically the whole distance on skates  while pat was attending to affairs at home the three visitors went out to do the village the sun was well up and as they stepped out into the clear still air both hal and walter paused with a little gasp of surprise and pleasure this was not the ugly sawmill village of their acquaintance but for the tall stack of the mill and the whine and scream of the saws there was nothing familiar it was as if a good fairy had touched the scene with a magic wand and all the sordid ugliness had been transformed to beauty over everything lay the white mantle of snow it half buried the smaller cabins it hid completely the stumps of the clearings it had buried the litter of the mill yard it glittered and sparkled in the rays of the sun beyond the clearing the evergreens rose in great pyramids of white no upper chain was no longer a blot on the landscape it was beautiful  as for sparrer he was dumb while he could not appreciate the wonder of the transformation he could and did appreciate the wonder of the scene and for the time being his tongue was tied from the mill office they called up woodcraft camp to tell doctor merriam of their arrival and that they would be with him on the following day  gee didnt it seem good to hear the big chiefs voice again said hal as they went out into the mill to show sparrer how logs are transformed into boards timbers and shingles sparrer tomorrow you are going to meet one of the finest men in the whole world bar none hes a great old scout  mrs malone was naturally disappointed that pat was not to be home for christmas but she said little and busied herself in helping the boys prepare for their holiday her motherly irish soul warmed at once to sparrer and she fussed over his outfit and comfort in a way that was new to the youngster for his own mother working from daylight to dark and often late into the night had had little time for mothering the boys had brought some gifts for the children and these their mother hid against the arrival of good st nick a part of sparrers outfit as a christmas gift from his comrades had been a warm mackinaw and to this mrs malone insisted on adding a pair of thick woolen stockings of her own knitting pats contribution was a pair of snowshoes which he brought out at the last moment as they were starting for the train and as he took them a lump rose in the younger lads throat and cut off speech but the shine in his eyes expressed more than his tongue could have such kindness was a new experience in his life and he hardly knew how to meet it  the short run by train to lower chain was quickly made and the boys piled out eager to be on their way pat had provided a stout toboggan which showed the effects of long use and on this he deftly loaded their duffle and supplies lashing them securely into place sparrer watched him with troubled face ever since the mention of skates the day before he had worried over that twelve mile trip down the lake he knew that upton and harrison had brought skates but he had none and if he had had he couldnt have used them he had never been on a pair in his life skating is not an accomplishment of the lower east side of new york  so sparrer had worried if it had been merely a matter of a twelve mile hike he would have been on edge to show the others that he could keep up but he knew that with the others on skates for him to try to keep up was as absurd as for a truck to try to keep pace with a racing car and it hurt his pride to feel that he would be a drag on the others hal and walter already had their skates on and were cutting circles figure eights and grapevine twists on the smooth ice with the fastening of the last lash pat put on his own skates  now me bantam get up on that load he ordered  sparrer demurred but the young giant picked him up bodily and plumped him down on a roll of blankets wrapped him up in a blanket left out for the purpose ordered him to sit still with dire threats of what would happen to him if he did not called to the others to get on to their jobs and they were off hal and walter with the rope of the toboggan between them pulling and pat pushing behind with his hands on sparrers shoulders  before them stretched the graywhite expanse of the lake and on either side the glistening white shores now receding as they passed a deep bay again creeping out in a long point there was no sound save the sharp ring of the skates and the soft grate of the smoothly slipping toboggan past two big summer hotels with blank staring windows past shuttered and deserted summer camps they sped until all sign of mans handiwork disappeared the keen air was like wine in their veins and it was hard to believe that the thermometer had registered eighteen below zero that morning for the air was dry and did not penetrate as would the moisture laden air at home at a temperature many degrees above the zero mark  i just cant believe that thermometer was on its job protested hal as they stopped for a breathing spell halfway down the lake why im so warm i wish i was rid of this mackinaw  me too added walter  pat suddenly whirled hal around and looked keenly at his left ear the rim was a dead white if you cant believe the thermometer perhaps you can believe this said he drily as he touched the ear what did i tell you about keeping your cap down over your ears shure tis a tenderfoot and not a first class scout at all at all thot ye be  what do you mean demanded hal as he slipped a glove off to feel of the ear at the look of blank astonishment that swept across his face as he discovered that the edge of his ear was stiff and wholly without feeling the others roared with laughter  i mean that youre frostbitten already replied pat and i hope that this will be a lesson to the whole bunch of you you may not feel him but old jack frost is right on the job just the same and it dont do up here to needlessly expose yourself it is because the air is so dry that you dont feel the frost but you freeze just the same well run over to that point and thaw you out and then i guess youll keep your cap down where it belongs  at the point pat rubbed the frosted ear vigorously with a handful of snow until the frost was out and for a few minutes hal danced with the ache of it while the others grinned thats one on me all right and youre welcome to laugh but little hal harrison has learned his lesson no more frostbites for me thank you he growled i dont wish you fellows any hard luck but i hope youll get a taste of it yourselves just to know what it feels like  walter and sparrer took warning from hals experience and saw to it that their ears were well covered before they started on as they drew near the end of the lake old baldy and mount seward loomed up with a grandeur and forbidding austerity that was almost menacing and which was yet grandly heroic the long pier of woodcraft camp jutting out into the lake was now clearly visible and on the end of it were two figures waving greetings  its the big chief and mother merriam lets give them the old yell cried upton  they stopped and with upton to lead sent the old woodcraft yell ringing down the lakewhoopyiyiyi whoopyiyiyi whoopyiyiyi woodcraft and even as the echoes flung it back from old baldy it was returned to them in the mingled voices of a man and a woman the doctor and mrs merriam were sending them welcome  a few minutes later they reached the pier and were exchanging warm greetings sparrer had felt a natural diffidence at the thought of meeting the man of whom he had heard so much but it vanished in the first handclasp and by the time he had reached the snug cabin he felt as if he had always known this greathearted kindly man and the sweetfaced woman whom the others called mother in a dim way he understood the loyalty and affection of his comrades for these two who were devoting their lives to the making of strong men from weak boys     chapter vi  snowshoes and fish   around the great log fire that night pat told doctor merriam about his trip and his impressions of city life winding up with the emphatically expressed conviction that while it might be a good place to do business it was no place in which to live and that he would rather have a cabin in the shadow of old baldy than a palace on riverside drive  so you dont envy hal laughed the doctor  i do not roared pat i wouldnt give the poorest muskrat pelt i ever took to change places with him  oh you young savage cried the doctor still i share in a measure your feeling i have lived in many cities but you see here i am buried in the woods and some of my friends wonder why ill tell you it is because here i can live simply unaffectedly true to myself and to god here he swept a hand toward the booklined walls are my friends ready to give me of inspiration comfort advice knowledge whatever i demand or may need they are not dead things these books they are living personalities which have enriched and are enriching the world when you boys listen to me you are not listening just to an audible voice you are listening to an expression of that invisible something that we call the spiritthe true personality and so it is that the writer of a great or good book never dies his spiritual expression is there on the printed page just as much as if he were giving expression to it in audible speech so with all these great and wonderful men and women constantly about me how can i ever be lonely and then when i step outofdoors it is directly into the temple of god his nearness and presence are manifest in every phase of nature the trees are alive some of them sleeping but alive nevertheless and others not even sleeping sometimes i wonder if the very rocks are not alive the elements seemingly war with one another but there is nothing mean or petty or base in the mighty struggle as there invariably is in the conflict of human passions the indian sees the great spirit in the lightning and hears him in the rushing wind and the thunder and is not afraid but bows in reverence he has a sense of nearness to the creator and loses it when he is confined in the manmade world of brick and stone and steel and is eager to get back it is elemental in him in nature he sees god made manifest we call him a savage but i sometimes wonder if he is not more nearly a true child of the father of all than many socalled civilized men who win the plaudits of the world and seem to forget whence they came and whither they will go  but i didnt mean to preach a sermon but just to give you an idea of why pat and i prefer to be savages if you please and spend our lives with nature now pat what are your plans when do you start in for camp havent heard a word since you left fromhe paused at a warning wink from pat and then finishedyour partner big jim was down from the lumber camp this week and reported seeing a silver gray if you could catch a couple of those fellows that problem of going away to school would pretty nearly settle itself  whats a silver gray asked hal whose knowledge of fur bearers was rather limited  a color phase of the common red fox replied the doctor and if not worth its weight in gold it is worth so much that a single skin is often worth twice over the whole of a seasons catch of other furs why it should be called silver i dont know for the only silver about it is the tip of the tail the color is black and single skins have sold as high as 2500 and more and 800 to 1500 is not at all unusual so valuable are the skins that black fox farming has become an established industry and a pair of black foxes for breeding purposes are worth from 1000 up so you see jim saw considerable money running loose when he saw that fox  phew exclaimed hal with a low whistle of astonishment i didnt suppose there was anything on four legs except blooded live stock worth so much money wouldnt it be great if pat could catch three or four this winter  pat threw back his head and laughed heartily make it a dozen while youre about it son said he dont be so modest ive lived in these woods some years but i never yet have seen a live black fox and ive known of only two being caught if jim says he saw one he did theres nothing the matter with jims eyesight i guess ill have to have a look around the neighborhood where he saw it as for our plans doctor we are going to spend tomorrow with you and give these tenderfeet a few lessons on snowshoes well hit the trail for camp bright and early the next morning  the next day dawned clear and cold and after a hearty breakfast the snowshoes were brought forth first pat explained the tie in common use and showed just how to adjust the rawhide thongs to give free play to the ankles and yet prevent the toes from creeping forward to the crossbars with the thongs properly adjusted the shoes could be easily kicked off or put on again without untying the knots  the chief thing to remember said he is to take a long stride with the toes pointed straight ahead if you take a short step you will be almost certain to step on the tail of one shoe with the toe of the other and over you go now ill show you how and you fellows can practice a while out here in front where the snow has been cleared away until you get the hang of the thing then well make a little trip out into the woods and visit some of the old places so you can see how different they are from what they were last summer  i have a suggestion to make said the doctor while mother puts up a lunch you get these youngsters so that they can keep right side up then well all take a short hike and show muldoon how real woodmen can have a hot meal when there is three feet of snow in the woods  hurrah shouted hal that will be bully come on walt and lets see your paces  for the next fifteen minutes the three boys tramped back and forth in front of the cabin the shoes clacking merrily amid a running fire of chaff and comment from pat once sparrer stepped on one of uptons shoes and sent him headlong to the huge delight of the others again hal did just what pat had warned them against took a short step and tripped himself up but at the end of a quarter of an hour they had pretty well got the hang of the thing as pat expressed it and were eager to try it on deep snow  theres nothing to it declared hal i thought there were something to learn like skating but this is a cinch i could keep it up all day and by way of emphasizing his remarks once more tripped himself up and sat down abruptly  sure its no trick at all chaffed walter when you cant keep up sit down and when youre down stay down theres nothing to it for hal forgetting the width of his present underpinning had no sooner scrambled to his feet than he had gone down again because of the overlapping webs  the doctor and mrs merriam now joined them for the latter was an expert on shoes and had no mind to miss the outing pat and the doctor swung to their backs the packs wherein were the supplies and dishes and they were off the doctor in the lead mrs merriam next then sparrer hal upton and pat in the rear to keep the tenderfeet from straggling and to pull them out of the snow he explained  for a short distance a broken trail was followed then the doctor abruptly swung off among the trees where the snow lay deep and unbroken the three novices soon found that progress here was a very different matter from walking on the comparatively hard surface of the packed trail the shoes sank in perhaps a couple of inches and it was necessary to lift the feet more to step high which put more of a strain on the muscles also there was a tendency to step higher than was at all in good form and to shorten the stride by so doing losing the smooth easy forward roll from the hips  still all things considered the three novices were doing themselves proud until in an unguarded moment hal stepped on the stub of a broken branch of a fallen tree buried in the snow it caught in the tail of the shoe just enough to break his stride he took a short step to catch his balance stumbled and took a beautiful header at pats roar of laughter the others turned to see two big webs wildly waving above the snow and nothing more of the unfortunate hal now being plunged head first into deep snow with a pair of snowshoes on your feet is a good deal like being thrown into the water with a life preserver fast to your feetyou cant get them down for a few moments the others howled with glee as they watched the frantically kicking legs and listened to the smothered appeals for help from the luckless victim then pat reached out and loosened the shoes gripped hal by the ankles and drew him forth red in the face from his exertions and spitting out snow he looked so wholly bewildered and withal so chagrined and foolish that he was greeted with a fresh peal of laughter to which he responded with a sheepish grin as he tried to get the snow out of his neck and from up his sleeves  theres nothing to it nothing at all jeered walter  i didnt know but you thought you heard that black fox down there and were trying to get him said pat  at that instant upton involuntarily stepped back a thing for which snowshoes were never designed and a second later had measured his length in the snow falling at full length he did not disappear as hal had done but he was hardly less helpless every effort to help himself by putting his hands down was futile he simply buried his arms to the shoulders in the yielding snow without finding anything on which to get a purchase hal was jubilant  when youre down stay down he yelped laugh at me will you  walter had by this time managed to kick his shoes off and once free of these was soon on his feet and was enjoying the joke as much as any one both he and hal were up to their hips in the snow for here among the evergreens it had not packed and flounder as they would they could not get out  the doctors eyes twinkled as he picked up hals shoes and handed them to him well boys said he its high time we were hitting the trail again suppose you put your shoes on and well make up for lost time  hal took the shoes and then looked helplessly across at walter who had just secured his and it suddenly occurred to him that perhaps the doctors remark was not so guileless as it seemed  how in thunder are we going to he demanded vainly trying to force a shoe down to meet an upraised foot halfway in the doing of which he once more lost his balance  i thought i showed you fellows just how to put your shoes on this morning a good scout ought not to have to be shown twice how to do a simple thing like that said pat without cracking a smile what kind of scouts are you anyway crying for help the first time you tumble in a little bit of snow  whos crying for help demanded upton vainly striving to get a shoe down where he could get his foot into the fastening i wouldnt take any help now if i thought id got to stay here all day take that and that  he began to dig furiously with the shoe throwing the snow with malice aforethought full in pats face hal instantly took the cue and there was a hasty retreat on the part of their tormentors in the midst of which sparrer came to grief and had his turn at the snowshoers baptism in a few minutes walter had dug away enough snow to get his shoes under him and walked forth in triumph followed by hal sparrer anxious to prove himself a good sport refused all aid being small and light he had not sunk in as the others had and managed to get one shoe under him with this for a support he soon had the other fastened it was the work of a moment to adjust the first one and he was ready to take his place in line  there were no more mishaps and as they tramped on through the great still woodland the wonder and the beauty of it silenced them for it seemed like a vast cathedral in which the human voice would be a profanation of the solemn hush upton knew every foot within a radius of two miles of woodcraft camp and for five miles in the direction in which they were heading and yet not even to sparrer did the surroundings seem more strange such is the alchemy of the snow king to make the familiar unfamiliar the commonplace beautiful so it was that when at the end of three miles they emerged on the shore of a frozen sheet of water walter at first failed utterly to recognize it and it was not until pat made some reference to the huge pickerel walter had caught during his first summer at woodcraft that it dawned on him that this was the very setback where he had discovered pats secret fishing grounds and on the shore of which he had given pat his first lesson in boxing and in the meaning of the word honor  ive come over here because mother insists that a dinner in the woods is no more complete without a fish course than it would be in a new york hotel and because to tell the truth i have a hankering for a taste of fresh fish myself pat i hope that spring is still open where you put the minnows last fall suppose you take this net and pail and see what you can find he opened a small folding net as he was speaking i take it for granted that you youngsters have your belt axes with you as good scouts in the woods should one of you can run over to that alder thicket and cut a dozen straight sticks about three feet long and as thick as my forefinger the other two can chop holes in the ice they dont need to be very big you know not over a foot across i suggest that you scatter them pretty well it adds to the fun to have them some distance apart and it multiplies the chances of a good catch while you are doing that i will start a fire and get things started for lunch  sparrer having no axe but a stout scout knife volunteered to cut the alder saplings while hal and walter attended to the holes in the ice hal was radiant this was one of the things he had counted on and he had brought from new york a dozen type as the modern tipups for fishing through the ice are called but when they had started out that morning he had not dreamed that he would have a chance to use them on a snowshoe trip and so they were neatly rolled in his duffle bag at the camp  wonder what kind of a rig the big chief has got and how hes going to use those sticks said he to upton as he came up to where walter was making the ice fly in glittering chips  dont know but whatever it is you can bet your last dollar it is all right replied walter how many holes have you cut  five im going to chop one more over there toward the north shore how many have you replied hal  six that ought to be a good place over there and that will make the dozen here come sparrer and the big chief and i guess well soon see what the idea is pat must have found the spring open for sparrer has the pail  the guess was a good one for when he peeped in the pail walter found that it contained a couple of dozen minnows together the three walked over to where hal was just finishing the last hole the doctor took from under his arm a bundle of short pieces of lath each about eighteen inches long tapering toward one end to which was fastened a bit of red flannel two inches from the other end was a hole big enough for one of the alder sticks to pass through freely fastened close to the end and neatly wound around it was a short length of stout line on the end of which was a hook with wire snell unwinding one of these lines the doctor passed one of the alder sticks through the hole in the lath baited the hook with a lively minnow and dropped it through the hole in the ice the alder stick was placed across this so that the lath came in the middle and lay on the ice at right angles a pull on the line would drag the end of the lath down making it stand upright with its little red signal on the end and that was all there was to it  it was simple in the extreme but quite as effective as hals more elaborate type could have been as was presently demonstrated they were just preparing to set the last tipup when hal glancing over to the first one set saw the red signal and with a wild yell of weve got one weve got one started for it at top speed the others paused to see what the result would be and saw him yank out a flapping prize  its a beaut he panted as he rejoined them holding out a handsome pickerel bet it weighs five pounds if it weighs an ounce say this is great  the fish was already stiff but much to their surprise the doctor told them it was not dead frozen fish often retaining life for some time after being taken from the water he now left the tipups to the care of the three boys warning them to make frequent rounds of the holes to break the ice as it formed and keep the lines free the fish he took with him to where mother merriam was busy beside the fire for which pat was chopping wood  pickerel were numerous and hungry to judge by the way they bit it was novel and exciting sport to the three city boys there would be a yell of theres one and then a wild race to see who could reach it first at first they almost invariably forgot in their excitement to take along the bait pail which meant a second trip for one of them to rebait the hook sometimes the signal would drop before they reached it and they knew that the fish was off several times there were two signals waving at once and one time there were five by the time the doctors welcome hail of dinner came ringing across the ice the bait pail was empty and they had fourteen fish none under three pounds and from that up to six with the first one caught they had a total of fifteen the doctor smiled as he scanned the eager faces of the young fishermen and then looked at the long row of fish laid out on the snow  enough is plenty said he and i guess this will do for today we want to leave some for the boys next summer well take the lines up after dinner  how good that dinner did smell to the hungry boys with appetites whetted by exercise in the keen air the snow had been shoveled away nearly to the ground for the bed logs for the fire and ample space cleared in front and spread with balsam boughs on which to sit there was a steaming kettle of pea soup and a pot of hot chocolate the pickerel had been split and broiled in halves pinned to pieces of hemlock bark stood before the fire and basted with bacon drippings there was a venison steak done to a turn for the doctor had hung a deer in his ice house at the end of the open season there were potatoes boiled in their jackets there was a brown johnnycake baked in a reflector oven and to cap all a plate of the doughnuts for which mother merriam was famous  and you call this a lunch cried walter when he had eaten until he had to let out his belt no wonder it required two packs to bring it here well is there anything to beat this in new york  not in a tousand years oim going to run away and live here declared sparrer and while the others laughed he stared with dreamy eyes into the leaping flames of the huge fire pat had built and who shall say but that in them he saw the symbols of new hopes and ambitions springing from the colorless sordid drudgery which until this time had been his life  after the meal was finished and the dishes washed there was an hour of storytelling by the doctor ending with the singing of america under the towering snowladen spruces and then the homeward trip thanks to their experiences on the outward trip and the watchfulness resulting therefrom there were no further mishaps and when they reached camp and kicked off the big webs once more the boys were ready to vote their first day in winter woods all that they had dreamed it would be and more also they were quite willing to second and carry by unanimous vote the motion that they seek their beds early in preparation for an early start the next day     chapter vii  on the trail   day was just breaking when the boys bade farewell to doctor and mother merriam and with a hot breakfast under their belts started for the trapping camp as yet pat had given no hint as to where it was located and walter and hal respecting his reticence forbore to ask questions walter did venture to ask if they would reach there before dark  no replied pat well have to make a camp tonight and advanced no further information  all their duffle and the supplies which pat was taking in were loaded on the toboggan and to this pat had rigged a sort of harness so that two walking single file could drag it this relieved them of packs walter and hal each carried his rifle on the chance of picking up a rabbit on the way the snowshoes were slung over their backs pat explaining that for a time they would follow a broken out lumber trail and it would be easier walking without the shoes than on them  it was when they turned into this trail that the first suspicion of where they were bound for flashed through uptons mind but he held his peace and settled to the task of doing his share of the pulling and this proved to be no easy matter the trail was but roughly broken out by the passage of lumber sleds and it soon became necessary for one to steady the load to keep it from capsizing it was slow toilsome work and when at the end of ten miles pat called a halt for a rest while he made four cups of hot pea soup by the simple process of melting snow and crumbling into it a roll of erbswurst the others were ready to declare that they had come twenty miles  as he drank his soup and munched a cracker walter scanned his surroundings closely presently he discovered what he sought a partially obliterated blaze on a big tree just beyond and to the right of where they were squatting  ive got you now old mr foxy he cried this mysterious camp of yours is the cabin in smugglers hollow and were going to camp tonight at little goose pond more than that your partner is alec smith why didnt i guess it before own up now old crafty  quite unabashed pat bestowed a grin on upton three bullseyes he commented ive been wondering how long it would take you fellows to catch the scent began to think id have to rub your noses in it  hurrah interrupted hal who had been an eager listener i never thought of the hollow and yet there is no place i should like to go to so much as that say walt these heads of ours sure are thick dont you remember that pat told us that first night in new york that alec was trapping and the last he heard of him he was over in the hollow well wed make good detectives we would ive done a lot of wondering about pats partner and what sort of a fellow he would prove to be and whether or not wed like him and to think its alec if you werent such a young and tender innocent id throw you in the snow and give you a shampoo what do you say walt to doing it anyway  come on cried pat the two of you or all three  upton shook his head mournfully id like to but it wouldnt be right he isnt as big as the two of us and so it wouldnt do at all it would be the same as a big fellow picking on a little one you know i thrashed him once for doing that very thing and now if we should turn around and do it im afraid the force of my beautiful example would be wholly destroyed i tell you what you do it alone hal  hes too small declared hal thats why i wanted you to help then my conscience would be only half guilty im going to let him off this time with just a snowball  suiting his action to the word he landed a big soft snowball full on the side of pats head pat made a rush for him but walter thrust out a foot and sent him headlong into the snow and before he could regain his feet hal was on him endeavoring to wash his face with snow in a second there was the liveliest kind of a snow fight upton and sparrer yelling encouragement with absolute impartiality it ended with hals smothered cry of enough and pats allowing him up just in time to see walter and then sparrer unceremoniously pitched into the snow by way of showing that all scouts are equal pat explained as he rubbed their faces  panting and glowing from the frolic they put out the fire built to heat their soup and were ready to hit the trail again from this point on the snowshoes were an absolute necessity for they left the lumber trail for another ten miles through the woods this time they were not dependent on the blazed trees as they had been when they went that way in the fall for some one had been over the trail since the last snowfall evidently coming out from little goose pat studied the tracks for a few minutes then his face cleared it was big jim said he i wonder now if he took a look in the hollow to see how alec was getting on he may have been over to the gillicuddy camp the trail from which comes in at the pond you remember but i have an idea he swung around to see alec i wonder now where he saw that fox i just took it for granted that it was around where he is cutting and didnt ask any questions for fear of letting the coon out of the hole about where we were going then when i was alone with the doctor we both forgot all about jim there were so many other things to talk about it may be that he saw that silver gray somewhere along this trail well keep our eyes peeled for signs  how do you know that big jim made these tracks asked walter who had been studying them closely hoping to find out for himself the clue which made pat so sure of his man but unable to see anything distinctive save that they were of odd shape being nearly round  by a combination of two thingsthe shape of the tracks and the length of the stride replied pat jim always uses bearspaw shoes and i dont believe there are more than half a dozen other pairs in this neck of woods then look at the length of the stride its a good three inches longer than mine and theres nothing dainty about mine there isnt a man in the woods who could take that stride and hold it but jim everly so im as sure it was big jim as i am that if we dont get a hustle on well have to camp in the snow and itll be a lot more comfortable at the pond weve got another long hike tomorrow and we want to be in shape to do it  for some miles the going was fairly level and once they had got into the swing of the thing the boys found it comparatively easy there were two or three mishaps but these were counted part of the sport about two miles from their destination they came to a spur of a mountain over which the trail led in fact it was the very spur on the other side of which spud ely had overrun the trail and got lost the fall previous pat called a halt  its going to be no small job to get this load up there said he we can go around the spur but to do that will add a good three miles and in the valley it will be dark before we can reach camp what do you think are you game to try the hill  the hill the hill follow me comrades up yonder heights and drive the enemy from their guns shouted hal striking a heroic attitude and pretending to flourish an imaginary sword      where lives the scout by difficulties pressed     who will admit a chicken heart possessed     who will not rather bravely face the wust     and do and dare and conquer or go bust  bravo cried walter      when dares our comrade coin and use a word like wust     well take his dare and see wholl scale yon hillside fust  lead on mr malone well make it or die in the attempt  all right me brave scouts replied pat up we go tis a chance to see the kind of stuff thats in the likes of you for twill be no childs play getting this load up there and when we get up there where you see the bare rock watch your footing that rock is slippery and a fall there would be serious  the next half hour was one of panting sweating toil in the first place as soon as the grade began to rise sharply the boys found that the only way they could progress was by digging their toes into the snow through the toe holes in the shoes which brought an added strain on the already weary muscles of the calves it would have been bad enough in view of their inexperience if they had had nothing else to consider but there was that heavy load and it grew heavier every minute as they got higher where the wind had had full sweep there was comparatively little snow and in some places the bare rock was exposed here they found it easier going without the snowshoes than with them  hauling and pushing they worked the toboggan up until at last the spur was crossed  gee whiz exclaimed hal im sweating like a butcher thats what i call work  and were doing it for fun added upton funny what a difference the viewpoint makes i suppose its all in the way you look at it whether work is fun or fun is work i can tell you one thing and that is that i for one am mighty glad that there isnt another one of those things to cross today im afraid id lie down and holler quits what are you rubbing your legs for sparrer  just feeling of em to get wise if deys all dere replied sparrer  the remainder of the trail to little goose was comparatively easy and they reached the familiar leanto just as dusk was settling down and there was more than one sigh of thankfulness as the shoes were kicked off for the last time  im tired enough to drop right down and go to sleep in the snow but my little tummy wont let me confessed hal ring for the waiter please and have him bring me a planked steak with half a chicken on the side grapefruit salad and a pot of coffee with real cream wake me up when it comes  nothing doing declared pat this isnt the waldorf astoria but hotel de shivers heat and food supplied only to those who pay in labor all bills payable in advance  thats me hal seated himself on the pile of stuff and gave vent to an exaggerated sigh of contentment havent i labored all day tell the bellhop to take my stuff to my room i think ill have my dinner served there  he ended with a grunt the result of a sharp poke in the pit of his stomach from an axe handle to turn on the heat with explained pat sweetly thrusting the axe into hals hands and pointing to a pile of birch logs  hal got to his feet with a groan and a grimace and followed upton who with another axe had already started for the woodpile youre a slave driver thats what you are a flinthearted slave driver he grumbled albeit with a twinkle that belied his words      my tummy oh my tummy       it gives me such a pain     i wonder will it ever       feel really full again  that depends on how soon you get that wood split grinned pat if you dont get a move on it will be so dark you cant see what you are doing and i give you fair warningno wood no dinner      let it never be said i am ever a shirk     when a dinner depends on the way that i work  retorted hal and forthwith fell to his task with a vim that put upton on his mettle to break even with him for hal was no mean axeman as pat well knew the handling of an axe was one of the things which hal had learned and learned well during his three summers in the woods to the thorough woodsman an axe is a complete toolchest with it he can do almost anything that needs to be done from the cutting of firewood to the building of a log cabin  sparrer was put to work pulling down the hemlock boughs which had been piled in front of the leanto to keep out the snow while pat unpacked things started the fire and made preparations for the evening meal this was sparrers first experience in a leanto and when the boughs were out of the way he examined it with interest the back and two ends were of logs the front being open its whole width the roof was of big sheets of hemlock bark laid overlapping and with a sharp pitch to the back  on the ground about seven feet from the rear wall two sixfoot logs about eight inches through had been staked end to end so that they reached from one side wall to the other midway a similar log had been laid across to the rear wall making two pens as it were these had been filled with small balsam boughs thrust at an angle butts down so that they shingled and packed closely the result was two beds fifteen inches thick and so springy and comfortable that it made one sleepy just to look at them it was perhaps three feet from the beds to the open front in this space at one end was a table two feet square made by driving four stakes into the ground and nailing on a top made of a flattened sheet of cedar bark  a little snow had sifted in through the protecting boughs and this sparrer swept out with a fir bough for a broom pat meanwhile had a kettle of snow melting for water for soup and was mixing up a johnnycake the reflector oven was set before the fire to get heated and while sparrer helped bring in the wood which the two choppers had split pat sliced bacon and put it on to parboil in the fryingpan having melted snow to make water enough to cover it  wot youse doing that for asked sparrer oi thought youse always fried bacon  to get some of the salt out of it son replied pat ill fry it all right when the time comes just you lay out the plates and cups where they will keep warm  sparrer ranged the four agateware plates which were really shallow pans so that soup could be served in them as well as dry food against a stick where they would get warm but not too hot to handle the erbswurst was crumbled into the now boiling water a handful of julienne or evaporated vegetables cut in thin strips was added the pan of johnnycake was put in the oven and the four boys gathered around to watch and wait with many a hungry sniff the soup was soon ready and pat announced the first course how good it did taste as they sat on their blanket rolls near enough to the fire to enjoy its warmth each with a pan of the hot soup on his knees  before this was finished pat poured off the water from the bacon and that was soon sizzling and throwing off that most delicious of all odors to a hungry woodsman  course number two called pat as he apportioned the brown slices among the four plates and then drew forth the johnnycake baked to a turn a rich even brown all over with a heart of gold the very sight of which brought forth gasps of delighted anticipation  whats course number three mr chef asked walter as he prepared to sink his teeth into his quarter of the corn bread  something worth saving your appetite for replied pat regreasing the pan and pouring in the remainder of his batter for another cake he poured off all but a little of the bacon fat from the big fryingpan and then dropped into it a slice of meat which he had kept hidden under a towel  venison by all thats great shouted hal as the meat began to sizzle on the hot iron why didnt you tell us you had venison so that the thought of it would have helped us up that pesky hill  tis the docthors contribution to the joy av living responded pat deftly flipping the steak over to sear the other side but i mistrust yez have eaten so much already thot tis not the loikes av yez will be wanting more than maybe a wee bite but never ye moind tis meself will do justice to the docthor and his gift  dont you believe it roared the three in unison  the steak and the second johnnycake were done together and were finished together to the last scrap and crumb and along with them went hot chocolate there was a general loosening of belts and then hal broke the silence of contentment which had fallen on the little group      my tummy oh my tummy       it has now another pain     i wish that it were empty       that it might be filled again  said he gazing mournfully into his empty plate  thems my sentiments too said walter when the laugh that followed had subsided but any fellow who springs a thing like that has to pay for it i move that hal wash the dishes all in favor say aye  three ayes made the woods ring all opposed say no  hals no was shouted at the top of his lungs  tis a vote declared walter mr harrison will now attend to his duties and carry out the action of this assembly  after the dishes were out of the way pat built a huge fire with three great backlogs one above another and slanting back to keep them from rolling down they were held in place by braces at the back in front of these smaller logs were piled the backlogs reflecting the heat forward into the leanto then the blankets were spread on the rough beds and with all their clothing on including moccasins four weary young woodsmen turned in for the night  pat was asleep almost as soon as he touched the bed and hal and upton were not far behind him but to sparrer tired as he was the novelty of his surroundings was too great for immediate sleep and for a long time he lay staring out at the flickering flames and above them at the brilliant stars his active imagination keyed to a high pitch it was like fairyland to him nothing seemed real he had read and heard of these things but that he eddie muldoon could actually be experiencing them sleeping in a real hunters camp in the dead of winter tramping on snowshoes through great lonely forests eating such meals as he had never known before in all his short lifemeals cooked over open fires in the great wonderful outofdoors couldnt be and yet here he was  the fire died down until only a deep glow a warm ruddy glow which grew less and less lighted the rough interior and before it had quite vanished eddie had slipped from the real which seemed unreal to the unreal which so often seems real in the realm of dreams  three times during the night pat crawled out of his blankets to put wood on the fire but the other sleepers knew nothing of it they slept the deep heavy sleep of healthy tired boys and it mattered not to them that the temperature dropped until the very trees cracked and split with the cold they were as warm and comfortable as if in their own beds at home overhead the stars shone down on a great white world wherein the fire made but a flickering point of yellow light and wherein was no sound save the heavy breathing of the sleepers the sputter of hot coals snapping off into the snow the occasional crack of a frostriven tree and the soft stamp of a snowshoe rabbit gazing wondereyed at the dying embers     chapter viii  alec hints at dark things   hal was willing to swear that he had not been asleep more than ten minutes when he was awakened by the beating of a pan with a stick and pats roar of breakfast all hands out for breakfast he rolled over sleepily so as to look out pat was laughing at him beyond the firelight and from the tiny strip of sky above the dark tree tops he could see a few pale stars blinking at him weakly  aw pat thats no joke you may think its funny but it isnt he growled and there was a note of real anger this time  what demanded pat with a deep throaty chuckle  you know whatwaking a feller up when hes just got to sleep and is dead tired and got a hard day coming flared hal  aisy aisy son do ye think i would be frying bacon in the middle of the night for a joke tis meself has been up this good hour and tis six oclock this very minute twill be daylight by the toime we be ready to start returned pat goodhumoredly  hal had it on the tip of his tongue to say that he didnt believe it but by this time he was sufficiently awake to smell the bacon and hear it sizzle and sputter in the pan moreover his companions were already kicking off their blankets and he had the good sense to realize that pat meant just what he said still it was hard to believe and it was not until he had reached for his watch that he was convinced that it really was time to prepare for another days tramp then he hastily crawled from his blankets his good humor fully restored for hal was a good sport and there was nothing of the shirk about him  i beg pardon pat said he as he joined the two shivering figures crowding as close to the fire as they could comfortably get while they watched pat stir up the pancake batter i honestly thought you were up to one of your old tricks and putting something across on us doesnt seem as if id more than closed my eyes phew but its cold  it was it was the hour just before the break of day when perhaps because the blood has not yet begun to circulate freely the cold seems to have reached its maximum of strength beyond the narrow radius of the glow from the fire it seemed to fairly bite to the bone  get busy with the axe and youll forget it advised pat adding it is the courtesy of the woods to leave a little wood ready for the next fellow who may hit camp late as we did yesterday youll have just about time enough to get warmed up before these flapjacks are ready  good idea cried walter seizing an axe come on you fellows sparrer can lug it in as we split it  at the end of ten minutes pat called them to eat and by that time they had forgotten the cold for they were in a warm glow from exercise  ill bet it was cold in the night said upton as they sat down to bacon flapjacks and hot chocolate  right you are my boy replied pat when i got up the second time it was cold enough to freeze the tail off a brass monkey  when you got up the second time what in the dickens were you up for exclaimed hal  to kape yez from freezing to death grinned pat did yez think the fire would feed itself  i didnt think anything about it confessed hal gee it must have been cold when you crawled out to start things this morning makes me shiver to think of it i guess the rest of us are the lucky little boys to have everything started for us and a ripping good fire going before we turned out do you always get up before daylight in the woods pat  sure replied pat its nothing when youre used to it most trappers are on the trail by break of day the days are all too short in winter anyway especially when youve got a long trap line to work over i expect alec is on the line now hell be trying to get through early today so as to have things ready for us when we reach the cabin its going to be a stiff pull today for you fellows and the sooner we get started the better  as soon as breakfast was finished the toboggan was packed the brush piled once more in front of the leanto and the fire put out by the simple process of throwing snow on it the cold light of the stars had given way to the colder gray of the dawn as they once more slipped on the shoes and hit the trail around little goose pond it was then that the three novices realized that they were indeed tenderfeet they had not gone half a mile before it seemed as if every muscle from their thighs down was making individual and vigorous protest but they were game and if pat guessed their feelings it was not from any word which they let drop  gradually the stiffness wore off and at the end of a couple of hours they were traveling with some degree of comfort pat purposely set an easy pace for the first few miles and he kept a watchful eye on sparrer for whom he felt personally responsible as a matter of fact the youngster was standing it even better than the other two for one thing he was considerably lighter and his shoes bore him up better than was the case with his companions in places where the snow was packed he did not sink in at all whereas the others broke through slightly and on soft snow he did not begin to sink as far as they did of course this meant far less strain on his muscles and greater ease in walking  as they rounded the end of the pond pat pointed out the place where he had been mistaken for a deer by two city boys and got a bullet through his hat a little beyond this point they saw the first sign of life since they had entered the woods the tracks of a hare or snowshoe rabbit and with them other tracks which at first glance all but pat mistook for those of another rabbit  you fellows wait here a minute said he and followed the trail into a thicket of young hemlocks a few minutes later he called to them to join him they found him at the farther side of the thicket at his feet the snow had been considerably disturbed and there were some bloodstains and torn scraps of white fur beyond a single trail led to the foot of a tree and there ended  marten explained pat briefly in response to the looks of inquiry he ran mr longlegs down here ate his dinner and took to the trees ive had a hunch that there were marten in this neck of woods but havent had a chance to trap them yet  later they put up a flock of spruce grouse but it was out of season and the boys had too much respect for the spirit as well as the letter of the law to be even tempted to shoot after the noon lunch pat quickened the pace somewhat the temperature had moderated rapidly and the sky was overcast its a weather breeder and were in for more snow said pat as he scanned the sky with some appearance of anxiety i dont like the looks of it we want to reach the cabin before the storm breaks and weve got to hit it up faster in order to do it how are your legs  still doing business replied hal the stiffness is out but i guess i wont object to reaching that little old cabin how about you walt  same here replied upton im game for the rest of the distance but the cabin will look good to me all right all right hope alec will have dinner ready ive no sooner eaten than im hungry again      my tummy oh my tummy  began hal but pat cut him short with the order to fall in and started off at a pace which left hal no breath to waste on doggerel they now buckled down to the trail in earnest pats fears proved well grounded for they were still some three miles from the cabin when the first needlelike particles began to hiss through trees and sting their faces by the time they entered the pass to smugglers hollow the tracks of big jim had been entirely obliterated and pat was holding the trail by the blazed trees a feat by no means easy because of the difficulty of looking ahead in the face of the storm  in the narrow pass they stopped for a few minutes for a breathing spell there the force of the storm was broken but when they emerged into the hollow they found that they must force their way into the very teeth of it the wind had risen and it drove the fine icy particles with a force that almost cut the exposed skin the blinding cloud swirled about them and completely hid their surroundings pat in the lead partly broke the force of the storm for those behind it seemed to them as if he must be going by blind instinct but if he was he had a dogged confidence that was at least reassuring at last when it seemed to the three city lads that they simply could not push on another foot pat stopped and raised a warning hand listen said he  with straining ears they listened but for a couple of minutes heard nothing then seemingly out of the heart of the storm there came a faint helloo  alec said pat briefly hes getting worried  together they gave an answering shout but the wind seemed to snatch the sound from their lips and whirl it behind them no use said pat winds the wrong way and we better save our breath well need it it isnt far now and hell keep yelling to guide us  once more they buckled down to the task in hand the few minutes respite had eased the weary muscles and the sound of alecs voice was wonderfully stimulating fifteen minutes later panting and gasping powdered with snow from head to feet they stumbled up to the cabin just as alec smith threw open the door to renew his signals for a second he stared then a look of intense relief swept across his rugged features  illustration once more they buckled down to the task  glory be he cried springing forward and unceremoniously shoving the exhausted boys into the cabin i was feared that ye would be having to spend the night in a snowdrift did ye no hear me shouting  pat nodded as he sank on to a stool panting for breath we heard you all right alec but we couldnt make you hear us because the wind was the wrong way besides we didnt have any breath to spare  but alec wasnt listening he was delightedly shaking hands with walter and hal and helping them to strip off their mackinaws not forgetting sparrer whose presence was a surprise pat having sent no warning of this addition to the party  my but ye be a sight for sore eyes he declared as he bustled about preparing hot chocolate and in other ways striving to make his guests comfortable saving big jim who spent one night here i havent laid eyes on a living soul since pat left and that was three weeks gone though i mistrust that there be others no so very far away  pat looked up quickly whats that he demanded sharply  alecs face clouded ive seen signs which i dinna like ill be telling ye more aboot it after dinner said he briefly  and the catch since ive been away asked pat  is no what it should be theres na doot aboot that its no what it should be the face of the young scotchman darkened still more pat flashed him a look of understanding well talk that over by and by said he just now were half famished my but that stew smells good ill unpack while you are getting the stuff ready with that toboggan in here there isnt room to turn around  the toboggan had been dragged in when they first arrived and it occupied most of the available room walter helped him unload piling the stuff on one of the bunks for the time being presently alec called for their eating outfit confessing that his establishment didnt possess dishes enough for so many at length he announced dinner ready and bade the four draw up to the little rough deal table spread with a piece of white oilcloth for seats there were two fivefoot benches made by splitting a log smoothing the flat sides and inserting four stout birch legs in the convex side of each these were drawn up on either side of the table and at one end alec drew up an empty box for his seat  alec had as walter expressed it laid himself out on that dinner there was venison stew with dumplings and a rich thick gravy there were bakingpowder biscuits as light as feathers there were baked potatoes and canned string beans and last but not least there was a great brown loaf of hot gingerbread  hows your tummy now asked walter as hal at last was forced to refuse a third helping of stew  its too small hal complained i want more i want a lot more and i cant eat another mouthful  pat insisted on helping alec do up the dishes and flatly refused to allow any one else take a hand so the others spent the time in stowing away their duffle and inspecting the interior of the cabin to sparrer it was of course all new and strange as for that it was hardly less so to harrison and upton when they had last seen it it had been windowless doorless and the roof at the rear had been but temporarily patched now there was a stout door four small windows had been fitted into the openings left for this purpose the temporary repairs which pat had made on the roof at the rear end had been replaced with a permanent roof in fact the whole roof had been put in first class shape the side walls had been repacked with moss between the logs the four side bunks repaired and a new one built at the back and all filled with freshly cut balsam the floor had been repaired so also had the fireplace and chimney a small cupboard and shelves had been added on the floor were two big deerskins  but the thing which caught and held the attention of the boys most was a big bearskin which had been thrown on one of the upper bunks  when and where did you get him asked upton eagerly  shot him within less than half a mile of the cabin just before real cold weather set in replied alec he was just gettin ready to den up for the winter i misdoot he was the same one that give that young feller you called sister the scare the day he was alone here last fall tracked him in a light snow and was lucky enough to see him first regular old he feller and he sure took some killing first shot got him right back of the shoulder and made him squall a plenty but it didna stop him knew by that that i had hit him and hit him hard but the way he beat it you neverd have guessed he was hurt at all when i see the blood on the trail i kenned he was hard hit and would no travel far if left alone so i sat down and smoked a pipe then i took up the trail and sure enough he had laid down behind a windfall about a quarter of a mile from where i first see him the old fox heard me coming and sneaked away again but he was getting weak and didna go far before he laid down again this time i got another shot and broke his backbone but at that it took two more shots to finish him you aint never killed a bar till hes dead what do you think that feller ely will say when he gits that skin  spud is that for spud do you mean to say that you are going to send that skin to spud ely cried walter  alec nodded i promised him a barskin when he left and i reckon that thats hisn hope hell like it  like it alec hell be tickled silly he wrote me that you had promised him one cried walter its perfectly bully good old spud i wish he could be here with us now to make a little sunshine not that we need it he hastened to add but he sure would enjoy this i bet hes green with envy if he knows that we fellows are up here now  he knows all right hal broke in wrote him when i first thought of this trip but he couldnt get away  i wanted to get that skin to him for christmas but didnt have a chance to pack it out explained alec guess ill send it out when you fellers go a little old barskin dont begin to pay what i owe that boy if it hadnt been for him id probably died up there in that hideout where he found me and if it hadnt been for the little doctor here id likely have died anyway anyhow id have lost my leg theres a barskin coming to you too some day  walter flushed it made him uncomfortable to be called the little doctor as alec persisted in calling him yet at the same time he was conscious of a warm glow of pride which he tried hard to stifle pooh alec that was no more than any of the other fellows would have done if i hadnt been here you know all scouts know what to do for first aid to the injured said he  just the same i dont believe there was one of us would have had the nerve to tackle that broken leg of alecs i wouldnt for one declared hal  to relieve walters embarrassment pat abruptly changed the subject what was that you hinted at when we first got here about signs of some one else in these diggings he asked turning to alec  the scotchmans face darkened he threw a couple of big logs on the fire and then as the others made themselves comfortable he told his story briefly for the last two weeks there had been little fur in the traps especially on the forty mile line to the north he had made the round of this line twice in this time with only one marten a fox and a few rats to show for it but he had found signs which led him to believe that some of the traps had been robbed he was morally certain that some one had been systematically making the rounds of the traps timing the visits so that there would be no danger of running into him and so cunningly following his trail that it was only by the closest study of the tracks that he had made sure that a stranger had been on the line at one unsprung marten trap he had found a couple of drops of blood which indicated that there had been something in the trap at another there had been the faint imprint of the body of an animal laid in the snow off at one side in one trap he had found the foot of a muskrat nothing unusual in itself but it had been cut off with a knife and not twisted or gnawed off  these things he had discovered on his trip two weeks ago and on his return trip he had thrust tiny twigs into the snow of the trail in such a way that they would not be noticed on his second round from which he had returned only the day before he had found some of these crushed into the snow sure evidence that they had been stepped on he had kept a sharp watch for a strange trail joining his own but had discovered none doubtless due to the fact that the thief or thieves had come across the bare ice of one of the lakes near the farther end of the line and then it had been an easy matter to step into his trail where it skirted the edge of the lake on this last trip he had found an empty rifle shell which apparently had been dropped unnoticed  pats face had hardened as he listened to the recital any signs of the bloody minded thaves in the holler or on the short lines he asked  alec shook his head theyve kept away from here the catch on the short lines has been fair and on the long line it ought to have been better  pat stood up and shook himself arrah now tis time i was back on me job he growled wance i lay the two hands av me on the thafe tis the last time he will be wantin to look wid the eyes av envy on fur thot dont belong to him a thafe who would shtale another mans fur would rob his own grandmother this storm will cover up all tracks but tis like there will be a chance for some real scouting after it is over tis thaves well be trappin and not fur for a while did big jim say anything about a silver fox when he was here  no replied alec his face lighting why  he told doctor merriam that he saw one on his way out and weve been wondering if it was over this way hal broke in eagerly  likely he saw it on his way out of the hollow replied alec theres one here ive seen him twice but didnt get a shot ive got traps set for him but hes been too smart for me so far hes a big feller and his skin will grade no 1 prime if we can get him the thieves are welcome to all the rest of our furs  no theyre not retorted pat theyre going to fork over every pelt theyve taken to the smallest rat or pat malone will know the reason why he shook a big fist by way of emphasis now lets turn in and forget our troubles he ended with a mildness that brought a general laugh     chapter ix  snowbound   all that night the storm raged and in the morning the snow was still falling pat and alec from force of habit were up early but seeing that there would be nothing doing outside they forbore to waken the three visitors and were not averse to returning to their blankets for a couple of hours of extra sleep how long the three boys would have slept is a question had not alec dropped a pan which clattered noisily upton poked a sleepy face out from his bunk  what you fellers doing he demanded  pat grinned getting dinner will you have some or will you wait for supper  walter felt for his watch and looked at it then he tumbled out in a hurry hey you fellows he yelled are you going to sleep all day its eleven oclock and alec is cooking dinner weve missed breakfast and      my tummy oh my tummy  murmured a sleepy voice from the opposite bunk what you giving us it isnt morning yet hal thrust out a tousled head and blinked stupidly  it isnt tomorrow morning but it will be this afternoon in about an hour laughed pat tis the way they do in noo yorrk turn day into night he explained to alec  no such thing protested hal indignantly it isnt moren daylight now  there was some foundation in fact for hals statement for the little cabin but dimly lighted at best was even at this late hour in a semi twilight due to the snow that partly covered the windows the effect was very much that of daybreak the odor of frying bacon however was a potent inducement to get up and by the time dinner was ready the boys were ready for it there was considerable goodnatured joshing over their ability to sleep and pat warned them that if they repeated the performance they would be taken out and dropped in a snowbank it had been a good thing for them however just what they needed after their strenuous experience of the previous day and beyond some stiffness they confessed that they never had felt better in their lives  what are we going to do this afternoonstart scouting for those thieves hal asked as he wiped the dishes  pat laughed not so that youd notice it me bye were going to stay right here the storms not over yet and if it keeps on im thinking well be buried completely however it looks to me as if it will break away shortly and then youll have a chance to show what good little diggers they raise in noo yorrk  and in the meantime  well enjoy all the comforts av home pat yawned and stretched  which means i suppose that well sit around and play simon says thumbs up or something like that all the afternoon laughed hal  perhaps yed like to sleep some more suggested alec slyly  and perhaps youve got another guess coming retorted hal whats that thing youre whittling on  a stretching board for marten replied alec  whats a stretching board and how do you use it hal was all interest  to stretch skins on dinna ye know that all skins have to be stretched alec tossed the board one side and reached for another  dont know a thing about trapping or furs except that dad has promised me a new fur coat when i get back retorted hal im painfully and sublimely ignorant but willing to learn and i have a hunch that there are others suppose you elucidate the facts by way of killing time  here here that will do for you hal cried upton your alleged poetry is bad enough without springing anything like that what have you been doing at that prep schoolconfabulating with the profs or flirting with the dictionary elucidate i move fellows that if he springs anything more like that we throw him in the snow i would suggest doing it anyway if his idea wasnt so good go to it alec and tell us about fur  i dinna ken where to begin protested alec as he carefully rounded the smaller of his board to a point so that it looked much like one of the shingle boats every boy knows  begin with that thing youre makingstretching board i believe you called it said hal  that would be holding the gun by the wrong end protested pat the story all happens before one of these things is needed pat was himself at work on a stretching board  begin with the kinds of fur and the ways in which it is trapped and the life of a trapper and all that sort of stuff suggested upton  just tell us what youse do every day and how youse live all alone and de scraps youse gets inter wid de bears n things and how youse has t foight for life an pass it out hotright off de fire  thats the stuff sparrer thats what we want cried hal as everybody laughed give us the story of trapping right off the griddle  ye dinna find anything very hot aboot a trappers life alec paused in his work to gaze reflectively into the fire its mostly cold and lonesomeness and hard work theres no fighting with the beasties worth mentioning its mostly fighting with storms and sometimes hunger and a struggle with nature ive sometimes wondered if some of the grand ladies and men too would be so proud and take so much pleasure in their fine furs if they knew what it has cost in suffering to man and beastie to get them and yet i am no complaining laddies ye ken that its a hard life and yet there is something aboot it that gets down into a man and calls him and he has to hit the trails and is no happy until he does  the fur that we get in this country is muskrat mink otter marten fox lynx and once in a while fisher sometimes we get a few skunks but not many so far in as this we used to get beaver but it is against the law to take the beasties at any time now  which is the most valuable hal interrupted  black or silver fox theyre worth so much they dont count ive trapped ever since i was knee high to a speckled fawn and havent taken one yet i dinna ken what theyre worth but ive heard that moren 2500 has been paid for an extra prime skin  what makes em worth so much is it because the fur is so extra fine asked upton  fine nothing pat broke in if there is any poorer wearing fur than fox i wish youd show me a large prime red fox will bring only four dollars to perhaps six or seven in a year when fur is scarce and high and the fur of a black fox isnt any different or better all that difference in price is because once in a blue moon nature gets tired of red and tries black for a change and people with more money than brains pay the price because it is rare and they can wear something that mighty few others can have its fox just the same and it will wear out just as quickly as if it were common everyday red its a fad but the saints defind us from any more brains till afther we have the hide av the black gintleman thot jim and alec have seen here in the hollow  money does talk doesnt it pat chuckled hal heres hoping you get both the fox and the long price by the way whats a cross fox  the prettiest baste in the woods returned pat promptly he has black legs and underparts black tail with white tip and gray head and body with a dark cross on the shoulders but hes just a sport of the red fox a variation in between the red and black a perfect specimen is worth a lot of money but nowhere near what a black will bring between the red and all black there are a lot of variations of the cross and the price varies accordingly but lets get back to regular fur instead of freaks have you looked over that price list i brought in alec  alec nodded i see otter and fisher are quoted just the same 15 for no 1 prime i think the two otter and the fisher weve got will grade that all right up here he continued turning to the boys marten pay us best because they bring us from 6 for no 2 to 12 for large no 1 prime and some years more than that lynx pay pretty nearly as well when we can get em the trouble is we dont get enough of em we get some foxes and some mink the latter are rather down now but some years they are high and pay right well last and least but like the pennies that make the dollars are the muskrats theyre bringing only thirty cents now but i have seen em as high as a dollar  in other parts of the country are other furs coon disna get up as far as this and arctic and blue fox dinna get as far south we get some weasel which when pure white is quite worth the trouble of skinning little as the critters are ye ken it is the ermine of royalty  how about bearskins i suppose they are worth considerable said walter glancing over at spuds prize  less than ye will be thinking replied alec yon skin is primeand will grade as large what now would ye be thinking it would be bringing me from a fur buyer this minute  fifty dollars ventured hal  alec and pat smiled what do you say little doctor alec turned to upton  walter did some quick thinking he had set in his own mind the same figure hal had given but he had caught that smile of the two trappers and he suspected that hal was rather wide of the mark it didnt seem possible to him that such a beautiful great skin could be worth less but at a venture he cut it in halves twentyfive said he  knock ten off of that and ye will be aboot right said alec  what only fifteen dollars for that big skin hal fairly shouted  pat laughed outright thats all this year and they never are worth a great deal you see for his size even a rat is worth considerable more and is therefore not to be despised and when you consider the labor of skinning a big brute like that and then packing out his hide the rats are more to my liking if there be enough of them  dont you trap for bears at all asked hal i had figured on seeing a bear trap and perhaps finding old bruin in one  pat smiled as he noted the look of disappointment on hals face we dont trap them this time of year son because there are none to trap theyre denned up for the winter he explained but you shall have a chance to see a deadfall before you go back alec built a couple but it was rather too late in the season theyll be ready for early spring when bears begin to move again then i suspect alec will build one or two more eh alec  a couple i guess ive marked some likely places was the reply  what about steel traps asked upton i had an idea that most trappers used those almost altogether these days  by way of reply alec dragged out from under one of the bunks a clanging mass of steel heft it said he briefly passing it to walter  my but thats heavy he exclaimed what does it weigh  nineteen pounds replied alec tell me how would ye like to pack three or four of those in addition to a lot of smaller traps for ten or fifteen miles  not for me declared upton i begin to see the why of the deadfalls its easier to build a few of those than to lug these heavy things around i didnt suppose they were as heavy as this are all of em like this  no there are some that weigh only a little over eleven pounds but those are for small bars i dont no ways favor em myself because ye ken i never yet have found a way of being certain what size bar would be stepping in one leastways not until he was caught a big feller will sometimes get out of the smaller trap but a little feller never gets out of the big trap so i sets only the big ones this is a no 5 and big enough for any bars around these parts theres a bigger one made for grizzly bar and lions and tigers and such like critters but that weighs fortytwo pounds weve got two of these no 5s to set in the spring if i was in good bar country where the critters are plenty id use more of these but as long as they aint plenty and im after other fur id rather use the deadfall in the first place it kills the critter and if hes caught you know right where to find him hes right there but if he gets caught in one of these things he may be a couple of hundred yards away and he may be in the next county which is mighty inconvenient specially if yeve got a lot of traps to tend to  hows that i thought you fastened the traps hal was plainly puzzled  sure we fasten em returned alec but do ye no see that if it was to anything solid like a tree the critter would be breaking the trap or the chain maybe or tearing himsel loose so we cut a log small enough at one end for the ring on the end of the chain to just barely slip over it and down to the middle where it is fastened with a spike the clog is six or seven feet long and of hard wood then when mr bar gets caught he has nothing solid to pull against to tear himself free he marches off with nineteen pounds of trap and the clog dragging from his foot the clog catches in the brush and between trees and usually he disna get very far because the heavy drag tires him besides that every time hes pulled up short it must hurt like the mischief and take the heart out of him sometimes we find where he has stopped to fight the clog once in a while a swivel breaks or something else gives way and he gets rid of the clog but still has the trap fast to his foot then hes likely to dig out for parts unknown ive known a trapper to camp two or three nights on the trail of a bar that had gone off with a trap before he could catch up with the critter mostly they will go a ways and then make a bed lie down a while get uneasy and move on to do the same thing all over again sometimes they wont lie in the bed after theyve made it but move on and try again  sparrers eyes were bulging do youse mean dey really make a bed same as us he asked  surest thing you know replied pat when a bear dens up for the winter he makes himself comfortable does it when hes traveling too dont know how he got wise to the danger of rheumatiz from sleeping on the bare ground but he seems to be on all right breaks a lot of brush and makes a regular bough bed sometimes he uses rotted wood when it is handy and brush isnt oh hes a wise proposition is mr bear if he once gets nipped in a trap and gets away it is a smart trapper who can get him in another  meanwhile hal had been examining the trap and trying to force down the springs im blessed if i see how you set one of the things said he at last  ill show ye only when its set ye want to keep away from it its more dangerous than a bar himsel  he brought forth two screw clamps and adjusted them to the double springs of the traps by turning thumbscrews the springs were compressed and held so that the jaws of the trap could be opened and the pan set to hold them the boys noticed that in doing this he worked from underneath sure sign of the careful and experienced trapper in the event of the clamps slipping there would be no chance of his hand or arm being caught in the jaws  how does the bear get caught asked sparrer to whom traps were an unknown quantity  by stepping on that pan explained pat ill show you  he removed the clamps and then with a long stick touched the pan instantly the jaws flew up and closed with a vicious snap biting into the soft wood so that pull as they would the boys were unable to get the stick out  huh exclaimed hal id hate to have that thing get me by the leg i should think it would break the bone  it very likely would unless your leg was pretty well protected a bears bones are not so brittle and do not break easily but once that thing has got a grip its there to stay said pat  i suppose you cover the trap up so that the bear wont see it ventured upton  right son that is just what we do replied pat we cover it with leaves or moss according to where the set is made  where does the bait go inquired hal do you put it right on the trap or hang it over it  neither laughed pat we build a bait pen of brush or old logs roofing it over and set the trap just at the entrance in such a way that mr bear must step in it in order to get into the pen or cubby where the bait is staked at the rear sometimes we lay a stick across the entrance close to the trap and six or eight inches from the ground so that the bear will try to step over it and in doing so he will be sure to put one foot in the trap an old bear who has lost a toe or two in a trap and so has learned his lesson will sometimes tear the bait pen down from the rear and so get the bait a deadfall is about the only way of catching one of that kind  i should think other animals would spring the trap ventured hal  they do sometimes especially your friend prickly porky the porcupine replied pat but when we are after bear we try to set the trap so that nothing less than a bear will spring it show em the trick alec  goodnaturedly alec once more set the trap then he took a small springy stick and fastened it upright in a crack in the floor then he bent it over until the other end was hooked under the pan of the trap the spring of it held the pan in place even when considerable weight was placed directly on the pan that would allow small animals to pass over it freely ye see he explained but the weight of a bar would spring it we do the same thing with other traps using smaller sticks according to what we are after  at this point pat went to investigate conditions outside hi you fellows he called storms over and its time to get busy and dig out its been raining but its clearing off cold and by morning therell be a crust thatll hold a horse walt you and hal know where the spring is so you fellows make a path down to it the rest of us will shovel out the woodpile and the storehouse  whats the storehouse there wasnt anything of that kind last fall hal was all eagerness  just a bit of a log shack we put up to keep the meat and supplies in youll see it when you get outside now everybody to worrrk pat flung the door open a wall of snow faced them  alec produced a homemade wooden shovel and an old iron one with these he and pat soon cleared a space in front of the cabin then the others armed with snowshoes and an old slab went to work with a will and soon smugglers hollow rang with the laughter and shouts of the merry crew it was not far to the spring and the task of digging out and trampling down a path was not difficult when they finished walter and hal turned for their first good look at the surroundings it was a wilderness of white broken only by the thin column of smoke from the cabin chimney and the figures of their comrades busy at the woodpile and storehouse the cabin itself was nearly buried in snow which was more than halfway to the low eaves it had drifted quite over the little shack where pat and alec were at work all tracks had been obliterated and for a few minutes it was difficult for them to get their bearings so changed was the landscape then one by one they picked out the landmarks they had learned to know so well in the fall but which now were so changed as to be hardly recognized  they stood in silence something very like awe stealing over them as the grim beauty combined with pitiless strength of the majestic scene impressed itself upon them  just think of a man living here all alone for weeks at a time thats what i call nerve i believe id go dippy in a week murmured hal hardly above a whisper as if he were afraid to trust his voice in the great solitude  and yet there is something fascinating about it i can feel the call of it myself replied upton i suppose when one gets used to it it isnt so bad itsitswell i suppose its what you would call elemental and there is something heroic about this battling with the very hills and elements to wrest a living from them hello pats calling us  they hurried back to the cabin where pat promptly shoved a pail into the hands of each and ordered them back to the spring for water when they returned alec had begun preparations for supper  this evening announced pat alec will finish his yarn about trapping and then well plan for tomorrow will you fellows have bakingpowder biscuit or corn bread for supper  corn bread was the unanimous shout  corn bread it is then declared pat and how will yez have the murphies  french fried cried hal  yez be hearing the orders av the gintlemincorn bread and french fried praties misther cook said pat turning to alec ill be mixing the corn bread whoile ye cut the spuds the rest av yez can bring in wood and set the table an the wan who loafs most gets the least to eat  at once there was a grand scramble to see who could do the most in view of such a dire threat     chapter x  life on the fur trails   supper out of the way the boys made themselves comfortable and gave alec the word to take up his yarn  to begin with said alec throwing a log on the fire when a trapper is thinking of going into new country he generally prospects it first same as a prospector for gold only he looks it over for signs of fur instead of for minerals sometimes he does this in summer or early fall and sometimes he does it in winter planning for the next winter friend o mine went up into brunswick last winter and looked over some country which never has been trapped to amount to anything and this year hes up there with a line over one hundred miles long  jerusalem where did he stay nights when he was looking it over asked hal  wherever he happened to be replied alec  didnt he have no tent nor nothin sparrer was round eyed with wonder  alec shook his head nothin but a weeks supply of grub his axe rifle and blanket thats all any good woodsman needs  but was it as cold as it is now asked hal  colder because that part of brunswick is considrable farther north when night came he would just dig away the snow build a fire and when the ground was het up move his fire back lay some boughs down where the fire had been make a little bough shelter over it build a good big fire to reflect the heat and turn in sometimes when theres a big rock handy or an upturned tree we warm up a place a little way in front of that and then move the fire over against it and turn in without any shelter at all moren once ive slept in just a hole in the snow tisnt so bad when youre used to it have to get up a few times in the night to put wood on the fire but that aint nothin is it pat  tis no more than a reminder av how good it is to shlape returned pat  when a mans prospectin for fur he not only looks for signs of the beasties but he looks the lay of the land over and gets the landmarks fixed in his mind continued alec he picks out a place for his main camp locating it where he can get his supplies and stuff in and his furs out at the end o the season without too much difficulty if it is in lumbered country he picks out a place that can be reached by some old trail with a little clearing out so that a team can get in more often though he locates on a river where he can get his stuff in by canoe and can get out again the same way in the spring  at the same time he tries to choose a location that will be to his best advantage in working his trap lines if hes got a long line laid out he also picks out likely places for temporary camps places handy to springs and firewood early in the fall he gets his stuff together and goes in to build his camps trappers mostly work in pairs but sometimes one goes it alone like my friend up in brunswick he took his traps an stuff in in september sos to get his camps built and be ready for busness as soon as fur got prime  can one man build a log cabin without any help asked walter  sure replied pat if hes reasonably husky and most woodsmen are a smart axeman can roll one up in four days but of course its easier and quicker if there are two  the main camp is made stout and comfortable as possible same as tis here only usually tis no so big alec resumed the thread of his story the other camps are just big enough for a bunk an to cache some supplies and are one to two days journey apart accordin to the country in good weather a feller disna mind sleeping oot one night between camps if he must though he disna aim to if he can help it a few supplies are left in each camp and firewood cut and left handy when this work is done its usually bout time to be gettin after the critters  a long line is usually planned on a sort of loop when the country will permit so that the trapper may go out one way and return another when two are trapping together pardners like pat and me one works the line one way and one the other of course two can work a longer line than one can and cover it the way it ought to be covered ive put in moren one winter alone but ye ken its michty satisfying to hae speech wi some one once in a while when im alone it gets so that i talk to the varmints just to hear a human voice even though it be my own  i shouldnt think it would be safe for a man to be all alone for so long upton interrupted  tisnt altogether safe replied alec there was old bill bently never was a better woodsman than old bill he used to trap way up north of here used to go it alone mostly but one winter he took a pardner lucky thing for bill he did they had a long line that year and bill covered it one way and his pardner big frank covered it the other they would meet at the upper end and then again at the main camp well one time big frank was a day late getting to the upper camp a big bar had busted a swivel on a trap and gone off with the trap took frank a whole day to catch up with him when he got to the camp he expected to find bill waiting for him but nary a sign of bill could he find  this wasnt suprisin considerin his own luck but somehow it made big frank uneasy he hit the trail fore daylight the next morning and didna stop to look at traps but just made tracks watching out for some sign of bill long about noon he found him by a deadfall alongside of a bar of course the critter was dead and bill would have been if he had to lay there much longer seems in resetting the deadfall the lever with which he was raising the fall log broke and somehow bill got one leg under it and there he was caught in his own trap and with a broken leg to boot lucky for bill it was early in the season or he would have frozen to death long fore frank got there as it was he was in pretty bad shape if hed been trapping alone it would have been the end of him  but im getting off my story of how we catch fur of course we have to have a number of sizes of traps for muskrats we use no 1 for mink no 1 or no 112 this is also big enough to hold fox coon and fisher but no 2 is better for marten we use mostly no 1 but if there are signs of fisher or lynx we use no 112 so if one happens to get into a trap it will hold him these critters are so strong that they would pull out of the smaller trap  its marten that you are after mostly isnt it i understood you to say that upton interposed  were after anything we can get but most of our sets are for marten returned alec in the fall we took a good many rats and will again in the spring but at this time o the year when everything is frozen tis only around spring holes that we can get a rat now and then since the law will no let us trap them at their houses i dinna ken what these lawmakers want to meddle with a poor mans business for so long as the rat is killed i dinna see what difference it makes where hes killed or how we used to get good fur when it was no against the law to trap at the houses  walt heres a subject for a little missionary work alec is still an uncivilized savage in some things especially when what he calls his rights to hunt and trap are concerned pat broke in  upton looked a bit puzzled i dont quite get the point about the house trapping said he  youve seen muskrat houses aplenty havent you asked pat  walter nodded well continued pat before this law was made trappers used to chop a hole in the side of a house and set a trap on the bed inside of course this drove the rats out but they would soon be back because there was nowhere else to go by visiting the traps night and morning it was no trick at all to get all the rats now the law forbids this kind of trapping alec here doesnt approve of the law he thinks that there are rats enough and to spare and he cant see that that kind of work is cutting his own nose off and killing the goose that lays the golden egg says you can clean all the rats out of a place and in time more will come to take their places and i cant make him see it any different  how about beaver asked walter turning to the scotchman nowhere near as plentiful as they used to be are they  the trapper shook his head been trapped pretty near out of this country im for protecting the beaver all right but rats is different ye couldnt trap out all the rats in a million years theres rats enough and there always will be  ever hear of the passenger pigeon asked upton  alec signified that he never had guess they dinna live in this country he added  i guess they dont replied upton drily fact is they dont live in any country any more what is supposed to be the very last specimen died in captivity in cincinnati last year a reward of several thousand dollars for proof of a single pair nesting anywhere in america has stood for several years but the bird is believed to be absolutely extinct and yet seventyfive years ago they were numbered by millions and extended over america from the atlantic to the rocky mountains probably billions would be nearer the truth the ornithologist wilson once watched a flock which he estimated to be a mile wide moving at the rate of a mile a minute and it took four hours to pass allowing three birds to each square yard there must have been more than two billion birds in that one flock in 1869 one town in michigan shipped to market in forty days almost twelve million birds they were so plentiful that they sold as low as twelve cents a dozen and netters made money at that when the first efforts to protect them were made they were fruitless because people said that the numbers were so great that it would be impossible ever to reduce them to a serious extent and today there is not one living it doesnt seem possible but it is a cold hard fact and man alone is to blame  the same thing is happening right now with a lot of animals and birds just as sure as that fire is burning fifty years will see a lot off them extinct unless they are better protected the hunters of the pigeon didnt believe it any more than you believe it about the rats on the level alec do you think it a square deal to take a rat in the only place hes got to stay in the winter  oh im not taking them that way alec protested with some haste i believe in respecting the law even if it is a fool law  but is it a fool law i dont think so said walter quietly in a boxing match it is a foul to hit a man when hes down  tisnt in a lumbermans fight alec broke in if a mans down so much the better then youve got him thats the thing to doget him down and then do him good  aw say youse dont mean that sparrers eyes were round with indignation for even a street gamin has better ethics than this  its the way they fight up here sparrer im sorry to say said pat in a rough and tumble fight here they kick bite and gouge and you may well pity the under man but theyre learning better  would you hit a man who was bound and helpless asked walter quickly  certainly not cried alec indignantly thats different  not so very different from your rats in their houses protested upton they come pretty near to being helpless besides they have no reason to suspect harm there and they dont put it up to any scout and hed say right off the reel that it is unfair and that is something that no scout will stand for but this is nothing to do with marten you were saying alec that you trap for marten mostly  aye replied alec rather glad to have the subject changed if the truth were known and its the prettiest and most comfortable kind of trapping in the winter ye see the beasties are found in heavy timber and broken country and that gives the trapper more protection from cold and storms then the beasties are no so hard to trap as some others when ye find marten sign ye may be pretty sure that the critter will be along there again they live on mice rabbits birds and squirrels fish makes good bait when the snows are not too heavy i build a little cubby a pen ye ken of sticks at the foot of a big tree the tree forming the back and roof it over with evergreen branches to keep out the snow on a little bed of boughs i set the trap just inside the opening of the cubby and cover it lightly with tips of evergreen the bait is placed on a stick at the back of the cubby i hang a couple of boughs partly over the opening so that if whiskey jack happens along he wont see the bait and steal it  here pat interrupted to explain for sparrers benefit that a whiskey jack is the common name in the north for the canada jay  i shouldnt think the marten could get his peepers on the bait then said sparrer  he disna need to laddie replied alec his nose finds it for him another set which i like and use a good deal is this i cut a small spruce of about four inches through so as to leave a stump about two feet above the snow in the top of this i cut a v or crotch and after trimming off the lower limbs of the tree i rest it in this crotch so that the butt end projects some distance and is three or four feet above the snow about a foot from the butt end i flatten off a place for the trap and tie it in place with a bit of string and loop the chain around the trunk of the tree then i make a split in the end of the butt and in this fasten the bait mr marten runs up the tree to get the bait steps in the trap and falls off and hangs there he cant twist a foot off or pull free in any way once he steps in the trap hes a goner  deadfalls work pretty well with marten yell have a chance to see some as ive got some right handy here in some draws off the hollow yell understand them better by seeing than by me trying to tell you about them  how about otter asked hal  steel traps for them and we have to be some perticlar how we set em theres nary a critter that i know of more suspicious of man replied alec in the fall and spring we get em with water sets i got one this fall up at one of the beaver dams i cut a hole in the middle of the dam so that the runoff from the pond was all through this but not enough to lower the pond and bring the beavers to stop up the hole i made the passage only eight or nine inches wide and set the trap in the water at the upper end the first otter to come along tried to go through that opening and i had him sometimes when we find a point of land running out into a lake or big stream well find an otter trail across it where the critter has taken a short cut then we set a trap in the water at one end water sets are best because there is no human scent in the winter we set under the ice and ill show you a couple of sets of that kind before you go back  and foxes prompted upton  alec grinned theyre worse than otter he confessed ye think ye ken all about the critters and then ye meet up with one that just gives ye the laugh like the silver thats hanging around here ive tried every set i know of for that feller but hes still grinning at me and this crust aint going to help matters any its bad enough in dry snow but with a crust there wont be anything doing in the fall i use water sets where i can one of the best is at a shallow spring four or five feet across about a foot and a half from the shore put a mosscovered stone or a sod so that it will come just above the level of the water halfway between this and the shore set the trap covering the jaws springs and chain with mud or wet leaves from the bottom the pan should be just under water and on this place a little piece of moss or sod so that it will come an inch above the water on the outer stone or sod put a small piece of bait and a little scent mr fox comes along smells the bait and promptly investigates he disna like to wet his feet and the bit of covering on the pan of the trap looks like a good steppingplace then you have him  ye must take care to leave everything in a perfectly natural state i wade up the outlet and take care not to touch the banks some trappers boil the traps in hemlock boughs to kill the scent others just leave them over night in running water i wear clean gloves to handle the traps there are a lot of dry sets some with bait and some without the latter being used in frequented runways a very good set is to find an old mosscovered log or stump and set the trap on the highest point covering it so that the whole thing looks just as it did before then toss a big bait like a muskrat or rabbit eight or ten feet from it mr fox is always suspicious and before he goes too near anything like that he will go to the highest point to look the ground over thats when ye get him of course there mustnt be any other high point for him to get on  you spoke of scents alec ive read about them what are they anyhow asked upton  for answer alec got up and went to a corner of the cabin and brought forth an old fruit jar pat grinned heres some said alec simply as he unscrewed the cover while the boys crowded around they took one whiff and then fairly tumbled over each other to get away  cover it up take it away howled hal holding his nose i wont be able to eat a square meal for a week  me too yelped sparrer dey has some awful smells in new york but dis is de limit  jumping crickets i should think that stuff would drive things away and not attract em exclaimed upton what is it anyhow  skunk fat and mice cut up and put in the jar and hung in the sun until thoroughly rotted and then some skunk and muskrat scent added sorry you dont like it replied pat a drop or two judiciously used seems to be a great attraction for foxes and some other critters alec has got another brand if you would like to sample itfish oil made by cutting up fish and letting them rot in the same way its a mighty good scent  no thanks cried hal hastily well take your word for it what about those stretching boards  im coming to that replied alec raw furs are handled in two ways cased and open mink marten fox fisher weasel muskrat skunk and bob cat are cased that is what these boards are for we skin em by cutting loose around the feet and then cutting down the back of the hindlegs to and around the vent and then skin the hindlegs carefully and also the tail then the skin is turned back and stripped off the body wrong side out to the ears taking as little fat as possible the ears are cut off close to the head and the skin is cut loose around the eyes and nose the easiest way is to hang the critter up by the hindlegs after skinning out these and the tail  these small boards pat and i are making are for muskrats in the spring for marten mink otter fisher and such like we use longer narrower boards that is they are narrower in proportion to their length ill show you some presently the best boards are those with a narrow strip ripped out of the middle for the whole length this makes a wedge or tongue of course it should be tapered this makes it possible to use the board for various size animals and to stretch the skin to its fullest extent it also makes it easy to remove a skin from the board as taking out the wedge at once loosens the whole board  the skins are put on the stretchers fur side in then with a blunt knife they are fleshed that is they are scraped clean of every particle of fat and flesh then they are stretched to their fullest extent and put to dry or cure in a cool airy place as soon as dry enough to prevent shrinking or wrinkling they are taken from the boards lynx and fox are then turned fur side out but the others are left as they are  beaver coon bear wolf and badger are skinned open that means that a cut is made from the point of the jaw straight down the belly to the vent a cut is made down the inside of the forelegs across the breast to the point of the brisket and another down the back of the hindlegs big animals like bars wolves and wolverines should be skinned out to the ends of their toes and have the feet left on these skins are stretched flat a coon nearly square a beaver round and others to their natural shape the best way is by lacing them with twine in a frame many trappers lose money by careless handling of the furs all dirt blood and lumps should be carefully removed lots of skins prime when caught grade way down because of careless handling now i guess you chaps have got your fill of furs what about tomorrow its christmas ye ken  thats so and it will be the queerest christmas i ever have spent said hal thoughtfully we ought to celebrate somehow whats the program pat  how about a rabbit hunt in the morning a big dinner and a shootingmatch in the afternoon replied pat  bully cried all three together  whats the matter with a christmas tree in the evening added upton we ought to do something christmasy  i was going to suggest that very thing retorted hal well make it the greatest christmas this old hollow ever saw now lets turn in i want to be out for those rabbits right early by the way alec i hope theres some of that venison left for the big feast  dinna ye worry laddie i hae saved a roast special replied alec as he prepared things for the night     chapter xi  christmas in smugglers hollow   merry christmas  at the sound of pats roar the three guests hastily tumbled out of their bunks with answering greetings a cheerful fire blazed up the chimney and added its flickering light to that of a couple of candles for the sun was not yet up alec was cutting bacon and pat was mixing flapjack batter  breakfast will be ready in fifteen minutes and the one who isnt ready goes hungry he announced  it wont be yours truly declared hal reaching for his clothes      my tummy oh my tummy       it gives me such a pain     i wonder will it ever  say who swiped one of my socks i cant find but one and i left em together he began to toss things left and right in search of the missing article  meanwhile upton was down on his knees fumbling under his bunk at hals complaint he looked up suspiciously i cant find one of mine he sputtered somebodys been putting up a job on us hi what the he finished by pointing toward the fireplace  hal looked there hung his missing sock also one of uptons and one of sparrers all three misshapen and bulging  ut would not be christmas an we did not hang the childers stockings announced pat gravely  with a whoop the three boys fell on the stockings entering into the spirit of the occasion they seated themselves on the floor in front of the fire and pulled out the contents as gleefully as ever they had emptied christmas stockings at home in their younger days the gifts were trifling in themselves but the better for that very fact there were little packages of sprucegum a carved paperknife a tiny birchbark canoe whistles made from bucks horn a rabbits foot charm and other knickknacks of the woods pats voice broke into the midst of the babel produced by the discovery of the socks and their contents five minutes for those who want breakfast he announced  instantly there was a mad scramble to finish dressing and when time was up it was evident that no one proposed to go hungry that christmas morning during the meal it was decided that alec should remain at camp to prepare for the grand feast while the others went in search of rabbits walter and hal knowing the surrounding country were to go each on his own hook while pat would take sparrer with him just before starting the two former held a whispered conference they had brought in with them a few gifts for pat and his partner and also some small packages which the home folks had pledged them not to open until christmas day at hals suggestion it was decided to say nothing about these until night and spring them as a surprise at the christmas tree on which hal had set his heart  as pat had foreseen there was a crust on which the shoes made no impression hal elected to go down the north side of the brook while upton took the opposite side pat and sparrer were to visit a certain swamp not far distant all were to be back at the cabin by eleven oclock  to upton the tramp in that wonderful wilderness of glistening white meant far more than the hunt as a matter of fact the very thought of killing anything amid such pure surroundings was repugnant to him to this feeling a big white hare which foolishly sat up to stare at him within fifteen minutes after he had left the cabin undoubtedly owed its life slowly the rifle had been raised until the sights rested squarely between the two innocent staring eyes then it had been as slowly lowered i cant do it puss the others will get all we need to eat i guess so suppose you remove your pretty self from the range of temptation said he taking a sudden forward step thereupon puss promptly acted upon his advice and so precipitately that upton laughed aloud merry christmas he shouted as the bounding white form disappeared  that decided him his heart was not in hunting that morning what he did want to do was just to tramp and drink in the beauty of the wonderful scene his rifle was a nuisance he wished that he had not brought it at all why not cache it and pick it up on his way back a hasty survey of his surroundings discovered a fire blackened hollow stub split its full length on one side it was the very thing he was looking for it was a landmark he could not very well miss on his return he put his rifle in it tightened his belt and then deliberately turned his back on the valley and headed for the top of the ridge he was in quest of views and not of game  climbing a ridge on a snow crust is no childs play as walter soon found out it sometimes seemed as if he slipped back two feet for every one he gained he tried taking off the shoes only to find that in sheltered places he broke through and was worse off than on the slipping shoes but he was grimly resolved that he would get to the top of the ridge cost him what it might it was characteristic of the boy that what he set out to do he did so he ground his teeth and kept at it slipping scrambling pulling himself up by brush and trees after a little he discovered that by zigzagging back and forth along the face of the slope and taking advantage of every little inequality he could make fairly good progress  still it took an hour and a half of strenuous work to gain the coveted top of the ridge and he was thoroughly winded and weary to say nothing of sundry bruises and scratches from frequent falls panting and perspiring he turned to look back below him lay smugglers hollow but how different from the hollow into which he had gazed for the first time in september it was not less lonely or less wild in fact if anything these features were accentuated the mountains which seemed to enclose it on all sides were no less heroically grand and rugged but they had been robbed in a measure of their forbidding somber gloom by the transforming mantle of snow the heavy stand of spruce on the opposite mountain no longer cloaked it with the shadows of night like a perpetual threat of evil each tree was a pyramid of myriad gems flashing in the sun  he could trace the course of the frozen brook through the heart of the hollow a ribbon of white smooth and unbroken between the fringe of alders on either side he could see the cabin or rather the roof and eaves for the cabin itself was nearly buried in a drift from the chimney a thin pencil of blue smoke rose straight up in the still air it was the one thing needed it in no way marred the grandeur of the scene but it saved it from utter desolation something of this sort flitted vaguely through uptons mind then he heard the faint crack of a rifle on the opposite side of the hollow followed by two more cracks the smoke and the sound of the rifle removed the last vestige of temporary depression which the grandeur of the scene and the utter silence of the vast solitude had tended to produce  hals got into a bunch of em or else his shooting eye is off he chuckled and turned to scan the ridge he was on to the west it presented a broken line of low peaks one slightly higher than the rest marked the place where the pass to the hollow entered it was the hill from which the lost trail party had first looked into smugglers hollow and the view from the summit was more complete than from the point walter now occupied  id like to get up there he thought but its a little too much of an undertaking on this crust besides it would make me late for dinner hello wonder what that is  he had caught a sudden flash on the highest point of the peak as he watched he saw it again his first thought had been that it was the sun reflected from a bit of ice but an instants thought convinced him that this couldnt be it would of necessity be fixed and steady the flashes he had seen were made by something moving with this knowledge came the sudden conviction that the flashes were caused by the sun striking on polished metal hastily feeling in his rucksack he drew out a pair of operaglasses which he always carried with him for use in studying birds and animals they were not very strong but sufficiently so to bring the peak perceptibly nearer at first he could make out nothing unusual then through the glasses he caught that flash again and focussed them as nearly as possible on the spot from which it had come for some minutes he saw nothing suspicious he was almost ready to give up and conclude that it was in his imagination when he was positive that he saw something move back of a stunted little spruce growing from a cleft in the rocks at the point where he had located the flashes  instantly every instinct of the true scout was aroused there was something alive back of that little spruce it might be an animal and then again it might be a man at once there flashed into his mind alecs account of the robbed traps could it be that one of the thieves was reconnoitering the hollow his heart gave a queer jump at the thought anyway it was clearly up to him to find out what he could  rapidly he reviewed the situation it was clear that from his present location he would gain no further information if his suspicions were true if an enemy was watching from behind that spruce he was undoubtedly aware of walters presence for he was standing in the open beyond question he had been watched from the time he left the cabin to make a false move now would be to give warning he regretted that he had gazed so long at the suspected point that in itself would be sufficient to arouse suspicion in the mind of any one hiding there the first thing then was to allay any such suspicion  deliberately he turned his glasses across the hollow and studied the opposite mountain for a greater length of time than he had watched the point where he had seen the flash then he squatted down and leisurely turned his glasses from point to point in the hollow in the manner of one having no interest in anything but the view not once did he glance back along the ridge although he was burning with curiosity and desire to do so he ignored it as if it held no further interest for him whatever for perhaps ten minutes he continued to act the part of a mere sightseer then putting his glasses back in his rucksack he stretched lazily and in a leisurely manner began to pick his way down into a little draw which cut back into the ridge in the opposite direction from the pass once down in this he would be out of sight of a possible watcher at the spruce lookout  as soon as he was sure that he was beyond observation upton hurried the draw led back into a thick stand of young growth and he hoped by working up through this to be able to cross the ridge unobserved and work back to a point which he had carefully noted and from which owing to the change of angle he felt sure he would be able to see back of the little spruce tree which had previously cut off his view getting up to the top of the ridge was stiff work for an inexperienced snowshoer in a hurry and was productive of many tumbles but it was accomplished at last after this it was comparatively easy to work along just below the top on the back side to the point he had selected  there he cautiously crept into a thicket of young spruce and his heart beating like a triphammer with excitement carefully parted the branches until he could get a clear view his hands trembled as he drew out the glasses would he discover anything or had he been wrought up to such a pitch over nothing the little spruce leaped out clear and distinct as he got the focus ha the exclamation was wholly involuntary and he experienced an absurd impulse to look around to make sure that he had not been overheard although he knew that he was absolutely alone  the cause was the figure of a man squatting behind the spruce and peering intently into the valley he wore a fur cup pulled low to shade his eyes and this together with the distance made it impossible for upton to see his features clearly but somehow he received an unshakable conviction that it was an indian or a halfbreed a rifle leaned against the tree and doubtless it was the glint of the sun on its polished surface that had produced the mysterious flashes that had first caught his attention  hes watching to see if i go back to the cabin thought walter if he doesnt see me by the time the others return hell smell a rat theres nothing more to be gained by staying here ive proved that we are being watched and thats all i can do its up to me to get back and tell the others  cautiously the boy retreated through the thicket until he was below the cap of the ridge then he hurried running when he could and finding it less difficult than he had imagined he crossed above the head of the draw and went on until he had reached a point which he judged must be about opposite to where he had left his rifle in the hollow tree his first impulse had been to keep on until he could come out directly in the rear of the cabin but on second thought he had decided that it would be wiser to return by the same way that he had left and get his rifle if he had been seen leaving the cabin with his rifle it would look odd to say the least if he should be seen returning without it  in climbing the ridge he had zigzagged back and forth picking the easiest grade but now he was too impatient for so slow a method of descent and plunged straight down slipping sliding checking himself by catching at trees and brush getting a fall now and then as the web of his shoes caught in a stick but on the whole doing very well one thing he had not considered as he should havethe possibility of slipping over an unseen ledge it was brought home to him when he brought a rather long slide to an abrupt end by catching a tree on the very edge of a sheer drop of perhaps eight feet  phew he gasped a little more and id have gone over that and had a nasty tumble been the same way if it had been a fifty foot ledge i see where little walter will be turning up missing one of these days if he doesnt look out its a poor scout who takes needless chances in territory he isnt familiar with ill be more careful hereafter  he peered over the edge of the ledge below the snow had drifted deep and it was clear the ledge ran east and west for some distance and to make a detour would take time his first thought was to kick off his shoes toss them down and then jump but if he did this he would be sure to break through the crust and he had no means of knowing the depth of that drift or what might be underneath it he had no desire to find out he must either jump on his shoes or go around and the temptation was to jump  may as well learn to jump now as another time he muttered for the time being forgetting that in the event of a mishap such as a twisted ankle he would be helpless in a temperature far below zero  he walked back a bit took three or four long quick strides and leaped as he left the edge of the little bluff he felt the tails of his shoes drop until the big webs hung from his feet at an angle but slightly off the perpendicular a momentary doubt of a successful landing flashed through his mind he had a vision of an ignominious plunge through the crust and perhaps broken shoes then automatically he set himself for the landing arms spread body thrust forward and knees bent it seemed as if those hanging shoes certainly must trip him a second later he struck the crust in a half crouch the crust cracked and gave a little just enough to prevent the shoes from sliding with a quick step he regained his balance and with a sense of exhilaration realized that he had made successfully his first jump on snowshoes  from this point he had little difficulty in reaching the hollow stub where he secured his rifle and then turned toward the cabin hal was just coming in from one hand dangled a snowshoe rabbit  is that all youve got for all that shooting ive heard chaffed walter  hal grinned couldnt hit a balloon if it was big as a mountain and tied down in front of me he confessed dont know what the trouble was but i just couldnt shoot wouldnt have got this fellow if he hadnt sat up and begged to be shot missed him a mile the first time at ten yards bullet didnt go near enough to scare him second shot was no better got him on the third shot but i believe at that he jumped in front of the bullet you dont seem to have had even that much luck what was the trouble havent heard your rifle this morning  didnt feel like hunting went up on the ridge to get the view instead returned walter carelessly wonder how sparrer made out  they entered the cabin to find pat and sparrer already there the latter so excited that he gave vent to a joyful whoop when he caught sight of them and rushed precipitately to the back of the room to drag forth two pairs of rabbits  plugged em all meself he declared proudly  the rabbits were duly examined and sparrer was praised for his marksmanship until his cheeks burned pat leading in piling it on thick two of the rabbits had been neatly drilled through the heads a third had got it in the neck as pat put it and the fourth had been shot through the body pat forestalled any criticism by explaining that this was the first rabbit they had found and he had told sparrer to shoot at thot little lump av snow just by way av gettin yer hand in quite innocently sparrer had done so and had nearly dropped the rifle in surprise when the lump of snow had resolved itself into a rabbit which gave a few spasmodic kicks and then lay still  of course hal was chaffed unmercifully over his one lone contribution to the larder especially when he admitted that he had shot at no less than five but he took it goodnaturedly confessing that he was utterly at loss to account for his bad form  meanwhile upton had said nothing about his discovery on the ridge his first impulse had been to blurt out the news but on second thought he had decided not to at the first opportunity he drew pat aside and told him the big fellows face darkened say nothing about it he counseled theres no use in spoiling a merry day and the knowledge that we are being watched will do them no good theres nothing we can do about it today tis not likely they mean us any harm its the fur they are after and theyve just taken advantage of the crust which leaves no trail to look us over and find out how many are in our party  so walter held his peace and threw himself into the preparations for dinner as if he had nothing of more importance on his mind that christmas feast will never be forgotten by the three city lads there was the promised roast of venison a rabbit stew potatoes baked in the ashes canned peas biscuit a jar of jam and to top off with a hot apple pie made from evaporated apples but the real surprise was a steak done to a turn over the hot coals  bear shouted hal as he set his teeth in the first mouthful  alec smiled i see ye have tasted it before said he  once replied hal louis woodhull got one on that swift river trip a year ago last fall but when did you get this fellow and why have you kept so mum about it  alec nodded toward the skin which was to be spud elys its the same one said he ive kept part of him ripening out in the storehouse against this day he explained  when they could eat no more there was a general loosening of belts and sighs of complete satisfaction into which pat rudely broke with a demand for dishwashers and wipers  oh can it grunted hal when a fellows in the seventh heaven what do you try to bring him down to earth again for  but pat was obdurate and with many an exaggerated grunt and groan the remains of the feast were cleared away the dishes washed and the cabin set to rights then followed a lazy hour before the rifle match it was agreed that pat and alec both of whom were expert shots should count as a clean miss any shot not striking in the black while the others should be credited with whatever their actual scores were each was to be allowed ten shots the bullseye counted ten the first ring outside counted nine the next ring eight and so on each was allowed three trial shots to get the range  hal was the first to take his trial shots at the crack of the rifle upton ran forward to examine the target never touched it didnt even hit the board some shooter you are hal he yelled  hal flushed but said nothing for his second shot he took plenty of time and was as careful as he knew how to be the result was the same for his third shot he used a rest which was contrary to the rules but was allowed as this was only a trial shot this time he nicked a splinter from one edge of the board on which the target was fastened  here let me see that rifle cried pat striding forward and snatching the gun out of hals hands he sighted it then handed it back with a grin will ye tell me how iver ye got thot wan rabbit wid a gun the loikes av thot he demanded  why whats the matter with the gun demanded hal reaching for it a puzzled scowl furrowing his brows  alec forestalled him and took the rifle from pats hands he in turn sighted along the barrel laddie said he the soberness of his face belied by the twinkle in his eyes do ye no ken that a gun is like a fine lady it must be treated wi respect  hal took the gun with a puzzled look i dont quite get you fellows yet said he  pat laughed outright look at your forward sight man youve hit the end of your barrel against something and knocked that sight a wee bit out of alignment it must have been pure luck that you got that rabbit this morning  use my rifle interrupted walter  thanks replied hal i believe i will even if i got the sights adjusted on my gun i shouldnt be able to shoot every time i made a poor shot id have the feeling that it was the guns fault my but it is a relief to know that i havent gone back in my shooting quite so badly as all that  all having made their trial shots the match was on walter shot first getting five tens four nines and an eight a total of ninetyfour alec was next and his first shot was a nine followed by nine bullseyes a total of ninety under his handicap hal started off with a seven went into the black six times in succession then got two eights and wound up with a nine total ninetytwo sparrer gave them a surprise with eightyseven and pat slapped him on the back the coaching he had received that morning during the rabbit hunt had not been in vain pat was the last man up and shot rapidly and with seeming carelessness but the succession of bullseyes was proof that this was more apparent than real his last shot however barely touched the edge of the black and he insisted that it be counted a miss tying him with alec and giving walter the match  after this pat and alec shot a friendly match while this was going on hal slipped back to the cabin he had marked a small spruce of perfect shape not far from the rear of the cabin and this he now cut and dragged in by the time the shooting was over he had it set up at the rear of the room and had stretched a blanket across so as to screen it when his comrades came trooping in they were warned not to peep behind it under threat of dire penalties he made one exception he needed uptons help and also the gifts that walter had brought from home  by the time they had finished it was quite dark in the cabin they piled logs on the fire and when the blaze was leaping merrily up the chimney and casting a warm ruddy light over the room hal suggested that they draw up to the fire for a christmas story he chose the german legend of the origin of the christmas tree he possessed no mean skill as a storyteller and he threw himself into the telling of this so that his listeners sat in rapt attention  just before the conclusion he gave walter a signal and the latter arose and slipped back of the blanket as the story ended the blanket was pulled down and there was the little tree glittering with lights and tinsel and hung with the gifts which the boys had brought there was a delighted gasp from pat alec and sparrer and then a silence that was a tribute in itself as they watched the colored candles gradually shorten the truth is it was the first christmas tree within the experience of any one of the three and they were as delighted as any children could have been  when the candles had burned down to the danger point hal blew them out and then distributed the gifts which were opened amid much hilarity and fun making  this makes up for the stockings this morning he laughed as the others showered him with fulsome praise  it more than makes up declared pat tis a christmas ill never forget then as he lovingly fingered a long desired book sent in by doctor merriam he added but when did you think of the tree idea was it in new york  hal nodded the idea came to me the very day we left saw a window full of tree fixings and on the impulse ran in and got the candles and tinsel glad you like it  an hour of storytelling followed ere they turned in and silence like a christmas benediction settled over the cabin     chapter xii  a deer yard   would you fellows like to visit a deer yard pat asked at breakfast the next morning when the subject of the days program had been brought up  would we upton fairly shouted it say pat do you mean that there is a really truly sure enough deer yard anywhere near here ive read about em and id give all my old shoes to see one  right o my fine bucko you shall see one and it wont cost you so much as a shoestring replied pat its not over a mile from camp and on the ridge just above it is one of those deadfalls for bear that alec built last fall well take that in and kill two birds with one stone if you say so there are some marten traps on that same ridge that i want to have a look at what do you say alec  verra good replied alec you show the laddies the yard and look over that line and ill take the short line east well get back here by noon and this afternoon we can show them some other sets  to this plan the others agreed with enthusiasm and preparations for an immediate start were begun shall we take rifles asked hal eagerly  for what demanded pat we be going to visit a deer yard and twould be tempting fate and flying in the face of providence to let such a bloodthirsty young gintleman in among the poor cratures with a gun in his hands  hal joined in the laugh at his expense and then added rather lamely  we might run across that silver fox  and we might jump over the moon the one is as likely as the other retorted pat  so the guns were left at the cabin pat led the way straight to the ridge on which spud ely had missed his first chance to get a buck in the fall but instead of climbing the ridge worked along the foot of it skirting a swamp they followed the edge of this for some distance and then abruptly turned into it the growth was dense in places with thickets of young hemlocks which afforded both warmth and shelter in severe weather almost at once they came to a deeply trodden path which led them presently to a maze of paths running in all directions  here we are said pat  sparrers face was a study wheres de yard he asked  all around here replied pat with a comprehensive sweep of his arm wherever you see these paths then a sudden light breaking over him he added did you expect to find a fence around it son  sparrer grinned not at all embarrassed by the general laugh and perfectly willing to confess his ignorance all de yards ever oi seen had fences round em oi thought a fence was what made a yard he confessed  not a deer yard replied pat a deer yard is a place where the deer tramp out paths in the snow and spend the winter it is made where they get both shelter and food when the first deep snow comes they collect in such a place and start the paths while browsing for food then as the snow gets deeper they follow the same paths because it is easier going and make new paths only when they have to to reach new food supplies by continually using these paths they keep them open and manage to pick up a living browsing on twigs and pawing down to the ground moss by the time the heaviest snows come they cant very well get out if they want to especially when there is a crust like this you see some of those paths are two to three feet deep the more plentiful the feed and the smaller the herd the smaller the yard before there were any laws to protect deer and moose they used to be slaughtered in the yards by trappers and lumber jacks because it is no trick at all for a man on snowshoes to run them down once get them frightened so that they break out of the yard and they can be run down in no time theres a deal of poaching goes on now when a yard is discovered near a lumber camp its just plain murder and nothing less ive known a whole family of moose bull cow yearling and calf to be wiped out in one day by a bloodyminded gamehog didnt even waste a shot on the calf but ran it down and cut its throat red pete the brute walt helped to put in the pen the first year he came up here used to make a business of locating deer yards and keeping lumber camps supplied with fresh meat all winter the poor critters havent even a running chance for their lives  oi hope well be able to lamp some oi wud loike to put me peepers on a real live wild deer before we go home said sparrer his eyes shining with suppressed excitement  i guess i can promise you that my son replied pat well separate here sparrer and i will work off to leeward hal will keep straight ahead and walt will swing to windward if you two start any they will work over to us and give sparrer a chance to see em yell if you start any i reckon youll find em pretty tame they havent been bothered here and they know as well as we do that the law protects em now watch for fresh sign and follow it up  they separated as suggested hal and walter moving slowly so as to give pat and sparrer time to gain a good position walter swung well to the windward side of course this meant that his chances of getting a close view of any deer which might be on his side of the yard were comparatively slim they would wind him and at once move on he was in effect a driver for the others but he didnt mind this wild deer were no new sight to him and he was only too anxious to give sparrer the pleasure which he knew a glimpse of peakedtoes in the freedom of his native woods would be  he chose what appeared to be one of the most used paths and followed this as quietly as he could he soon found that still hunting on snowshoes and with moccasined feet on bare ground were two very different matters he was not yet sufficiently adept on the big webs to keep them from clacking as the rim of one shoe passed over the rim of the other the harder he tried not to the more noise he made it seemed clack clack clack it was most annoying he stopped to consider then on the impulse of a sudden idea he slipped his shoes off and dropped down into the path he had been following here he could walk without noise the droppings of the deer known as sign by all hunters were numerous and the brush within reach from the path showed indications of having been browsed on recently and he found several places where sharp hoofs had pawed away the snow since the last storm  the path twisted and turned and doubled on itself showing that it had been made originally by aimless wandering in quest of food other paths crossed it but walter avoided these judging that the one he was on was as likely as another to lead him to the quarry at length after an abrupt turn it led straight into a thicket of hemlocks young growth as he approached this there was a sharp sound like the sudden release of compressed air repeated a second later from a point a trifle to the right it was the alarm warning of deer above the snow just to the right of and beyond the thicket he caught a glimpse of the heads and necks of two does moving rapidly the effect was most peculiar it was as if they possessed no bodies until one of them made a high jump for just an instant bringing the back and rump with its snowy white flag stiffly erect into view  from the way they go i should think it was the hunting season i had an idea that they wouldnt be particularly timid but those two lit out in a regular panic act like theyd been hunted until their nerves were all on edge thought the boy as he hurriedly forced his way through the thicket  he had no expectation of finding more there but was eager to see where the two had been lying and then to follow them up as rapidly as possible so he burst through the screen of hemlocks in rather precipitate fashion an unusual proceeding for upton whose natural caution had been supplemented by a very thorough training in woodcraft during the three summers he had spent at woodcraft camp the instant he was through the barrier he realized the folly of his action facing him not ten feet away was a big buck with a splendid pair of antlers  illustration not ten feet away was a big buck  if the does were panic stricken their lord was not on the contrary he was the embodiment of vicious anger the hair on his neck was raised his eyes blazed with rage and he was pawing the snow with impatience these details were registered on walters mind to be recalled later but at the time he was conscious of but one thingthat he had stumbled into a predicament which might easily cost him his life no sooner was he clearly in view than the buck charged telling of it at the cabin that night upton declared that in that fleeting instant it seemed to him that he was staring at a whole forest of horns pointed straight for him  intuition is subconscious direction without the aid of conscious thought and is usually the result of wisely directed thinking in the past as a scout upton had tried to train himself to meet emergencies to be prepared and it was the result of this training that governed him now dropping his snowshoes he leaped aside fortunately the snow had been trampled down for a sufficient space at this point to allow of this as it was the buck swept past so close as to almost graze his clothing  indeed so narrow had been the margin that the shoes released as he jumped fell directly in front of the infuriated animal and the brow antlers pierced the meshes of one of them it was this lucky circumstance which was uptons salvation for a few minutes the bucks attention was wholly engaged with this new adversary which banged against his nose obscured his vision and clung to him in such inexplicable fashion he tried to back away from it but in vain then he plunged forward and sought to grind it into the snow with the result that he only fixed it more firmly on his antlers in vain he struck at it with his feet the dangling tail offered nothing on which to get a purchase fear now began to replace rage here was an enemy that would neither fight nor run away nor could he in turn run away from it  meanwhile walter had made the most of his opportunity but a few feet distant was a young hemlock tree floundering through the snow he reached this and scrambled up it was a small tree and his perch was none too secure and anything but comfortable for an extended stay but it meant safety for the time being and just then this was everything with a sigh of thankfulness he turned his attention to the scene below and his sense of humor for the moment overcame everything else the buck was plainly being worsted in his battle with the snowshoe and was working himself into a panic his great eyes were wide with fright as he backed and plunged and vainly reared in an effort to strike with his forefeet with every toss of his head the tail of the shoe rapped him sharply across his nose adding injury to insult it was so funny that walter fairly shouted with laughter and the sound of his voice added to the terror of the frantic animal  with a desperate leap sidewise in an effort to get clear of his tormentor he landed in the deep snow his sharp hoofs cutting through the crust then followed a succession of floundering plunges which took him still further into trouble until at last panting from fright and the result of his efforts he was forced to cease his struggles from sheer weariness  it was then that upton thought seriously of his own plight the buck was not much more helpless than he himself without his shoes one lay below him in the snow somewhat the worse for the trampling of the buck during his wild plunging this he could retrieve without trouble or danger but the other was still fast on those uncomfortably sharp horns and he was of no mind to make a closer acquaintance with them unaided it was then that he remembered that in the subsequent excitement he had failed to give the view hallo when he had started the does and thus warn the others that game was afoot a yell now would mean to the others merely that they were to be on the watch for deer headed their way unless they were near enough to distinguish words which he much doubted  then he remembered the whistle which he always carried and the emergency call for help of the blue tortoise patrol both hal and sparrer would recognize and understand that somehow it seemed less a compromise of dignity than yelling for help he raised the whistle to his lips and blew the signal waited five seconds and blew again a minute later he heard a reply from a lesser distance than he had expected followed almost at once by another which was rendered fainter by distance  reached both of em he muttered complacently hal isnt so far away as i was afraid he might be guess i better tell them what the trouble is  with the whistle he spelled out in the morse code treed by a buck watch out  back came the double reply o k followed by hals voice in a long drawn hellooo shouting occasionally to give the others the direction upton climbed down from his perch recovered the one shoe and then waited with such patience as he could hal was soon within easy shouting distance and the anxiety in his voice as he inquired if upton was all right was very evident set at rest on this point he whooped joyously and upton grinned ruefully  this will be nuts for hal hell never let me hear the end of it im glad he didnt see me up the tree he thought aloud he warned hal not to come too near but to wait until the others came up while he felt that the buck was so bedded in the snow as to be practically harmless he wanted no chances taken  a few minutes later pat and sparrer came up panting with the exertion of their long run and the circumstances were briefly explained pat took in the situation at a glance and his eyes danced with enjoyment and all three began to chaff walter unmercifully but there was little time for this just then the coming up of the others had further alarmed the buck who had recovered wind and strength to some degree and was now renewing his efforts to escape  pat ordered hal to circle around and head off the animal while he himself came up from behind and endeavored to free the shoe sparrer was to stand by in case of need and render any assistance he could upton was to stay where he was indeed there was nothing else for him to do as once in the deep snow he would be more helpless than the deer the latter was still floundering forward and there were stains of red on the crust where it had cut the slender legs  as hal appeared in front of him whooping excitedly the buck ceased his struggling and stood shoulder deep in the snow his sides heaving and his steaming nostrils quivering as he labored for breath  poor thing he hasnt got another kick in him hal exclaimed drawing so near that he could reach out and touch the slender muzzle  dont be too sure of that me bye betther shtand back a bit warned pat coming up from the animals rear and leaning forward to get hold of the shoe  hardly were the words out of his mouth when the buck flung his head up and back the tail of the shoe flew up striking hal a sharp blow on the side of his head instinctively he jumped back forgetting that he was on snowshoes the result was immediate and decisive with a wild yell he pitched backward and disappeared in the snow at the same instant pat grabbed the bucks horns one with each hand and straddling his back called for sparrer to free the shoe this sparrer succeeded in doing after a few minutes struggle and then turned his attention to hal whose muffled cries of help take him away bore evidence to the fact that he was under the impression that the buck had knocked him down and was trying to trample him in fact it was hard work to convince him that this was not the case until with sparrers help he regained his feet and got the snow out of his eyes sufficiently to see pat struggling with the deer  as soon as hal and sparrer were at a safe distance pat let go and joined the others breathing heavily from his exertions the deer freed of the hateful thing which had clung to his head and been the cause of all his troubles turned and with awkward jumps plunged back through the way he had broken in leaving the yard pat warned walter to keep out of sight so as not to turn the animal into new difficulties and presently they saw him reach the trodden paths of the yard and with a shake of his beautifully crowned head bound lightly away  then while they took stock of damages upton told his story an innocent babe in the woods murmured pat when walter told how he had removed his shoes and taken to the deer paths if that had been a bull moose now instead of a buck tis loike yer frinds wud be weeping instead av laughing at ye this very minut  thats true pat replied walter promptly it was a foolish thing to do and i know it now as it is youve got the laugh on meand hal he added slyly how about it hal  oh its on me too all right returned that young gentleman rubbing the lump on his head i sure thought that brute was right on top of me  pat meanwhile had brought out some stout twine and was making temporary repairs on the damaged shoes beyond some damage to the webbing where the horns had pierced it the one which had been the cause of the bucks discomfiture was as good as ever but the frame of the other had been badly split by the sharp hoofs of the plunging animal bringing the broken parts together pat wound them with the twine and when he had finished pronounced the shoe fit for the trip back to the cabin where he would undertake a more permanent job  we wont visit those traps now said he in spite of walters protest that he could go back while the others went on and led the way homeward     chapter xiii  poachers   the behavior of the deer in the yard had puzzled upton not a little he could evolve no theory to account for it why at this season of the year should those two does have appeared so terror stricken at his approach and why should the buck have been in such an ugly mood from all accounts he had read and from what pat had said he had had good grounds for expecting the animals to be fairly tame he put the matter up to pat as they tramped homeward but his reply was evasive and unsatisfactory in fact the big fellow was not inclined to talk he appeared to have something on his mind and strode along with a black scowl darkening his usually goodhumored face once walter thought he detected a slight shake of his head at sparrer as the latter started to say something he was sure of it when the latter abruptly changed the subject  pat set a stiff pace he seemed in a hurry to get back to the cabin as he opened the cabin door and looked in a flash of what looked to upton very much like relief crossed his face as he saw that it was empty it being too early for alec to have returned this puzzled walter more than ever but he held his tongue and forbore to ask questions he felt sure that in his own good time pat would unburden himself the latter at once went to work on the broken shoe replacing the twine with a rawhide thong made pliable by soaking in water this would contract in drying and the broken frame would be stronger than ever  he had just finished the job when alec came in with two marten any signs of our friends the enemy asked pat whimsically  alec shook his head no one has been near the traps he replied i dinna think they will dare come so near the cabin  youve got another guess coming alec retorted pat the murthering thaves killed two deer within a mile of here yesterday  what exclaimed walter and hal in unison while alec suspended his skinning knife in mid air and shot a keen glance at pat  its a fact pat went on sparrer will tell you so  sparrer nodded in confirmation of pats surprising statement  but we didnt hear any guns protested hal  no replied pat for the very good reason that no guns were fired they were not hunting they were butchering then he graphically described for alecs benefit uptons experience with the buck that morning and the story lost nothing in the telling walt he continued knows enough about deer to realize that the deer he saw did not behave as he expected they would and hes been puzzling over it ever since ill tell you the reason theyve been hunted and harried in that yard till their nerves are on the jump so that they will run from their own shadows all but the buck and i guess now after his scrap with the snowshoe he will be as bad as the does as it was he was simply fighting mad knowing their helplessness outside the yard ordinarily he would have simply trotted off quietly with the does but they were hunted yesterday to a point where the old fellow was desperate and the proof of it is what sparrer and i found  what was it demanded walter eagerly  we found where a fawn and a doe had been driven into the deep snow and butchered with a knife replied pat the story was plain enough for any one who can read signs it was no trick at all for those bloody poachers on snowshoes to run them down and drive them into the snow after that no gun was needed besides a gun is too noisy for thieves and lawbreakers walt didnt tell you what he saw yesterday fire away walt and tell em  upton told briefly what he had seen on the peak by the pass and his reasons for telling only pat alecs face hardened as he listened and a steely glint crept into his eyes when walter had finished pat continued  you fellows wondered why i was so keen on getting back to the cabin it was because i dont believe it is safe to leave it unguarded as long as the snow was soft those thieves kept away from the hollow but with this crust to leave no tracks theyve come down here and theyve been watching us they know how many of us are here and are watching our movements theyd raid the cabin in a minute if they saw the chance but as long as anybody is here theyll keep out of sight hereafter well leave a guard when we go out tomorrow alec and i will start before daybreak to look for those fellows and leave you youngsters to amuse yourselves i have an idea that their camp isnt so far away as alec thought it was now well have dinner and this afternoon alec and i will look over a couple of the short lines one of you can keep guard here and the other two can go with us or do anything else you please  upton insisted that he should keep guard hal decided to go with alec and sparrer with a little hesitancy confessed that he would like to hunt rabbits the experience of christmas morning had whetted his taste for hunting and following a trap line seemed tame sport in comparison he was eager to try his luck alone and when walter offered the loan of his rifle his happiness was complete when the others had departed he shouldered the rifle and at uptons suggestion started to follow the course of the brook up to the beaver ponds so as to see the houses and dams and then go on to the swamp at the head of the ponds where spud ely had found the rabbit tracks which had ultimately led to his finding of alec smith the fall before  it did not take him long to reach the first or big dam it was difficult for this boy of the city to believe that this could be the work of animals and not men and had he not seen some of the beaver cuttings in the bronx park at home he would have been inclined to think that upton had been stuffing him when he told him about the dam there was little opportunity to examine the construction because it was covered with snow and was in effect a long solid wall of glistening white beyond stretched the smooth even surface of the big pond with nothing to break the dead level of it but three white mounds over toward the north shore these he knew must be the houses of which upton had told him and he at once decided to go over and investigate them  as he approached them he discovered several small mounds around two of the houses but thought nothing of this until he noticed that the snow around them had been recently disturbed and that the mounds themselves were not crusted instantly every sense which his scout training had developed was aroused here was something peculiar and to be investigated could this be the work of the beavers he would find out rapidly he dug into one of the mounds and presently disclosed evergreen boughs over which the snow had been heaped could this be some work of the strange little animals of which he had never heard he lifted one of the boughs and looked at the butt it had been broken off and not cut by teeth moreover it was freshly broken he examined another with the same result underneath was a larger one and this had been cut with an axe  sparrer straightened and looked keenly in all directions a sudden suspicion was rapidly crystallizing into conviction in his mind this was the work of man what did it mean so far as he could see there was not another living thing in all that great white waste the vast silence was oppressive involuntarily he shivered for the first time the loneliness of complete solitude gripped him the more so that hitherto in all his life he had never known what it was to be absolutely alone from babyhood he had been surrounded night and day by human beings many of them evil but human nevertheless even since he had entered the woods he had not been out of speaking distance of one or more of his companions until now an overwhelming sense of littleness and insignificance swept over him there was something sinister and threatening in the towering hills he had the feeling that unseen eyes were watching him and it made his flesh creep he knew it was must be only a feeling yet he could not rid himself of it it is a feeling which every one who is alone for the first time in the wilderness experiences  then he shook himself youse is sure losing yer goat sparrer he muttered buck up  with this he resumed his investigations when the last of the boughs had been removed he found a hole in the ice about a foot and a half wide and a trifle longer along one end and both sides small dead sticks had been driven into the mud and close to the edges of the hole these were about four inches apart and formed a little pen with one end open close to one side and projecting beyond the pen through the open end was a long freshly cut green poplar stick fastened about two inches above the bottom the water was shallow and presently he made out a steel trap dimly outlined well inside the pen quite close to the poplar stick the chain fastened to one of the pen stakes  it was all perfectly clear now to even such a novice as sparrer it was a set for beaver he knew enough about the animals to know that their favorite food is poplar bark the green poplar stick was bait it seemed queer to think of a stick of wood as bait but this is what it was and nothing else he saw that it was securely fastened at the butt end in a corner of the pen and was staked down near the opening so that there could be no cross movement it could not be pulled out the only way for a hungry beaver to get it would be to enter the pen and cut it off and in doing this he could hardly fail of stepping in the trap then he would drown miserably under the ice the part left sticking out beyond the pen was by way of a teaser it would be the first part touched by the animal and would undoubtedly be cut off close to the pen having had a taste of the fresh green bark and no harm having come from it the animal would unsuspectingly enter the pen to secure the remainder whereas with the bait wholly within the pen in the first place the animal would be suspicious and wary of entering it was all very simple clever and diabolical  sparrers first impulse was to spring the trap but on second thought he decided to leave it alone it might well be that his discovery were better unknown his life in new york streets had taught him that it is possible to know too much that some things are better forgotten as soon as learned he recalled what had been said about the illegality of trapping beaver if pat and alec were doing a little quiet poaching it was none of his business they would not thank him for interfering of course the trap must be theirs there was no one else trapping in the hollow the poachers there had been so much talk about were working miles beyond the hollow on the long line he remembered now that neither pat nor alec had once suggested a trip up this way good reason they wanted to avoid any embarrassing questions about those queer little mounds for he knew now that each one covered a trappan the boughs and the snow were to keep the holes from freezing over he counted the mounds there were three at one house and four at the other  youse better cover this up and make yer getaway while the goings good he muttered as he replaced the boughs and packed the snow over them until the mound was as nearly as he had found it as it was possible to make it then he made a hasty examination of the houses the snow was melted on the tops of the two around which the traps were set sure sign that they were inhabited this was caused by the warm air from the interior escaping through the air holes which are always left in the top of a beaver house the third was solidly crusted over a reasonably sure indication that it was abandoned  having satisfied his curiosity sparrer started back to the dam and followed it to the woods on the farther shore he had intended to go straight across the pond to the second dam but his discovery of the traps had aroused his sense of caution and he decided that it would be better to keep to the woods on the broad white expanse of the pond he would be altogether too conspicuous should it happen that curious eyes were watching as he skirted the shore of the pond through the brush his thoughts were so busy with his discovery that for the time being he quite forgot to keep an eye out for rabbit signs the illegality of this attempt to catch beaver in a closed season did not impress him at first he had had nothing to do with game and game laws they were entirely outside his range of experience in fact he failed utterly to grasp the purpose back of the laws and like a great many others he regarded them as a restriction of individual liberty and a violation as of no very great moment they were to him very much as the keep off the grass signs in the city park  so it was no shock to the boy to think that his new idol pat should be breaking a law for which he could see no reason but what did give him a shock was the method employed this outraged his strong sense of fair play its hitting em below de belt dey aint got a chance in de world he kept saying over and over to himself dey finds de food right by dere houses under de ice where dey aint looking for no foul blow and dey helps demselves and gits a knockout widout a show he could overlook the breaking of the law because it held no meaning for him but it was hard to reconcile this flagrant outrage on fairness with what he knew of pat  maybe alecs doing it on de side and pat dont know nothin about it he thought and with this comforting reflection he felt better as he tramped on his thoughts grew clearer he recalled alecs strong assertion that he was for protecting beaver if alec had been sincere this eliminated him and pat had not been away from the cabin unattended since they arrived moreover the traps had been set since the last snow and that fact effectually disposed of both pat and alec as he realized this sparrer gave vent to a low whistle its some other mugs as sure as shootin he exclaimed bet its de same guys dat killed de deer and pat an alec dont know nothin about it he paused undecided whether to go back or keep on but a moments reflection decided him pat and alec were out on the trap lines and would not be back until dark he would keep on and have his hunt the news would keep until he got back  but this newborn certainty that there were others in the hollow gave him an uncomfortable feeling and he decided that he would keep as much away from the open as possible for this reason as he approached the second dam he was content to look at it from the screen of brush it was similar to the first but smaller and there were no houses in the pond above the third dam was but a short distance above and this was the smallest of the three beyond this lay the swamp where he hoped to find the rabbits that his nerves were jumpy he realized by the way he started at every unexpected sound the grinding of one tree against another even an unusually loud clack of his own snowshoes made his heart jump once he could have sworn that he heard a stick snap behind him and for a full two minutes he stood listening but he heard nothing further and nothing moved within his range of vision charging it up to an overwrought imagination and chiding himself for a silly chump he moved on  presently he discovered fresh rabbit sign and this drove everything else out of his head slowly he moved forward his rifle cocked and ready profiting by his experience with pat the day before he scanned every little irregularity in the surface of the snow with suspicious eyes presently he discovered a little mound ahead of him and a bit to one side of the path he was following it seemed to sparrer that it was if anything a trifle whiter than the surrounding snow study it as he would to his untrained eyes it bore no resemblance to an animal but presently he noticed two dark spots and it flashed over him that they were eyes intently watching him slowly he started to raise his rifle but at the first movement the white mound dissolved into a long legged animal which bounded behind a stump and was gone before he could get his gun to his shoulder  disappointed but resolved that the next one should not get the jump on him sparrer kept on sign was plentiful everywhere and his hopes ran high so fearful was he of another rabbits repeating the surprise of the first one that as he stole forward he kept his gun at his shoulder until at last he was forced to lower it from sheer weariness but in spite of his care and watchfulness he saw no more game and at last sat down on an old log to rest he was tired and if the truth be known somewhat discouraged he was too new at the hunting game to realize that his was no more than the usual experience of the hunter and that his chances of success if no better were no worse than in the beginning     chapter xiv  the silver fox   the log on which sparrer was seated was near the edge of the swamp and commanded a view of the small upper pond while he himself was more or less screened from observation from that direction by a fringe of young birch and alders he had sat there perhaps ten minutes and was just beginning to realize that he would have to move on in order to keep warm when his eyes idly scanning the farther shore detected something moving among the trees beyond the farther end of the little dam  instantly he was all attention his eyes glued to the spot he forgot that he was beginning to feel chilled a warm glow of excitement rushed over him there was an animal of some kind over there but what he could not tell at that distance but one thing was certain it was no rabbit for it was dark in color and it was too big he could catch but tantalizing glimpses of it in the young growth along the edge of the pond and presently it disappeared altogether behind a tangle of fallen brush unconsciously he held his breath as he waited for it to reappear slowly the minutes slipped away he began to think that his eyes must have been playing him tricks he was once more becoming conscious of the cold and had almost decided to cross over and investigate the brush pile into which he thought the animal had vanished when a black form leaped lightly out on the farther end of the dam and paused with one fore foot uplifted and head thrown up to test the wind  sparrer needed but one look at the great plume of a tail to know that it was a fox but such a fox as he had never dreamed existed it was bigger than any fox he had ever seen the great size being apparent even at that distance and instead of the red coat of the foxes with which the boy was familiar at the bronx zoo this fellow was robed in the blackness of night and this was intensified by contrast with the pure white of his surroundings  its him de silver fox gasped sparrer under his breath and with the realization that here before his very eyes was the king of the north american fur bearers whose skin was worth a fabulous sum according to what he had heard he began to shake as with the ague what if he could get him a cold sweat broke out at the mere thought there on the dam was what to him was nothing less than a fortune and here was he shaking like an aspen leaf in the wind the distance was too great for a shot at present but perhaps the fox would come nearer and then a true eye and steady nerves for just a matter of a few seconds and the prize might be his  with a quick intake of breath he tried to get a grip on himself he thought of the battles he had fought with bullies older and bigger than himself and had won because he had kept his head in the heat of contest and had coolly taken advantage of every opening but that was different then he was in action and it was easier to keep cool then too if he missed one blow there was a chance for another it was this sitting still with the knowledge that there would be but one chance and that this must be taken at just the right moment or be lost forever that upset him so then curiously enough the motto of the boy scouts flashed into his headbe prepared it was like a tonic to his shaking nerves was not a scout supposed to be prepared for all emergencies and what was this but a form of emergency  he stopped shaking he lifted his rifle ever so little and found that it remained steady and motionless in his hands it aint no fox its just a rabbit and youse cant miss it he whispered over and over to himself and experienced an odd sense of confidence he was himself once more the sparrer of the streets able to take care of himself and keep his head in any emergency the sparrer of the blue tortoise patrol noting the number of the fleeing machine at the time of the accident  meanwhile the fox was leisurely crossing the dam stopping now and then to sniff at the snow or to test the wind fortunately what little there was of the latter was blowing toward the hidden watcher a fact which sparrer did not appreciate at the time had the wind been the other way the fox would have caught the hated man smell and vanished like a shadow as it was his every move denoted complete lack of suspicion so far as a fox ever does lack this characteristic trait  sparrer was at complete loss as to what he should do the temptation to crawl forward so as to get within easy range of the end of the dam was almost irresistible but he realized that the first move on his part would be likely to attract the keen eyes of his quarry and arouse his suspicions had the fringe of brush through which he was watching been leaved out it might have been possible to successfully make this move but as it was his dark body against the white background could hardly fail of detection despite the screen of brush he knew enough of animals to know that so long as he was motionless he would appear to be no more than a part of the log on which he sat and wisely concluded to sit tight and await developments  if the fox continued clear across the dam there was one point at which he would afford a clear shot through a little opening in the brush it would be at long range but the 22 was high powered and if he could judge the distance aright and hold true there was a chance that he might kill so far as he could see this appeared to be his only chance and he prepared to take advantage of it inch by inch he wormed himself around on the log so as to face this opening then estimating the distance as best he could a difficult matter across the snow he set his sights accordingly cocked the rifle and held it in readiness all the time he kept whispering to himself nothin but a rabbit nothin to git excited about youse has got a dead cinch youse cant miss somehow this trying to think of the fox as a rabbit helped wonderfully anybody could hit a rabbit  the fox was trotting now with his nose to the snow sparrer was conscious of a hope so great that it was almost a prayer that the animal would stop when he reached the critical spot it would be a hard enough shot at a motionless mark but to hit a mark moving as swiftly as the fox was now going was more than he dared even dream of doing the trot broke into a lope sparrer raised the rifle and sighted through the opening it seemed to him that that swiftly moving form crossed the opening in one leap a blur of black across his sights slowly he lowered his rifle his chance was gone  in the reaction that followed he realized how high his hopes had been it seemed as if fortune had but played with him had put the prize almost within his grasp and then as he reached for it had snatched it away to tease and mock him he could have cried with vexation and disappointment had he been of the weeping kind as it was he swallowed a lump in his throat and leaned forward to peer through the brush for one last glimpse of the royal animal  at the end of the dam the fox stopped sparrer could just make him out through the tangled screen of brush for a moment he stood motionless it seemed to the boy like adding insult to injury then with a long graceful leap he landed on the snow of the swamp a sudden hope caused sparrer to instinctively tighten his grip on the rifle and catch his breath perhaps the fox would come his way if he should well he would at least find a true scouthe would be prepared  but the fox did not turn in his direction instead he kept straight on into the swamp as if he intended to cross it to the high land which made up to the hills beyond sparrer caught occasional glimpses of him through the trees he crossed the trail by which sparrer had come in sniffed at it looked up in sparrers direction suspiciously it seemed to him sniffed again and then trotted on as if the matter were of no present interest the dry snow had not held the scent sufficiently to cause alarm  instead of continuing in a direct course for the hills the fox now began to quarter the ground very much as a bird dog does in quest of quail in short runs from side to side he advanced deeper into the swamp investigating every bush and clump of trees in his course pausing now and then with head raised and ears cocked forward to listen then running on again gradually it dawned on sparrer that reynard had crossed the dam with a definite purpose he had come over to the swamp with the same object in view that had brought sparrer thereto hunt rabbits  the sharp contrast between the snow and the black coat of the fox made it possible for sparrer to follow the animals movements at a distance which under ordinary conditions would have been impossible he had turned and was working up wind continually stopping to carefully test the light air in the hope of scenting a hare his course was now directly away from sparrer toward the lower end of the swamp the boy could get only an occasional glimpse of him and presently lost him altogether once more bitter disappointment rankled in his heart what should he do now should he remain where he was or should he move on how he wished that he knew more about hunting and the ways of animals black foxes in particular what would pat do were he in his place would he give up somehow he couldnt picture pat as giving up without further effort to capture so great a prize  hed do somethin but what sparrer scowled in labored thought the fox was somewhere between him and the cabin should he turn back on the chance that he would jump the animal somewhere on the way and get a running shot no chance he decided remembering the clack of his shoes in walking hed hear me a mile he slipped his shoes off and rose to his feet the crust bore him for he was a light weight then he took a comprehensive survey of his surroundings there was one other chance the fox might return he would soon reach the lower edge of the swamp and failing to make a kill might decide to try his luck down wind in the main body of the swamp  the more sparrer thought of this the more likely it seemed perhaps unconsciously he was allowing hope to father the idea anyway it raised his spirits wonderfully in such an event he must be ready once more he looked the ground over carefully his present position was on the outer edge of the swamp he quickly appreciated that if he were farther in his chances would be doubled in case the fox returned if he remained where he was the fox might pass so far toward the other side that he would not even see him to say nothing of getting a shot whereas if he could find a place farther in which would command a fairly open view in all directions the chances of the animal passing unseen would be greatly reduced slightly back of his present position and a good rifle shot in to the swamp he noted a small mound crowned by a clump of young birches he decided to take his stand there and await developments silently but vigorously he swung his arms to restore circulation then picking up his rifle and shoes he made his way quickly toward the new stand taking the utmost care not to snap a twig or make the least noise  as he entered the clump of birches a white form leaped out from the lower side ran ten or twelve yards and sat up looking back with eyes in which fear and curiosity were strangely blended it was a hare or socalled snowshoe rabbit and a big one slowly and carefully sparrer put down his shoes and then straightened up and raised his rifle silently he brought the sights to bear on the motionless white form his finger was already on the trigger when he remembered the fox a shot now would effectually put an end to any possibility of getting the prince of fur bearers that day and what was a rabbit compared with the latter  oddly enough the old adage a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush popped into his head but this time the one in the bush was of so much greater value that he promptly decided to let the one in hand go at that distance he couldnt miss for he had readjusted the sights and he had but to press the trigger to put an end to bunny a little sigh escaped him as he lowered the rifle the lowering of that rifle was the hardest thing he had done for a long time it required considerable power of selfrestraint the fox might not come back and if he did might not offer a shot or he might miss him then the chances were that he would have to return to the cabin empty handed  with the lowering of the rifle the rabbit dropped to a crouch thumped the snow smartly and then slowly hopped away to a point twenty yards distant in the direction in which the fox had gone and there crouched under a bush an inconspicuous lump of white sparrer noted with satisfaction that she was still within good range and made up his mind that if there were no signs of the fox within fifteen or twenty minutes and the rabbit still remained where she was he would shoot  now be it known that the thump of a rabbit can be heard a long distance it was so unexpected and so loud that it fairly startled sparrer who was wholly unfamiliar with this method of rabbit signaling the ground is an excellent transmitter of sound and the heavy snow crust was hardly less effective other ears than sparrers heard and for them that signal was pregnant with meaning and possibilities not two minutes later sparrer caught sight of a black spot moving swiftly in his direction it was the fox  as he drew nearer he moved more slowly and with characteristic cunning and caution every few steps he paused to listen and to look sharply under every tree and bush he no longer tested the air as when sparrer had last seen him for now he was working down wind and must trust to eyes and ears rather than to his nose but he was no less thorough in the way in which he covered the ground back and forth across sparrers field of vision he wove investigating every likely hidingplace approaching each with infinite care tense alert the picture of eagerness prepared to spring at the first move of his quarry  as he approached sparrer could read in every move and attitude of the black hunter expectancy and confidence that he knew to a reasonable certainty the approximate location from which that signal thump had sounded was clearly evident that he also knew that the rabbit might have and very likely had moved since thumping was also clear and he was taking no chance of overrunning his game if he kept on as he was coming he would be within shooting distance within a few minutes inch by inch sparrer raised the rifle and then hardly daring to breathe tense as motionless as the trees among which he stood he waited  the fox was now within thirty yards and still coming it was plain that he was unsuspicious of danger and intent wholly on the hunt at this point he turned obliquely to the left to investigate an old log sparrer was tempted to shoot but a clump of alders was in the way and he well knew that even a small twig would be almost sure to deflect the bullet he would wait finding nothing at the log the fox turned and quartered to the right which brought him into the open between the rabbit and the hunter and but a few yards from the former the angle at which he was approaching was such as to offer the smallest mark possible and make the shot uncertain for such a novice as sparrer by a great effort the latter overcame the almost overwhelming temptation to shoot and waited hoping that the animal would turn broadside  suddenly he whirled like a flash the boys first thought was that he had been discovered but the next move of the fox explained his action crouching so that he appeared to move on his belly he began to creep toward the rabbit which still sat motionless the fox had caught the scent of the latter at the instant he turned and he had but to follow his nose straight to his victim meanwhile he presented no better mark than before as he was now moving straight away and sparrer held his fire by this time he was so interested in the tragedy that was being enacted before him that he almost forgot his own immediate purpose  inch by inch the black hunter crept forward hugging the snow then sparrer saw him gather his muscular hindlegs under him there was a swift leap and at the same instant the rabbit left her form in a long jump before she could make another the fox was upon her there was a shrill scream a crunching of teeth and it was over for an instant the fox stood with one foot on the still white form a black statue of triumph then he picked the rabbit up by the middle and the limp form hung transversely in his jaws the long legs hanging on one side and the drooping head with ridiculously long ears on the other it was clear that reynard did not intend to enjoy his feast on the spot  in executing this last move he had turned broadside it was now or never for sparrer with infinite care he lined his sights just back of the shoulder and pulled the trigger simultaneously with the sharp crack of the rifle the fox made a convulsive spring and then crumpled in a black heap on the snow shaking so that he could hardly manipulate the lever sparrer ejected the empty shell and threw another cartridge into place then with the rifle at his shoulder covering the pathetic black heap as best he could he slowly advanced somewhere he had read or heard that it was an old fox trick to simulate death and he was taking no chances  but his precautions were needless the bullet had severed the spinal column the silver fox of smugglers hollow had stalked his last rabbit and made his last kill in the revulsion of feeling from the reaction following the long nervous strain sparrer hardly knew whether to laugh or cry as he stretched the black form out on the snow and ran his hands through the wonderful soft black fur and admired the great tail with its tip of snowy white he had for the moment almost a feeling of regret that he had been the means of destroying so beautiful a creature then the true significance of his achievement luck he called it swept over him and his eyes shone as he pictured his reception at the cabin  in the midst of his triumphant thoughts a guttural voice broke in white boy heap good shot  sparrer whirled to find himself staring into a dark coppery countenance with beady eyes low brow and high cheek bones it was an indian     chapter xv  sparrers temptation   white boy heap good shot repeated the indian with what was intended to be a friendly grin  he was standing some twenty paces away and where he had come from sparrer hadnt the least idea if he had sprung out of the snow at his feet the boy would have been no more startled and surprised he was short thickset and was dressed in a nondescript pair of trousers much the worse for wear a faded mackinaw spotted with grease and dirt and was of course on snowshoes the swarthy evil face was crowned with a cap of unplucked muskrat fur save for a light axe carried in one hand and a knife in his belt he apparently was unarmed a fact which sparrer noted at once with a feeling of relief  black fox no good kill rabbits and birds good to kill fox what white boy do with him continued his unwelcome visitor  take his skin replied sparrer for want of anything better to say  skin no good red fox skin good black fox no goodbad fur no can sell white boy take rabbit and give indian fox this astounding proposal was accompanied with what was intended for an ingratiating smile but which served only to make the face still more ugly  hes wised me fer a tenderfoot an thinks oim easy thought sparrer aloud he said what do youse want of it if its no good and youse cant sell it  once more the dark face broke into a grin no sell make cap to wear he touched his head to make clearer his meaning indian like black cap he added guilelessly  sparrer laughed aloud at the childish simplicity of the idea then he shook his head nothin doing he replied oi want the fox meself  a look of cunning swept across the dark visage indian buy fox give two dollar was the next bland proposal  again sparrer grinned and shook his head he was beginning to enjoy the situation this was a method of barter he was accustomed to the method of the lower east side he began to feel at home  five dollar the indian pulled off a mitten and held up the hand with the fingers spread  once more sparrer shook his head youse cant buy it said he decidedly as if to end the parley an youse cant put nothin across on me he added its worth a lot of dough an oim wise to it youse better run along he shifted his rifle to a handier position by way of a hint  the indian who had gradually advanced stopped his face changed completely there was no longer any attempt to hide the greed in the beady eyes he was no fool and he saw the uselessness of trying to dissemble further he meant to have that skin by fair means or foul by fair means if possible for he was keen enough to realize that thus he would avoid possible unpleasant consequences in the future this youngster knew more than he had supposed he did but he might not be proof against the temptation of ready money pulling off his other mitten he held up both hands closed his fingers opened them again closed them and then opened those of one hand  twentyfive dollar he exclaimed  that was a larger sum than sparrer had ever possessed at one time in all his life and to have that in hand at once was a temptation there was no denying the fact the skin might be worth all that he had heard and then again it might not he was too wise in the ways of the world to be ignorant of the fact that fabulous tales are built around comparatively modest facts undoubtedly the skin was valuable the fact that the indian was so eager to get it was proof of this but as for its being worth any such sum as two thousand or even one thousand that seemed absurd he glanced down at the black form at his feet and his imagination couldnt conceive of any one paying even a hundred dollars for such a little bit of fur why even when stretched it would be but a fraction of the size of the great bearskin back at the cabin and that was worth only fifteen dollars and for his part he would much rather have the latter he looked up to find the black beady eyes of the indian fixed upon him as if they read his very thoughts the man had been quick to perceive his hesitation and now began to speak again  white boy staying at trappers camp fox no belong to white boy him belong to trappers trappers sell and get money white boy get nothing white boy sell to indian no tell trappers indian go away and no tell white boy have all the moneytwentyfive dollar once more he held up his hands to indicate the amount  sparrer gulped the plan was simplicity itself twentyfive dollars meant a great deal to him and no one would ever know a vision of the toilworn face of his mother when he should place twentyfive dollars in her hands flashed before him and wasnt the fox his hadnt it been free and wild belonging to nobody and hadnt he waited and watched and with steady hands and a true eye made a clean kill he knew nothing of the ethics of a trappers camp what the indian had said might be true and he would get no share in the prize he had won it wasnt fair it was an aspect of the matter of which he had not thought indeed in the excitement of the hunt he had had no opportunity to think of anything but getting the shot what he should do with the fox if he got it had not entered his head and after the kill the appearance of the indian had put everything else out of his head  in swift review there passed through his mind all that he had heard about the silver fox of smugglers hollow he thought of the traps which alec had set especially for the wily king and how he and pat had openly planned for his capture this was their trapping territory by right of preëmption he sparrer was their guest and but for pat he would never have had this wonderful outing it was even a borrowed rifle with which he had made the fatal shot it was luck mere luck the luck of a novice that had given him the opportunity but was that any reason why he should not profit by it if he had not killed it the animal would still be running at large and pat and alec might never have gotten it it was his his his and no one else had any claim on it why should he not do as he pleased with it  meanwhile the indian had been watching with an intense fixed stare that noted every change of expression in the boys face a less close observer than he would have realized that the boy was tempted he was cunning enough to know that now was the time to play his trump card and catch the lad before he had fully regained possession of himself and spurned the temptation with a single swift step forward he exclaimed fifty dollar  there was a note of finality in his voice which sparrer recognized it was his last bid he would go no higher there would be no more bartering if twentyfive dollars had seemed big the doubling of the amount meant little less than a fortune in the boys eyes  youse hasnt got fifty dollars he said weakly youse is bluffin  in truth he had every reason for thinking so from the indians appearance one does not expect to find so large a sum on a man presenting so rough an appearance as this fellow particularly in the woods imagine sparrers surprise therefore when the indian felt inside his shirt and brought out a worn buckskin bag which apparently had been suspended by a thong around his neck and from it drew forth a wad of greasy bills squatting on his heels he unfolded these and began to count them out before him on the snow they were in small denominations and as he slowly spread them out counting aloud as he did so the effect was most impressive he meant that it should be he counted on the influence that the sight of so much currency would have  it was a cunning move had he shown the money in a pile or had the bills been in large denominations the effect would not have been nearly so impressive as it was the snow around him was literally carpeted with bills in spite of himself sparrer gave vent to a little gasp the indian heard stuffing the two bills which remained after he had counted out fifty back in the little bag he rose to his feet and with a dramatic sweep of one hand above the green carpet exclaimed  all white boys for fox white boy countfifty dollar white boy buy much things have good time he smiled meaningly indian take fox and leave much money white boy hide umso he thrust a hand into his shirt nobody know indian go wayfar he swept a hand toward the mountains then he pointed at the bills at his feet much money very much money white boy count  sparrer looked down in a fascinated stare and unconsciously he did count he had but to say the word and all those bills would be his his to hide away in his bosom and gloat over in secret until he should reach home and then a vision of the things they would buy passed before himthings his boyish heart had coveted things which his mother and brothers and sisters needed things which would for a time make life brighter and better and it would not be stealing the fox was his he had shot it and he had a right to do what he pleased with it it would not be stealing he repeated to himself almost fiercely  but would it be honorable could he go back to his companions and tell them freely and openly what he had done no he must keep his deed a secret locked in his heart to be boasted of only among his companions of the street gang once he would have had no qualms whatever his conscience would not have been troubled in the least but that was when he was sparrer muldoon street gamin and champion scrapper of the gang with no higher ethics than the right of might now he was edward muldoon boy scout sworn to keep physically strong mentally awake and morally straight to obey the scout law of which the first commandment is to be trustworthy and the second to be loyal  would he be either mentally awake or morally strong if he yielded to this temptation could he regard himself in the future us trustworthy or as loyal to his friends two selves were battling in one boy  it aint nothin wrong insisted sparrer muldoon  a scouts honor is to be trusted whispered edward muldoon  you bet it is unconsciously the boy spoke aloud the battle was won his face cleared in that moment he understood many things he knew now exactly what he would do he would take the fox to the cabin and turn it over to pat and alec he knew that that was what he had intended to do all along before the indian had appeared he knew too who this lowbrowed uglyfaced redskin was he was one of the thieves who had been stealing fur and who had butchered the deer the day before it came over him all in a flash that it was he who had set those traps at the beaver houses that he himself had been seen there and followed doubtless the indian had been in hiding close by all the time and the killing of the fox had brought him forth because he could not let so rich a prize slip through his fingers yes everything was clear to sparrer now in his first surprise his own problem following hard on the heels of it he had no chance to think or even to wonder how the man had happened to appear there at that moment now he understood and his face flushed with anger  the money was no longer a temptation he scowled down at it and he wondered if it had been come by honestly he could not know that the man was an outlaw and had been forced to leave a lumber camp between suns with no chance to spend his accumulated wages so he regarded the money with growing suspicion and his anger grew at the thought of how near he had come to selling his honor perhaps for tainted money at that  here youse take yer money an git he growled he motioned with the barrel of his rifle by way of emphasis an youse better take up dem traps he added significantly  the indians expression changed as he squatted once more and picked up the bills he was too shrewd a sign reader not to know when it was useless to follow a trail further the fox couldnt be bought therefore it must be obtained in some other way by craft or violence if he could get near enough to the boy to disarm him the rest would be easy if notwell there was another way he would avoid it if possible for the boys friends were too near they would be on his trail inside of twentyfour hours it would mean a long hurried flight across the border with two of the best woodsmen in the whole section behind him and every warden and lumber camp on both sides of the line watching for him it would mean a battle if ever they came up with him a battle to the death but a thousand perhaps two thousand dollars one would dare much for such a sum he had friends across the border through them the skin could be disposed of while he remained in hiding once across the line with the booty he had no fear that is if he could obtain it without committing the blood crime he would strike north and then market the pelt in the spring it would be difficult to prove that it was not of his own killing there were no witnesses it would be only the word of this boy against him even should he be traced given a reasonable start he had little fear of this  he looked over at the black fox and the lust of greed glittered in his eyes the animal was of unusual size and the fur was extra prime assuredly it would bring a great sum after all it was but a boy with whom he had to deal and by the looks of him a novice in the woods he stuffed the money bag back in his shirt and rose his axe in hand then without warning he leaped forward axe upraised his face contorted with rage like that of a demon  stop  there was something menacing and sinister in the sound of the word but more menacing and sinister was the muzzle of the little rifle into which he was staring it brought him up short in the middle of a stride he had seen the boy shoot and now the rifle was held as steadily as when it had been pointed at the fox there was something in the sound of the boys voice that warned him that he would not hesitate to shoot again and at that distance he could not miss the indian froze into a statue  turn around and git commanded sparrer he was not afraid he knew that the rifle gave him the whip hand a boy of his age from higher walks in life might have been intimidated not so sparrer young in years he was old in experience he had seen too many drunken brawls too many bad men in his street life and knew too much of human nature to feel fear with that gun at his shoulder instead a white hot consuming rage welled up within him as when he had rushed to the defense of some weakling against the attack of a cowardly bully he saw red  youse git he repeated and there was a threat in the very way in which he said it  for a brief second the indian hesitated then with an ugly snarl like that of a trapped beast he slowly turned baffled rage distorted his face until it was more like that of some savage animal than of a human being it was humiliating to be balked by a slip of a boy it was worse to have a fortune almost within his reach and be forced to leave it there was murder black murder in his heart as he slowly shuffled forward a few steps  suddenly he turned like a flash and with a peculiar swing threw the axe sparrer knew nothing of the art of axe throwing at which many woodsmen are expert and are deadly in their quickness and precision he was wholly unprepared for the move and it caught him off guard he caught a glimpse of glinting steel and instinctively ducked as he had learned to do in fighting at the same time he threw up his rifle the axe struck the barrel of the latter just enough to be slightly deflected from its course and the end of the handle instead of the keen blade struck the boy a crashing blow on the side of the head without a sound he dropped in his tracks  a slow grin overspread the face of his assailant as he strode over and looked down at the white still face of his victim after all it was better so he had not killed him and there was less to fear from the long arm of the law contemptuously he touched the still form with the toe of a shoe then gloatingly he picked up the fox hesitated and picked up the rabbit without another glance at the huddled form on the snow he turned and vanished among the trees     chapter xvi  the conference   sparrers eyelids fluttered then slowly lifted dully and uncomprehendingly he stared up at a fretwork of bare brown branches against a background of blue where was he what had happened then a throb of pain in his head cleared his senses and memory returned all too vividly his brows contracted in a black scowl and slowly and painfully he rolled over and got to his feet staring about for his assailant but of the outlaw there was no sign save the broken crust where the axe had plunged through nor was there any trace of the black fox save a little spot of crimson and two or three black hairs where the animal had lain  how long he had been unconscious he had no means of knowing but it could not have been long or he would have been frostbitten as it was he was merely chilled and numb from the cold his head ached badly and passing a mittened hand over it he found a big lump where the axe had hit him moreover he felt sick to his stomach dizzy and weak but for his physical ailments he had no thought wrath black boiling rage surged over him he had been robbed he had been treacherously outwitted for the moment it was the latter fact rather than the former that was the cause of his hot resentment he sparrer muldoon who had lived by his wits ever since he could remember had been caught napping  an me wid de drop on him he exclaimed bitterly he put me down fer de count but it was a foul an oi wasnt lookin fer no foul serves me right he smiled bitterly oi ought tknown better than t give him an openin serves me right fer listenin t his spiel if ever oi get de drop on him again hell wish hed never set eyes on sparrer muldoon  this was idle boasting and sparrer knew it the chances that he would ever again set eyes on the wily redskin were exceedingly slim still it was possible that pat and alec might be able to pick up his trail and the sooner they were put wise to the affair the better he would get back to camp as soon as possible he picked up his rifle and even as he did so a new thought flashed across his mind why tell of his experience at all why mention the black fox he could explain the bump on his head by saying that he had slipped and fallen striking his head against a log pat and alec need never know that he had lost the rare pelt for them for all time nor that he had been such a tenderfoot as to be outwitted by an indian on whom he already had the drop why say a word about it to tell would be likely to win for himself nothing but contemptcontempt for his weakness in parleying with the outlaw and for his stupidity in being outwitted  but there was a hope a faint one to be sure but still a hope that by some special favor of providence pat and alec might be able to trace his assailant and recover the skin not to tell would be to surrender without a fight and this was directly contrary to the boys nature a double motive urged him to leave no stone unturned that might lead to the capture of the indianthe desire to recover the rich prize and the spirit of revenge he could tell of the robbery without in any way committing himself in the matter of the temptation which had led to the parley with the outlaw this is what he would do he didnt want his companions to think worse of him than was absolutely necessary  so with his mind made up to this course he headed for camp clickclack coward clickclack coward his very shoes mocked him he tried to shut out the sound but he could not had edward muldoon boy scout won over sparrer muldoon street gamin only to lose in the end where the trail led close to the end of the big beaver dam he stopped abruptly and a last brief battle was fought between scout and gamin when it was over he pushed on with an eagerness he had not felt before for the scout had triumphed and this time he knew that the victory was final he would tell the whole story from beginning to end and spare himself nothing youse aint no quitter he muttered to himself fiercely youse is goin ter tell de truth de whole truth and nothing but de truth  his progress was slow and his snowshoes seemed strangely heavy the fierce conflict within not less than the effects of the blow he had suffered had left him physically weak he felt lightheaded his nervous system had received a shock from which he was now feeling the effects he was possessed of a desire to sit down and rest every few minutes but he set his jaws grimly and plodded on upton was outside the cabin splitting wood as he approached he looked up as the clickclack of snowshoes caught his attention and seeing that it was sparrer called cheerily what luck  a shadow of his oldtime impudent grin flashed across sparrers face as he replied what luck wud ye be expecting with a tenderfoot loike me  the greatest luck in the world its always that way in stories retorted upton then he noticed the pale face of the younger lad and dropping his axe he sprang forward say boy whats happened he demanded anxiously youre white as a sheet are you hurt or have you had a fright spit it out  a little of both oi guess confessed sparrer sitting down wearily on a handy log are de others back yet  not yet but theyre coming now replied upton as a faint yell reached them thats hal and by the sound of his voice theyve had luck of some kind but what happened to you  its a long story and oill tell it when de others get here replied sparrer oi think oill go in and get a ddrink of somethin hhot his teeth chattered it was the result of nervous reaction quite as much as cold upton with real concern in his face sprang forward and put an arm around the shaking youngster and led him into the cabin then hastened to make him a cup of hot soup with this in his stomach sparrer rapidly recovered and by the time pat alec and hal arrived the latter whooping joyously he was quite himself they brought with them three marten and a fisher  when these had been duly admired upton demanded that sparrer tell his story and this he did sparing himself nothing at the first mention of the black fox there was an eager leaning forward on the part of all his listeners and when he told of the successful shot hal whooped with joy  where is he he demanded  oi dont know replied sparrer and could not restrain a rather pathetic grin at the blank look of astonishment that swept over the four eager faces then he hurried on blurting out a full confession of his temptation and winding up with the incident of the axe throwing and his final recovery of consciousness  de skunk didnt even leave me de rabbit he concluded  the faces of pat and alec had changed rapidly from interest and astonishment to seriousness anger and determination both knew that murder and nothing less had been back of the throwing of that axe and that it was merely the accident of good fortune that sparrer was with them now instead of lying a corpse out there in the beaver swamp pat reached forward and pulled sparrers cap from his head disclosing an ugly lump where the blow had fallen till that moment no one had noticed that the boy had kept his cap on  you may thank the good god that it was the handle and not the blade that struck you son twas he alone that saved you this time exclaimed the big fellow a note of reverence in his voice tis an ugly bump he added passing his fingers lightly over the swelling tis a wonder it didnt break your skull as it was the cap saved you i guess why didnt you tell us you had that nasty lump you young spalpeen it ought to have been treated long ago  it aint nothing replied sparrer sheepishly for he hated to have a fuss made over him  upton was already heating water and preparing a bandage as soon as the water was hot he added a little tincture of arnica and despite sparrers protests a hot bandage was soon applied and he was forced to admit that it brought almost immediate relief this attention having been given the victim pat called a conference  its plain enough said he that this is the work of one of the blackhearted crooks who have been stealing our furs for tis my belief that there is probably more than one and likely not over two alec nodded concurrence with this belief that theyll stop at nothing sparrers experience proves ive known murder to be committed for less than the price of a prime black fox pelt now that theyve got it tis like that they will pull camp at once rather than take the chance of being discovered on the other hand they may think that their camp is so well hidden that they can just lie low if as i suspect they have been run out of one of the canadian lumber camps this may be what they will do they know that sparrer here is a tenderfoot and that there is only his word against theirs besides they can hide the pelt and deny all knowledge of it sparrer hasnt a shred of proof but the lump on his head and it would take more than that to convince a court of law in these parts that he had killed a genuine black fox  its my opinion that their camp is a whole lot nearer than alec has supposed there are plenty of draws back in these hills where a camp could be hidden and discovered only by chance unless some one was making special search for it the fact that that bloodyminded injun was hanging around the beaver pond so late in the day is evidence enough for me that his camp isnt many miles away ill bet its within five miles of us this blessed minute they probably located our trap lines then built their camp in a place we were not likely to visit and then by working back up through the hills kept their trail hidden and crossed on the ice to work our long lines as alec suspects they left our short lines alone partly because they could not get at them without leaving a trail in the soft snow and partly so as not to arouse suspicion  with the crust they could go where they pleased and the injun took the chance to do a little poaching on the beaver pond knowing that we would leave it alone he probably saw sparrer when he uncovered that trap and followed him through the woods either with the idea of finding out if the youngster suspected anything and then frightening him into holding his tongue or else just to keep track of his movements he saw the killing of the fox and decided that the fortune in that pelt was worth any risk  what he told sparrer about the skin belonging to alec and me isnt true this is a free country and the free creatures belong to whoever can get them if the critter had been in one of our traps it would have been a different matter then it would have been our property but the critter belonged to nobody until it was killed and when sparrer knocked it over every hair on that black hide belonged to him and to no one else the cunning redskin made up that yarn to tempt sparrer and there wasnt a particle of truth in it now the question is what are we going to do to get back sparrers property if it was just an ordinary red fox or even a marten the case would be different though even then id be for getting it back and running those thieving poachers out of the country as it is we owe it to sparrer to try to get that skin whats your idea alec  alec leaned forward and poked the fire ye ken that the moons full the night said he slowly i am thinking that you and me might take a bit of a look around if we could find the camp it would be time enough to decide what to do next i dinna think that with that prize they will be staying in these pairts long and what is done has got to be done quickly i have no suspicioned that the camp was handy till now i am no saying that i think so now he hastened to add with characteristic scotch caution but i will admit that it is possible ye ken there is no nook or hollow of these hills that i dinna ken every foot of i hid out here once myself we can leave the laddies to get a wee bit of sleep while we have a look in the most likely places  no you dont protested hal if theres any game like that afoot you can count us in cant they fellows  upton and sparrer voiced eager assent but pat shook his head nothing doing he declared alec and i are responsible for the safety of you fellows and youll stay right here and keep this little old cabin from running away besides he added noting the disappointment in the three faces this is no playscouting it is mens work and only for those who know the country two are all that are needed and more would double the chances of giving alarm if alec and i can locate the camp we may need your help tomorrow in rounding up the thieves so you will be good little boys and stay right here until youre needed i was thinking of the moon before alec spoke when it is up twill be almost as light as day twill do no harm for us to have a look around alec says true that he knows every foot of these hills and hollows i know them pretty well myself and if those birds of ill omen bad cess to the likes of them do not fly too soon well come pretty close to locating em inside the next twentyfour hours theres no use in starting before the moon is well up meanwhile well have supper i have no mind to travel on an empty stomach and ive the appetite of a lumberhorse this very minute any of that bearsteak left alec  alec promptly produced the desired meat and it was soon sizzling over the fire while they ate they discussed what should be done in case the camp of the outlaws was discovered  do you suppose they will fight asked hal eagerly  look at sparrer there and ask sensible questions returned pat sarcastically is a man who would attempt coldblooded murder likely to come at a whistle like a good doggie weve got to take them by surprise or somebody is likely to get hurt that is why i want you boys to keep out of it this isnt your business its alecs and mine  how about me youse said a while ago that that skin is mine piped up sparrer  so it is me bantam but your own skin is worth more to you than all the silver foxes that ever lived and if you cannot keep it whole yourself its up to us to keep it whole for you retorted pat it isnt just the matter of that fox skin he continued im guessing that alec and i have a good sized stake in the skins cached in that camp right now we had a little unpleasantness with those sneaking robbers of honest men to settle as soon as you left and this has simply forced it a little sooner its our job and you fellows are to stay out thats final  they knew by the tone of his voice that no amount of begging or argument would avail them in the least they knew too that pat was right in his stand they were his guests and as such entailed upon him a certain responsibility for their safety and welfare  but pat cant we be in at the finish pleaded hal gee think of a real scrap going on under our very noses and we not seeing it  depends on what the finish is replied pat ill promise you this much that if there is anything to see or if you can help without the risk of stopping a bullet or a knife you shall have a chance at present it looks like a dangerous game but well know more when weve found that camp the greatest help you can give us now is to stay right here well be back before daylight and by that time we will know enough i hope to plan some action alec itll be a couple of hours yet before we can start suppose we turn in for a bit of rest its little enough were likely to get for the next twentyfour hours well leave the lads to put the camp in order  this the boys were only too glad to do while the two trappers stretched out in their bunks and rested two hours later pat arose and peeped out the moon flooded the hollow with light and he grunted his satisfaction a few minutes later he and alec slipped out and almost at once were lost in the heavy shadows of the evergreens each carried his rifle and the two faces were set and grim there was something sinister in this silent departure and as they vanished into the vast brooding wilderness the three boys instinctively drew nearer together hal shrugged his shoulders and laughed but somehow his laugh sounded oddly forced  somebody kick me and tell me if im awake said he throwing another log on the fire you read about such things and think its a bully story but somehow the story seems more real than the reality of course nothings going to happen to pat and alec yet just the same they are out with rifles hunting sure enough bad men and if theres any shooting somebodys likely to be hurt if it wasnt for sparrers bandaged head there id think i was dreaming hows the old nut feel anyway sparrer  better but sore enough t let me know dis aint no dream returned the younger lad say he exploded abruptly what will de fellers say when we get back an tell em we been fightin outlaws an that oi gets a knockout from a sureenough injun bet deyll wish dey was in my shoes  upton laughed he was still boy enough to appreciate sparrers feelings as long as you had to get it im glad it was a real redskin who put it across said he as for fighting it doesnt look to me as if we were going to see any of it pat isnt going to take any chances on one of us getting hurt it makes me sick every time i think of the close call sparrer had if pat and alec find the camp of those brutes they wont do anything rash theyll try to trap em some way theyre right about us but just the same i wish we could be in it somehow id like to see the finish  perhaps we shall yet hal spoke hopefully shall we turn in  whats the use returned upton i couldnt sleep a wink until pat and alec get back we ought to keep the fire going and have something hot ready for them when they get in  suits me declared hal i couldnt sleep either  sparrer was of the same opinion so they sat before the fire and speculated on what was happening out there in the forest sparrer was plied with questions about his adventure and told the story over so graphically that the thrill of it sent little shivers down the backs of his listeners at times they sat in silence wondering if they might hear distant rifle shots and so the night wore on the most exciting night in their experience and yet a night in which so far as they were concerned nothing happened     chapter xvii  the camp of the poachers   upton had just glanced at his watch and noted that the hour was 3 a m hal and sparrer were both asleep the long vigil having proved too much for them despite their assertions early in the evening that they couldnt sleep a wink a slight sound outside the door caught walters attention a second later the door swung open and pat and alec entered it was clear that they had expected to find all the boys asleep and were endeavoring to make as little noise as possible  walter flashed a keen look at the two faces and read there the success of the trip hey you sleepyheads theyve found the camp he shouted thumping hal on the back  whawhawhat stammered hal rubbing his eyes and staring about him wildly while sparrer blinked stupidly then fully recovering his senses hal sprang to his feet did you really find the camp he asked eagerly  pat nodded hurrah cried the impetuous boy say who hit me i was right in the middle of a dream i had three outlaws lined up against a cabin wall and covered with a rifle when i felt that thump and for a minute i thought it was another one of em who had stolen up behind me and got me foul im certainly glad it was only a dream  everybody laughed upton meanwhile had hung a kettle of soup over the fire and was setting a couple of places at the table for the two trappers knowing that they must be hungry after their long tramp now tell us about it he commanded when they had had a chance to dispose of the soup and a big slab of corn bread  there isnt much to tell began pat we found their camp and watched it for a while and then came back  so simple murmured hal we found their camp i suppose you shut your eyes and let a good fairy take you by the hands and lead you straight to it its a wonder you havent been over to make a friendly call before seeing it is so handy and easily found  there was no mistaking the sarcasm in hals voice and pat laughed aloud twas no fairy led us to ut me bye but just common woods sense and me partners knowledge av the counthry then dropping his brogue he continued you know enough about camping to know that one of the first and most important things to look out for in locating a camp is a good water supply alec knows every good spring for twenty miles around having made up our minds that the camp was within five miles alec just ran over in his mind the likely springs within that distance and the lay of the land the fact that those bloodyminded thieves have been working our long trap lines was a pretty good indication that their camp lay somewhere handy to these that narrowed it down to two springs the first of which is at the head of a little draw which makes in to the north about four miles west of here just before our line swings north the second is in a draw which makes in to the south of a pond about a mile farther on and somewhat off our trap line we made straight for the first one and found nothing there then we cut across to the second and as soon as we were in the draw we knew that we were on the right track  how interrupted hal eagerly  the smell of woodsmoke replied pat we worked around to the spring mighty careful to keep under cover and make no noise expecting to find the camp right there but there wasnt a thing to be seen then we followed our noses up wind over a little rise and there in the middle of a clump of spruce was the cabin pretty near buried in snow we watched it for a while and then as there was nothing doing we came back and thats the whole of the story  whats the next move upton asked the question with an eagerness he could not conceal  a little daylight surprise party replied pat with a grin  are we in on it demanded the three boys in chorus  that depends replied pat alec and i have been talking it over and if youll agree to obey orders and keep under cover maybe well take you along witnesses may come in handy but youve got to agree to do just as youre told  we will chorused the three joyously  our plan is to surround the cabin before daylight the fact that those fellows havent pulled out already indicates that they are planning to lie low but theyll be up and out early to spy on us weve got to be in hiding before they are up and that means that we must start in half an hour you fellows are to remain in hiding and leave alec and me to handle those chaps and youre not to show yourselves unless we signal you to  how many of them are there asked upton  two we think replied pat the cabin isnt big enough for more now get busy and stow away a good meal because there is no knowing when youll get another  a hasty meal of bacon and cold corn bread with hot chocolate was speedily disposed of and they were ready to start at pats suggestion the boys had put on extra clothing to protect them should they be compelled to remain inactive for some time with the exception of sparrer each carried a rifle in single file alec in the lead and pat in the rear they threaded their way through the forest never will the three city boys forget the uncanny strangeness of that tramp through the moonlit wilderness the silence of the great frozen waste oppressive even in the light of day was doubly so now their errand and the thought of what might happen at the end of their journey combined to stimulate already overexcited imaginations to a point where nothing seemed real they felt as if moving in a dream it was as if by enchantment they had been translated from their commonplace selves into the heroes of one of their favorite books of adventure they had the feeling that at any moment they might return to normal conditions and find it all a figment of the imagination  down the hollow past the trail by which they had entered it alec led the way and out at the western end then for a couple of miles he bore slightly north along the old trappers trail that upton remembered the sheriff had taken in his search for alec the previous fall from this point they bore south and presently came to the edge of a small pond glistening white and spotless in the moonlight at that hour it was seemingly safe to cross but alec was taking no chances and kept to the cover around the edge  at the entrance to the draw of which pat had told them they paused for a whispered conference the boys were cautioned to watch every step and to guard against the slightest sound pat was to place them in hiding to the rear of the camp where they would be out of all possible danger should there be any shooting and he once more impressed upon them the fact that they were scouts under orders and under no circumstances were they to move unless signaled alec would hide near the spring while pat would secrete himself where he could cover the cabindoor  making a detour pat led the boys to a point slightly up the hill and back of the clump of hemlocks in which he said the cabin was hidden upton and sparrer he placed together in a thicket directly to the rear of the camp and hal he stationed a hundred yards to the right then once more charging them to make no sound he left them and vanished as completely as if the ground had opened and swallowed him  the moon still rode high but already the gray of approaching dawn appeared in the east and dulled its silver radiance they had arrived none too soon upton strained his eyes to make out the cabin but in the uncertain shadows it was impossible he found himself actually wondering if pat and alec were not mistaken he found it hard to believe that there could be any other human beings within miles of them it was bitter cold and despite the extra clothing the boys felt the chill of it it seemed to creep into the very marrow of their bones and the excitement which had exhilarated them at the start subsided in direct ratio to their increasing discomfort  the gray in the east crept higher and the moon waxed pale the shadows grew less dense and objects more distinct little by little something took shape down there among the firs at first it was little more than a mound of white but presently upton made out that what he had at first taken to be a little blacker shadow than the rest was nothing less than the smokeblackened top of a short chimney into which he could look from his position on the hill above this gave him a clue to the cabins situation evidently it backed up against the hill and at the rear was almost drifted over with snow in fact the snow was banked to the eaves on both sides the front only having been cleared this was screened from view by a thicket of young firs in such a way that one might pass in front within thirty yards and not see the cabin unless looking especially for it it reminded walter of nothing so much as the cunningly hidden home of a fox  the gray in the east had given way to a touch of rose color when sparrer sniffed softly and silently pointed to the chimney a thin column of smoke was beginning to rise it was evident that the inmates were astir the situation was rapidly approaching a climax muffled sounds from within the cabin reached the boys with hearts thumping painfully the watchers waited presently there was the creak of a door from their position upton and sparrer could not see what hal from his location farther to the right had a clear view of a dark roughly clad man who stooped to pass out of the low doorway but a moment later they saw him as he entered the thicket a pail in one hand he was going to the spring for water  he passed from sight over the little rise that separated the slight hollow where the cabin was located from the deeper hollow where the spring was as he reached the bottom he came into view again they saw him stop abruptly in his tracks as if frozen then drop his pail and half turn as if to run only to stop again and throw his arms above his head then alec appeared his rifle covering the man before him there was evidently a parley of some kind but the distance was too great for the sound of their voices to carry undoubtedly alec had warned the other not to raise his voice with bated breath the boys watched the strange pantomime below it was plain that alec was giving orders to which the other objected for he violently shook his head the former who had partly lowered his rifle raised it again menacingly whereat his captive appeared to capitulate lowering one arm he fumbled at his belt and presently drew forth a wicked looking knife which with evident reluctance he tossed at alecs feet the latter then permitted his victim to lower the other arm and evidently issued an order for the man turned and with alec behind him disappeared in the woods  hes taking him around to where pat is whispered upton that wasnt the fellow that got you was it  sparrer shook his head his eyes were blazing with excitement dat wasnt no injun he whispered dat feller was easy wonder if de other gink will be as easy  once more they settled down to patient waiting the smell of frying bacon mingled with that of woodsmoke and tantalized their nostrils it seemed an age before the door creaked again hal only of the three boys could see the dark face that peered out in the direction of the spring it was the darker for an ugly scowl which contracted the low brows for a long minute the man stared in the direction of the spring and hal could see his lips moving as if he muttered to himself then he vanished inside and the door closed it was not long however before it opened again and once more the scowling face appeared staring toward the spring it was clear that his companions continued absence was beginning to puzzle him taking a step forward he imitated to perfection the hoarse croak of a raven so true to life was it that hal instinctively looked up expecting to see the black bird of ill omen then it flashed over him that this was a signal call to the man who had gone for the water  twice it was repeated the third call was answered from beyond the thicket in front of the cabin hal guessed rightly that it was pat endeavoring to entice the indian for the man at the cabin was sparrers assailant to come out he hoped that by replying he would lead the indian to think that the answer was from the latters partner and that the redman would assume that something important had been discovered to keep his partner so long and would seek to join him to find out what it was if once the indian could be led away from the cabin his capture would be easy  but pats hopes in this respect were doomed to be dashed the instant the indian heard the answering croak from in front of the cabin instead of from the direction of the spring suspicion flashed into his face for a few seconds he stood motionless his beady eyes boring into the thicket before him but pat was well hidden and alec and his prisoner were out of the line of vision pat essayed another croak but it served only to still further arouse the indians suspicions that all was not right  illustration for a few seconds he stood motionless  taking a step forward he darted his keen gaze in all directions at the same time listening intently then abruptly he turned to reënter the cabin  stop hands up or ill shoot pat was taking the one chance open to him if he allowed the man to get back inside the cabin there was no telling when he would show himself again it was clear that he suspected something it was better to take the chance that he would obey orders knowing that some one had the drop on him rather than be obliged to lay siege to the cabin  the indian froze in his tracks both hands up now walk straight back five steps and stop commanded pat  the indian took one step back then in a flash he dove head first through the partly open door throwing himself flat the wily fellow counted on the suddenness of the move and the abrupt change of angle of fire to escape pats rifle cracked followed instantly by the bang of the door he had missed his man he afterward confessed that he had made no real effort to score a hit the idea of taking a fellow beings life was repugnant to him even though the fellow was a wouldbe murderer he had shot because the situation had required it it was necessary that the fellow should know that he had to deal with those who could shoot and were not afraid to  half the battle was won one man was captured and the other driven to cover knowing that the latter would make no attempt to get away for the present and that in any event hal was posted where he could give the alarm should an attempt be made pat and alec turned their attention to their captive his hands were securely bound behind him with a piece of rope which pat had had the foresight to bring and he was then subjected to a grueling examination but sullenly refused to commit himself on any point he was a french canadian of the lower type and alec recognized him as big pierre a notorious character in the lumber camps of the region  there was an ugly glint in his black eyes that boded ill for his captors should he once gain the upper hand of them he refused to admit that he had been robbing the trap lines or that he had even been watching the camp in smugglers hollow only once and that when alex charged him with having a hand in the theft of the black fox did his face betray anything but sullen rage for just a fleeting instant a mingled look of surprise interest cupidity and anger swept across his face pat caught it and signed for alec to cease his questioning then he drew alec to one side out of earshot of their captive  as sure as youre standing here he doesnt know a thing about that fox he whispered hes been doublecrossed by the injun perhaps we can use him to get the redskin out of his hole its worth trying anyway     chapter xviii  smoking out the indian   pat and alec returned to their captive alec acted as spokesman speaking the patois of the canuck or french canadian fluently while the frenchman spoke english but little and that very brokenly alec repeated his previously made charges of theft from the traps and also of illegal poaching in the deer yard to all of which pierre shrugged his shoulders indifferently then speaking slowly that every word might sink in alec charged him with being an accomplice to attempted murder and the theft of the black fox  this roused the frenchman to vehement denial he swore by the name of his patron saint that he knew nothing of the black fox and had had no part in the theft he declared that he didnt even know that a black fox had been seen in the hollow and as for the assault on sparrer he was as innocent as a newborn babe then alec told him the story of the killing of the fox and the murderous attack by the indian concluding by stating his belief that the latter had hidden the skin and intended to desert his companion at the first opportunity and thus avoid having to share his illgotten gains  pierres face grew black with ill suppressed rage not as his captors well knew at the dastardly crime but at the evident intention of his partner to doublecross him alec artfully pointed out the serious situation in which he pierre was if turned over to the officers of the law he would undoubtedly have to face the charge of being accessory to the indians crime he wound up with the suggestion that if pierre would endeavor to help them recover the skin they would in return be content to allow him to get out of the country if he refused they would hold him and turn him over to the authorities  it did not take pierre long to make up his mind he saw clearly that he had nothing to gain by refusing and everything to lose moreover the spirit of revenge was strong within him after a few minutes of hesitation he sullenly agreed to do whatever was required of him  tell him said pat that he is to go out there and demand of that skulking redskin that he come out and surrender tell him to make it clear that the camp is surrounded and the jig is up that were going to get him anyway dead or alive and we dont much care which tell him that he is not to go nearer than ten yards to the cabin that weve got him covered and if he makes any break it will be his last one  alec translated this and pierre nodded then he walked forward through the thicket into the open at alecs command coming to a halt some thirty feet from the cabin door where he hailed the indian in the latters own tongue there was a muffled reply and after some delay the cabin door was opened a crack and a rifle barrel thrust through then followed a heated parley in the indian tongue of which alec understood enough to gather the substance  hes laying it on thick he chuckled says that the sheriff and deputies are here and have got the camp surrounded and that unless he comes out theyll shoot him on sight the injun has passed him the lie hes mockin pierre for being caught by a couple of makebelieve trappersye ken thats you and me patand a lot of infants he says he hasnt got the black fox and disna know anything about it pierre is giving him a beautiful tonguelashing and calling him everything bad this side of purgatory tis a shame ye dinna understand a little of the lingo pat ha the red says hell shoot on sight and is warning pierre to get back before he takes a pot shot at him and by the saints i believe he means it  as a matter of fact at this point they saw the rifle barrel raised pierre abruptly turned and without once looking back rejoined the two men in the thicket he was in a towering rage and spat out french invectives at a rate to defy description he reported the result of his mission stating his opinion that the indian could hold out indefinitely as there was a plentiful supply of grub in the cabin and enough firewood to keep him from freezing for longer than his besiegers would care to stay  will he shoot do you think if we rush the cabin asked pat meditatively  as if in reply the rifle at the cabin door spat fire and a bullet whistled through the thicket so close to pat that instinctively he ducked he had carelessly exposed himself to the view of the outlaw almost instantly alecs rifle replied and a splinter flew from the doorframe  that will teach him that tis no makebelieve shooter out here he growled  the door still remained open a crack evidently to allow the inmate to observe what was going on in front the only vulnerable point of attack there being no windows in the cabin pat worked around to a point where he could put a bullet through this crack by way of warning and his shot was followed by the closing of the door  ut remoinds me said he with a comical grimace as he slipped into the brogue av the first skunk i iver caught twas in a box trap and having got the little baste in the trap i didnt know how in the mischief to get him out  meanwhile the three boys had obediently remained at their posts they had witnessed the parley and the shooting but just what it all meant and what the results were they could only guess they were ashake with excitement and fairly ached with curiosity shortly after the last shot pat joined them and briefly explained what had happened and the present situation  theres only one thing we can do now said he and that is to smoke the old fox out this is where you fellows or one of you anyway will have a chance to take a hand the snow is banked clear to the roof here at the back and it will be no trick at all for one of you to steal down there to the chimney hes got a fire there now but the minute he suspects what is up hell put that out weve got to give him something he cant put out ive got on an old sweater thats about worn out a couple of you can slip around down where we passed those cedars and strip off enough bark and that hanging moss to stuff it out so that you can make a ball of it and stuff it down the chimney with a pole so that it will stick halfway on top of that you can drop some rolls of lighted birch bark and have ready the thickest fir boughs you can find to clap on top of the chimney walt you better tend to putting the stuff down the chimney and mind you work fast and dont lean over it when he finds what is up hes likely to try a pot shot up the chimney in the hope of blowing the stuff out if you have good heavy boughs on top he cant do it alec and i will watch the front to get him when he comes out have plenty of bark and get it going well before you toss the rolls in as long as you dont get over the chimney and keep off the roof there will be no danger the roof is of bark and he may take a chance shot up through it so work from the drift on this end  hal and sparrer went after the moss while upton made a trip over to a clump of birches and stripped off the bark then with his belt axe he cut a number of fir boughs by the time the others returned he had the bark and boughs ready and had prepared a stick with which to push down the mossfilled sweater if he should push this too far it would drop down into the fireplace on the other hand he wanted to get it far enough down so that the flames from the bark would not immediately fire the fir boughs on top breaking through the snowcrust he mixed snow with the moss and also rolled the sweater in snow the boys had brought more moss than was needed for stuffing the sweater and this upton also mixed with snow and placed in a loose mass at the foot of the chimney  when all was ready he had hal and sparrer each light a couple of the birch rolls ready to hand to him as soon as these were going he stuffed the sweater down the chimney pushing it down with the stick as far as he dared then seizing the burning bark rolls he tossed them down on top crammed the loose moss in and clapped the fir boughs over all on top of the latter he tossed some snow meanwhile pat had created a diversion in front of the cabin by shouting threats of what they would do to the redskin if he didnt come out and surrender  upton had worked quickly and was through before the outlaw fully sensed what was up at first he evidently thought that they had merely covered the top of the chimney to smoke him out with his own fire and a hissing sound which came up to them through the chimney proclaimed the quenching of this with water then discovering that the smoke was increasing instead of decreasing he did exactly what pat had foreseenattempted to blow the chimney clear by firing his rifle up it however he only succeeded in setting fire to the sweater from underneath and this because of its nature merely smouldered it was now merely a question of whether the sweater and moss would burn and drop before the smoke in the cabin became too dense for a human being to live in it  birch bark as every boy scout knows is one of the most inflammable of materials it burns like fat and also like fat it throws off a thick smoke this was working up now in little puffs through the fir boughs but the great bulk of it must be pouring into the cabin for upton had taken care in stuffing the sweater down not to wholly block the passage now and then a little tongue of flame licked up through the fir boughs and was promptly extinguished with a handful of snow the snowdamp moss shoved down on top of the bark was adding to the smoke and from the sounds in the cabin it was clear that the occupant was in difficulties  presently sparrer called attention to smoke pouring up at the front end of the cabin the door had been set ajar to let out the smoke almost immediately there was a shot from the thicket where pat was hiding followed by a second shot and then the bang of the door as it was once more shut but it did not remain closed long no human being could long survive in such an atmosphere as now prevailed in the little cabin this time the door was flung wide open and in the midst of the cloud of smoke that poured out the indian staggered forth gasping and choking  pat at once stepped from hiding covering the outlaw with his rifle but for this there was no real need until he should get some pure air into his lungs he was quite helpless he threw himself down in the snow and gasped weakly a sorrier looking spectacle could hardly be imagined his eyes were inflamed bloodred his face and clothing were smeared with soot and ashes one cheek was bleeding from a wound made as it afterward appeared by a splinter torn off from the doorframe by one of pats bullets alec wasted no time in securing the prisoners hands behind him and then deftly searched him for hidden weapons finding nothing but a knife that reminded him of the knife pierre had tossed at his feet when he was captured at the spring and he sent sparrer to get it  as soon as the capture was made the three boys had rushed forward forgetting that they were under orders to remain at their posts until signaled somewhat sternly but with a twinkle in his eyes that belied the severity of his voice pat now reminded them of this and ordered upton back to clear the boughs from the top of the chimney by this time the sweater had burned through and the whole mass had dropped into the fireplace where it continued to burn the smoke rolling out of the open door in a dense cloud with the removal of the boughs from the top of the chimney a draft was reëstablished and the smoke sought its natural outlet it was some time however before the interior of the cabin could be examined with any comfort and pat took advantage of this to quiz the indian  so far as results were obtained he might as well have talked to a wooden post the redskin stolidly refused to answer questions when confronted with sparrer he denied ever having seen him before much to that young mans disgust he steadfastly denied all knowledge of the black fox and refused to admit that he ever had been in smugglers hollow  at last pat gave up in disgust the cabin had sufficiently cleared of smoke by this time to permit of a search being made leaving alec to stand guard over the prisoners pat and the three boys entered and began their investigations two rifles stood inside the door and these pat emptied of cartridges and stood them outside against the end of the cabin then without ceremony he pulled the bedding from the two low bunks and tossed it out on the snow this was followed by everything else the cabin contained until it was stripped bare under the two bunks they found part of the object of their search many cased furs there were marten mink fisher a couple of otter three red fox two lynx and a number of muskrat a pile that altogether represented a tidy sum from a trappers point of view but the black fox was not among them  pat glowered at the prisoners savagely as he noted that some of the skins had been carelessly handled and therefore would not bring what they would had they been properly treated then he resumed his search of the cabin the only thing further in the way of skins were two tightly rolled deerhides freshly taken from the animals one being that of a fawn  do you mind what i told you had happened at the deer yard growled pat as he tossed the skins out of the door  convinced at last that the skin of the black fox was not in the camp they regretfully gave up the search there and emerged from the cabin alec read the disappointment and chagrin in their faces so too did big pierre who had been awaiting the result of their search with illconcealed impatience he had scarcely looked at his partner since the latter had been captured now he turned and spoke rapidly in french to alec  he says explained the latter that if the injun really has got the skin he has hidden it outside somewhere and that if well agree to let him go hell help us hunt for it he says that it is probably in a hollow tree somewhere near but swears that he doesnt know where he thinks that the injun meant to wait until he pierre was away from camp and then get it and light out  i shouldnt wonder if hes right at that exclaimed hal what do you think of the proposition pat  he may be right enough about the injun but i wouldnt trust him the length av me nose pat growled let me talk a bit more to the injun  he strode up in front of the captive and shook a brawny fist beneath his nose weve got you and were going to turn you over to the sheriff unless you come across mighty quick with that skin he thundered then dropping into simple speech that the indian could not misunderstand he continued you kill deer out of season skins prove it he pointed to the bundle of fresh hides you steal much fur big pierre say so if we let him go alec translated and pierre nodded the indian glanced at his late partner and saw the nod a vindictive look swept across his face and left it as expressionless as before  you try to kill white boy he go to court and swear injun go to prison for long time years and years black fox only thing can save injun  the indian appeared to consider the triple indictment but no hint of what was passing in his mind appeared in his face it was as stolid and expressionless as ever at length he spoke  you give injun gun and all his things and let go if he tell something he inquired  well see about it pat growled  no promise injun no tell was the prompt response  it was pats turn to consider finally he made up his mind listen alec said he you tell pierre that well give them their guns but no cartridges that well let them take their personal belongings and as much grub as they can carry and let them go on condition that they will admit having stolen those skins from our traps that they will agree to get out of these parts and never come back and that the indian shows us where the fox is otherwise well take them to camp and hold them prisoners while one of us goes out for the sheriff tell him to tell the injun  alec turned to pierre and spoke rapidly the latter interjected a question now and then and when alec had finished made a brief reply he says alec explained that he agrees though he thinks we ought to let them have some cartridges he admits the stealing of the furs but still protests that he wasnt in on the fox affair and wants to know if well let him go in case the injun refuses to come across  tell him yes replied pat  this alec did and pierre at once turned to the indian and addressed him in his own tongue alec picked up enough to know that pierre was putting the case in its strongest light and dwelling on the length of time in prison likely to follow conviction when he finished the indian turned to pat  you come he said simply and turned toward the woods     chapter xix  sparrer saves the skin   without hesitancy pat followed the indian it was a queer sight the indian leading with his hands bound behind him and pat with his rifle across the hollow of one arm stalking grimly behind him they were soon lost to view and the others settled down to wait and speculate it was almost threequarters of an hour later that they reappeared and it was seen at once that pat carried a black object swinging from one hand as by one impulse the three boys rushed forward to meet them in their haste they quite forgot that they were on snowshoes with the result that sparrer took an inglorious header in the course of which he upset walter and the latter landing on the tail of one of hals shoes sent him sprawling alec roared and even big pierre permitted himself to grin  by the time all three had regained their feet pat and the indian had come up  here you are son see if you can take better care of him this time said pat as he flung the fox at sparrers feet  with a cry of joy sparrer seized the fox and held him up for the admiring gaze of his comrades the animal had not been skinned for which pat and alec were sincerely thankful this important matter and the stretching of the skin they preferred to attend to themselves especially after seeing the careless way in which some of the furs found in the cabin had been handled  where did you find him asked hal as he ran his fingers through the luxuriant fur  in a hollow tree just as pierre guessed replied pat the injun wouldnt answer any questions but it is clear enough that he didnt have time to skin the beast last night and hid it there on his way to camp intending to get it the first chance he had when pierre wasnt around he took good care of it and it is in perfect condition that was some shot of yours son  sparrer flushed with pleasure twant nothin he mumbled anybody could have done it  by this time they had rejoined alec and pierre the latters eyes glittered as he ran them appraisingly over the beautiful black form of the fox then darted a malevolent glance in the direction of his partner  what will that skin bring alec asked pat  the trapper was studying the fox with the critical stare of the expert i dinna ken pat he replied slowly tis a big beastie and by all odds the finest fur i ever put my eyes on it will bring 1500 anyway and maybe 2000 i never thought to lay my hands on the likes of it he turned and looked at sparrer with an expression almost of awe tell me laddie what is the charm ye carry said he  sparrer laughed oi didnt even have a rabbits foot he confessed sure an it was just the luck av the oirish  right me son hurray for the irish cried pat then with an abrupt change he once more became the leader alec go through the clothes of our misguided friends and see that they have no cartridges in their pockets this alec did despite the protests of big pierre when he was sure that he had secured all of these thus rendering the guns useless he set both prisoners free at pats order and they were commanded to pack up their stuff and get ready to hit the trail this they did sullenly enough for they felt that they were under guard as indeed they were their packs were soon ready for besides their blankets a few cooking utensils and grub they had little enough the latter included part of the illgotten deer meat  when they were about ready to start big pierre made one last plea for cartridges at least for himself but pat was obdurate and told them that they were lucky to be allowed to take their guns when all was ready for the trail their knives were returned to them and the frenchmans axe was given him the indians axe pat retained  ye may loike ut as a bit av a souvenir av the lump on yer head he murmured in an aside to sparrer though his real reason was that he feared what might happen should the two outlaws be equally armed when it came to the quarrel which he felt sure was brewing between them  they were given a final warning to get wholly out of the country and never show their faces there again on pain of having the charges of poaching and theft brought against them the big frenchman was manifestly glad enough to get off so lightly but there was an ugly gleam in the black eyes of his companion sparrer had laid the fox on the snow and drawn a few steps away from it the better to watch proceedings as the outlaws started to hit the trail to the north the redskin in the lead the latter suddenly sprang toward the fox at the same instant snatching his knife from his belt  sudden as was his move sparrer was too quick for him he thrust forward a foot that tripped the indian and sent him sprawling sparrer also being upset before the indian could regain his feet big pierre was on him sending his big fist crashing full into the swarthy face then wrenching the knife from his grasp pierre flung it far into the brush and once more raised his fist by this time pat and alec had joined the mêlée and were dragging the infuriated frenchman from his victim all the time pierre poured out a stream of invective which only the indian and alec could understand the latter explained later that he was charging his companion with trying to put them both in prison after they had been fortunate enough to win their freedom believing and rightly that if the indian had succeeded in slashing the skin as he had intended they would have been held and turned over to the proper authorities  dat puts me even wid him shrilled sparrer triumphantly as he mounted guard over the fox and the indian with a bruised and battered face regained his feet and once more hit the trail big pierre at his heels heaping abuse upon him as they disappeared in the brush pat dropped the butt of his rifle to the snow  thats the end of that precious pair so far as we are concerned said he with a sigh of relief pierre is wise enough to know that this isnt a healthy country for them and they wont bother us any more hes got the indian where the hair is short now for the latter hasnt even a knife and i guess its just as well now well finish our job here and get back to camp you fellows rustle up some birch bark and dry wood and heap it up inside the cabin  what for demanded hal looking blank  to fumigate after the prisence av a skunk retorted pat whimsically  by means of the belt axes of the boys supplemented by the indians axe in the hands of alec a pile of inflammable stuff was soon collected and heaped up inside the cabin then pat touched a match to the pile and soon the whole interior was a roaring furnace the bark roof quickly burned through and fell with a great hissing of the snow which it carried down with it sending the sparks and embers skyward in a golden cloud satisfied that the destruction of the camp would be sufficient to render it uninhabitable pat ordered all hands to make ready for the return to their own camp and they were soon on the trail the fire was left to burn itself out as no harm could come from it owing to the snowcovered surroundings  hal still puzzled over the burning of the cabin i should think you would have wanted to keep it pat he ventured at length it might have come in handy some time  twas too handy altogether as it was retorted pat when youve dug a fox out fill up his den and with this cryptic reply hal was forced to be content  sparrer having no rifle insisted on carrying the fox an honor granted him with one accord very different was their entrance into smugglers hollow from their departure in the small hours of that same day and there was much jesting and hilarity for their buoyant spirits had rebounded wonderfully now that the load of anxiety and dread had been lifted pat and alec each carried a bundle of furs sufficient in themselves to raise their spirits to a high plane for these added to those they already had assured the financial success of their partnership  as they came in sight of their cabin upton called attention to a thin vapor of smoke rising from the chimney  somebody there as sure as im alive and kicking exclaimed pat now i wonder who is paying us a visit this time  as if in answer the door opened and a big burly form stepped forth  jim oh you jim yelled upton delightedly  the big guide and lumber boss for it was he turned in their direction his weathertanned face lighting with real pleasure then as they drew nearer a comical look of wonder and perplexity crossed it he stepped back to the door and apparently spoke to some one inside for a second later another strapping big man stepped out  hello exclaimed pat thats bill marshman the game warden and deputy sheriff who was looking for alec last fall and scared away the bear the day we left plympton to take care of camp its lucky for those two chaps back there nodding in the direction from which they had come that bill didnt get here a day sooner they wouldnt have got off so easy  by this time the party had approached within easy talking distance of the men at the cabin who were staring at them in dumb amazement pat chuckled  hello jim hello bill he called mighty glad to see you sorry you didnt get here sooner so as to join our little expedition  say drawled the warden is this a war party returning from a raid  youve guessed it declared pat dropping his load and shaking hands warmly with the two men in the absence av the constitooted authority he poked his fist into the ribs of the warden by way of emphasizing the point we have been upholding the majesty av the law and the rights av freeborn american citizens and yez have just missed putting the bracelets on as ugly a pair av villains as iver stole the furs av honest men  a light broke over the sheriffs face big pierre and his injun partner he exclaimed i was tipped off that they were somewhere about here and thats what brought me in where are they now  hitting the trail for parts unknown replied pat well tell you about it later meanwhile here are some friends of mine you ought to know and keep an eye on bill theyll bear watching  he then introduced the three boys sparrer still clung to his prize and as he came forward to shake hands jim and the warden sensed for the first time what it was he was carrying  by gum exclaimed jim i believe thats the very fellow i was telling you about bill saw him the last time i was over here did you trap him pat or is he part of the spoils of war  wrong both ways jim replied pat he was the cause of this little expedition come on in and while we are rustling up some grub well tell you the yarn  jim and the warden listened with growing interest and appreciation while pat unfolded the story when it ended the warden gravely arose and walked over to sparrer shake hands over again son said he to the boys great confusion if i had had to sit still and watch a fortune trot around the way you did i sure would have been so plumb shaky that id have missed the shot when the time came what are you going to do with him now that youve got him  thus did the warden bring to a head a question that had been troubling the boy ever since the fox was recovered he aint mine he gulped oi lost him and wouldnt never seen him again if it hadnt been fer dem he nodded in the direction of pat and alec hes theirs an dey aint no use talkin about it sparrer set his lips firmly  in an instant pat and alec were on their feet protesting that such talk was foolishness and that the prize belonged to sparrer and no one else but the boy shook his head stubbornly  seems to me drawled the warden when he could make himself heard that this here is a case for a disinterested party to decide now if you was to ask me i should say that an even split fiftyfifty is the fair thing this here young tenderfoot comes up here with horseshoes or rabbitsfeet or some other luck charms hung all over him and without no help from any one bags a fortune which he finds running around loose right up to that point its hisn and nobody else aint got no claim on it then he loses it and aint got no more chance of gettin it back himself than a bull moose has of growing a long tail up steps pat and alec and friendly like does for him what he cant do for himself an gets the prize back now it seems to me that half ought to go to this here young feller fer gettin it in the first place and half to the other two fer gettin it back after it was lost what do you say jim  the only fair thing declared jim judicially theres enough in it to give em all a comftable bit  a warm discussion followed in which hal and upton sided with the warden and jim and it ended only when sparrer at last agreed to a threeway split from this stand no amount of argument could move him he would take a third share if pat and alec would each take a third otherwise he wouldnt take any and so it was finally agreed  the skinning and stretching of the hide was left to alec who was a past master in the art while he was thus engaged the warden mysteriously beckoned pat to one side  pat whose are these he asked gravely drawing a bunch of traps from under a bunk  pat reached for them and examined them curiously mine that is mine and alecs those are our marks he replied pointing to certain file marks on them where did you get them he added wonderingly  where i got this fellow replied the warden reaching under the bunk and drawing out the body of a beaver i know you better than to think you had a hand in this pat he continued buthe hesitated and then continued hurriedly i thought perhaps your partner has been doin a little poachin unbeknown to you you know he didnt have the best name ever was when he first came into these parts  a great light broke over pats face alec dont know anything more about this than i do he declared there isnt a straighter man in the woods than alec is now and you just want to make up your mind to that right now bill thats the work of that thievin injun you mind what i told you about sparrers findin those traps at the beaverpond well its as plain as the nose on your face that injun lifted some of our traps and set them there he knew that if you came snoopin round and found em the marks on em would point to us those skunks didnt have any traps anyway thinkin about that fox id clean forgotten about the beaver poor little chap pat stroked the body of the beaver  alec was now called in and his look of blank astonishment when he saw the traps and the dead animal was all that was needed to convince the warden that pat was right in his surmise  that evening jim explained his visit by stating that he had all along planned to get over to the hollow before the boys left when the warden dropped into his camp early that morning and stated his intention of going on to the hollow jim decided that he would accompany him  how are you boys going back he asked  the same way we came in i suppose replied upton  whats the matter with putting in a day with me and seeing how a logging camp is run then ill send you out to the railroad on a lumber wagon suggested the big lumber boss  the idea appealed to the boys and it was finally agreed that they would accompany him to his camp the next day it would give them a new experience for which they were eager and at the same time eliminate the long hike back to lower chain so not without sincere regret it must be admitted they got their duffle together preparatory to an early start the next morning for the fifteen mile hike to jims headquarters they turned in early for now that the excitement was over they felt the reaction from the long strain they had been under and the loss of sleep the night before jim and the warden bunked on the floor and the cabin in smugglers hollow was soon wrapped in silence save for the gentle breathing of the sleepers so ended a red letter day for at least three of the occupants     chapter xx  the black fox is sold   the day in the lumber camp was all too short for all of the boys but especially for sparrer to whom the cutting of the great trees and the hauling of the logs and piling of them on the rollways on the banks of the river ready for breaking out on the high water of the spring was of absorbing interest hal and upton were familiar with logging operations having visited logging camps many times during their summers in the woods the only novelty to them lay in the changed setting of the scenes produced by the snow  sparrer was of just the type to win immediate favor with the rough bighearted lumberjacks and they made him feel at home at once they vied with one another in showing him things of interest and his comments colored with the slang of the city streets afforded them no end of amusement so it was with regret on all sides that at break of the following day the boys put their duffle on the big sled used for hauling in supplies and followed it themselves pat went with them to see them off at the train  with the last glimpse of the lumber camp as the sled entered the forest a silence broken only by the tinkle of the bell on one of the horses the muffled sound of their feet and the slithering slide of the broad runners over the snow fell on the little group none felt in the mood for talking save the driver and he soon subsided failing to elicit more than monosyllabic responses pat was busy with thoughts of what his share from the sale of the black fox skin would mean to him in the furtherance of his ambitions for an education but on his three guests the unfathomable mystery of the wilderness had once more fallen and wrapped them in its spell it was the deeper for the knowledge that they were so soon to break it with no certainty of when they might again surrender their spirits to it they were going back to another world  oddly enough it was sparrer who finally voiced the feeling of which both upton and hal were conscious yet found no words to express  it makes a feller feel little said he like he aint nothin at all and yet dat inside av him is somethin biggern this he swung one hand around in an all inclusive sweep an it makes him feel clean inside just like it is outside an like hed got to do big things an little mean things hadnt got no place anansparrer was groping for words to make his meaning clearit gives a feller a funny feelin dat he aint much and yet dat some way hes biggern de mountns an if dey is a million years old like people say hes goin ter last a lot longer bein out here makes me feel just like oi do when oi go into de church an de sun comes trew dem colored winders and de organ plays an lifts a feller right up til he feels like he had wings an could fly if he only knew how ter use em  sparrer stopped abruptly and gazed with unseeing eyes off through the forest aisles pat looked over at the youngster with the light of understanding in his eyes  right son said he i know the feeling this is the great cathedral that god has built for himself and the littleness we feel is because of his own presence and the sense of being greater than all this the mountains the lakes and the rivers is i reckon because he makes us feel that if he made all these things to last through millions of years he isnt going to let his greatest work man perish in the little bit of time that makes a mans lifetime  the bell on the horse tinkled the runners slithered over the snow and no further word was spoken until the driver cried yonders the clearin i reckon you fellers hev got just about time enough to look the town over before the train comes  an hour later farewells were said and the three boys stood on the rear platform of the pullman waving to pat as the train pulled out for some time after the straight form of the brawny young trapper and the dingy depot of the little village had faded from view the boys stood watching the panorama of frozen wilderness then reluctantly it must be confessed they turned to the warmth and luxury of the car  say hasnt it been great exclaimed hal as he dropped into his seat  great doesnt express it at all declared upton it beats even the hunt for lost trail  as for sparrer he said nothing at all but glued his face to the window that he might drink in as long as he could the beauty of this land of enchantment where the test of a man was his ability to contend successfully with the forces of nature and to live within the law when beyond the watchful eyes of the law this land where a man was gauged by his moral strength no less than by his physical strength these two weeks in the heart of the wilderness had wrought a change in the lads whole attitude toward life his inherent love of battle for battles sake had been given a new turn his old ambitions to be a soldier or a prizefighter were forgotten in a new ambitionto be a woodsman to pit his strength and courage and skill against the elemental forces of nature instead of against his fellows in short sparrer had resolved that some day he would shake the dust of the city from his feet forever he would become a guide and lumber boss like big jim and so he watched the flying landscape and dreamed dreams and they were wholesome  it had been agreed that pat and alec should attend to the marketing of the fox skin sparrers share to be forwarded to him when the sale was made the day after they reached new york the operator at upper chain received a message over which he puzzled long it was addressed to pat malone and was as follows  wire best price you can get for skin but do not sell until you hear from me hal  it was two weeks before pats reply was received hal was back at school but mr harrison opened the message and smiled as he read it it was brief and to the point  two thousand dollars whats up pat  mr harrison rang for his private secretary take this message and get it off at once he said crisply pat malone upper chain will give twentyfour hundred dollars for skin ship at once by express my check by next mail  then he dictated a letter to hal telling him of the success of their conspiracy for the two had hatched the plan together hals description of the events in smugglers hollow had so delighted mr harrison that he had at once exclaimed weve got to have that skin my boy as a piece of fur it is worth as much to me as it is to any one else for sentimental reasons it is worth more to me than it is to any one else i dont believe in mixing sentiment with business my boy but there are exceptions to all rules this is one besides i owe that young irishman up there in the woods more than money can repay for what he has done in helping to make you what you are today you have him wire the best price he can get and ill go it one better and by the way you might suggest to that youngster who shot the beast that when he gets his share of the money ill be glad to invest it for him where it will earn more than it will in a bank  and this is how it happened that pat alec and sparrer with eight hundred dollars apiece experienced for the first time that sense of independence and power which comes with the possession of wealth for not even mr harrison with his millions felt richer than they to alec it meant the realization of a cherished dream which included the ownership of a certain tiny farm to pat it meant the education he had set his heart upon while to sparrer it meant a better home a lifting of some of the load from his mothers shoulders and a further stimulating of an already awakened ambition to gain for himself a share in the higher and better things of life  of course when the story was told to the blue tortoise patrol sparrer was more popular than ever he was little short of a hero in the eyes of his companions the more so because upton was at pains to point out that the boys good fortune was really due to his adherence to the scout principles which he had embraced and to the moral victory which he had gained through loyalty to the scout oath in the face of the hardest kind of temptationthe temptation when there is none to see either victory or defeat  a few weeks later the damage suit growing out of the automobile accident in bronx park was tried and the blue tortoises were called as witnesses once more sparrer distinguished himself unhesitatingly picking out from a group of men the one whose face he had seen for just a fleeting moment in the big car racing away from the scene of the accident so positive was his identification that the defense which was based on the claim that the car had been taken without the owners knowledge crumbled then and there for the man who sparrer identified was none other than the owner himself  as for upton he returned to his studies with renewed vim and determination which in due time brought its rewardthe scholarship on which he had set his heart      on my honor i will do my best     to do my duty to god and my country and to obey the scout law     to help other people at all times     to keep myself physically strong mentally awake and morally        straight  well might the men of today as well as the men of tomorrow subscribe to this oath of the boy scouts of america whether their lot in life be cast in the turmoil of the great city or the loneliness of a trappers camp     the stories in this series are       the boy scouts of woodcraft camp     the boy scouts on swift river     the boy scouts on lost trail     the boy scouts in a trappers camp
