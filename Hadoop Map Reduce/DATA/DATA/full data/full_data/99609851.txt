99609851	the doliver romance and other pieces                           tales and sketches                         by nathaniel hawthorne                            an old womans tale    in the house where i was born there used to be an old woman crouching all day long over the kitchen fire with her elbows on her knees and her feet in the ashes  once in a while she took a turn at the spit and she never lacked a coarse gray stocking in her lap the foot about half finished it tapered away with her own waning life and she knit the toestitch on the day of her death  she made it her serious business and sole amusement to tell me stories at any time from morning till night in a mumbling toothless voice as i sat on a log of wood grasping her cheekapron in both my hands  her personal memory included the better part of a hundred years and she had strangely jumbled her own experience and observation with those of many old people who died in her young days so that she might have been taken for a contemporary of queen elizabeth or of john rogers in the primer  there are a thousand of her traditions lurking in the corners and byplaces of my mind some more marvellous than what is to follow some less so and a few not marvellous in the least all of which i should like to repeat if i were as happy as she in having a listener  but i am humble enough to own that i do not deserve a listener half so well as that old toothless woman whose narratives possessed an excellence attributable neither to herself nor to any single individual  her groundplots seldom within the widest scope of probability were filled up with homely and natural incidents the gradual accretions of a long course of years and fiction hid its grotesque extravagance in this garb of truth like the devil an appropriate simile for the old woman supplies it disguising himself clovenfoot and all in mortal attire  these tales generally referred to her birthplace a village in the valley of the connecticut the aspect of which she impressed with great vividness on my fancy  the houses in that tract of country long a wild and dangerous frontier were rendered defensible by a strength of architecture that has preserved many of them till our own times and i cannot describe the sort of pleasure with which two summers since i rode through the little town in question while one object after another rose familiarly to my eye like successive portions of a dream becoming realized  among other things equally probable she was wont to assert that all the inhabitants of this village at certain intervals but whether of twentyfive or fifty years or a whole century remained a disputable point were subject to a simultaneous slumber continuing one hours space  when that mysterious time arrived the parson snored over his halfwritten sermon though it were saturday night and no provision made for the morrowthe mothers eyelids closed as she bent over her infant and no childish cry awakenedthe watcher at the bed of mortal sickness slumbered upon the deathpillow and the dying man anticipated his sleep of ages by one as deep and dreamless  to speak emphatically there was a soporific influence throughout the village stronger than if every mothers son and daughter were reading a dull story notwithstanding which the old woman professed to hold the substance of the ensuing account from one of those principally concerned in it  one moonlight summer evening a young man and a girl sat down together in the open air  they were distant relatives sprung from a stock once wealthy but of late years so povertystricken that david had not a penny to pay the marriage fee if esther should consent to wed  the seat they had chosen was in an open grove of elm and walnut trees at a right angle of the road a spring of diamond water just bubbled into the moonlight beside them and then whimpered away through the bushes and long grass in search of a neighboring millstream  the nearest house situate within twenty yards of them and the residence of their greatgrandfather in his lifetime was a venerable old edifice crowned with many high and narrow peaks all overrun by innumerable creeping plants which hung curling about the roof like a nice young wig on an elderly gentlemans head  opposite to this establishment was a tavern with a well and horsetrough before it and a low green bank running along the left side of the door  thence the road went onward curving scarce perceptibly through the village divided in the midst by a narrow lane of verdure and bounded on each side by a grassy strip of twice its own breadth  the houses had generally an odd look  here the moonlight tried to get a glimpse of one a rough old heap of ponderous timber which ashamed of its dilapidated aspect was hiding behind a great thick tree the lower story of the next had sunk almost under ground as if the poor little house were aweary of the world and retiring into the seclusion of its own cellar farther on stood one of the few recent structures thrusting its painted face conspicuously into the street with an evident idea that it was the fairest thing there  about midway in the village was a gristmill partly concealed by the descent of the ground towards the stream which turned its wheel  at the southern extremity just so far distant that the windowpaces dazzled into each other rose the meetinghouse a dingy old barnlike building with an enormously disproportioned steeple sticking up straight into heaven as high as the tower of babel and the cause of nearly as much confusion in its day  this steeple it must be understood was an afterthought and its addition to the main edifice when the latter had already begun to decay had excited a vehement quarrel and almost a schism in the church some fifty years before  here the road wound down a hill and was seen no more the remotest object in view being the graveyard gate beyond the meetinghouse  the youthful pair sat hand in hand beneath the trees and for several moments they had not spoken because the breeze was hushed the brook scarce tinkled the leaves had ceased their rustling and everything lay motionless and silent as if nature were composing herself to slumber  what a beautiful night it is esther remarked david somewhat drowsily  very beautiful answered the girl in the same tone  but how still continued david  ah too still  said esther with a faint shudder like a modest leaf when the wind kisses it  perhaps they fell asleep together and united as their spirits were by close and tender sympathies the same strange dream might have wrapped them in its shadowy arms  but they conceived at the time that they still remained wakeful by the spring of bubbling water looking down through the village and all along the moonlighted road and at the queer old houses and at the trees which thrust their great twisted branches almost into the windows  there was only a sort of mistiness over their minds like the smoky air of an early autumn night  at length without any vivid astonishment they became conscious that a great many people were either entering the village or already in the street but whether they came from the meetinghouse or from a little beyond it or where the devil they came from was more than could be determined  certainly a crowd of people seemed to be there men women and children all of whom were yawning and rubbing their eyes stretching their limbs and staggering from side to side of the road as if but partially awakened from a sound slumber  sometimes they stood stockstill with their hands over their brows to shade their sight from the moonbeams  as they drew near most of their countenances appeared familiar to esther and david possessing the peculiar features of families in the village and that general air and aspect by which a person would recognize his own townsmen in the remotest ends of the earth  but though the whole multitude might have been taken in the mass for neighbors and acquaintances there was not a single individual whose exact likeness they had ever before seen  it was a noticeable circumstance also that the newest fashioned garment on the backs of these people might have been worn by the greatgrandparents of the existing generation  there was one figure behind all the rest and not yet near enough to be perfectly distinguished  where on earth david do all these odd people come from said esther with a lazy inclination to laugh  nowhere on earth esther replied david unknowing why he said so  as they spoke the strangers showed some symptoms of disquietude and looked towards the fountain for an instant but immediately appeared to assume their own trains of thought and previous purposes  they now separated to different parts of the village with a readiness that implied intimate local knowledge and it may be worthy of remark that though they were evidently loquacious among themselves neither their footsteps nor their voices reached the ears of the beholders  wherever there was a venerable old house of fifty years standing and upwards surrounded by its elm or walnut trees with its dark and weatherbeaten barn its well its orchard and stonewalls all ancient and all in good repair around it there a little group of these people assembled  such parties were mostly composed of an aged man and woman with the younger members of a family their faces were full of joy so deep that it assumed the shade of melancholy they pointed to each other the minutest objects about the homesteads things in their hearts and were now comparing them with the originals  but where hollow places by the wayside grassgrown and uneven with unsightly chimneys rising ruinous in the midst gave indications of a fallen dwelling and of hearths long cold there did a few of the strangers sit them down on the mouldering beams and on the yellow moss that had overspread the doorstone  the men folded their arms sad and speechless the women wrung their hands with a more vivid expression of grief and the little children tottered to their knees shrinking away from the open grave of domestic love and wherever a recent edifice reared its white and flashy front on the foundation of an old one there a grayhaired man might be seen to shake his staff in anger at it while his aged dame and their offspring appeared to join in their maledictions forming a fearful picture in the ghostly moon light  while these scenes were passing the one figure in the rear of all the rest was descending the hollow towards the mill and the eyes of david and esther were drawn thence to a pair with whom they could fully sympathize  it was a youth in a sailors dress and a pale slender maiden who met each other with a sweet embrace in the middle of the street  how long it must be since they parted observed david  fifty years at least said esther  they continued to gaze with unwondering calmness and quiet interest as the dream if such it were unrolled its quaint and motley semblance before them and their notice was now attracted by several little knots of people apparently engaged in conversation  of these one of the earliest collected and most characteristic was near the tavern the persons who composed it being seated on the low green bank along the left side of the door  a conspicuous figure here was a fine corpulent old fellow in his shirtsleeves and flamecolored breeches and with a stained white apron over his paunch beneath which he held his hands and wherewith at times be wiped his ruddy face  the stately decrepitude of one of his companions the scar of an indian tomahawk on his crown and especially his worn buff coat were appropriate marks of a veteran belonging to an old provincial garrison now deaf to the rollcall another showed his rough face under a tarry hat and wore a pair of wide trousers like an ancient mariner who bad tossed away his youth upon the sea and was returned hoary and weatherbeaten to his inland home there was also a thin young man carelessly dressed who ever and anon cast a sad look towards the pale maiden above mentioned  with these there sat a hunter and one or two others and they were soon joined by a miller who came upward from the dusty mill his coat as white as if besprinkled with powdered starlight  all these by the aid of jests which might indeed be old but had not been recently repeated waxed very merry and it was rather strange that just as their sides shook with the heartiest laughter they appeared greatly like a group of shadows flickering in the moonshine  four personages very different from these stood in front of the large house with its periwig of creeping plants  one was a little elderly figure distinguished by the gold on his threecornered bat and skyblue coat and by the seal of arms annexed to his great gold watchchain his air and aspect befitted a justice of peace and county major and all earths pride and pomposity were squeezed into this small gentleman of five feet high  the next in importance was a grave person of sixty or seventy years whose black suit and hand sufficiently indicated his character and the polished baldness of whose head was worthy of a famous preacher in the village half a century before who had made wigs a subject of pulpit denunciation  the two other figures both clad in dark gray showed the sobriety of deacons one was ridiculously tall and thin like a man of ordinary bulk infinitely produced as the mathematicians say while the brevity and thickness of his colleague seemed a compression of the same man  these four talked with great earnestness and their gestures intimated that they had revived the ancient dispute about the meetinghouse steeple  the grave person in black spoke with composed solemnity as if he were addressing a synod the short deacon grunted out occasional sentences as brief as himself his tall brother drew the long thread of his argument through the whole discussion and reasoning from analogy his voice must indubitably have been small and squeaking but the little old man in goldlace was evidently scorched by his own redhot eloquence he bounced from one to another shook his cane at the steeple at the two deacons and almost in the parsons face stamping with his foot fiercely enough to break a hole through the very earth though indeed it could not exactly be said that the green grass bent beneath him  the figure noticed as coming behind all the rest had now surmounted the ascent from the mill and proved to be an elderly lady with something in her hand  why does she walk so slow asked david  dont you see she is lame said esther  this gentlewoman whose infirmity had kept her so far in the rear of the crowd now came hobbling on glided unobserved by the polemic group and paused on the left brink of the fountain within a few feet of the two spectators  she was a magnificent old dame as ever mortal eye beheld her spangled shoes and goldclocked stockings shone gloriously within the spacious circle of a red hooppetticoat which swelled to the very point of explosion and was bedecked all over with embroidery a little tarnished  above the petticoat and parting in front so as to display it to the best advantage was a figured blue damask gown  a wide and stiff ruff encircled her neck a cap of the finest muslin though rather dingy covered her head and her nose was bestridden by a pair of goldbowed spectacles with enormous glasses  but the old ladys face was pinched sharp and sallow wearing a niggardly and avaricious expression and forming an odd contrast to the splendor of her attire as did likewise the implement which she held in her hand  it was a sort of iron shovel by housewives termed a slice such as is used in clearing the oven and with this selecting a spot between a walnuttree and the fountain the good dame made an earnest attempt to dig  the tender sods however possessed a strange impenetrability  they resisted her efforts like a quarry of living granite and losing her breath she cast down the shovel and seemed to bemoan herself most piteously gnashing her teeth what few she had and wringing her thin yellow hands  then apparently with new hope she resumed her toil which still had the same resulta circumstance the less surprising to david and esther because at times they would catch the moonlight shining through the old woman and dancing in the fountain beyond  the little man in goldlace now happened to see her and made his approach on tiptoe  how hard this elderly lady works remarked david  go and help her david said esther compassionately  as their drowsy void spoke both the old woman and the pompous little figure behind her lifted their eyes and for a moment they regarded the youth and damsel with something like kindness and affection which however were dim and uncertain and passed away almost immediately the old woman again betook herself to the shovel but was startled by a hand suddenly laid upon her shoulder she turned round in great trepidation and beheld the dignitary in the blue coat then followed an embrace of such closeness as would indicate no remoter connection than matrimony between these two decorous persons  the gentleman next pointed to the shovel appearing to inquire the purpose of his ladys occupation while she as evidently parried his interrogatories maintaining a demure and sanctified visage as every good woman ought in similar cases  howbeit she could not forbear looking askew behind her spectacles towards the spot of stubborn turf  all the while their figures had a strangeness in them and it seemed as if some cunning jeweller had made their golden ornaments of the yellowest of the setting sunbeams and that the blue of their garments was brought from the dark sky near the moon and that the gentlemans silk waistcoat was the bright side of a fiery cloud and the ladys scarlet petticoat a remnant of the blush of morningand that they both were two unrealities of colored air  but now there was a sudden movement throughout the multitude  the squire drew forth a watch as large as the dial on the famous steeple looked at the warning hands and got him gone nor could his lady tarry the party at the tavern door took to their heels headed by the fat man in the flaming breeches the tall deacon stalked away immediately and the short deacon waddled after making four steps to the yard the mothers called their children about them and set forth with a gentle and sad glance behind  like cloudy fantasies that hurry by a viewless impulse from the sky they all were fled and the wind rose up and followed them with a strange moaning down the lonely street now whither these people went is more than may be told only david and esther seemed to see the shadowy splendor of the ancient dame as she lingered in the moonshine at the graveyard gate gazing backward to the fountain  o esther  i have had such a dream cried david starting up and rubbing his eyes  and i such another answered esther gaping till her pretty red lips formed a circle  about an old woman with goldbowed spectacles continued david  and a scarlet hooppetticoat added esther  they now stared in each others eyes with great astonishment and some little fear  after a thoughtful moment or two david drew a long breath and stood upright  if i live till tomorrow morning said he ill see what may be buried between that tree and the spring of water  and why not tonight david asked esther for she was a sensible little girl and bethought herself that the matter might as well be done in secrecy  david felt the propriety of the remark and looked round for the means of following her advice  the moon shone brightly on something that rested against the side of the old house and on a nearer view it proved to be an iron shovel bearing a singular resemblance to that which they had seen in their dreams  he used it with better success than the old woman the soil giving way so freely to his efforts that he had soon scooped a hole as large as the basin of the spring  suddenly he poked his head down to the very bottom of this cavity  ohowhat have we here cried david
