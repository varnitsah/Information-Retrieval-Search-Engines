35882913	the golden dream by rm ballantyne    robert michael ballantyne was born in 1825 and died in 1894  he was educated at the edinburgh academy and in 1841 he became a clerk with the hudson bay company working at the red river settlement in northen canada until 1847 arriving back in edinburgh in 1848  the letters he had written home were very amusing in their description of backwoods life and his family publishing connections suggested that he should construct a book based on these letters  three of his most enduring books were written over the next decade the young fur traders ungava the hudson bay company and were based on his experiences with the hbc  in this period he also wrote the coral island and martin rattler both of these taking place in places never visited by ballantyne  having been chided for small mistakes he made in these books he resolved always to visit the places he wrote about  with these books he became known as a great master of literature intended for teenagers  he researched the cornish mines the london fire brigade the postal service the railways the laying down of submarine telegraph cables the construction of lighthouses the lightship service the lifeboat service south africa norway the north sea fishing fleet ballooning deepsea diving algiers and many more experiencing the lives of the men and women in these settings by living with them for weeks and months at a time and he lived as they lived  he was a very truetolife author depicting the often squalid scenes he encountered with great care and attention to detail  his young readers looked forward eagerly to his next books and through the 1860s and 1870s there was a flow of books from his pen sometimes four in a year all very good reading  the rate of production diminished in the last ten or fifteen years of his life but the quality never failed  he published over ninety books under his own name and a few books for very young children under the pseudonym comus  for todays taste his books are perhaps a little too religious and what we would nowadays call pi  in part that was the way people wrote in those days but more important was the fact that in his days at the red river settlement in the wilds of canada he had been a little dissolute and he did not want his young readers to be unmindful of how they ought to behave as he felt he had been  some of his books were quite short little over 100 pages  these books formed a series intended for the children of poorer parents having less pocketmoney  these books are particularly wellwritten and researched because he wanted that readership to get the very best possible for their money  they were published as six series three books in each series  recreated as an etext by nick hodson august 2003    the golden dream by rm ballantyne    chapter one  adventures in the far west  the cause of the whole affair  ned sinton gazed at the scene before him with indescribable amazement he had often witnessed strange things in the course of his short though chequered life but he had never seen anything like this  many a dream of the most extravagant nature had surrounded his pillow with creatures of curious form and scenes of magic beauty but never before either by actual observation or in nightly vision had ned sinton beheld a scene so wonderful as that which now lay spread out before him  ned stood in the centre of a cavern of vast dimensionsso vast and so full of intense light that instead of looking on it as a huge cave he felt disposed to regard it as a small world  the sides of this cavern were made of pure gold and the rooffar above his headwas spangled all over with glittering points like a starry sky  the ground too and in short everything within the cave was made of the same precious metal  thousands of stalactites hung from the roof like golden icicles millions of delicate threads of the same material also depended from the starspangled vault each thread having a golden ball at the end of it which strange to say was transparent and permitted a bright flame within to shine through and shed a yellow lustre over surrounding objects  all the edges and angles and points of the irregularlyformed walls were of burnished gold which reflected the rays of these pendant lamps with dazzling brilliancy while the broad masses of the frosted walls shone with a subdued light  magnificent curtains of golden filigree fell in rich voluminous folds on the pavement half concealing several archways which led into smaller caverns similar to the large one  altogether it was a scene of luxurious richness and splendour that is utterly indescribable  but the thing that amazed ned sinton most was that the company of welldressed ladies and gentlemen who moved about in these splendid halls and ate golden ices or listened to the exquisite strains of music that floated on the atmosphere were all as yellow as guineas ned could by no means understand this  in order to convince himself that there was no deception in the matter he shook hands with several of the people nearest to him and found that they were cold and hard as iron although to all appearance they were soft and pliable and could evidently move about with perfect freedom  ned was very much puzzled indeed  one would have thought he must have believed himself to be dreaming  not a bit of it  he knew perfectly well that he was wideawake  in fact a doubt upon that point never crossed his mind for a moment  at length he resolved to ask the meaning of it all and observing a stout old gentleman with a bland smile on his yellow countenance in the act of taking a pinch of golden snuff from a gold snuffbox he advanced and accosted him  pray sir began ned modestly may i take the liberty of asking you what is the meaning of all this  all what sir inquired the old gentleman in a deep metallic voice  this golden cave with its wonderful lamps and especially these golden people andexcuse me sir for remarking on the circumstanceyou seem to be made of gold yourself  i have often heard the term applied to extremely rich persons but i really never expected to see a man who was literally worth his weight in gold  the old gentleman laughed sarcastically at this sally and took an enormous pinch of golddust  as he did not seem inclined to be communicative however ned said again what is the meaning of it all can you explain what has done it  smiling blandly at his interrogator this gentleman of precious metal placed his head a little on one side and tapped the lid of his snuffbox but said nothing  then he suddenly exclaimed at the full pitch of his voice california my boy  thats whats done it edward california for ever  ned hurrah  as the deep tones of his voice rang through the starspangled vault the company took up the shout and with california for ever made the cavern ring again  in the excess of their glee the gentlemen took off their hats and the ladies their wreaths and turbans and threw them in the air  as many of them failed to catch these portions of costume in their descent the clatter caused by their fall on the golden pavement was very striking indeed  come here my lad said the old gentleman seizing ned sinton by the arm and laughing heartily as he dragged him towards an immense mirror of burnished gold look at yourself there  ned looked and started back with horror on observing that he himself had been converted into gold  there could be no mistake whatever about it  there he stood staring at himself like a yellow statue  his shootingjacket was richly chased with alternate stripes of burnished and frosted work the buttons on his vest shone like stars his pantaloons were striped like the coat his hair was a mass of dishevelled filigree and his hands when in the height of his horror he clasped them together rang like a brassfounders anvil  for a few moments he stood before the mirror speechless  then a feeling of intense indignation unaccountably took possession of him and he turned fiercely on the old gentleman exclaiming  you have done this sir  what do you mean by it eh  youre quite mistaken ned  i didnt do it  california has done it ha ha my boy youre done for  smitten with the yellow fever neddy california for ever  see here  as he spoke the old gentleman threw out one leg and both arms and began to twirl round after the fashion of a pegtop on one toe  at first he revolved slowly but gradually increased his speed until no part of him could be distinctly observed  ned sinton stood aghast suddenly the old gentleman shot upwards like a rocket but he did not quit the ground he merely elongated his body until his head stuck against the roof of the cave  then he ceased to revolve and remained in the form of a golden stalactitehis head surrounded by stars and his toe resting on the ground  while ned stood rooted to the spot turning the subject over in his mind and trying to find out by what process of chemical or mechanical action so remarkable a transformation could have been accomplished he became aware that his uncle old mr shirley was standing in the middle of the cave regarding him with a look of mingled sarcasm and pity  he observed too that his uncle was not made of gold like the people around him but was habited in a yeomanry uniform  mr shirley had been a yeoman twenty years before his nephew was born  since that time his proportions had steadily increased and he was now a man of very considerable rotundityso much so that his old uniform fitted him with excessive tightness the coat would by no means button across his capacious chest and being much too short shewed a very undignified amount of braces below it  uncle exclaimed ned sinton rushing up to his relative what can be the meaning of all this  everybody seems to be mad  i think you must be mad yourself to come here such a figure as that and im quite sure i shall go mad if you dont explain it to me  what does it all mean  california replied mr shirley becoming more sarcastic in expression and less pitiful  why thats what everybody cries exclaimed ned who was now driven almost to desperation  my dear uncle do look like yourself and exercise some of your wonted sagacity  just glance round at the cave and the company all made of gold and look at megold too if not pinchbeck but im not a goodenough judge of metals to tell which what has done it uncle  do look in a better humour and tell me how it has happened  california replied mr shirley  yes yes i know that  california seems to be everything here  but how has it come about  why are you here and what has brought me here  california repeated mr shirley  uncle ill go deranged if you dont answer me  what do you mean  california reiterated mr shirley  at the same moment a stout golden lady with a filigree turban shouted for ever at the top of a very shrill voice and immediately the company took up the cry again filling the cave with deafening sounds  ned sinton gave one look of despair at his relativethen turned and fled  put him out shouted the company  down with the intruder  ned cast a single glance backward and beheld the people pushing and buffeting his uncle in a most unceremonious manner  his helmet was knocked down over his eyes and the coatso much too small for himwas rendered an easy fit by being ripped up behind to the neck  ned could not stand this  he was stout of limb and bold as a lion although not naturally addicted to fighting so he turned suddenly round and flew to the rescue  plunging into the midst of the struggling mass of golden creatures ned hit out right and left like a young hercules and his blows rang upon their metal chests and noses like the sound of sledgehammers but without any other effect  suddenly he experienced an acute sensation of pain andawoke to find himself hammering the bedpost with bleeding knuckles and his uncle standing beside his bed chuckling immensely  o uncle cried ned sitting up in his bed and regarding his knuckles with a perplexed expression of countenance ive had such an extraordinary dream  ay ned interrupted his uncle and all about california ill be bound  why how did you guess that  it needs not a wizard to guess that lad  ive observed that you have read nothing in the newspapers for the last three months but the news from the golddiggings of california  your mind has of late been constantly running on that subject and it is wellknown that daydreams are often reproduced at night  besides i heard you shouting the word in your sleep as i entered your room  were you fighting with golddiggers eh or indians  neither uncle but i was fighting with very strange beings i assure you and  well well interrupted mr shirley never mind the dream just now we shall have it at some other time  i have important matters to talk over with you my boy  morton has written to me  get up and come down as quickly as you can and well discuss the matter over our breakfast  as the door closed after the retreating form of his uncle edward sinton leaped out of bed and into his trousers  during his toilet he wondered what matters of importance mr shirley could intend to discuss with him and felt half inclined to fear from the grave expression of his uncles face when he spoke of it that something of a disagreeable nature awaited him  but these thoughts were intermingled with reminiscences of the past night  his knuckles too kept constantly reminding him of his strange encounter and do what he would he could not banish from his mind the curious incidents of that remarkable golden dream    chapter two  our hero  we have entered thus minutely into the details of our heros dream because it was the climax to a long series of daydreams in which he had indulged ever since the discovery of gold in california  edward sinton was a youth of eighteen at the time of which we write and an orphan  he was tall strong broadshouldered fairhaired blueeyed romannosed and gentle as a lamb  this last statement may perhaps appear inconsistent with the fact that during the whole course of his schoollife he had a pitched battle every weeksometimes two or three in the week  ned never began a fight and indeed did not like fighting  but some big boys will domineer over little ones and ned would not be domineered over consequently he had to be thrashed  he was possessed even in boyhood of an amount of physical courage that would have sufficed for any two ordinary men  he did not boast  he did not quarrel  he never struck the first blow but if twenty boys had attacked him he would have tried to fight them all  he never tyrannised over small boys  it was not his nature to do so but he was not perfect any more than you are dear reader  he sometimes punched small boys heads when they worried him though he never did so without repenting of it and doing them a kindness afterwards in order to make up  he was very thoughtless too and very careless nevertheless he was fond of booksspecially of books of adventureand studied these like a heroas he was  boys of his own size or even a good deal bigger never fought with ned sinton  they knew better than that but they adored him in some cases envied him and in all cases trusted and followed him  it was only very big boys who fought with him and all they got by it was a good deal of hard pummelling before they floored their little adversary and a good deal of jeering from their comrades for fighting a small boy from one cause or another neds visage was generally scratched often cut frequently swelled and almost always black and blue  but as ned grew older the occasions for fighting became less frequent his naturally amiable disposition improved partly owing no doubt to the care of his uncle who was in every sense of the term a good old man and when he attained the age of fifteen and went to college and was called sinton instead of ned his fighting days were over  no man in his senses would have ventured to attack that strapping youth with the soft blue eyes the fair hair the prominent nose and the firm but smiling lips or if he had he would have had to count on an hours extremely hard work whether the fortune of war went for or against him  when ned had been three years at college his uncle hinted that it was time to think of a profession and suggested that as he was a firstrate mathematician and had been fond of mechanics from his childhood he should turn an engineer  ned would probably have agreed to this cheerfully had not a thirst for adventure been created by the stirring accounts which had begun to arrive at this time from the recentlydiscovered goldfields of california  his enthusiastic spirit was stirred not so much by the prospect of making a large fortune suddenly by the finding of a huge nuggetalthough that was a very pleasant ideaas by the hope of meeting with wild adventures in that imperfectlyknown and distant land  and the effect of such dreams was to render the idea of sitting down to an engineers desk or in a mercantile countingroom extremely distasteful  thus it came to pass that edward sinton felt indisposed to business and disposed to indulge in golden visions  when he entered the breakfastparlour his mind was still full of his curious dream  come along my lad cried mr shirley laying down the bible and removing his spectacles from a pair of eyes that usually twinkled with a sort of grave humour but in which there was now an expression of perplexity set to work and get the edge off your appetite and then ill read moxtons letter  when mr shirley had finished breakfast ned was about half done having just commenced his third slice of toast  so the old gentleman complimented his nephew on the strength of his appetite put on his spectacles drew a letter from his pocket and leaned back in his chair  now lad open your ears and consider what i am about to read  go on uncle im all attention said ned attacking slice number four  this is moxtons letter  it runs thus  dear siri beg to acknowledge receipt of yours of the 5th inst  i shall be happy to take your nephew on trial and if i find him steady shall enter into an engagement with him i need not add that unremitting application to business is the only road to distinction in the profession he is desirous of adopting  let him call at my office tomorrow between ten and twelveyours very truly daniel moxton  is that all inquired ned drawing his chair towards the fire into which he gazed contemplatively  mr shirley looked at his nephew over the top of his spectacles and said  thats all  its very short remarked ned  but to the point rejoined his uncle  now boy i see that you dont relish the idea and i must say that i would rather that you became an engineer than a lawyer but then lad situations are difficult to get nowadays and after all you might do worse than become a lawyer  to be sure i have no great love for the cloth ned but the ladder reaches very high  the foot is crowded with a struggling mass of aspirants many of whom are of very questionable character but the top reaches to one of the highest positions in the empire  you might become the lord high chancellor at last who knows  but seriously i think you should accept this offer  moxton is a grave stern man but a sterling fellow for all that and in good practice  now what do you think  well uncle replied ned ive never concealed my thoughts from you since the day you took me by the hand eleven years ago and brought me to live under your roof and ill not begin to dissemble now  the plain truth is that i dont like it at all  stop now cried mr shirley with a grieved expression of countenance dont be hasty in forming your opinion  besides my boy you ought to be more ready to take my advice even although it be not altogether palatable  my dear uncle you quite misunderstand me  i only tell you what i think about the proposal  as to taking your advice i fully intend to do that whether i like it or not but i think if you will listen to me for a few minutes you will change your mind in regard to this matter you know that i am very fond of travelling and that i dislike the idea of taking up my abode on the top of a threelegged stool either as a lawyers or a merchants clerk  well unless a man likes his profession and goes at it with a will he cannot hope to succeed so that i have no prospect of getting on i fear in the line you wish me to adopt  besides there are plenty of poor fellows out of work who love sitting still from nine am to ten pm and whose bread i would be taking out of their mouths by devoting myself to the legal profession and  at this point ned hesitated for a moment and his uncle broke in with  tell me now if every one thought about business as you do how would the world get on think you  badly i fear replied the youth with a smile but everybody doesnt think of it as i do and tell me uncle if everybody thought of business as you would wish me to do what would come of the soldiers and sailors who defend our empire and extend our foreign trade and achieve the grand geographical discoveries that have of late added so much lustre to the british name  ned flushed and became quite eloquent at this point  now look at california he continued theres a magnificent region full of gold not a mere myth or an exaggeration but a veritable fact attested by the arrival of letters and golddust every month  surely that land was made to be peopled and the poor savages who dwell there need to be converted to christianity and delivered from their degraded condition and the country must be worked and its resources be developed and whos to do it if enterprising clergymen and schoolmasters and miners do not go to live there and push their fortunes  and which of the three callings do you propose adopting inquired mr shirley with a peculiar smile  well uncle iathe fact is i have not thought much about that as yet  of course i never thought of the first  i do not forget your own remark that the calling of a minister of the gospel of christ is not like other professions to be adopted merely as a means of livelihood then as to the second i might perhaps manage that but i dont think it would suit me  do you think then that you would make a good digger  well perhaps i would replied ned modestly  mr shirley gravely regarded the powerful frame that reclined in the easychair before him and was compelled to admit that the supposition was by no means outrageous  besides continued the youth i might turn my hand to many things in a new country  you know i have studied surveying and i can sketch a little and know something of architecture  i suppose that latin and greek would not be of much use but the little i have picked up of medicine and surgery among the medical students would be useful  then i could take notes and sketch the scenery and bring back a mass of material that might interest the public and do good to the country  oh said the old gentleman shortly come back and turn author in fact and write a book that nobody would publish or which in the event of its being published nobody would read  come now my dear uncle dont laugh at me  i assure you it seems very reasonable to me to think that what others have done and are doing every day i am able to do  well i wont laugh at you but to be serious you are wise enough to know that an old mans experience is worth more than a youths fancies much of what you have said is true i admit but i assure you that the bright prospects you have cut out for yourself are very delusive  they will never be realised at least in the shape in which you have depicted them on your imagination  they will dissolve my boy on a nearer approach and as shakespeare has it like the baseless fabric of a vision leave not a wrack behind or at least not much more than a wrack  ned reverted to the golden dream and felt uneasy under his uncles kind but earnest gaze  most men continued mr shirley enjoy themselves at first when they go to wild countries in search of adventure but they generally regret the loss of their best years afterwards  in my opinion men should never emigrate unless they purpose making the foreign land they go to their home  but i wont oppose you if you are determined to go i will do all i can to help you and give you my blessing but before you make up your mind i would recommend you to call on mr moxton and hear what prospects he holds out to you  then take a week to think seriously over it and if at the end of that time you are as anxious to go as ever ill not stand in your way  you are kind to me uncle more so than i deserve said ned earnestly ill do as you desire and you may depend upon it that the generous way in which you have left me to make my own choice will influence me against going abroad more than anything else  ned sighed as he rose to quit the room for he felt that his hopes at that moment were sinking  and before you take a step in the matter my boy said old mr shirley go to your room and ask counsel of him who alone has the power to direct your steps in this life  ned replied briefly i will uncle and hastily left the room  mr shirley poked the fire put on his spectacles smoothed out the wrinkles on his bald forehead with his hand took up the times and settled himself down in his easychair to read but his nephews prospects could not be banished from his mind  he went over the whole argument again mentally with copious additions ere he became aware of the fact that for threequarters of an hour he had been apparently reading the newspaper upside down    chapter three  hopes and fearsmr shirley receives a visit and a wild proposal  when edward sinton left his chamber an hour after the conversation related in the last chapter his brow was unruffled and his step light he had made up his mind that come what might he would not resist the wishes of his only near relative and his best friend  there was a day in the period of early boyhood that remained as fresh on the memory of young sinton as if it had been yesterdaythe day on which his mother died  the desolation of his early home on that day was like the rising of a dark thundercloud on a bright sky  his young heart was crushed his mind stunned and the first ray of light that broke upon himthe first gush of reliefwas when his uncle arrived and took him on his knee and seated beside the bed where that cold still form lay wept upon the childs neck as if his heart would break  mr shirley buried the sister whom he had been too late to see alive  then he and his little nephew left the quiet country village and went to dwell in the great city of london  from that time forward mr shirley was a father to ned who loved him more than any one else on earth and through his influence he was early led to love and reverence his heavenly father and his blessed redeemer  the subject of going abroad was the first in regard to which ned and his uncle had seriously disagreed and the effect on the feelings of both was very strong  neds mind wandered as he put on his hat and buttoned his greatcoat up to the chin and drew on his gloves slowly  he was not vain of his personal appearance neither was he reckless of it  he always struck you as being a particularly welldressed man and he had naturally a dashing look about him  poor fellow he felt anything but dashing or reckless as he hurried through the crowded streets in the direction of the city that day  moxtons door was a green one with a brass knocker and a brass plate both of which ornaments owing to verdigris were anything but ornamental  the plate was almost useless being nearly illegible but the knocker was still fit for duty  the street was narrowas ned observed with a feeling of deep depressionand the house to which the green door belonged besides being dirty retreated a little as if it were ashamed of itself  on the knocker being applied the green door was opened by a disagreeablelooking old woman who answered to the question is mr moxton in with a short yes and without farther remark ushered our hero into a very dingy and particularly small office which owing to the insufficient quantity of daylight that struggled through the dirty little windows required to be lighted with gas  ned felt so to speak like a thermometer which was falling rapidly  can i see mr moxton he inquired of a small dishevelled clerk who sat on a tall stool behind a high desk engaged in writing his name in every imaginable form on a sheet of note paper  the dishevelled clerk pointed to a door which opened into an inner apartment and resumed his occupation  ned tapped at the door indicated  come in cried a stern voice  ned as a thermometer fell considerably lower  on entering he beheld a tall gaunt man with a sour cast of countenance standing with his back to the fire  ned advanced with a cheerful expression of face  thermometrically speaking he fell to the freezingpoint  you are young sinton i suppose  youve come later than i expected  ned apologised and explained that he had had some difficulty in finding the house  umph  your uncle tells me that youre a sharp fellow and write a good hand  have you ever been in an office before  no sir  up till now i have been at college  my uncle is rather partial i fear and may have spoken too highly of me  i think however that my hand is not a bad one  at least it is legible  at least said mr moxton with a sarcastic expression that was meant for smile perhaps for a grin  why thats the most you could say of it  no hand is good sir if it is not legible and no hand can possibly be bad that is legible  have you studied law  no sir i have not  umph youre too old to begin  have you been used to sit at the desk  yes i have been accustomed to study the greater part of the day  well you may come here on monday and ill speak to you again and see what you can do  im too busy just now  goodmorning  ned turned to go but paused on the threshold and stood holding the doorhandle  excuse me sir he said hesitatingly may i ask what room i shall occupy ififi come to work here  mr moxton looked a little surprised at the question but pointed to the outer office where the dishevelled clerk sat and said there  ned fell to twenty below the freezingpoint  and pray sir he continued may i ask what are officehours  from nine am till nine pm with an interval for meals said mr moxton sharply but we usually continue at work till eleven at night sometimes later  goodmorning  ned fell to zero and found himself in the street with an indistinct impression of having heard the dishevelled clerk chuckling vociferously as he passed through the office  it was a hard struggle a very hard struggle but he recalled to mind all that his uncle had ever done for him and the love he bore him and manfully resolved to cast california behind his back for ever and become a lawyer  meanwhile mr shirley received a visit from a very peculiar personage he was still seated in his armchair pondering his nephews prospects when this personage entered the room hat in handthe hat was a round straw oneand cried heartily good day kinsman  ha  captain bunting how are ye  glad to see you old fellow exclaimed mr shirley rising and seizing the sailor by the hand  sit down sit down and lets hear your news  why i believe its six months since i saw you  longer shirley longer than that replied the captain seating himself in the chair which ned sinton had vacated a short time before i hope your memory is not giving way  i have been half round the world and its a year and six months today since i sat here last  is it cried mr shirley in surprise  now that is very remarkable but do you know captain i have often thought upon that subject and wondered why it is that as we get older time seems to fly faster and events which happened a month ago seem as if they only occurred yesterday  but let me hear all about it  where have you been and where are you going next  ive been replied the captain who was a big broad man with a rough overall coat rough pilotcloth trousers rough red whiskers a shaggy head of hair and a roughskinned face the only part of him in fact which wasnt rough was his heart that was soft and warm  ive been as i remarked before half round the world and im goin next to america  thats a short but comprehensive answer to your question  if you have time and patience kinsman ill open the logbook of my memory and give you some details of my doings since we last met  but first tell me how is my young friend ned  oh hes wellexcellently wellbesides being tall and strong  you would hardly know him captain  hes full six feet high i believe and the scamp has something like a white wreath of smoke over his upper lip already  i wish him to become an engineer or a lawyer but the boy is in love with california just now and dreams about nothing but wild adventures and golddust  the captain gave a grunt and a peculiar smile crossed his rugged visage as he gazed earnestly and contemplatively into the fire  captain bunting was a philosopher and was deeply impressed with the belief that the smallest possible hint upon any subject whatever was sufficient to enable him to dive into the marrow of it and prognosticate the probable issue of it with much greater certainty than any one else  on the present occasion however the grunt above referred to was all he said  it is not necessary to trouble the reader with the lengthened discourse that the captain delivered to his kinsman  when he concluded mr shirley pushed his spectacles up on his bald head gazed at the fire and said odd very odd and interesting toovery interesting  after a short pause he pulled his spectacles down on his nose and looking over them at the captain said and what part of america are you bound for now  california answered the captain slowly  mr shirley started as if some prophetic vision had been called up by the word and the tone in which it was uttered  and that continued the captain brings me to the point  i came here chiefly for the purpose of asking you to let your nephew go with me as i am in want of a youth to assist me as a sort of supercargo and jackofalltrades  in fact i like your nephew much and have long had my eye on him  i think him the very man for my purpose  i want a companion too in my businessone who is good at the pen and can turn his hand to anything  in short it would be difficult to explain all the outs and ins of why i want him  but hes a tight clever fellow as i know and i do want him and if youll let him go i promise to bring him safe back again in the course of two yearsif we are all spared  from what youve told me ive no doubt the lad will be delighted to go  and believe me his golden dreams will be all washed out by the time he comes back  now what say you  for the space of five minutes mr shirley gazed at the captain over his spectacles in amazement and said nothing  then he threw himself back on his chair pushed his spectacles up on his forehead and gazed at him from underneath these assistants to vision  the alteration did not seem to improve matters for he still continued to gaze in silent surprise at last his lips moved and he said slowly but emphatically  now that is the most remarkable coincidence i ever heard of  how so inquired the captain  why that my nephew should be raving about going to california and that you should be raving about getting him to go and that these things should suddenly come to a climax on the same forenoon  its absolutely incredible  if i had read it in a tale now or a romance i would not have been surprised for authors are such blockheads generally that they always make things of this kind fit in with the exactness of a dovetail but that it should really come to pass in my own experience is quite incomprehensible  and so suddenly too  as to that remarked the captain with a serious philosophical expression of countenance most things come to a climax suddenly and coincidences invariably happen together but after all it doesnt seem so strange to me for vessels are setting sail for california every other day and  well interrupted mr shirley starting up with energy as if he had suddenly formed a great resolve i will let the boy go  perhaps it will do him good  besides i have my own reasons for not caring much about his losing a year or two in regard to business  come with me to the city captain and well talk over it as we go along  so saying mr shirley took his kinsman by the arm and they left the house together    chapter four  the end of the beginningfarewell to old england  as captain bunting sagaciously remarked most things come to a climax suddenly  on the evening of the day in which our tale begins edward sintonstill standing at zerowalked into his uncles parlour  the old gentleman was looking earnestly though unintentionally at the cat which sat on the rug and the cat was looking attentively at the kettle which sat on the fire hissing furiously as if it were disgusted at being kept so long from tea  neds face was very long and sad as he entered the room  dear uncle said he taking mr shirley by the hand im not going to take a week to think over it  i have made up my mind to remain at home and become a lawyer  ned replied mr shirley returning his nephews grasp im not going to take a week to think over it either  i have made up my mind that you are to go to california and become aawhatever you like my dear boy so sit down to tea and ill tell you all about it  ned was incredulous at first but as his uncle went on to explain how matters stood and gradually diverged from that subject to the details of his outfit he recovered from his surprise and sprang suddenly up to 100 degrees of fahrenheit even in the shade of the prospect of parting for a time from old mr shirley  need we be surprised reader that our hero on that night dreamed the golden dream over again with many wonderful additions and sundry remarkable variations  thus it came to pass that two weeks afterwards ned and his uncle found themselves steaming down the thames to gravesend where the good ship roving bess lay riding at anchor with a short cable and topsails loose ready for sea  ned said mr shirley as they watched the receding banks of the noble river you may never see home again my boy  will you be sure not to forget me will you write often ned  forget you uncle exclaimed ned in a reproachful voice while a tear sprang to his eye  how can you suggest such a  well well my boy i know iti know it but i like to hear the assurance repeated by your own lips  im an old man now and if i should not live to see you again i would like to have some earnest loving words to think upon while you are away  the old man paused a few moments and then resumed  ned remember when far from home that there is another homeeternal in the heavensto which if you be the lords child you are hastening you will think of that home ned wont you  if i do not meet you again here at any rate i shall hope to meet you there  ned would have spoken but his heart was too full  he merely pressed old mr shirleys arm  perhaps continued his uncle it is not necessary to make you promise to read gods blessed word  youll be surrounded by temptations of no ordinary kind in the goldregions and depend upon it that the bible read with prayer will be the best chart and compass to guide you safely through them all  my dear uncle replied ned with emotion perhaps the best promise i can make is to assure you that i will endeavour to do in all things and at all times as you have taught me ever since i was a little boy  if i succeed i feel assured that i shall do well  a long and earnest conversation ensued between the uncle and nephew which was interrupted at last by the arrival of the boat at gravesend jumping into a wherry they pushed off and were soon alongside of the roving bess a barque of about eight hundred tons burden and according to captain bunting an excellent seaboat  catch hold o the manropes cried the lastnamed worthy looking over the side thats it now then jump all right  how are ye kinsman glad to see you ned  i was afraid you were goin to give me the slip  i have not kept you waiting have i inquired ned  yes you have youngster replied the captain with a facetious wink as he ushered his friends into the cabin and set a tray of broken biscuit and a decanter of wine before them  the wind has been blowin off shore the whole morning and the good ship has been straining at a short cable like a hound chained up  but well be off now in another halfhour  so soon said mr shirley with an anxious expression on his kind old face  all ready to heave up the anchor sir shouted the first mate down the companion  the captain sprang on deck and soon after the metallic clatter of the windlass rang a cheerful accompaniment to the chorus of the sailors one by one the white sails spread out to the breeze and the noble ship began to glide through the water  in a few minutes more the last words were spoken the last farewell uttered and mr shirley stood alone in the sternsheet of the little boat watching the departing vessel as she gathered way before the freshening breeze  as long as the boat was visible ned sinton stood on the ships bulwarks holding on to the mizzen shrouds and waving his handkerchief from time to time  the old man stood with his head uncovered and his thin locks waving in the wind  soon the boat was lost to view  our hero brushed away a tear and leaped upon the deck where the little world of which for many days to come he was to form a part busied itself in making preparation for a long long voyage  the british channel was passed the atlantic ocean was entered england sank beneath the horizon and for the first time in his life ned sinton found himselfat sea    chapter five  the seadangers of the deep and uncertainty of human affairsa disastrous night and a bright morningcalifornia at last  only those who have dwelt upon the ocean for many months together can comprehend the feelings of delight with which the longimprisoned voyager draws near to his desired haven  for six long months did the roving bess do battle with the surging billows of the great deep during that time she steered towards the gulf of mexicocarefully avoiding that huge reservoir of seaweed termed the saragossa sea in which the unscientific but enterprising mariners of old used to get becalmed oftentimes for days and weeks togethershe coasted down the eastern shores of south america fired at and shewed her heels to a pirate doubled cape horn fought with the tempests that take special delight in revelling there and finally spreading her sails to the genial breezes of the pacific ocean drew near to her voyageend  all this the good ship roving bess did with credit to herself and comfort to her crew but a few weeks after she entered the pacific she was met contrary to all expectation by the bitterest gale that had ever compelled her to scud under bare poles  it was a beautiful afternoon when the first symptoms of the coming storm were observed  captain bunting had just gone down below and our hero was standing at the weather gangway observing the sudden dart of a shoal of flyingfish which sprang out of the sea whizzed through the air a few hundred feet and fell with a splash into the water in their frantic efforts to escape from their bitter enemy the dolphin  while ned gazed contemplatively at the spot where the winged fish had disappeared the captain sprang on deck  were goin to catch it he said hurriedly as he passed forward tumble up there tumble up all hands to shorten sails  hand down the royals and furl the tgallant sails mr williams to the first mate and look alive  ay ay sir was answered in that prompt tone of voice which indicates thorough discipline and unquestioning obedience while the men scrambled up the forehatch and sprang up the ratlines hand over hand  a moment before the vessel had lain quietly on the bosom of the unruffled deep as if she were asleep now she was all uproar and apparent confusion sails slewed round ropes rattled and blocks creaked while the sonorous voice of the first mate sounded commands like a trumpet from the quarterdeck  i see no indication of a storm remarked young sinton as the captain walked aft  possibly not lad but i do  the barometer has fallen lower all of a sadden than i ever saw it fall before  you may depend upon it we shall have to look out for squalls before long  just cast your eyes on the horizon over the weather bows there its not much of a cloud and to say truth i would not have thought much of it had the glass remained steady but that faithful servant never  better closereef the topsails sir said the mate touching his cap and pointing to the cloud just referred to  do so mr williams and let the watch below remain on deck and stand by to man the halyards  in less than an hour the roving bess was running at the rate of twelve knots under closereefed topsails before a steady gale which in halfanhour later increased to a hurricane compelling them to take in all sail and lay to  the sun set in a blaze of mingled black and lurid clouds as if the heavens were on fire the billows rose to their utmost height as the shrieking winds heaved them upwards and then cutting off their crests hurled the spray along like driving clouds of snow and dashed it against the labouring ship as if impatient to engulf her in that ravening maw which has already swallowed up so many human victims  but the little vessel faced the tempest nobly and rose like a seamew on the white crest of each wave while the steersmenfor there were two lashed to the wheelkept her to the wind  suddenly the sheet of the fore trysail parted the ship came up to the wind and a billow at that moment broke over her pouring tons of water on her deck and carrying away the foremast maintopmasts and the jibboom  clear the wreckdown the helm and let her scud shouted the captain who stood by the mizzenmast holding on to a belayingpin  but the captains voice was drowned by the whistling winds and seeing that the men were uncertain what to do he seized one of the axes which were lashed to the foot of the mast and began to cut away the ropes which dragged the wreck of the foremast under the lee of the ship  williams the mate and the second mate followed his example while ned sprang to the wheel to see the orders to the steersmen obeyed  in halfanhour all was clear and the ship was scudding before the gale under bare poles  weve not seen the worst of it remarked the captain as he resumed his post on the quarterdeck and brushed the brine from his whiskers i fear too that she has received some bad thumps from the wreck of the foremast  youd better go below sinton and put on a topcoat its no use gettin wetter than you can help  im as wet as i can be captain besides i can work better as i am if theres anything for me to do  well there aint much youll have enough to do to keep yourself from being washed overboard  hows her head larry  nor east an by east replied one of the men at the wheel larry oneil by namea genuine son of erin whose jovial smile of rollicking good humour was modified but by no means quenched by the serious circumstances in which he found himself placed  his comrade william jones who stood on the larboard side of the wheel was a short thickset stern seaman whose facial muscles were scarcely capable of breaking into a smile and certainly failed to betray any of the owners thoughts or feelings excepting astonishment  such passions as anger pity disgust fear and the like whatever place they might have in joness breast had no visible index on his visage  both men were sailorlike and powerful but they were striking contrasts to each other as they stoodthe one sternly the other smilinglysteering the roving bess before that howling storm  is not nor east and by east our direct course for the harbour of san francisco inquired ned sinton  it is replied the captain as near as i can guess but weve been blown about so much that i cant tell exactly  moreover its my opinion we cant be far off the coast now and if this gale holds on ill have to bring to at the risk of bein capsized  them plaguey coralreefs too are always springin up in these seas where you least expect em  if we go bump against one as we are goin now its all up with us  not a pleasant idea remarked ned somewhat gravely  do these storms usually last long  before the captain could reply the first mate came up and whispered in his ear  eh how much dye say he asked quickly  five feet sir she surged heavily once or twice on the foremast and i think must have started a plank  call all hands to work the pumps and dont let the men know how much water there is in the hold  come below ned  i want you  keep her head steady as she goes  ay ay sir sang out oneil as the captain descended the companionhatch to the cabin followed by his young friend  the dim light in the swinging lamp flickered fitfully when the ship plunged into the troughs of the seas and rose again with a violent surge as each wave passed under her while every plank and spar on board seemed to groan under the strain  darkness now added to the terrors of the wild storm  sitting down on a locker captain bunting placed his elbows on the table and covering his face with his hands remained silent for several minutes while ned sat down beside him but forbore to interrupt his thoughts  boy he said at length looking up anxiously weve sprung a leak and a few minutes will shew what our fate is to be  five feet of water in the hold in so short a time implies a bad one  five feet two sir said the mate looking in at the cabin door and the carpenter cant get at the leak  i feared as much muttered the captain  keep the men hard at the pumps mr williams and let me hear how it stands again in ten minutes  captain said ned it does not become a landsman to suggest perhaps but i cant help reminding you that leaks of this kind have been stopped by putting a sail below the ships bottom  i know it boy i know it but we could never get a sail down in such a night  can nothing be done then  yes lad its hard to do it but it must be done life is more precious than goldwe must heave the cargo overboard  i have invested every farthing i have in the world in this venture continued captain bunting sadly but theres no help for it  now you were at the shifting of the cargo when we opened the hatches during the calms off the brazilian coast and as you know the position of the bales and boxes i want you to direct the men so as to get it hove out quickly luckily bein a general cargo most o the bales are small and easily handled  here comes the mate againwell mr williams  up another inch sir  go ned over with it  ill superintend above so goodbye to our golden dreams  there was a slight tone of bitterness in the captains voice as he spoke but it passed away quickly and the next instant he was on deck encouraging his men to throw the valuable cargo over the side  bale after bale and box after box were tossed ruthlessly out upon the raging sea until little was left in the ship save the bulky and less valuable portion of the cargo  then a cry arose that the leak was discovered the carpenter had succeeded in partially stopping it with part of a sail and soon the pumps began to reduce the quantity of water in the hold  at last the leak was gained and effectually stopped and before daybreak the storm began to subside  while part of the crew being relieved from the harassing work at the pumps busied themselves in repairing damages ned went to his cabin to put on dry clothes and take a little rest of which he stood much in need  next day the bright sun rose in a cloudless sky and a gentle breeze now wafted the roving bess over the pacific whose bosom still heaved deeply from the effects of the recent storm  a sense of fervent thankfulness to god for deliverance filled the heart of our hero as he awoke and beheld the warm sunbeams streaming in at the little window of his cabin  suddenly he was roused from a deep reverie by the shout of land ho on deck  words cannot convey an adequate idea of the effect of such a shout upon all on board  land ho was repeated by every one as he sprang in dishabille up the hatchway  where away inquired captain bunting  right ahead sir answered the lookout  ay there it is said the captain as ned without coat or vest rushed to his side and gazed eagerly over the bow there it is ned california at last  yonder rise the golden mountains that have so suddenly become the worlds magnet and yonder too is the golden gate of the harbour of san francisco  humph much good itll do us  again there was a slight tone of bitterness in the captains voice  dont let down your spirits captain said ned in a cheering tone there is still enough of the cargo left to enable us to make a start for the goldfields  perhaps we may make more money there than we would have made had we sold the cargo at a large profit by trafficking on the coast  captain bunting hooked his thumbs into the armholes of his waistcoat and shook his head  it was evident that he had no faith in golddigging  meanwhile the crew had assembled on the forecastle and were looking out ahead with wistful and excited glances for the fame of the golden land to which they were approaching had spread far and wide and they longed to see the golddust and nuggets with their own eyes  its a beautiful land intirely exclaimed larry oneil with an irrepressible shout of enthusiasm which called forth a general cheer from the men  arrah now remarked another patlander dont ye wish ye wos up to the knees and elbows in the goolden sands already  faix id give a months pay to have wan day at the diggins  i dont believe a word about iti dont remarked jones with the dogged air of a man who shouldnt wouldnt and didnt believe and yet felt somehow that he couldnt help it  nother do i said another its all a sham come now aint it bill he added turning to a bronzed veteran who had visited california two years before  a sham exclaimed bill  i tell e wot it is messmate when you comes for to see the miners in san francisco drinkin shampain like water an payin a dollar for a glass o sixwater grog youll  how much is a dollar inquired a softlooking youth interrupting him  bill said it was bout four shillins and turned away with a look of contempt at such a display of ignorance  four shillins exclaimed the soft youth in amazement  clear the anchor and clew up the maintopsail shouted the mate  in another moment the crew were scattered some aloft to lay out on the topsail yard some to the clewlines and some to clear the anchor which latter had not been disturbed since the roving bess left the shores of old england    chapter six  san franciscoan unexpected desertioncaptain bunting takes a gloomy view of things in generalnew friends and new planssingular facts and curious fancies  the golden gates as they are called of san francisco are two rocky headlands about a mile apart which form the entrance to one of the finest harbours or rather landlocked seas in the world  this harbour is upwards of forty miles long by about twelve miles broad at its widest point and receives at its northern end the waters of the noble sacramento river into which all the other rivers in california flow  nearly opposite to the mouth of the sacramento on the southern shores of the bay stands the famous city of san francisco close to which the roving bess let go her anchor and clasped the golden strand  the old adage that truth is strange stranger than fiction was never more forcibly verified than in the growth and career of this wonderful city  no dreams of arabian romance ever surpassed the inconceivable wonders that were matters of everyday occurrence there during the first years of the goldfever and many of the results attributed to aladdins wonderful lamp were almost literally accomplishedin some cases actually surpassedin and around the cities of california  before the discovery of gold san francisco was a mere hamlet  it consisted of a few rude cottages built of sundried bricks which were tenanted by native californians there were also a few merchants who trafficked in hides and horns  cruisers and whalers occasionally put into the harbour to obtain fresh supplies of water but beyond these and the vessels engaged in the hidetrade few ships ever visited the port and the name of san francisco was almost unknown  but the instant the rumour got abroad that gold had been discovered there the eyes of the world were turned towards it  in a few months men and ships began to pour into the capacious harbour a city of tents overspread the sandhills on which the hamlet stood thousands upon thousands of goldhunters rushed to the mines the golden treasures of the land were laid bare and immense fortunes were made literally in the course of a few weeks  in many cases these were squandered or gambled away almost as soon as made but hundreds of men retired from the goldfields after a few months labour and returned home possessed of ample fortunes  thousands too failedsome from physical inability to stand the fatiguing labour of the mines and some from what they termed want of luck though want of perseverance was in nine cases out of ten the real cause while many hundreds perished from exposure and from the diseases that were prevalent in the country  well would it have been for these last had they remembered gods word make not haste to be rich but the thirst for gold and the prospect of the sudden acquisition of enormous wealth had blinded them to the fact that their frames were not equal to the rough life at the mines  the excitement was at its height when the roving bess anchored off the shores of this land of gold  the sun was just setting as the anchor dropped and the crippled ship swung round towards the shore for the tide had just begun to rise  faix its a quare town said larry oneil to ned who was gazing in wrapt astonishment and admiration ever the stern  it was indeed quare  the entire city was made up of the most flimsy and makeshift materials that can be conceived  many of the shops were mere tents with an open framework of wood in front some were made of sheetiron nailed to wooden posts some were made of zinc others imported from the states of wood painted white and edged with green a few were built of sundried bricks still fewer of corrugated iron and many of all these materials pieced together in a sort of fancy patchwork  even boats were used as dwellings turned keel up with a hole cut in their sides for the egress of a tin smokepipe and two others of larger size to serve as door and window  finding space scarce owing to the abrupt rise of the hills from the shore many enterprising individuals had encroached upon the sea and built houses on piles driven into the sand nearly halfamile below the original high water mark  almost every nation under the sun had representatives there and the consequent confusion of tongues was equal to that of babel  the hills overhanging the lower part of the town were also well covered with tents temporary houses and cottages that had some appearance of comfort about them  such was the city on which the sun went down that night and many were the quaint sagacious and comic remarks made by the men as they sat round their various messtables in the forecastle of the roving bess speculating noisily and halfseriously on the possibility of getting a run into the interior for a day or two  but there was a party of men in the ship whose conversation that night was neither so lighthearted nor so loud  they sat in a dark corner of the forecastle talking earnestly in subdued tones after the watch for the night was set  their chief spokesman was a rough illlooking fellow named elliot  ye see lads said this man to the halfdozen comrades around him we must do it tonight if were to do it at all  theres the captains small boat layin out astarn which comes quite handy an as we lose all our pay by the dodge i dont see why we shouldnt take it  the man struck his fist into his left palm and looked round the circle for opinions  i dont half like it said one it seems to me a sneaking way of doin it  bah ejaculated another wot gammon you do talk  if he lose the boat dont we lose the tin  besides are we agoin to let sich a trifle stand in the way o us an our fortins  have ye spoken to the other men elliot inquired one of the group  ay in coorse i have an theyre all agreeable  young spense stood out pretty stiff at first but i talked him over  only i said nothing to larry oneil or bill jones  i know its of no use  theyll never agree and if we wos to speak of it to either on em hed go right away aft an tell the captain  their watch below ll come on in an hour an then the watch on deckll be on our side  so lads go and git ready an sharps the word  the party broke up and went quietly below to prepare for flight leaving no one on deck except oneil and jones and two of their comrades who formed part of the watch  as elliot had said the watch was changed in about an hour  the mate and captain came on deck looked round to see that all was right and then returned to the cabin to consult about the preliminary arrangements for disposing of the remnant of the cargo  ned sinton had turned in to have a good sleep before the expected toil and bustle of the following day oneil and jones being relieved from duty were glad to jump into their hammocks and the deck was left in charge of the conspirators  it was a clear lovely night  not a zephyr stirred the surface of the sea in whose depths the starry host and the images of a hundred ships of all shapes and tonnage were faithfully mirrored  bright lights illumined the city those in the tents giving to them the appearance of cones and cubes of solid fire  the subdued din of thousands of human voices floated over the water and mingled with the occasional shout or song that rose from the fleet and the splash of oars as boats passed to and from the shore  over all the young moon shed a pale soft light threw into deep shadow the hills towards the north which rose abruptly to a height of 3000 feet and tipped with a silver edge the peak of monte diavolo whose lofty summit overlooks all the golden land between the great range of the sierra nevada and the ocean  it was a scene of peaceful beauty well fitted to call forth the adoration of man to the great and good creator  doubtless there were some whose hearts rose that night above the sordid thoughts of gain and gold but few such were recognisable by their fellowmen compared with the numerous votaries of sin and socalled pleasure  towards midnight captain bunting turned in ordering the steward to call him at daybreak and shortly afterwards the mate retired having previously looked round the deck and spoken the watch  a few minutes after elliot and his comrades appeared on deck with their boots and small bundles in their hands  is all right whispered elliot  all right replied one of the watch  nothing more was said the boat was hauled softly alongside and held firmly there while two men descended and muffled the oars then one by one the men slid down the side and a bag of biscuit and a junk of beef were lowered into it by the second mate who was one of the conspirators  at that moment the first mate came on deck and went forward to inquire what was wrong  its something in the boat sir replied the second mate  the mate looked over the side and the sailors felt that they must be discovered and that their plans were about to be frustrated  but the second mate was a man of decision  he suddenly seized williams round the neck and covering his mouth with his hand held him as if in a vice until he was secured and gagged  shall we leave him whisperingly inquired one of the men  no hed manage to kick up a row take him with us  the helpless mate was immediately passed over the side the rope was cast off and the boat floated softly away  at first the oars were dipped so lightly that no sound was heard even by those on board except the drops of brine that trickled from the blades as they rose from the water then as the distance increased the strokes were given more vigorously and at last the men bent to it with a will and they were soon shooting over the vast bay in the direction of the sacramento river up which they meant to proceed to the diggings  with the exception of oneil and jones who had already reached the diggings in their dreams the whole crew sixteen in all levanted leaving captain bunting to navigate the ship back to old england as he best might  it is easier to conceive than to describe the feelings of the captain when on the following morning he discovered that his crew had fled he stamped and danced and tugged his hair and pursed up his lips so tight that nothing but an occasional splutter escaped them  then he sat down on the cabin skylight looked steadily at ned who came hurriedly on deck in his shirt and drawers to see what was wrong and burst into a prolonged fit of laughter  hallo captain whats up  nothin lad ha ha  oh yes human flesh is up ned sailors is riz an weve been soldwe haveuncommon  hereupon the captain roared again but there was a slight peculiarity in the tone that indicated a strong infusion of rage with the seeming merriment  theyre all goneevery man jack said jones with a face of deep solemnity as he stood looking at the captain  so they are the blackguards an that without biddin us good mornin bad luck to them added oneil  at first ned sinton felt little disposed to take a comic view of the affair and urged the captain strongly to take the lightest boat and set off in pursuit but the latter objected to this  its of no use he said the ship cant be repaired here without heavy expense so as i dont mean to go to sea again for some time the desertion of the men matters little after all  not go to sea again exclaimed ned in surprise  what then do you mean to do  thats more than i can tell  i must see first how the cargo is to be disposed of after that it will be time enough to concoct plans for the future  it is quite clear that the tide of luck is out about as far as it can go just now perhaps it may turn soon  no doubt of it captain cried his young protege with a degree of energy that shewed he had made up his mind as to what his course should be in the event of things coming to the worst  ill go down and put on a few more articles of clothing and then well have a talk over matters  the talk which was held over the breakfasttable in the cabin resulted in the captain resolving to go ashore and call on a scotch merchant named thompson to whom he had a letter of introduction halfanhour later this resolve was carried out  jones rowed them ashore in the smallest boat they had and sculled back to the ship leaving oneil with them to assist in carrying up two boxes which were consigned to mr thompson  the quay on which they stood was crowded with men of all nations whose excited looks and tones and goahead movements testified to the highpressure speed with which business in san francisco was transacted  its more nor i can do to carry them two boxes at wance said larry oneil regarding them with a puzzled look an sorra a porter do i see nowhere  as he spoke a tall gentlemanlylooking young man in a redflannel shirt roundcrowned wideawake long boots and corduroys stepped forward and said ill help you if you like  dye think ye can lift it inquired larry with a dubious look  the youth replied by seizing one of the boxes and lifting it with ease on his shoulder shewing that though destitute of fat he had more than the average allowance of bone and sinew  i doubt if you could do it better than that yourself larry said ned laughing  come along now close at our heels lest we get separated in the crowd  the young porter knew the residence of mr thompson well and guided them swiftly through the crowded thoroughfares towards it  passing completely through the town he led them over the brow of one of the sandhills beyond it and descended into a little valley where several neat villas were scattered along the sides of a pleasant green slope that descended towards another part of the bay  turning into the little garden in front of one of these villas he placed the box on the wooden platform before the door and said this is mr thompsons house  there was something striking in the appearance of this young porter he seemed much above his station in life and ned sinton regarded his bronzed and handsome but somewhat haggard and dissipated countenance with interest as he drew out his purse and asked what was to pay  two dollars answered the man  ned looked up in surprise  the idea of paying eight shillings for so slight a service had never entered his imagination  at that moment the door opened and mr thompson appeared and invited them to enter  he was a shrewd businesslike man with stern but kind expression of countenance  come in come in and welcome to california he said on perusing the captains letter of introduction  glad to see you gentlemen  youve not had breakfast of course we are just about to sit down  this way he added throwing open the door of a comfortable and elegantlyfurnished parlour  bring the boxes into the passagethat will do  here lizette pay the men dear two dollars apiece i fancy  excuse me interrupted captain bunting only one bas to be paid the other is one of my sailors  ah very good which is he  larry oneil stepped forward hat in hand  go in there my man and cook will attend to you  larry passed through the doorway pointed out with a pleasant fluttering sensation at the heart which was quickly changed to a feeling of considerable disappointment on discovering that cook was a negro  meanwhile lizette took two dollars from her purse and bowing modestly to the strangers as she passed out of the room advanced with them towards the young porter  now lizette was not beautifulfew women are in the highest sense of the term and the few who are are seldom interesting but she was pretty and sweet and innocent and just turned sixteen  fortunately for the male part of the world there are many such  she had lightbrown hair which hung in dishevelled curls all round a soft fair complexion blue eyes and a turnedup nosea pert little nose that said plainly i will have my own way now see if i dont  but the heart that animated the body to which that nose belonged was a good kind earnest one therefore the nose having its own way was rather a blessing than otherwise to those happy individuals who dwelt habitually in the sunshine of lizettes presence  at this particular time ladies were scarce in california  the immense rush of men from all parts of the earth to the diggings had not been accompanied as yet by a corresponding rush of women consequently the sight of a female face was as it always ought to be a source of comfort to mankind  we say comfort advisedly because life at the goldmines was a hard riotous mammonseeking rugged and we regret to say it ungodly life and men in whom the soft memories of other days were not entirely quenched had need sometimes of the comforting reflection that there still existed beings on the earth who didnt rant and roar and drink and swear and wear beards and boots and bowieknives  there was double cause then for the gaze of respectful admiration with which the young porter regarded lizette as she said here is your fare porter and put the money into his hand which he did not even thank her for but continued to hold extended as if he wished her to take it back again  lizette did not observe the gaze for she turned away immediately after giving him the money and reentered the parlour whereupon the youth thrust both hands into his breechespockets left the house and returned slowly to the city with the expression on his countenance of one who had seen a ghost  meanwhile captain bunting and ned sinton sat down with their host and hostess to a second breakfast over which the former related the circumstances of the double loss of his crew and cargo  you are unfortunate said mr thompson when the captain paused but there are hundreds in nearly the same predicament  many of the finelooking vessels you see in the harbour have lain helplessly there for months the crews having taken french leave and gone off to the diggings  its awkward said the captain with a troubled expression as he slowly raised a square lump of pork to his mouth what would you advise me to do  sell off the remnant of the cargo and set up a floating boardinghouse  the square lump of pork disappeared as the captain thrust it into his cheek in order to say what with a look of intense amazement  lizette laughed inadvertently and feeling that this was somewhat rude she in her effort to escape plunged deeper into misfortune by turning to sinton with a blushing countenance and asking him to take another cup of teaa proposal that was obviously absurd seeing that she had a moment before filled up his second cup  thus suddenly appealed to ned stammered thank youif youahno thank you not any more  set up a floating boarding establishment reiterated the merchant in a tone of decision that caused them all to laugh heartily  it may sound strange he continued but i assure you its not a bad speculation  the captain of an american schooner whose crew deserted the very day she arrived turned his vessel into a floating boardinghouse about two months ago and i believe hes making a fortune  indeed ejaculated the captain helping himself to another mass of pork and accepting lizettes proffer of a third cup of tea  you have no idea continued the merchant as he handed the bread to ned and pressed him to eatyou have no idea of the strange state of things here just now and the odd ways in which men make money  owing to the rush of immigrants everything is enormously dear and houseroom is not to be had for love or money so that if you were to fit up your ship for the purpose you could fill it at once  at the various hotels in the city an ordinary meal at the table dhote costs from two to three dollarseight and twelve shillings of our moneyand there are some articles that bear fabulous prices  its a fact that eggs at this moment sell at a shilling each and onions and potatoes at the same price but then wages are enormously high  how long this state of things will last no one can tell in the meantime hundreds of men are making fortunes  only the other day a ship arrived from new york and one of the passengers a cute fellow had brought out fifteen hundred copies of several newspapers which he sold for a dollar each in less than two hours  then rents are tremendous  you will scarcely believe me when i tell you that the rent paid by the landlord of one of the hotels here is 110000 dollarsabout 22000 poundsa year and it is but a poor building too  my own warehouse which is a building of only one storey with a front of twenty feet is rented to me at 40000 dollars8000 pounds a yearand rents are rising  ned and the captain leaned back in their chairs aghast at such statements and began to entertain some doubts as to the sanity of their host but the worthy merchant was a grave quiet man without a particle of romance in his composition and he went on coolly telling them facts which ned afterwards said made his hair almost stand on end when he thought of how little money he possessed and how much he would have to pay for the bare necessaries of life  after some further converse on men and things in general and on prospects at the mines mr thompson said and now captain bunting ill tell you what ill do  i will go down to your ship overhaul the cargo and make you an offer for the whole in the lump taking the saleable with the unsaleable  this will at any rate put you in funds at once and enable you to follow what course seems best  will that suit you  it will said the captain and thank ee  as for turning a boardinhouse keeper i dont think im cut out for it  neither is my friend sinton eh  certainly not answered ned laughing we might as well become washerwomen  youd make a pretty good thing of it if you did retorted mr thompson would they not lizette you know more about these things than i do  indeed i cannot tell papa as i do not know the capabilities of our friends in that way but i think the few washerwomen in the city must be making fortunes for they charge two shillings apiece for everything large and small  now then gentlemen said the merchant rising if you have quite finished we will walk down to the harbour and inspect the goods  an arch smile played round lizettes lips as she shook hands with ned at parting and she seemed on the point of speaking but checked herself  i beg pardon said ned pausing did you  oh it was nothing said lizette i was only going to remark that that if you set up in the washing line i shall be happy to give you all the work i can  ahem coughed ned gravely and if we should set up in the other line will you kindly come and board with us  hallo ned whats keeping you roared the captain  coming shouted ned as he ran after him  where has larry oneil gone  hes away down before us to have a look at the town  we shall find him i doubt not cruising about the quay  in a few minutes the three friends were wending their way through the crowded streets back to the shore    chapter seven  the fate of the roving bessgambling scenesmr sinton makes a new friendlarry oneil makes money in strange waysa murder and a beggars deathned becomes a poor mans heir  the remnant of the cargo of the roving bess proved to be worth comparatively littleless even than had been anticipated  after a careful inspection mr thompson offered to purchase it in the slump for 1000 dollarsabout 200 pounds sterling  this was a heavy blow to poor captain bunting who had invested his allthe savings of many yearsin the present unfortunate venture  however his was not a nature to brood over misfortunes that could not be avoided so he accepted the sum with the best grace he might and busied himself during the next few days in assisting the merchant to remove the bales  during this period he did not converse much with any one but meditated seriously on the steps he ought to take  from all that he heard it seemed impossible to procure hands to man the ship at that time so he began to entertain serious thoughts of taking his chance at the diggings after all  he was by nature averse to this however and had nearly made up his mind to try to beat up recruits for the ship when an event occurred that settled the matter for him rather unexpectedly this event was the bursting out of a hurricane or brief but violent squall which before assistance could be procured dragged the roving bess from her moorings and stranded her upon the beach just below the town  here was an end to seafaring prospects  the whole of his limited capital would not have paid for a tenth part of the labour necessary to refloat the ship so he resolved to leave her on the beach and go to the diggings  mr thompson advised him to sell the hull as it would fetch a good price for the sake of the timber which at that time was much wanted in the town but the captain had still a lurking hope that he might get his old ship afloat at some future period and would not hear of it  what said he sell the roving bess which stands a1 at lloyds to be broken up to build golddiggers houses  i trow not  no no let her lie where she is in peace  on the day after the squall as ned and the captain were standing on the shore regarding their late floating and now grounded home in sad silence a longlegged lanternjawed man in dirty canvas trousers long boots a rough coat and broad straw hat with an enormous cigar in his mouth and both hands in his trouserspockets walked up and accosted them  it did not require a second glance to know that he was a yankee  guess that eres pretty wall fixed up stranger he said addressing the captain and pointing with his nose to the stranded vessel  it is answered the captain shortly  fit for nothin but firewood i calculate  to this the captain made no reply  i say stranger continued the yankee i wouldnt mind to give e 1000 dollars for her slick off  i dont wish to sell her replied the captain  say 1500 replied the man  i tell you i wont sell her  no  now that is kurous  will e loan her then  here ned whispered a few words to the captain who nodded his head and turning to the yankee said  how much will you give  wall i reckon shes too far out to drive a screamin trade but i dont mind sayin 100 dollars a month  after some consultation with ned and a little more talk with the yankee captain bunting agreed to this proposal only stipulating that the bargain should hold good for a year that the hull should not be cut or damaged in any way and that the rent should be paid in advance into the hands of mr thompson as he himself was about to proceed to the goldfields  having sealed and settled this piece of business at a neighbouring tavern where the yankeemajor whitlawordered a brandysmash for himself and two ginslings for his companions which they civilly declined to his intense amazement the contracting parties separated  thats rather a sudden transfer of our good ship said ned laughing as they walked towards the plaza or principal square of the town where some of the chief hotels and gamblinghouses were situated  i feel half sorry for havin done it replied the captain however it cant be helped now so ill away to our friend thompsons office and tell him about it  then i shall wander about here until you return  it will be dinner time at the hotels two hours hence  suppose we meet at the parker house and talk over our future plans while we discuss a chop  to this the captain agreed and then hurried off to his friends office while ned entered the hotel  a large portion of this building was rented by gamblers who paid the enormous sum of 60000 dollars a year for it and carried on their villainous and degrading occupation in it night and day  the chief games played were monte and faro but no interest attached to the games as such the winning or losing of money was that which lent fascination to the play  ned had intended to stroll through the hotel and observe the various visitors who thronged the bar but the crash of a brass band in the gamblingsaloons awakened his curiosity and induced him to enter  the scene that met his eyes was perhaps the strangest and the saddest he had ever looked upon  the large saloon was crowded with representatives of almost every civilised nation under the sun  english scotch irish yankees french russians turks chinese mexicans indians malays jews and negroesall were there in their national costumes and all were more or less under the fascinating influence of the reigning vice of california and especially of san francisco  the jargon of excited voices can neither be conceived nor described  crowds surrounded the monte tables on which glittering piles of gold and silver coin were passing from hand to hand according to varying fortune  the characteristicsand we may add the worst passionsof the various nations were ever and anon brought strongly out  the german and spaniard laid down their money and lost or won without a symptom of emotion the turk stroked his beard as if with the view of keeping himself cool the russian looked stolid and indifferent the frenchman started frowned swore and occasionally clutched his concealed pistol or bowieknife while the yankee stamped and swore  but indeed the men of all nations cursed and swore in that terrible place  those who dwelt in the city staked gold and silver coin while the men just returned from the mines staked golddust and nuggets  these last were conspicuous from their rough clothing rugged bronzed and weatherworn countenances  many of them played most recklessly several successful diggers staked immense sums and either doubled or lost in two or three throws the hard earnings of many months of toil and left the rooms penniless  at one end of the saloon there was a counter with a plentiful supply of stimulants to feed the excitement of the wretched gamblers and the waiter here was kept in constant employment  ned had never been within the unhallowed precincts of a gamblinghouse before and it was with a feeling of almost superstitious dread that he approached the table and looked on  a tall burly bearded miner stepped forward at the moment and placed a huge purse of golddust on the table  now then he cried with a reckless air here goesneck or nothin  nothin he muttered with a fearful oath as the president raked the purse into his coffers  the man rose and strode sullenly from the room his fingers twitching nervously about the hilt of his bowieknife an action which the president observed but heeded not being prepared with a concealed revolver for whatever might occur  immediately another victim stepped forward staked five hundred dollarsand won  he staked again a thousand dollarsand won then he rose apparently resolved to tempt fickle fortune no more and left the saloon  as he retired his place was filled by a young man who laid down the small sum of two dollars fortune favoured this man for a long time and his pile of dollars gradually increased until he became overconfident and staked fully half of his gainsand lost  neds attention was drawn particularly to this player whom he thought he had seen before  on looking more fixedly at him he recognised the young porter who had carried up the box to the merchants house  his next stake was again made recklessly  he laid down all he possessed and lost  then he rose suddenly and drawing a pistol from his breast rushed towards the door  none of the players who crowded the saloon paid him more than momentary attention  it mattered not to them whether he meditated suicide or murder  they made way for him to pass and then closing in were deep again in the allabsorbing game  but our hero was not thus callous  a strong feeling of sympathy filled his breast prompting him to spring through the doorway and catch the youth by the shoulder just as he gained the street  he turned round instantly and presented the revolver at neds breast but the latter caught his right arm in his powerful grasp and held it in the air  be calm my poor fellow he said i mean you no harm i only wish to have a word of conversation with you  you are an englishman i perceive  the young mans head fell on his breast and he groaned aloud  come come said ned releasing his arm dont give way like that  im lost said the youth bitterly  i have struggled against this passion for gaming but it has overcome me again and again  it is vain to fight against it any longer  not a bit of it man said ned in a cheering tone as he drew the arm of the young man within his own and led him slowly along the street you are excited just now by your disappointments  let us walk together a while for i have something to say to you  i am quite a stranger here and its a comfort to have a countryman to talk with  the kind words and earnest hearty manner of our hero had the effect of soothing the agitated feelings of his new friend and of winning his confidence  in the course of halfanhour he drew from him a brief account of his past history  his name he said was collins he was the son of a clergyman and had received a good education  five years before the period of which we now write he had left his home in england and gone to sea being at that time sixteen years of age  for three years he served before the mast in a southsea whaleship and then returned home to find his father and mother dead  having no near relations alive and not a sixpence in the world he turned once more towards the sea with a heavy heart and an empty pocket obtained a situation as second mate in a trading vessel which was about to proceed to the sandwich islands  encountering a heavy gale on the western coast of south america his vessel was so much disabled as to be compelled to put into the harbour of san francisco for repairs  here the first violent attack of the goldfever had set in the rush of immigrants was so great that goods of all kinds were selling at fabulous prices and the few bales that happened to be on board the ship were disposed off for twenty times their value  the captain was in ecstasies and purposed sailing immediately to the nearest civilised port for a cargo of miscellaneous goods but the same fate befell him which afterwards befell captain bunting and many hundreds of othersthe crew deserted to the mines  thereupon the captain and young collins also betook themselves to the goldfields leaving the ship to swing idly at her anchor  like most of the first arrivals at the mines collins was very successful and would soonin diggers parlancehave made his pileie his fortune had not scurvy attacked and almost killed him compelling him to return to san francisco in search of fresh vegetables and medicine neither of which at that time could be obtained at the mines for love or money  he recovered slowly but living in san francisco was so expensive that ere his health was sufficiently recruited to enable him to return to the goldfields his funds were wellnigh exhausted  in order to recruit them he went in an evil hour to the gamingsaloons and soon became an inveterate gambler  in the providence of god he had been led some years before to become an abstainer from all intoxicating drinks and remaining firm to his pledge throughout the course of his downward career was thus saved from the rapid destruction which too frequently overtook those who to the exciting influences of gambling added the maddening stimulus of alcohol but the constant mental fever under which he laboured was beginning to undermine a naturallyrobust constitution and to unstring the nerves of a wellmade powerful frame  sometimes when fortune favoured him he became suddenly possessor of a large sum of money which he squandered in reckless gaiety often however following the dictates of an amiable sympathetic disposition he gave the most of it away to companions and acquaintances in distress  at other times he had not wherewith to pay for his dinner in which case he took the first job that offered in order to procure a few dollars  being strong and active he frequently went down to the quays and offered his services as a porter to any of the goldhunters who were arriving in shoals from all parts of the world  it was thus as we have seen that he first met with ned sinton and his friends  all this and a great deal more did ned worm out of his companion in the course of halfanhours stroll in the plaza  now said he when collins had finished im going to make a proposal to you  i feel very much interested in all that you have told me to be candid with you i like your looks and i like your voicein fact i like yourself andbut whats your christian name  tom replied the other  very well then ill call you tom in future and youll call me ned now tom you must come with me and captain bunting to the goldfields and try your fortune over againnay dont shake your head i know what you would say you have no money to equip yourself and you wont be indebted to strangers and all that sort of stuff but that wont do my boy  im not a stranger dont i know all your history from first to last  tom collins sighed  well perhaps i dont know it all but i know the most of it and besides i feel as if i had known you all my life  ned interrupted the other in an earnest tone of voice i feel your kindness very muchno one has spoken to me as you have done since i came to the diggingsbut i cannot agree to your proposal today  meet me at the parker house tomorrow at this time and i shall give you a final answer  but why not give it now  becausebecause i want toto get paid for a job i expect to get  tom said ned stopping and laying his hand on the shoulder of his companion while he looked earnestly into his face let us begin our friendship with mutual candour  do you not intend to make a few dollars and then try to increase them by another throw at the gamingtable  the youths brow flushed slightly as he answered you are right i had half an intention of trying my fortune for the last time  then said ned firmly and emphatically you shall do nothing of the sort  gambling for money is a mean pitiful contemptible thingdont frown my dear fellow i do not apply these terms to you i apply them to the principle of gamblinga principle which you do not hold as i know from your admission made to me not many minutes ago that you have often striven against the temptation  many men dont realise the full extent of the sinfulness of many of their practices but although that renders them less culpable it does not render them innocent much less does it justify the evil practices  gambling is all that i have styled it and a great deal worse and you must give it upi insist on it moreover tom i insist on your coming to dine with me at the parker house  i shall introduce you to my friend captain bunting whom you already know by sightso come along  well i will said tom smiling at his friends energy but still hanging back but you must permit me to go to my lodgings first  i shall be back immediately  very good  remember we dine in the course of an hour so be punctual  while tom collins hurried away to his lodgings ned sinton proceeded towards the shores of the bay in a remarkably happy frame of mind intending to pass his leisure hour in watching the thousands of interesting and amusing incidents that were perpetually taking place on the crowded quays where the passengers from a newlyarrived brig were looking in bewildered anxiety after their luggage and calling for porters where traffic by means of boats between the fleet and the land created constant confusion and hubbub where men of all nations bargained for the goods of all climes in every known tongue  while he gazed in silence at the exciting and almost bewildering scene his attention was attracted to a group of men among whose vociferating tones he thought he distinguished familiar voices  thats it heres your man sir cried one bursting from the crowd with a huge portmanteau on his shoulder  now then wherell i steer to  right ahead to the best hotel answered a slim yankee whose black coat patentleather boots and white kids in such a place told plainly enough that a superfine dandy had mistaken his calling  ay ay sir shouted bill jones as he brushed past ned in his new capacity of porter  faix yeve cotched a live yankee exclaimed a voice there was no mistaking as the owner slapped bill on the shoulder  hell make yer fortin av ye only stick by him  hes just cut out for the diggins av his mother wos here to take care of him  larry oneil gave a chuckle slapped his pockets and cut an elephantine caper as he turned from contemplating the retreating figure of his shipmates employer and advanced towards the end of the quay  now thin whos nixt cried he holding out both arms and looking excited as if he were ready to carry off any individual bodily in his arms to any place for mere love without reference to money  dont all spake at wance  tshoo dollars a mile for anythin onder a ton an yerself on the top of it for four  horoo mister sinton darlint is it yerself  och but this is the place intirelygoold and silver for the axin amost  ah ye neednt grin  look here  larry plunged both hands into the pockets of his trousers and pulled them forth full of half and quarter dollars with a few shining little nuggets of gold interspersed among them  ned opened his eyes in amazement and taking his excited comrade apart from the crowd asked how he had come by so much money  come by it he exclaimed ye could come by twice the sum av ye liked  sure didnt i find that they wos chargin tshoo dollarsaiqual to eight shillins im towldfor carryin a box or portmanter the length o me fut so i turns porter all at wance an faix i made six dollars in less nor an hour  but as i

youre an honest fellow and its a trate to meet wan here  capital cried ned laughing heartily and you didnt try for a letter after all  porter there shouted a voice from the quay  thats me yer honer  here ye are replied the irishman bounding away with a yell and shouldering a huge leathern trunk with which he vanished from the scene leaving ned to pursue the train of thought evoked by his account of his remarkable experiences  we deem it necessary here to assure the reader that the account given by larry oneil of his doings was by no means exaggerated  the state of society and the eccentricities of traffic displayed in san francisco and other californian cities during the first years of the goldfever beggars all description  writers on that place and period find difficulty in selecting words and inventing similes in order to convey anything like an adequate idea of their meaning  even eyewitnesses found it almost impossible to believe the truth of what they heard and saw and some have described the whole circle of life and manners there to have been more like to the wild incongruous whirl of a pantomime than to the facts of real life  even in the close and abrupt juxtaposition of the ludicrous and the horrible this held good  ned sinton had scarcely parted from his hilarious shipmate when he was attracted by shouts as if of men quarrelling in a gaminghouse and a few moments later the report of a pistol was heard followed by a sharp cry of agony  rushing into the house and forcing his way through the crowd he reached the table in time to see the bloody corpse of a man carried out  this unfortunate had repeatedly lost large sums of money and growing desperate staked his all on a final chance  he lost and drawing his bowieknife in the heat of despair rushed at the president of the table  a dozen arms arrested him and rendered his intended assault abortive nevertheless the president coolly drew a revolver from under the cloth and shot him dead  for a few minutes there was some attempt at disturbance and some condemned while others justified the act  but the body was removed and soon the game went on again as if nothing had occurred  sickened with the sight ned hurried from the house and walked rapidly towards the shores of the bay beyond the limits of the canvas town where he could breathe the free ocean air and wander on the sands in comparative solitude  the last straggling tent in that quarter was soon behind bun and he stopped by the side of an old upturned boat against which he leaned and gazed out upon the crowded bay with saddened feelings  as he stood in contemplation he became aware of a sound as if of heaving plethoric breathing under the boat  starting up he listened intently and heard a faint groan  he now observed what had escaped his notice before that the boat against which he leaned was a human habitation  a small hole near the keel admitted light and possibly at times emitted smoke  hastening round to the other side he discovered a small aperture which served as a doorway  it was covered with a rag of coarse canvas which he lifted and looked in  whos there inquired a voice as sharply as extreme weakness would allow  have a care  theres a revolver pointing at your head  if you come in without leave ill blow out your brains  i am a friend said ned looking towards the further end of the boat where on a couch of straw lay the emaciated form of a middleaged man put down your pistol friend my presence here is simply owing to the fact that i heard you groan and i would relieve your distress if it is in my power  you are the first that has said so since i lay down here sighed the man falling back heavily  ned entered and advancing as well as he could in a stooping posture sat down beside the sick mans pallet and felt his pulse  then he looked anxiously in his face on which the hand of death was visibly placed  my poor fellow said ned in a soothing tone you are very ill i fear  have you no one to look after you  ill replied the sick man almost fiercely i am dying  i have seen death too often and know it too well to be mistaken  his voice sank to a whisper as he added it is not far off now  for a few seconds ned could not make up his mind what to say  he felt unwilling to disturb the last moments of the man  at last he leaned forward and repeated from memory several of the most consoling passages of scripture  twice over he said though thy sins be as scarlet they shall be white as wool and him that cometh unto me christ i will in no wise cast out  the man appeared to listen but made no reply  suddenly he started up and leaning on his elbow looked with an awfully earnest stare into neds face  young man gold is goodgold is goodremember that if you dont make it your god  after a pause he continued i made it my god  i toiled for it night and day in heat and cold wet and dry  i gave up everything for it i spent all my time in search of itand i got itand what good can it do me now  i have spent night and day here for weeks threatening to shoot any one who should come near my goldha he added sharply observing that his visitor glanced round the apartment youll not find it here  no look look round peer into every corner tear up every plank of my boat and youll find nothing but rotten wood and dust and rusty nails  be calm my friend said ned who now believed that the poor mans mind was wandering i dont want your gold i wish to comfort you if i can  would you like me to do anything for you after  after im dead said the man abruptly  no nothing  i have no relationsno friendsno enemies even now  yes he added quickly i have one friend  you are my friend  you have spoken kindly to mea beggar  you deserve the name of friend  listen i want you to be my heir  see here i have had my will drawn up long ago with the place for the name left blank i had intendedbut no matterwhat is your name  edward sinton  here hand me that inkhorn and the pen  there continued the man pushing the paper towards him i have made over to you the old boat and the ground it lies on  both are mine  the piece of ground is marked off by four posts  take care of the  the mans voice sank to a mere whisper then it ceased suddenly  when ned looked at him again he started for the cold hand of death had sealed his lips for ever  a feeling of deep intense pity filled the youths heart as he gazed on the emaciated form of this friendless manyet he experienced a sensation approaching almost to gladness when he remembered that the last words he had spoken to him were those of our blessed saviour to the chief of sinners  spreading the ragged piece of canvas that formed a quilt over the dead mans face he rose and left the strange dwelling the entrance to which he secured and then hastened to give information of the death to the proper authorities  ned was an hour too late for dinner when he arrived at the hotel where he found captain bunting and his new friend awaiting him in some anxiety  hastily informing them of the cause of his detention he introduced them to each other and forgot for a time the scene of death he had just witnessed in talking over plans for the future and in making arrangements for a trip to the diggings    chapter eight  our hero and his friends start for the diggingsthe captains portraitcostumes and scenery and surprisesthe ranche by the roadsidestrange travellersthey meet with a new friend and adopt himthe hunters storylarry offers to fight a yankeehigh prices and empty purses  ovid never accomplished a metamorphosis more striking or complete than that effected by captain bunting upon his own proper person  we have said elsewhere that the worthy captain was a big broad man with a shaggy head of hair and red whiskers  moreover when he landed in san francisco he wore a blue coat with clear brass buttons blue vest blue trousers and a glazed straw hat but in the course of a week he effected such a change in his outward man that his most intimate friend would have failed to recognise him  no brigand of the pyrenees ever looked more savageno robber of the stage ever appeared more outrageously fierce  we do not mean to say that captain bunting got himself up for the purpose of making himself conspicuous  he merely donned the usual habiliments of a miner but these habiliments were curious and the captains figure in them was unusually remarkable  in order that the reader may have a satisfactory view of the captain we will change the scene and proceed at once to that part of the road to the goldfields which has now been reached by our adventurers  it is a wide plain or prairie on which the grass waves like the waters of the sea  on one side it meets the horizon on another it is bounded by the faint and fardistant range of the sierra nevada  thousands of millions of beautiful wildflowers spangle and beautify the soft green carpet over which spreads a cloudless sky not a whit less blue and soft than the vaunted sky of italy  herds of deer are grazing over the vast plain like tame cattle  wild geese and other waterfowl wing their way through the soft atmosphere and little birds twitter joyously among the flowers  everything is bright and green and beautiful for it is spring and the sun has not yet scorched the grass to a russetbrown and parched and cracked the thirsty ground and banished animal and vegetable life away as it will yet do ere the hot summer of those regions is past and gone  there is but one tree in all that vast plain  it is a sturdy oak and near it bubbles a cool refreshing spring over which one could fancy it had been appointed guardian  the spot is hundreds of miles from san francisco on the road to the goldmines of california  beneath that solitary oak a party of weary travellers have halted to rest and refresh themselves and their animals or as the diggers have it to take their nooning  in the midst of that party sits our captain on the back of a longlegged mule  on his head is or rather wasfor he has just removed it in order to wipe the perspiration from his foreheada brown felt wideawake very much battered in appearance suggesting the idea that the captain had used it constantly as a nightcap which indeed is the fact  nothing but a flannel shirt of the brightest possible scarlet clothes the upper portion of his burly frame while brown corduroys adorn the lower boots of the most ponderous dimensions engulf not only his feet but his entire legs leaving only a small part of the corduroys visible  on his heels or rather just above his heels are strapped a pair of enormous mexican spurs with the frightful prongs of which he so lacerated the sides of his unfortunate mule during the first part of the journey as to drive that animal frantic and cause it to throw him off at least six times a day  dire necessity has now however taught the captain that most difficult and rarelyaccomplished feat of horsemanship to ride with the toes well in and the heels well out  round captain buntings waist is a belt which is of itself quite a study  it is made of tough cowhide full two and a half inches broad and is fastened by a brass buckle that would cause the mouth of a robberchief to water  attached to it in various ways and places are the following articlesa bowieknife of the largest sizenot far short of a small cutlass a pair of revolving pistols also large and having six barrels each a stout leathern purse and a leathern bag of larger dimensions for miscellaneous articles  as the captain has given up shaving for many weeks past little of his face is visible except the nose eyes and forehead  all besides is a rugged mass of red hair which rough travel has rendered an indescribable and irreclaimable waste  but the captain cares not as long as he can clear a passage through the brushwood to his mouth he says his mind is easy  such is captain bunting and such with but trifling modifications is every member of his party  on ned sinton and his almost equally stalwart and handsome friend tom collins the picturesque costume of the miner sits well and it gives a truly wild dashing look to the whole party as they stand beneath the shade of that lovely oak preparing to refresh themselves with biscuit and jerked beef and pipes of esteemed tobacco  besides those we have mentioned larry oneil is therebusy carrying water in a bucket to the horses and as proud of his mexican spurs as if they were the golden spurs of the days of chivalry  bill jones is there with a blue instead of a redflannel shirt and coarse canvas ducks in place of corduroys  bill affects the sailor in other respects for he scorns heavy boots and wears shoes and a straw hat but he is compelled to wear the spurs for reasons best known to his intensely obstinate mule  there is also among them a native californiana vaquero or herdwho has been hired to accompany the party to the diggings to look after the packmules of which there are two and to assist them generally with advice and otherwise  he is a fine athletic fellowspanishlike both in appearance and costume and in addition to bad spanish gives utterance to a few sounds which he calls encleesh  the upper part of his person is covered by the serape or mexican cloak which is simply a blanket with a hole in its centre through which the head of the wearer is thrust the rest being left to fall over the shoulders  our travellers had reached the spot on which we now find them by means of a boat voyage of more than a hundred miles partly over the great bay of san francisco and partly up the sacramento river until they reached the city of sacramento  here they purchased mules and provisions for the overland journey to the minesa further distance of about a hundred and fifty milesand also the picks shovels axes pewter plates spoons pans and pannikins and other implements and utensils that were necessary for a campaign among the golden mountains of the sierra nevada  for these the prices demanded were so enormous that when all was ready for a start they had only a few dollars left amongst them but being on their way to dig for gold they felt little concern on this head  as the indians of the interior had committed several murders a short time before and had come at various times into collision with the golddiggers it was deemed prudent to expend a considerable sum on arms and ammunition  each man therefore was armed with a rifle or carbine a pistol of some sort and a large knife or short sword  captain bunting selected a huge old bellmouthed blunderbuss having as he said a strong partiality for the weapons of his forefathers  among other things ned by advice of tom collins purchased a few simple medicines he also laid in a stock of drawingpaper pencils and watercolours for his own special use for which he paid so large a sum that he was ashamed to tell it to his comrades but he was resolved not to lose the opportunity of representing life and scenery at the diggings for the sake of old mr shirley as well as for his own satisfaction  thus equipped they set forth  before leaving san francisco the captain and ned and tom collins had paid a final visit to their friend the merchant mr thompson and committed their property to his careie the hull of the good ship roving bessthe rent of which he promised to collect monthlyand neds curious property the old boat and the little patch of barren sand on which it stood  the boat itself he made over temporarily to a poor irishman who had brought out his wife with him and was unable to proceed to the diggings in consequence of the said wife having fallen into a delicate state of health  he gave the man a written paper empowering him to keep possession until his return and refused to accept of any rent whereat the poor woman thanked him earnestly with the tears running down her pale cheeks  it was the hottest part of an exceedingly hot day when the travellers found themselves as we have described under the grateful shade of what larry termed the lone oak  now our course of proceeding is as follows said ned at the conclusion of their mealwe shall travel all this afternoon and as far into the night as the mules can be made to go  by that time we shall be pretty well off the level ground and be almost within hail of the diggings  i dont belave it said larry oneil knocking the ashes out of his pipe in an emphatic manner sure av there was goold in the country we might have seed it by this time  larrys feelings were a verification of the words hope deferred maketh the heart sick  he had started enthusiastically many days before on this journey to the gold regions under the full conviction that on the first or second day he would be as he expressed it riding through fields of goold dust instead of which day after day passed and night after night during which he endured all the agonies inseparable from a first journey on horseback and still not a symptom of gold was to be seen no more nor in owld ireland itself  but larry bore his disappointments like an irishman and defied fortin to put him out of timper by any manes wotiver  patience said bill jones removing his pipe to make room for the remark is a wirtuethats wot i says  if ye cant make things better wot then why let em alone  wen theres no wind crowd all canvas and ketch wot there is  wen there is wind why then steer yer course or if ye cant steer as near it as ye can  anyhow never back yer foretopsail without a causethems my sentiments  and very good sentiments they are bill said tom collins jumping up and examining the girth of his horse i strongly advise you to adopt them larry  wot a bottle o wisdom it is said oneil with a look of affected contempt at his messmate  wos it yer grandmother now or yer great wan that edicated yearrah there ye go  oh morther yell break me heart  the latter part of this remark was addressed to his mule which at that moment broke its laryat and gambolled gaily away over the flowering plain  its owner followed yelling like a madman  he might as well have chased the wind and it is probable that he would never have mounted his steed again had not the vaquero come to his aid  this man leaping on his own horse which was a very fine one dashed after the runaway with which he came up in a few minutes then grasping the long coil of line that hung at his saddlebow he swung it round once or twice and threw the lasso or noose adroitly over the mules head and brought it up  yer a cliver fellow said larry as he came up panting sure ye did it be chance  the man smiled and without deigning a reply rode back to the camp where the party were already in the saddle  in a few minutes they were trotting rapidly over the prairie  before evening closed the travellers arrived at one of the roadside inns or as they were named ranches which were beginning at this time to spring up in various parts of the country for the accommodation of goldhunters on their way to the mines  this ranche belonged to a man of the name of dawson who had made a few hundred dollars by digging and then set up a grogshop and house of entertainment being wise enough to perceive that he could gain twice as much gold by supplying the diggers with the necessaries of life than he could hope to procure by digging  his ranche was a mere hovel built of sundried bricks and he dealt more in drinks than in edibles  the accommodation and provisions were of the poorest description but as there was no other house of entertainment near mine host charged the highest possible prices  there was but one apartment in this establishment and little or no furniture  several kegs and barrels supported two long pine planks which constituted at different periods of the day the counter the gamingtable and the table dhote  a large cooking stove stood in the centre of the house but there were no chairs guests were expected to sit on boxes and empty casks or stand  beds there were none  when the hour for rest arrived each guest chose the portion of the earthen floor that suited him best and spreading out his blankets with his saddle for a pillow lay down to dream of golden nuggets or perchance of home while innumerable ratsthe bane of california gambolled round and over him  the ranchero as the owner of such an establishment is named was said to be an escaped felon  certainly he might have been as far as his looks went  he was surly and morose but men minded this little so long as he supplied their wants  there were five or six travellers in the ranche when our party arrived all of whom were awaiting the preparation of supper  here we are cried the captain as they trotted into the yard ready for supper i trow and if my nose dont deceive me suppers about ready for us  i hope theyve got enough for us all said ned glancing at the party inside as he leaped from the saddle and threw the bridle to his vaquero  halloo boniface have ye room for a large party in there  come in an see growled dawson whose duties at the cooking stove rendered him indifferent as to other matters  ah thin yeve got a swate voice said larry oneil sarcastically as he led his mule towards a post to which bill jones was already fastening his steed  i say bill he added pointing to a little tin bowl which stood on an inverted cask outside the door of the ranche wot can that be for  dunno answered bill spose its to wash in  at that moment a long cadaverous miner came out of the hut and rendered further speculation unnecessary by turning up his shirt sleeves to the elbow and commencing his ablutions in the little tin bowl which was just large enough to admit both his hands at once  faix yer mouth and nose ought to be grateful said larry in an undertone as he and jones stood with their arms crossed admiring the proceedings of the man  this remark had reference to the fact that the washer applied the water to the favoured regions around his nose and mouth but carefully avoided trespassing on any part of the territory lying beyond  oh morther wot nixt exclaimed larry  well might he inquire for this man having combed his hair with a public comb which was attached to the doorpost by a string and examined himself carefully in a bit of glass about two inches in diameter proceeded to cleanse his teeth with a public toothbrush which hung beside the comb  all these articles had been similarly used by a miner ten minutes previously and while this one was engaged with his toilet another man stood beside him awaiting his turn  wen yer in difficulties remarked bill jones slowly as he entered the ranche and proceeded to fill his pipe git out of em if ye can if ye cant why wot then circumstances is adwerse an its o no use atryin to mend em  only my sentiments is that ill delay washin till i comes to a river  youve come from san francisco stranger said a roughlooking man in heavy boots and a guernsey shirt addressing captain bunting  maybe i have replied the captain regarding his interrogator through the smoke of his pipe which he was in the act of lighting  goin to the diggins i spose  yes  bin there before  no  nor none o your party i expect  none except one  youll be goin up to the bar at the american forks now i calclate  dont know that i am  perhaps youll try the northern diggins  perhaps  how long this pertinacious questioner might have continued his attack on the captain is uncertain had he not been suddenly interrupted by the announcement that supper was ready so he swaggered off to the corner of the hut where an imposing row of bottles stood demanded a brandysmash which he drank and then seating himself at the table along with the rest of the party proceeded to help himself largely to all that was within his reach  the fare was substantial but not attractive  it consisted of a large junk of boiled salt beef a mass of rancid pork and a tray of broken shipbiscuit  but hungry men are not particular so the viands were demolished in a remarkably short space of time  im amost out o supplies said the host in a sort of apologetic tone an the cart i sent down to sacramento some weeks ago for mores not come back  better than nothin remarked a bronzed weatherbeaten hunter as he helped himself to another junk of pork  if ye would send out yer boy into the hills with a rifle now an again yed git lots o grizzly bars  are grizzlybears eaten here inquired ned sinton pausing in the act of mastication to ask the question  eaten exclaimed the hunter in surprise in coorse they is  theyre uncommon good eatin too i guess  many a one ive killed an eaten myself an i like em better than beefi do  i shot one up in the hills there two days agone an supped off him but bein in a hurry i left the carcase to the coyotes  coyotes are small wolves  the men assembled round the rude table dhote were fifteen in number including our adventurers and represented at least six different nationsenglish scotch irish german yankee and chinese  most of them however were yankees and all were golddiggers even the hunter just referred to although he had not altogether forsaken his former calling devoted much of his time to searching for gold  some like our friends were on their way to the diggings for the first time others were returning with provisions which they had travelled to sacramento city to purchase and one or two were successful diggers who had made their pilesin other words their fortunesand were returning home with heavy purses of golddust and nuggets  good humour was the prevailing characteristic of the party for each man was either successful or sanguinely hopeful and all seemed to be affected by a sort of undercurrent of excitement as they listened to or related their adventures at the mines  there was only one serious drawback to the scene and that was the perpetual and terrible swearing that mingled with the conversation  the americans excelled in this wicked practice  they seemed to labour to invent oaths not for the purpose of venting angry feelings but apparently with the view of giving emphasis to their statements and assertions  the others swore from habit  they had evidently ceased to be aware that they were using oathsso terribly had familiarity with sinful practices blunted the consciences of men who in early life would probably have trembled in this way to break the law of god  yes by the way there was one other drawback to the otherwise picturesque and interesting group and this was the spitting propensity of the yankees  all over the floorthat floor too on which other men besides themselves were to reposethey discharged tobaccojuice and spittle  the nation cannot be too severely blamed and pitied for this disgusting practice yet we feel a tendency not to excuse but to deal gently with individuals most of whom having been trained to spitting from their infancy cannot be expected even to understand the abhorrence with which the practice is regarded by men of other nations  nevertheless brother jonathan it is not too much to expect that you ought to respect the universal condemnation of your spitting propensitiesby travellers from all landsand endeavour to believe that ejecting saliva promiscuously is a dirty practice even although you cannot feel it  we think that if you had the moral courage to pass a law in congress to render spitting on floors and carpets a capital offence you would fill the world with admiration and your own bosoms with selfrespect not to mention the benefit that would accrue to your digestive powers in consequence thereof  all of the supper party were clad and armed in the roughandready style already referred to and most of them were men of the lower ranks but there were one or two who like ned sinton had left a more polished class of mortals to mingle in the promiscuous crowd  these in some cases carried their manners with them and exerted a modifying influence on all around  one young american in particular named maxton soon attracted general attention by the immense fund of information he possessed and the urbane gentlemanly manner in which he conveyed it to those around him  he possessed in an eminent degree those qualities which attract men at once and irresistibly good nature frankness manliness considerable knowledge of almost every subject that can be broached in general conversation united with genuine modesty  when he sat down to table he did not grasp everything within his reach he began by offering to carve and help others and when at length he did begin to eat he did not gobble  he guessed a little it is true and calculated occasionally but when he did so it was in a tone that fell almost as pleasantly on the ear as the brogue of old ireland  ned happened to be seated beside maxton and held a good deal of conversation with him  forgive me if i appear inquisitive said the former helping himself to a handful of broken biscuit but i cannot help expressing a hope that our routes may lie in the same directionare you travelling towards sacramento city or the mines  towards the mines and as i observed that your party came from the southward i suppose you are going in the same direction  if so i shall be delighted to join you  thats capital replied ned we shall be the better of having our party strengthened and i am quite certain we could not have a more agreeable addition to it  thank you for the compliment  as to the advantage of a strong party i feel it a safeguard as well as a privilege to join yours for to say truth the roads are not safe just now  several lawless scoundrels have been roving about in this part of the country committing robberies and even murder  the indians too are not so friendly as one could wish they have been treated badly by some of the unprincipled miners and their custom is to kill two whites for every redman that falls  they are not particular as to whom they kill consequently the innocent are frequently punished for the guilty  this is sad replied ned  are then all the indian tribes at enmity with the white men  by no means  many tribes are friendly but some have been so severely handled that they have vowed revenge and take it whenever they can with safety  their only weapons however are bows and arrows so that a few resolute white men with rifles can stand against a hundred of them and they know this well  i spent the whole of last winter on the yuba river and although large bands were in my neighbourhood they never ventured to attack us openly but they succeeded in murdering one or two miners who strayed into the woods alone  and are these murders passed over without any attempt to bring the murderers to justice  i guess they are not replied maxton smiling but justice is strangely administered in these parts  judge lynch usually presides and he is a stern fellow to deal with  if you listen to what the hunter there is saying just now you will hear a case in point if i mistake not  as maxton spoke a loud laugh burst from the men at the other end of the table  how did it happen cried several  out wi the yarn old boy  ay an dont spin it too tight or faix yell burst the strands cried larry oneil who during the last halfhour had been listening openmouthed to the marvellous anecdotes of grizzlies and redskins with which the hunter entertained his audience  wall boys it happened this ways began the man tossing off a ginsling and setting down the glass with a violence that nearly smashed it  ye see i wos up in the mountains near the head waters o the sacramento lookin out for deer and gittin a bit o gold now an again when one day as i was acomin down a gully in the hills i comes all of a suddint on two men  one wos an injun as ugly a sinner as iver i seed tother wos a yankee lad in a hole diggin gold before my two eyes were well on them the red villain lets fly an arrow and the man fell down with a loud yell into the hole  up goes my rifle like wink and the redskin would ha gone onder in another second but my piece snappedcause why the primin had got damp an afore i could prime agin he was gone  i went up to the poor critter and sure enough it wos all up with him the arrow went in at the back o his neck  he niver spoke again  so i laid him in the grave he had dug for himself and sot off to tell the camp  an a most tremendous row the news made  they got fifty volunteers in no time and went off hotfut to scalp the whole nation as i had other business to look after and there seemed more than enough o fightin men i left them and went my way  two days after i had occasion to go back to the same place an when i comed in sight o the camp i guess there was a mighty stir  wots to do says i to a miner in a hole who wos diggin away for gold and carin nothin about it  only scraggin an injun he said lookin up  oh says i ill go and see  so off i sot and there wos a crowd o about two hundred miners round a tree and jest as i come up they wos puttin the rope round the neck of a poor wretch of an old greyhaired redskin whose limbs trembled so that they wos scarce able to hold him up  heave away now bill cried the man as tied the noose  but somethin was wrong with the hitch o the rope round the branch o the tree an it wouldnt draw and some time wos spent in puttin it right  i felt sorter sorry for the old man for his grave face was bold enough and age more than fear had to do with the tremblin o his legs before they got it right again my eye fell on a small band o redskins who were lookin quietly on and foremost among them the very blackguard as shot the man in the galley  i knew him at once by his ugly face  without sayin a word i steps forard to the old injun and takes the noose off his neck  halloo cried a dozen men jumpin at me  wots that for  scrag the hunter cries one  howld yer long tongues an hear what hes got to say shouts an irishman  keep your minds easy says i mountin a stump an seize that injun or ill have to put a ball into him before he gits offfor ye see i obsarved the black villain took fright and was sneakin away through the crowd  they had no doubt who i meant for i pinted straight at him and before ye could wink he was gripped and led under the tree with a face paler than ever i saw the face o a redskin before  now says i wot for are ye scraggin this old man  so they told me how the party that went off to git the murderer met a band o injuns comin to deliver him up to be killed they said for murderin the white man  an they gave up this old injun sayin he wos the murderer the diggers believed it and returned with the old boy and two or three others that came to see him fixed off  very good says i ye dont seem to remimber that im the man what saw the murder and told ye of it  by good luck ive come in time to point him outan this is him  an with that i put the noose round the villains neck and drawed it tight  at that he made a great start to shake it off and clear away but before you could wink he was swingin at the branch o the tree twinty feet in the air  sarved him right cried several of the men emphatically as the hunter concluded his anecdote  ay he continued an they strung up his six friends beside him  sarved em right too remarked the tall man whose partiality for the tin washhand basin and the toothbrush we have already noticed  if i had my way id shoot em all off the face o the arth i would right away  im sorry to hear they did that remarked larry oneil looking pointedly at the last speaker for it only shewed they was greater mortherers nor the injunsthe redskins morthered wan man but the diggers morthered six  an who are you that finds fault wi the diggers inquired the tall man turning full round upon the irishman with a tremendous oath  be the mortial cried the irishman starting up like a jackinthebox and throwing off his coat im larry oneil at yer sarvice  hooroo come on av ye want to be purtily worked off  instantly the mans hand was on the hilt of his revolver but before he could draw it the rest of the company started up and overpowered the belligerents  come gentlemen said the host of the ranche stepping forward its not worth while quarrelling about a miserable redskin  put on your coat larry and come lets get ready for a start said ned you cant afford to fight till youve made your fortune at the diggings  how far is it to the next ranche landlord  this cool attempt to turn the conversation was happily successful  the next ranche he was told was about ten miles distant and the road comparatively easy so as it was a fine moonlight night and he was desirous of reaching the first diggings on the following day as early as possible the horses and mules were saddled and the bill called for  when the said bill was presented or rather announced to them our travellers opened their eyes pretty wide they had to open their purses pretty wide too and empty them to such an extent that there was not more than a dollar left among them all  the supper which we have described cost them two and a half dollars about ten shillings and sixpence a head including a glass of bad brandy but not including a bottle of stout which larry in the ignorance and innocence of his heart had asked for and which cost him three dollars extra  an egg also which ned had obtained cost him a shilling  oh morther exclaimed larry why didnt ye tell us the price before we tuck them  why didnt ye ax retorted the landlord  its all right remarked maxton  prices vary at the diggings as you shall find ere long  when provisions run short the prices become exorbitant when plentiful they are more moderate but they are never low  however men dont mind much for most diggers have plenty of gold  captain bunting and bill jones were unable to do more than sigh out their amazement and shake their heads as they left the ranche and mounted their steeds in doing which the captain accidentally as usual drove both spurs into the sides of his mule which caused it to execute a series of manoeuvres and pirouettes that entertained the company for a quarter of an hour after which they rode away over the plain  it was a beautiful country through which they now ambled pleasantly undulating and partially wooded with fine stretches of meadow land between from which the scent of myriads of wildflowers rose on the cool night air  the moon sailed low in a perfectly cloudless sky casting the shadows of the horsemen far before them as they rode and clothing hill and dale bush and tree with a soft light as if a cloud of silver gauze had settled down upon the scene  the incident in the ranche was quickly banished and each traveller committed himself silently to the full enjoyment of the beauties around himbeauties which appeared less like reality than a vision of the night    chapter nine  a night ride in the woodsthe encampmentlarrys first attempt to dig for goldan alarma suspicious strangerqueer creatures  in less than two hours the travellers reached the second ranche which was little better in appearance or accommodation than the one they had left  having no funds they merely halted to water their cattle and then pushed forward  the country became more and more undulating and broken as they advanced and beyond the second ranche assumed the appearance of a hill country the valleys were free from trees though here and there occurred dense thickets of underwood in which maxton told them that grizzlybears loved to dwella piece of information that induced most of the party to carry their rifles in a handy position and glance suspiciously at every shadow  large oaks and baytrees covered the lower slopes of the hills while higher up the white oak and fir predominated  about an hour after midnight the moon began to descend towards the horizon and ned sinton who had been unanimously elected commander of the little band called a halt in the neighbourhood of a rivulet which flowed round the base of an abrupt cliff whose sides were partially clothed with scrubby bushes  we shall encamp here for the night comrades said he dismounting here is water and food for our nags a fine piece of greensward to spread our blankets on and a thickleaved oak to keep the dew off us now maxton you are an old campaigner let us see how soon youll have a fire blazing  ill have it ready before you get the camp kettles and pans out answered maxton fastening his horse to a tree seizing an axe and springing into the woods on the margin of the stream  and captain bunting continued ned do you water the horses and mules our vaquero will help you  jones will unpack the provender  tom collins and i will see to getting supper ready  an may i ax commodore said larry oneil touching his hat wot im to do  keep out of everybodys way and do what you pleases larry  which manes im to make myself ginerally useful so here goes  and larry springing through the bushes proceeded to fulfil his duties by seizing a massive log which maxton had just cut and heaving it on his powerful shoulder carried it to the camp  each was immediately busied with his respective duties  bustling activity prevailed for the space of a quarter of an hour the result of which was that before the moon left them in total darkness the ruddy glare of a magnificent fire lighted up the scene brilliantly glanced across the sunburnt faces and vivid red shirts of our adventurers as they clustered round it and threw clouds of sparks in among the leaves of the stout old oak that overspread the camp  now this is what i call uncommon jolly said captain bunting sitting down on his saddle before the cheerful blaze rubbing his hands and gazing round with a smile of the utmost benignity on his broad hairy countenance  it is replied maxton with an approving nod  do you know i have often thought captain that an indian life must be a very pleasant one  av coorse it must interrupted larry who at that moment was luxuriating in the first rich voluminous puffs of a newlyfilled pipeav coorse it must if its always like this  ay continued maxton but thats what i was just going to remark uponits not always like this  as a general rule i have observed men who are new to backwoods life live at first in a species of terrestrial paradise  the novelty and the excitement cause them to revel in all that is enjoyable and to endure with indifference all that is disagreeable sometimes even to take pleasure in shewing how stoically they can put up with discomfort  but after a time the novelty and excitement wear away and then it is usual to hear the praises of indian life spoken of immediately before and immediately after supper towards midnightparticularly if it should rain or mosquitoes be numerousmen change their minds and begin to dream of home if they can sleep or to wish they were there if they cant  get out you horrid philosopher cried tom collin as he gazed wistfully into the iron pot whose savoury contents ie pork flour and beans he was engaged in stirring  dont try to dash the cup of romance from our lips ere we have tasted it  believe me comrades our friend maxton is a humbug  i am an old stager myself have lived the life of an indian for months and months together and i declare to you im as jolly and enthusiastic now as ever i was  that may be quite true observed maxton seeing that it is possible you may have never been jolly or enthusiastic at all but even taking your words as you mean them to be understood they only tend to enforce what i have said for you know the exception proves the rule  bah you sophisticator ejaculated tom again inspecting the contents of the pot  och let him spake an be aisy remarked larry with a look of extreme satisfaction on his countenance were in the navelty an excitement stage o life just now an faix well kape it up as long as we can  hand me a cinder bill jones an dont look as if ye wos meditatin wot to say for ye know that ye cant say nothin  bill took no further notice of this remark than to lift a glowing piece of charcoal from the fire with his fingers as deliberately as if they were made of iron and hand it to oneil who received it in the same cool manner and relighted his pipe therewith  it strikes me we shall require all our jollity and enthusiasm to keep up our spirits if we dont reach the diggings tomorrow said ned sinton as he busied himself in polishing the blade of a superb huntingknife which had been presented to him by a few college friends at parting you all know that our funds are exhausted and its awkward to arrive at a ranche without a dollar to pay for a mealstill more awkward to be compelled to encamp beside a ranche and unpack our own provisions especially if it should chance to be a wet night  do you think we shall manage to reach the diggings tomorrow maxton  i am certain of it  twelve miles will bring us to little creek as it is called where we can begin to take initiative lessons in goldwashing  in fact the ground we stand on i have not a doubt has much gold in it  but we have not the means of washing it yet  larry oneil caught his breath on hearing this statement  dye mane to tell me he said slowly and with emphasis that im maybe sittin at this minute on the top o rale goold  you may be answered maxton laughing  wen ye dont know remarked bill jones sententiously removing the pipe from his lips and looking fixedly at his messmate wen ye dont know wots under ye nor the coorse o nature wich is always more or less adoin things oncommon an out o the way ye shouldnt ought to speckilate on wot ye know nothin about until ye find out hows her head an wich way the land lies  thems my sentiments  halloo  larry cried the captain and tom collins simultaneously look out for the kettle  itll boil over  larrys feelings had been deeply stirred at that moment so that the union of the sudden shout with the profundity of bills remark had the effect of causing him to clutch at the teakettle with such haste that he upset it into the fire  oh bad luck to ye  clumsy fellow ejaculated ned  off with you to the creek and refill it  larry obeyed promptly but the mischance after all was trifling for the fire was fierce enough to have boiled a twentygallon caldron in a quarter of an hour  besides the contents of the iron pot had to be discussed before the tea was wanted  in a few minutes supper was ready and all were about to begin when it was discovered that oneil was missing  ho  larry come to supper shouted one  hi where are you cried another  but there was no reply until the captain put both hands to his mouth and gave utterance to the nautical halloo with which in days gone by he was wont to hail the lookout at the maintop  ay ay comin sirr floated back on the night wind and shortly afterwards the irishman stumbled into camp with his hands his face and his clothes plentifully bedaubed with mud  why what have you been about inquired ned  diggin for goold sure  ive made a hole in the banks o the creek with me two hands that ye might bury a young buffalo in an sorrow a bit o goold have i got for me pains  a general laugh greeted the enthusiastic digger as he wiped his hands and sat down to supper  musha av i didnt git goold ive dug up a mortial big appetite anyhow  hand me the wooden spoon mister collins its more the gauge o me pratietrap than the pewter wans  dye know comrades im amost sure i seed an injun in the bush  av it wasnt it was a ghost  what like was he  look there and judge for yourselves cried oneil jumping suddenly to his feet and pointing towards the wood where a solitary figure was seen dimly against the dark background  every man leaped up and seized his weapons  who goes there shouted ned advancing towards the edge of the circle of light  a friend was the reply in english  relieved to find that he was not the advanceguard of a band of savages ned invited the stranger to approach and immediately he stepped within the sacred circle of the campfires light  this unexpected addition to the party was by no means a pleasant one  his complexion was exceedingly dark and he wore a jetblack beard  in manners he was coarse and repulsiveone of those forbidding men who seem to be born for the purpose of doing evil in whatever position of life or part of the world they happen to be placed  the rude garments of the miner harmonised with the rugged expression of his bearded and bronzed face and the harsh voice in which he addressed the party corresponded therewith  i spose yell not object to let me rest by yer fire strangers he said advancing and seating himself without waiting for a reply  youre welcome answered ned curtly for he neither liked the manners nor the aspect of the man  ye might ha wished us the top o the mornin i think suggested larry  here try an soften yer sperrits with a sup he added pushing a pewter plate of soup and a spoon towards him  the man made no reply but ate ravenously as if he had been starving when he had finished he lighted his pipe and drew his knees up to his chin as he warmed his hands before the blaze  little information of any kind could be drawn out of this taciturn wanderer  to neds questions he replied that he had been at the diggings on the yuba river which he described as being rich that he had made enough gold to satisfy all his wants and was on his way to san francisco where he intended to ship for england  his name he said was smith  he carried a short rifle with a peculiarly large bore and a heavy huntingknife the point of which was broken off  this last bill jones observed as the man laid it down after cutting up some tobacco preparatory to refilling his pipe  a good knife  how did ye break it inquired bill taking up the weapon and examining it  never you mind answered the man snatching it rudely from him and sheathing it  at this oneil regarded him with an angry expression  faix av ye wasnt livin so to spake in me own house id make ye change yer tone  i dont mean no offence said smith endeavouring to speak a little less gruffly  the fact is gents im out o sorts cos i lost a grizzly bar in the hills an hour or two agone  i shot him dead as i thought and went up and drove my knife into his side but it struck a rib and broke the pint as ye see and amost afore i could get up a tree he wos close up behind me  he went away after a while and so i got clear off  to the immense satisfaction of every one this disagreeable guest arose after finishing his pipe knocked the ashes out shouldered his rifle and bidding his entertainers goodnight reentered the forest and disappeared  youre well away remarked tom collins looking after him i couldnt have slept comfortably with such a fellow in camp  now then im going to turn in  so am i said maxton rolling himself in a blanket and pillowing his head on a saddle without more ado  in a few minutes the camp was as silent as it had previously been noisy captain buntings plethoric breathing alone told that human beings rested on that wild spot and this somewhat incongruously united with the tinkling of the rivulet hard by and the howling of coyotes constituted their lullaby  during the night the most of the travellers were awakened once or twice by a strange and very peculiar sensation which led them to fancy the earth on which they reposed was possessed of life  the lazy members of the party lay still and dreamily wondered until they fell asleep those who were more active leaped up and lifting their blankets gazed intently at the sward which darkness prevented them from seeing and felt it over with their hands but no cause for the unwonted motion could be discovered until the light of dawn revealed the fact that they had made their beds directly above the holes of a colony of groundsquirrels which little creatures poking upwards with their noses in vain attempts to gain the upper world had produced the curious sensations referred to  rough travelling however defies almost all disadvantages in the way of rest  tired and healthy men will sleep in nearly any position and at any hour despite all interruptions so that when our friends rose at daybreak to resume their journey they were well refreshed and eager to push on    chapter ten  game and cookeryarrival at the diggingslittle creeklaw and order in the minesnooning at little creekhardupour adventurers get credit and begin worka yankee outwitted  deer hares crows blackbirds magpies and quails were the creatures that bounded scampered hopped and flew before the eyes of the travellers at every step as they wended their way pleasantly beneath a bright morning sun over the hills and through the lesser valleys of the great vale of the sacramento  and all of these creatures excepting the crows and magpies fell before the unerring and unexpectedly useful blunderbuss of captain bunting passed a temporary existence in the maw of the big iron pot and eventually vanished into the carnivorous jaws of ned sinton and his friends  crows were excluded from their bill of fare because the whole party had an unconquerable antipathy to them and larry said he had aiten many pies in his lifetime but he had niver aiten magpies and hed be shot av he wos goin to begin now  the duties of chief hunter devolved upon the captainfirst because he was intensely fond of shooting and secondly because game was so plentiful and tame that it was difficult to avoid hitting something if one only fired straight before one  for the same reasons the blunderbuss proved to be more effectual than the rifle  the captain used to load it with an enormous charge of powder and a handful of shotswanshot two sizes of duckshot and sparrowhail mixed with an occasional rifleball dropped in to the bargain  the recoil of the piece was tremendous but the captain was a stout bufferif we may be permitted the expressionand stood the shock manfully  stewed squirrels formed one of their favourite dishes it was frequently prepared by tom collins whose powers in the culinary department proved to be so great that he was unanimously voted to the office of chef de cuisinebill jones volunteering and being accepted to assist in doing the dirty work for it must be borne in mind that the old relations of master and man no longer subsisted amongst any of the travellers nowexcepting always the native vaquero  all were equal at starting for the diggings and the various appointments were made by and with the consent of the whole party  little creek diggings were situated in a narrow gorge of the mountains through which flowed a small though turbulent stream  the sides of the hills were in some places thickly clothed with trees in others they were destitute not only of vegetation but of earth the rock on the steeper declivities of the hills having been washed bare by the periodical heavy rains peculiar to those regions  although wild and somewhat narrow this little valley was nevertheless a cheerful spot in consequence of its facing almost in a southerly direction while towards the east there were several wide and picturesque gaps in the hills which seemed to have been made for the express purpose of letting the sun shine the greater part of the day upon the diggers while they were at workan advantage no doubt when the weather was cool but rather the reverse when it was hot  the entrance to little creek was about two miles wide undulating and beautifully diversified resembling pleasure grounds rather than a portion of the great wilderness of the far west but the vale narrowed abruptly and about three miles further into the mountains became a mere gap or ravine through which the streamlet leaped and boiled furiously  it was an hour before noon when our travellers came suddenly upon the wide entrance to the valley  how beautiful exclaimed ned as he reined up to gaze in admiration over the flowering plain with its groups of noble trees  ay said maxton enthusiastically you may well say that  there may be perchance as grand but i am certain there is not a grander country in the world than americathe land of the brave and free  ned did not assent at once to the latter part of this proposition  you forget he said hesitatingly as if disinclined to hurt the feelings or prejudices of his new friend you forget that it is the land of slaves  i confess that i did forget that at the moment answered maxton while the blood mounted to his forehead  it is the foulest blot upon my countrys honour but i at least am guiltless of upholding the accursed institution as also are thousands of my countrymen  i feel assured however that the time is coming when that blot shall be wiped away  i am glad my friend said ned heartily to hear you speak thus to be frank with you i could not have prevailed upon myself to have held out to you the hand of intimate friendship had you proved to be a defender of slavery  then youll form few friendships in this country said tom collins for many of the yankees here have been slaveholders in their day and almost all defend the custom  the conversation was interrupted at this point by larry oneil uttering a peculiarly hibernian exclamation which no combination of letters will convey and pointing in an excited manner to an object a few hundred yards in advance of them  what dye see lad inquired bill jones shading his eyes with his hand  the whole party came to a halt and gazed earnestly before them for a few minutes in silence  och said oneil slowly and with trembling earnestness av me two eyes are spakin truth itsits a goold diggerthe first o the goolddiggersand larry followed up the discovery with a mingled cheer and warwhoop of delight that rang far and wide over the valley  at such an unwonted we might almost say appalling sound the first o the goolddiggerswho was up to his waist in a hole quietly and methodically excavating the earth on the rivers bank with a pickaxe raised his head and leaning on the haft of his pick scrutinised the new arrivals narrowly  hooray my hearty shouted larry as he advanced at a gallop followed by his laughing comrades  the top o the mornin to yeits good luck im wishin ye avic  how are ye gittin on in the goold way honey  the roughlooking dusty and bearded miner smiled goodhumouredly as he replied in a gentle tone of voice that belied his lookspretty well friend though not quite so well as some of my neighbours  i presume that you and your friends have just arrived at the mines  tear an ages its a gintleman i do belave cried larry turning to his companions with a look of surprise  the miner laughed at the remark and leaping out of the hole did his best to answer the many questions that were put to him in a somewhat excited tone by the party  wheres the gold inquired jones gravely going down on his knees at the side of the excavation and peering into it  i dont see none wotsomediver  the dust is very fine here answered the miner and not easily detected until washed  occasionally we come upon nuggets and pockets in the dry parts of the rivers bed and the canons of the hills but i find it most profitable to work steadily down here where the whole earth below the surface is impregnated with fine particles of gold many of the diggers waste their time in prospecting which word i suppose you know means looking out for new diggings but according to the proverb of my country i prefer to remain contented wi little and cantie wi mair  are we fardistant from the other miners in this creek inquired ned  no you are quite close  you will come upon the colony after passing that bluff of trees ahead of you answered the scotchman but come i will shew you the way it is not far from nooningtime when i usually cease work for a couple of hours  so saying the miner threw his pickaxe and shovel into the hole and led the way towards the colony of little creek  aint you afraid some of the badlooking scoundrels in these parts may take a fancy to your pick and shovel inquired the captain as they rode along at a foot pace  not in the least  time was when i would have feared to leave them for at one time neither life nor property was safe here where so many ruffians congregated from all parts of the world but the evil wrought its own cure at last  murders and robberies became so numerous that the miners took to lynch law for mutual protection  murderers and thieves were hanged or whipped almost to death with such promptitude that it struck terror into the hearts of evildoers and the consequence is that we of this valley are now living in a state of perfect peace and security while in other districts where the laws of judge lynch are not so well administered murders and thefts are occasionally heard of  here if a man takes a fancy to go prospecting for a time he has only to throw his pick and shovel into his claim or upon his heap of dirt see note 1 and he will be sure to find them there untouched on his return even though he should be absent several weeks  our tents too are left unwatched and our doors unfastened with perfect safety though it is wellknown that hundreds and thousands of dollars in golddust lie within  i do not mean to assert that we have attained to absolute perfectiona murder and a theft do occasionally occur but such are the exceptions security is the rule  truly said ned sinton you seem to live in a golden age in all respects  not in all answered the scot the terrors of the law deter from open violence but they do not enforce morality as the language and deportment of miners generally too plainly shew  but here we are at the colony of little creek  they rounded the projecting spur of one of the hills as he spoke and the whole extent of the little valley opened up to view  it was indeed a romantic and curious sight  the vale as we have said was narrow but by no means gloomy  the noontide sun shed a flood of light over the glistening rocks and verdant foliage of the hills on the left and cast the short rounded shadows of those on the right upon the plain through the centre of this the little creek warbled on its course now circling round some wooded knoll until it almost formed an island anon dropping in a quiet cascade over the edge of a flat rock in some places sweeping close under the base of a perpendicular cliff in others shooting out into a lakelike expanse of shallow water across a brightgreen meadow as it murmured on over its golden bed towards the sacramento  higher up the valley the cliffs were more abrupt  dark pines and cedars in groups or singly hung on their sides and gave point to the landscape in the background of which the rivulet glittered like a silver thread where the mountains rose in peaks towards the sky  along the whole course of this rivulet as far as the eye could trace it searchers for gold were at work on both banks while their white tents and rude wooden shanties were scattered singly or in clusters of various extent upon the wooded slopes in every pleasant and suitable position  from the distance at which our party first beheld the scene it appeared as if the miners were not men but little animals grubbing in the earth  little or no sound reached their ears there was no bustle no walking to and fro as if the hundreds there assembled had various and diverse occupations  all were intently engaged in one and the same work  pickaxe and shovel rose and fell with steady regularity as each individual wrought with ceaseless activity within the narrow limits of his own particular claim or rocked his cradle beside it dig dig dig rock rock rock shovel shovel shovel was the order of the day as long as day lasted and then the goldhunters rested until recruited strength and dawning light enabled them again to go down into the mud and dig and rock and shovel as before  many alas rocked themselves into a fatal sleep and dug and shovelled their own graves among these golden hills  many too who although they dug and toiled for the precious metal had neither made it their god nor their chief good were struck down in the midst of their heavy toils and retired staggering to their tents and there still clad in their damp garments laid their fevered heads on their saddlesnot unfrequently on their bags of golddustto dream of the distant homes and the loved faces they were doomed to see no more and thus dreaming in solitude or watched mayhap by a rough though warmhearted mate breathed out their spirits to him who gave them and were laid in their last restingplace with wealth untold beneath them and earth impregnated with golddust for their windingsheet  happy thrice happy the few who in that hour could truly say to jesus whom have i in heaven but thee and there is none upon earth that i desire beside thee  just as our travellers approached the nearest and largest cluster of huts and tents a sudden change came over the scene  the hour of noon had arrived and as if with one consent the miners threw down their tools and swarmed like the skirmishers of an invading host up from the stream towards the hutsa few of the more jovial among them singing at the full pitch of their lungs but most of them too wearied to care for aught save food and repose  noon is the universal dinnerhour throughout the goldmines an hour which might be adopted with profit in every way we venture to suggest by those who dig for gold in commercial and legal ledgers and cashbooks in more civilised lands  when the newcomers reached a moderatelysized logcabin which was the chief hotel of the colony they found it in all the bustle of preparation for an immediate and simple though substantial meal  can we have dinner inquired ned entering this house of entertainment while his companions were unsaddling and picketing their horses and mules  to be sure ye can my hearty answered the smiling landlord if ye pay for it  thats just the reason i asked the question answered ned seating himself on a caskall available chairs stool and benches having been already appropriated by mudbespattered miners because you must know i cant pay for it  ho ejaculated mine host with a grin hardup eh got cleaned out with the trip up an trust to diggin for the future  well ill give ye credit come on and stick in  its every man for himself here an no favour  thus invited ned and his friends squeezed themselves into seats beside the long table dhotewhich boasted a canvas tablecloth and had casks for legsand made a hearty meal in the course of which they obtained a great deal of useful information from their friend mcleod the scotchman  after dinner which was eaten hurriedly most of the miners returned to their work and ned with his friend under the guidance of mcleod went down to the river to be initiated into the mysteries of golddigging and washing  as they approached several of the claims which their owners were busy working a yankee swaggered up to them with a cigar in his mouth an impudent expression on his face and a pickaxe on his shoulder  guess youve just come to locate in them diggins strangers he said addressing the party at large but looking at ned whose superior height and commanding cast of countenance proved him unmistakeably to be a leader  we have replied ned who disliked the look of the man  thought so  im jest goin to quit an make tracks for the coast bliged to cut stick on business that wont wait i calclate  its plaguey unlucky too for my claims turnin out no end o dollars but i must sell it slick off so i dont mind to let ye have it cheap  is your claim better than the others in the neighbourhood inquired ned  wall i jest opine it is  look here cried the yankee jumping into his claim which was a pit of about eight feet square and three deep and delving the shovel into the earth while ned and his friends besides several of the other miners drew near to witness the result maxton and tom collins however winked knowingly at each other and with the scotchman drew back to the rear of the group  the first shovelful of earth thrown up was absolutely full of glittering particles of gold and the second was even more richly impregnated with the precious metal  ned and the captain stood aghast with amazement and bill jones opened mouth and eyes to their utmost extent  hooroo och goold galore there it is at last shouted larry oneil tossing up his arms with delight  do buy it mr ned darlint  i neednt turn up more i guess said the yankee carelessly throwing down his shovel and filling the earth into a tin bowl or pan ill jest wash it out an shew ye what its like  so saying he dipped the pan into the stream gently and proceeded to wash out the gold  as this was done in the way usually practised by diggers we shall describe it  setting down the tin pan of earth and water the yankee dipped both hands into it and stirred its contents about until it became liquid mud removing the stones in the operation  it was then moved round quickly with a peculiar motion which caused some off the top to escape over the edge of the pan with each revolution more water was added from time to time and the process continued until all the earthy matter was washed away and nothing but a kind of black sand in which the gold is usually contained remained at the bottom  there you are cried the man exultingly lifting up a handful of the heavy and shining mixture fifteen dollars at least in two shovelfuls ill sell ye the claim if ye like for two hundred dollars  i would give it at once said ned feeling at the moment deeply troubled on account of his poverty but to say truth i have not a farthing in the world  a peculiar grin rested on the faces of the miners who looked on as he spoke but before he could inquire the cause tom collins stepped forward and said  thats a firstrate claim of yours  what did ye say was your charge for it  three hundred dollars down  ill tell ye what rejoined tom ill give you six hundred dollars for it if you take out another shovelful of dirt like that  this remark was greeted by a general laugh from the bystanders which was joined in by the yankee himself as he leaped out of the hole and shouldering his shovel went off with his friends leaving ned and some others of his party staring at each other in astonishment  what does it all mean he inquired turning to tom coffins whose laughing countenance shewed that he at least was not involved in mystery  it means simply that we were all taken for greenhorns which was quite a mistake and that we were to have been thoroughly cheateda catastrophe which has happily been prevented  maxton and i determined to let the rascally fellow go as far as he could and then step in and turn the laugh against him as we have done  but explain yourself  i do not yet understand repeated ned with a puzzled look  why the fact is that when strangers arrive at the diggings full of excitement and expectation there are always a set of sharpers on the lookout who offer to sell their claims as they often say for a mere song and in order to prove their worth dig out a little dirt and wash it as you have just seen done taking care beforehand however to mingle with it a large quantity of golddust which of course comes to light and a bargain is generally struck on the spot when the sharper goes off with the price and boasts of having done a greenhorn for which he is applauded by his comrades  should the fraud be detected before the completion of the bargain as in our case he laughs with the rest and says probably he warnt so cute as usual  och the scoundrels cried larry an is there no law for sich doins  none at least in most diggings men are left to sharpen their own wits by experience  sometimes however the biter is pretty well bitten there was a poor chilian once who was deceived in this way and paid four hundred dollars for a claim that was scarcely worth working  he looked rather put out on discovering the imposture but was only laughed at by most of those who saw the transaction for his softness  some there were who frowned on the sharper and even spoke of lynching him but they were a small minority and had to hold their peace  however the chilian plucked up heart and leaping into his claim worked away like a trojan  after a day or two he hit upon a good layer of blue clay and from that time he turned out forty dollars a day for two months  ah good luck to him cried larry  and did the sharper hear of it inquired the captain  that he did and tried to bully the poor fellow and get his claim back again but there was a strong enough sense of justice among the miners to cause such an outcry that the scoundrel was fain to seek other diggings    note 1  dirt is the name given among miners to the soil in which gold is found    chapter eleven  goldwashingour adventurers count their gains and are satisfiedthe ryal bank o calyforny begins to prosperfrying goldnight visit to the grave of a murdered mana murderer caughtthe escape and pursuit  having escaped from the yankee landshark as has been related our adventurers spent the remainder of the day in watching the various processes of digging and washing out gold in imbibing valuable lessons and in selecting a spot for their future residence  the two processes in vogue at little creek at that time were the pan and the cradle washing  the former has been already adverted to and was much practised because the ground at that time was rich in the precious metal and easily wrought the extreme simplicity too of the operation which only required that the miner should possess a pick a shovel and a tin pan commended it to men who were anxious to begin at once  an expert man in favourable ground could gather and wash a panful of dirt as it is called every ten minutes and there were few places in little creek that did not yield halfadollar or more to the panful thus enabling the digger to work out golddust to the value of about twentyfive dollars five pounds sterling every day while occasionally he came upon a lump or nugget equal perhaps to what he could produce by the steady labour of a week or more  many of the more energetic miners however worked in companies and used cradles by means of which they washed out a much larger quantity of gold in shorter time and in places which did not yield a sufficient return by the pan process to render it worth while working the cradleowners obtained ample remuneration for their toil  the cradle is a very simple machine being a semicircular trough hollowed out of a log from five to six feet long by sixteen inches in diameter  at one end of this is a perforated copper or iron plate with a rim of wood round it on which the dirt is thrown and water poured thereon by one man while the cradle is rocked by another  the gold and gravel are thus separated from the larger stones and washed down the trough in which at intervals two transverse bars halfaninch high are placed the first of these arrests the gold which from its great weight sinks to the bottom while the gravel and lighter substances are swept away by the current  the lower bar catches any particles of gold that by awkward management may have passed the upper one  three men usually worked together at a rocker one digging one carrying the dirt in a bucket and one rocking the cradle  the black sand which along with the gold is usually left after all the washing and rocking processes are completed is too heavy to be separated by means of washing  it has therefore to be blown away from the gold after the mass has been dried over a fire and in this operation great care is requisite lest the finer particles of gold should be blown off along with it  the spot fixed on as the future residence of our friends was a level patch of greensward about a stonecast from the banks of the stream and twice that distance from the lowest cabin of the colony which was separated and concealed from them by a group of widespreading oaks and other trees  a short distance behind the spot the mountains ascended in steep wooded slopes and just in front the cliffs of the opposite hills rose abruptly from the edge of the stream but a narrow ravine that split them in a transverse manner afforded a peep into the hills beyond  at evening when the rest of the vale of little creek was shrouded in gloom this ravine permitted the last beams of the setting sun to stream through and flood their encampment with rosy light  here the tent was pitched and a fire kindled by tom collins he being intrusted with the command of the party whose duty it was to prepare the camp  this party included bill jones maxton and the vaquero ned the captain and larry oneil went under the guidance of mcleod to select a claim and take lessons in washing  this seems a likely spot said the scotchman as he led his new acquaintances down to the stream a few yards below their encampment you may claim as much ground as you please for there is room enough and to spare for all at the creek yet  i would recommend a piece of ground of ten or twelve feet square for each to begin with  here is a level patch that i shall appropriate then said ned smiling at the idea of becoming so suddenly and easily a landed proprietorand to such an extent  i suppose we dont require to make out titledeeds remarked the captain  theres my title dade cried larry driving his pick into the earth  you are right larry said mcleod laughing no other deed is required in this delightfullyfree country  ah thin its quite to my taste sure i niver thought to see the swate spot where i could pick out me property an pick up me fortin so aisy  dont count your chickens quite so fast said ned may be it wont be so easy as you think  but let us begin and ascertain the value of our claims i vote that larry shall have the honour of washing out the first panful of gold as a reward for his enthusiasm  a very proper obsarvation remarked the irishman as he commenced work without further delay  in the course of ten minutes part of the layer of surfaceearth was removed revealing the bluishclay soil in which gold was usually found the pan was filled with this paydirt as it was called in contradistinction to the surfacedirt which didnt pay and was taken down to the stream where larry washed it out under the eye of mcleod but he did it clumsily as might be expected and lost a considerable amount of valuable material  still for a first attempt it was pretty well done and his companions watched the result with feelings of excited earnestness that they felt halfashamed to admit even to themselves  there was mingled with this feeling a sort of vague incredulity and a disposition to ridicule the idea that they were actually endeavouring to wash gold out of the ground but when larrys panful began to diminish and the black sand appeared sparkling with unmistakeablybrilliant particles of reddishyellow metal they felt that the golden dream was in truth becoming a sober reality  as the process proceeded and the precious metal began to appear larrys feelings found vent in abrupt remarks  och av me tshoo eyesmusha there it isgoold intirelyav it isnt brass  ah ye purty little starso larry its yerself asll buy yer owld mother a pig an a coach to boot  hooroo  mr scotchman i misremimber yer name wots that  larry started up in excitement and held up between his forefinger and thumb what appeared to be a small stone  ha friend youre in luck  thats a small nugget replied mcleod examining the lump of gold  its worth ten dollars at least  i have worked often two or three weeks at a time without coming on such a chunk as that  ye dont mane it eh  och give it me  hooray and the irishman seizing the little lump with trembling eagerness rushed off shouting and yelling towards the camp to make his good fortune known to bill jones leaving the pan of black sand unheeded  this ned took up and tried his hand at the work of washing  when done the residue was found to be exceedingly rich so he and the captain proceeded without loss of time to test their separate claims  soon after their obliging friend the miner returned to his own claim further down the valley leaving them hard at work  that night when the bright stars twinkled down upon the camp at little creek our goldhunters wet and tired but hearty and hopeful assembled round the fire in front of their little tent among the oaktrees  the entire party was assembled there and they were gazing earnestly as might be expected of hungry men into the fryingpan  but they did not gaze at supper  no that night the first thing they fried was a mixture of black sand and gold  in fact they were drying and blowing the result of their first days work at the diggings and their friend the scotch miner was there to instruct them in the various processes of their new profession and to weigh the gold for them in his little pair of scales when it should be finally cleared of all grosser substances  as each panful was dried and blown the gold was weighed and put into a large white breakfast cup the bottom of which was soon heaped up with shining particles varying in size from the smallest visible speck to little lumps like grains of corn  bravo exclaimed mcleod as he weighed the last pan and added the gold to that already in the cup  i congratulate you gentlemen on your success  the days work is equal to one hundred and eighty dollarsabout thirty dollars per man  few men are so lucky their first day i assure you unless as has been the case once or twice they should hit upon a nugget or two  that being the case we shall have supper cried ned sinton and while we are about it do you go larry to mine host of the hotel and pay for the dinner for which he gave us credit  i dont wish to remain an hour in debt if i can avoid it  mister mcleod slowly said bill joneswho during the whole operation of drying and weighing the gold had remained seated on a log looking on with an expression of imbecile astonishment and without uttering a wordmister mcleod if i may make bold to ax how much is one hundred and eighty dollars  bills calculating powers were of the weakest possible character  about thirtysix pounds sterling replied mcleod  bills eyes were wide open before but the extent to which he opened them on hearing this was quite alarming and suggested the idea that they would never close again  the same incapacity to calculate figures rendered him unable to grasp correlative facts  he knew that thirtysix pounds in one day was a more enormous and sudden accumulation of wealth than had ever entered into his nautical mind to conceive of  but to connect this with the fact that a voyage and journey of many months had brought him there that a similar journey and voyage would be required to reconduct him home and that in the meantime he would have to pay perhaps five pounds sterling for a flannel shirt and probably four pounds or more for a pair of boots and everything else in proportion was to his limited intellectual capacity a simple impossibility  he contented himself with remarking in reference to these things that wen things in ginral wos more nor ordnarly oncommon an wen incomprehensibles was blowin a reglar hurricane astarn so that a man couldnt hold on to the belayinpins hed bin used to without their breakin short off an lettin him go spin into the leescupperswhy wot then a wise mans course wos to take in all sail an scud before it under bare poles  next day all the miners in the colony were up and at work by dawn  ned and his friends you may be sure were not last to leave their beds and commence digging in their separate claims which they resolved to work out by means of panwashing until they made a little ready cash after which they purposed constructing two rockers and washing out the gold more systematically and profitably  they commenced by removing the surfacesoil to the depth of about three feet a work of no small labour until the subsoil or paydirt was reached  of this they dug out a small quantity and washed it put the produce of black sand and gold into leathern bags and then digging out another panful washed it as before  thus they laboured till noon when they rested for an hour and dined  then they worked on again until night and exhaustion compelled them to desist when they returned to camp dried and blew away the sand weighed the gold which was put carefully into a general pursenamed by larry the ryal bank o calyfornyafter which they supped and retired to rest  the gold was found at various depths the dirt on the bedrock being the richest as gold naturally in consequence of its weight sinks through all other substances until arrested in its downward career by the solid rock  of course the labour was severe to men unaccustomed to the peculiar and constant stooping posture they were compelled to adopt and on the second morning more than one of the party felt as if he had been seized with lumbago but this wore off in the course of a day or two  the result of the second day was about equal to that of the first the result of the third a good deal better and bill who was fortunate enough to discover a small nugget returned to camp with a selfsatisfied swagger that indicated elation though his visage expressed nothing but stolidity slightly tinged with surprise  on the fourth day the cradles were made and a very large portion of their gains thereby swept away in consequence of the unconscionable prices charged for every article used in their construction  however this mattered little maxton said as the increased profits of their labour would soon repay the outlay  and he was right  on the fifth day their returns were more than trebled and that evening the directors of the ryal bank o calyforny found themselves in possession of capital amounting to one thousand one hundred and fifty dollars or as tom collins carefully explained to bill about 230 pounds  on the sixth day however which was saturday larry oneil who was permitted to work with the pan in the meantime instead of assisting with the cradles came up to dinner with a less hearty aspect than usual and at suppertime he returned with a terribly lugubrious visage and a totally empty bag  in fact his claim had become suddenly unproductive  look at that he cried swaggering recklessly into camp and throwing down his bag i havent got a rap faix the bags as empty as my intarior  what have you worked out your claim already inquired maxton  troth have i and almost worked out me own body too  well larry dont lose heart said ned as he dried the last panful of sand over the fire there are plenty more claims beside your present one  we too have not been as successful as before  i find the result is only fifty dollars amongst us all  thats a sudden falling off remarked tom collins i fear the paydirt is not deep near us nevertheless it pays well enough to keep us going for some time to come  i shall mark off a new space on monday  by the way maxton asked ned handing over the fryingpan to collins who soon filled it with a less valuable but at that time not less needful commodity than golddustnamely pork and beefhow do the miners spend the sabbath here  i suppose not much better than in the cities  here comes mcleod who will be better able to answer than i am replied maxton  the scot strode into the camp as he spoke and saluting the party seated himself beside the fire  ive come to tell you a piece of news and to ask advice he said but before doing so i may tell you in answer to your question that the sabbath here is devoted to drinking gambling and loafing about  i am not surprised to hear it said captain bunting but pray whats i the wind  any new diggins discovered  a new digging certainly has been discovered replied mcleod with a peculiar smile but not precisely such a digging as one is wont to search for  the fact is that in prospecting along the edge of the woods about a mile from this today i came upon the body of a murdered man  it was covered with stones and branches of trees which i removed and i immediately recognised it to be that of a poor man who used to work not far from my own claim  i had missed him for more than a week past but supposed that he had either gone to other diggings or was away prospecting  poor fellow said ned but how in such a matter can we help you with advice  well you see im in difficult circumstances rejoined the scot for i feel certain that i could point out the murderer yet i cannot prove him to be such and i want your advice as to what i should do  let it be known at once that you have discovered the murdered man at any rate said maxton  that i have done already  who do you think was the murderer inquired ned  a man who used to live in the same tent with him at one time but who quarrelled with him frequently and at last went off in a rage  i know not what was the cause but i heard him vow that he would be revenged he was a great coarse fellow more like a brute than a man with a black beard and the most forbidding aspect i think i ever saw  wot wos his name inquired bill jones while the party looked at each other as if they knew of such a character  smith was the name he went by oftenest but the diggers called him black jim sometimes  ha  smithblack beardforbidding aspect  it strikes me that i too have seen the man said ned sinton who related to mcleod the visit paid to them in their camp by the surly stranger  while he was speaking larry oneil sat pondering something in his mind  mister mcleod said he when ned concluded will ye shew me the body o this man faix im of opinion i can prove the murder but first of all how is the black villain to be diskivered  no difficulty about that  he is even now in the colony  i saw him in a gamblinghouse halfanhour since  my fear is that now the murders out hell bolt before we can secure him  its little trouble wed have in preventin that suggested larry  the consequences might be more serious however than you imagine suppose you were to seize and accuse him and fail to prove the murder the jury would acquit him and the first thing he would do on being set free would be to shoot you for which act the morality of the miners would rather applaud him than otherwise  it is only on coldblooded unprovoked murder and theft that judge lynch is severe  it is a recognised rule here that if a man in a row should merely make a motion with his hand towards his pistol his opponent is entitled to shoot him first if he can  the consequence is that bloody quarrels are very rare  niver a taste do i care cried larry they may hang me tshoo times over but ill prove the murder an nab the murderin blackguard too  have a care said ned youll get yourself into a scrape  make sure you are right before you act added maxton  larry oneil paid no attention to these warnings  are ye ready to go mister mcleod said he impatiently  quite replied the other  then come along  and the two left the camp together armed with their rifles knives revolvers and a shovel  it was a dark night  heavy clouds obscured the face of the sky through which only one or two stars struggled faintly and rendered darkness visible  the two men passed rapidly along the little footpath that led from the colony to the more open country beyond  this gained they turned abruptly to the right and entering a narrow defile proceeded at a more cautious pace into the gloomy recesses of the mountains  have a care larry oneil whispered the scotchman as they advanced the road is not so safe here owing to a number of pits which have been made by diggers after goldthey lie close to the edge of the path and are pretty deep  all right im lookin out replied larry groping his way after his comrade at the base of a steep precipice  here is the place said mcleod stopping and pushing aside the bushes which lined the path  keep close to methere is no road  are ye sure o the spot inquired larry in an undertone while a feeling of awe crept over him at the thought of being within a few yards of a murdered man in such a dark wild place  quite sure  i have marked the trees  see there  he pointed to a white spot on the stem of a tree where a chip had been cut off and close to which was a mound of earth and stones  this mound the two men proceeded to break up and in less than ten minutes they disentombed the body from its shallow grave and commenced to examine the fatal wound it was in an advanced state of decomposition and they hurried the process by the light of a bright solitary star whose flickering rays pierced through the overspreading branches and fell upon the ghastly countenance of the murdered man  while thus occupied they were startled by the sound of breaking twigs as if some one were slowly approaching whispering voices were also heard  it must be hereabouts said a voice in a low tone he pointed out the place  ho cried mcleod who with larry had seized and cocked his rifle is that you webster  halloo  mcleod where are you  in another moment a party of miners broke through the underwood talking loudly but they dropped their voices to a whisper on beholding the dead body  whist boys said larry holding up his hand  weve jist got hold o the bullet  its flattened the least thing but the size is easy to see  theres a wound over the heart too made with a knife now thats wot i want to get at the bottom of but i dont like to use me own knife to cut down  as none of the others felt disposed to lend their knives for such a purpose they looked at each other in silence  mayhap said the roughlooking miner who had been hailed by mcleod as webstermayhap the knife o the corpse is lyin about  the suggestion was a happy one  after a few minutes search the rusty knife of the murdered man was discovered and with this larry succeeded in extracting from the wound over the heart of the body a piece of steel which had evidently been broken off the point of the knife with which the poor wretch had been slain  larry held it up with a look of triumph  ill soon shew ye whos the murderer now boys av yell help me to fill up the grave  this was speedily accomplished then the miners hurrying in silence from the spot proceeded to the chief hotel of the place in the gamblingsaloon of which they found the man smith alias black jim surrounded by gamblers and sitting on a corner of the monte table watching the game  larry went up to him at once and seizing him by the collar exclaimedive got ye have i ye murderer ye black villain  come along wid ye and git yer desartscall a coort boys an sot up judge lynch  instantly the saloon was in an uproar  smith turned pale as death for a moment but the blood returned with violence to his brazen forehead he seized larry by the throat and a deadly struggle would speedily have taken place between the two powerful men had not ned sinton entered at the moment and grasping smiths arms in his herculean gripe rendered him helpless  what comrades cried black jim with an oath and looking fiercely round will ye see a messmate treated like this  im no murderer an i defy any one to prove it  there was a move among the miners and a voice was heard to speak of rescuing the prisoner  men cried ned still holding smith and looking round upon the crowd men  i guess there are no men here interrupted a yankee were all gentlemen  being a man does not incapacitate one from being a gentleman said ned sharply with a look of scorn at the speaker who deemed it advisable to keep silence  after a moments pause he continuedif this gentleman has done no evil i and my friends will be answerable to him for what we have done but my comrade larry oneil denounces him as a murderer and says he can prove it  surely the law of the mines and fair play demand that he should be tried  hear hear well said  git up a bonfire and lets have it out cried several voices approvingly  the miners rushed out dragging black jim along with them to an open level space in front of the hotel where stood a solitary oaktree from one of whose sturdy arms several offenders against the laws of the goldmines had at various times swung in expiation of their crimes here an immense fire was kindled and hither nearly all the miners of the neighbourhood assembled  black jim was placed under the branch from which depended part of the rope that had hanged the last criminal  his rifle pistols and knife were taken from him amid protestations of innocence and imprecations on the heads of his accusers  then a speech was made by an orator who was much admired at the place but whose coarse language would scarcely have claimed admiration in any civilised community  after this larry oneil stepped forward with mcleod and the latter described all he knew of the former life of the culprit and his conduct towards the murdered man  when he had finished larry produced the bullet which was compared with the rifle and the bullets in smiths pouch and pronounced similar to the latter  at this several of the miners cried out guilty guilty string him up at once  there are other rifles with the same bore said smith  i used to think judge lynch was just but hes no better i find than the landsharks elsewhere  hang me if you like but if ye do instead o gittin rid o one murderer yell fill the little creek with murderers from end to end  my blood will be on your heads  save yer breath said larry drawing smiths knife from its scabbard see here boys sure two dovetails niver fitted closer than this bit o steel fits the pint o black jims knife  them men standin beside me can swear they saw me take it out o the breast o the morthered man an yerselves know that this is the murderers knife  almost before larry had concluded smith who felt that his doom was sealed exerted all his strength burst from the men who held him and darted like an arrow towards that part of the living circle which seemed weakest  most of the miners shrank backonly one man ventured to oppose the fugitive but he was driven down with such violence that he lay stunned on the sward while smith sprang like a goat up the steep face of the adjacent precipice  a dozen rifles instantly poured forth their contents and the rocks rang with the leaden hail but the aim had been hurried and the light shed by the fire at that distance was uncertain  the murderer next moment stood on the verge of the precipice from which he wrenched a mass of rock and shouting defiance hurled it back with a fearful imprecation at his enemies  the rock fell into the midst of them and fractured the skull of a young man who fell with a groan to the earth  smith who paused a moment to witness the result of his throw uttered a yell of exultation and darted into the mountains whither for hours after he was hotly pursued by the enraged miners  but one by one they returned to the creek exhausted and telling the same taleblack jim had made his escape    chapter twelve  sabbath at the diggingslarry oneil takes to wandering and meets with adventuresan irish yankee discoveredterrible calamities befall travellers on the overland route  there is no country in our fallen world however debased and morally barren in which there does not exist a few green spots where human tenderness and sympathy are found to grow  the atmosphere of the goldregions of california was indeed clouded to a fearful extent with the souldestroying vapours of worldliness selfishness and ungodliness which the terrors of lynch law alone restrained from breaking forth in all their devastating strength  and this is not to be wondered at for europe and america naturally poured the flood of their worst inhabitants over the land in eager search for that gold the love of which we are told in sacred writ is the root of all evil  true there were many hundreds of estimable men who failing from adverse circumstances to make a livelihood in their native lands sought to better their fortunes in the far west but in too many cases the goldfever which raged there soon smote them down and men who once regarded gold as the means to an end came at last to esteem gold to be the end and used every means fair and foul to obtain it  others there were whose constitutions were proof against the national disease whose hearts deemed love to be the highest bliss of man and doing good his greatest happiness  but stilling and destructive though the air of the goldmines was there were a few hardy plants of moral goodness which defied itand some of these bloomed in the colony of little creek  the sabbath morning dawned on ned sinton and his friendsthe first sabbath since they had begun to dig for gold  on that day the miners rested from their work  shovel and pick lay quiet in the innumerable pits that had been dug throughout the valley no cradle was rocked no pan of golden earth was washed  even reckless men had come to know from experience that the almighty in his goodness had created the sabbath for the special benefit of mans body as well as his soul and that they wrought better during the six days of the week when they rested on the seventh  unfortunately they believed only what experience taught them they kept the sabbath according to the letter not according to the spirit and although they did not work they did not refrain from thinking their own thoughts and finding their own pleasure on gods holy day early in the morning they began to wander idly about from hut to hut visited frequently the grogshops and devoted themselves to gambling which occupation materially marred even the physical rest they might otherwise have enjoyed  comrades said ned sinton as the party sat inside their tent round the napkin on which breakfast was spread it is long since we have made any difference between saturday and sunday and i think it would be good for us all if we were to begin now  since quitting san francisco the necessity of pushing forward on our journey has prevented our doing so hitherto  how far we were right in regarding rapid travelling as being necessary i wont stop to inquire but i think it would be well if we should do a little more than merely rest from work on the sabbath  i propose that besides doing this we should read a chapter of the bible together as a family morning and evening on sundays  what say you  there was a pause  it was evident that conflicting feelings were at work among the party  perhaps youre right said maxton i confess that i have troubled myself very little about religion since i came out here but my conscience has often reproached me for it  dont you think messmates said captain bunting lighting his pipe that if it gets wind the whole colony will be laughin at us  sure they may laugh said larry oneil an after that they may cry av itll do them good  wots the differ to us  i dont agree with you ned said tom collins somewhat testily for my part i like to see men straightforward all fair and aboveboard as the captain would say  hypocrisy is an abominable vice whether it is well meaning or ill meaning and i dont see the use of pretending to be religious when we are not  tom replied ned in an earnest voice dont talk lightly of serious things  i dont pretend to be religious but i do desire to be so and i think it would be good for all of us to read a portion of gods word on his own day both for the purpose of obeying and honouring him and of getting our minds filled for a short time at least with other thoughts than those of goldhunting  in doing this there is no hypocrisy  well well rejoined tom ill not object if the rest are agreed  agreed was the unanimous reply  so ned rose and opening his portmanteau drew forth the little bible that had been presented to him by old mr shirley on the day of his departure from home  from that day forward every sabbath morning and evening ned sinton read a portion of the word of god to his companions as long as they were together and each of the party afterwards at different times confessed that from the time the reading of the bible was begun he felt happier than he did before  after breakfast they broke up and went out to stroll for an hour or two upon the wooded slopes of the mountains  ned and tom collins went off by themselves the others with the exception of larry walked out together  that morning larry oneil felt less sociable than was his wont so he sallied forth alone  for some time he sauntered about with his hands in his pockets his black pipe in his mouth a thick oak cudgel of his own making under his arm and his hat set jauntily on one side of his head he went along with an easy swagger and looked particularly reckless but no man ever belied his looks more thoroughly  the swagger was unintentional and the recklessness did not exist  on the contrary the reading of the bible had brought back to his mind a flood of home memories which forced more than one tear from his susceptible heart into his lightblue eye as he wandered in memory over the green hills of erin  but the scenes that passed before him as he roamed about among the huts and tents of the miners soon drew his thoughts to subjects less agreeable to contemplate  on weekdays the village if we may thus designate the scattered groups of huts and tents was comparatively quiet but on sundays it became a scene of riot and confusion  not only was it filled with its own idle population of diggers but miners from all the country round within a circuit of eight or ten miles flocked into it for the purpose of buying provisions for the week as well as for the purpose of gambling and drinking this being the only day in all the week in which they indulged in what they termed a spree  consequently the gamblers and storekeepers did more business on sunday than on any other day  the place was crowded with men in their rough though picturesque banditlike costumes rambling about from store to store drinking and inviting friends to drink or losing in the gamingsaloons all the earnings of a week of hard steady toiltoil more severe than is that of navvies or coalheavers  there seemed to be an irresistible attraction in these gamblinghouses  some men seemed unable to withstand the temptation and they seldom escaped being fleeced  yet they returned week after week to waste in these dens of iniquity the golden treasure gathered with so much labour during their six working days  larry oneil looked through the doorway of one of the gamblinghouses as he passed and saw men standing and sitting round the tables watching with eager faces the progress of the play while ever and anon one of them would reel out more than halfdrunk with excitement and brandy passing on through the crowded part of the village which looked as if a fair were being held there he entered the narrow footpath that led towards the deeper recesses at the head of the valley  oneil had not yet since his arrival found time to wander far from his own tent  it was therefore with a feeling of great delight that he left the scene of riot behind him and turning into a bypath that led up one of the narrow ravines opening into the larger valley strolled several miles into deep solitudes that were in harmony with his feelings  the sun streamed through the entrance to this ravine bathing with a flood of light crags and caves and bushencompassed hollows that at other times were shrouded in gloom  as the irishman stood gazing in awe and admiration at the wild beautiful scene beyond which were seen the snowy peaks of the sierra nevada he observed a small solitary tent pitched on a level patch of earth at the brow of a low cliff  curiosity prompted him to advance and ascertain what unsociable creature dwelt in it  a few minutes sufficed to bring him close upon it and he was about to step forward when the sound of a female voice arrested him  it was soft and low and the accents fell upon his ear with the power of an old familiar song  being at the back of the tent he could not see who spoke but from the monotonous regularity of the tone he knew that the woman was reading  he passed noiselessly round to the front and peeping over the tops of bushes obtained a view of the interior  the reader was a young woman whose face which was partially concealed by a mass of lightbrown hair as she bent over her book seemed emaciated and pale  looking up just as larrys eye fell upon her she turned towards a man whose gaunt attenuated form lay motionless on a pile of brushwood beside her and said tenderly  are ye tired patrick dear or would you like me to go on  larrys heart gave his ribs such a thump at that moment that he felt surprised the girl did not hear it  but he could not approach he was rooted to the earth as firmly though not as permanently as the bush behind which he stood  an irish voice and an irish girl heard and seen so unexpectedly quite took away his breath  the sick man made some reply which was not audible and the girl shutting the book looked up for a few moments as if in silent prayer then she clasped her hands upon her knees and laying her head upon them remained for some time motionless  the hands were painfully thin as was her whole frame  the face was what might have been pretty at one time although it was haggard enough now but the expression was peculiarly sorrowful  in a few minutes she looked up again and spread the ragged blanket more carefully over the shoulders of the sick man and larry feeling that he was at that time in the questionable position of an eavesdropper left his place of concealment and stood before the tent  the sick man saw him instantly and raising himself slightly exclaimed who goes there  sure i cant git lave to die in pace  the familiar tones of a countrymans voice fell pleasantly on larrys ear as he sprang into the tent and seizing the sick mans hand cried a blissin on the mouth that said that same  o pat darlint  im glad to mate with ye  whats the matter with ye  tell me now an dont be lookin as if yed seen a ghost  kape back said the girl pushing larry aside with a halfpleased halfangry expression  dont ye see that yeve amost made him faint hes too wake intirely to be  ah then cushla forgive me i wint and forgot meself  blissins on yer pale face sure yer irish too  before the girl could reply to this speech which was uttered in a tone of the deepest sympathy the sick man recovered sufficiently to say  sit down friend  how comed ye to larn me name  i guess i never saw ye before  sure didnt i hear yer wife say it as i come forard to the tint answered larry somewhat staggered at the unirish word guess  he is my brother remarked the girl  troth yeve got a dash o the yankee brogue said larry with a puzzled look did ye not come from the owld country  the sick man seemed too much exhausted to reply so the girl said  our father and mother were irish and left their own country to sittle in america  we have never seen ireland my brother nor i but we think of it as almost our own land  havin been brought up in the woods and seein amost no one but father and mother for days an weeks at a time weve got a good deal o the irish tone  ah thin ye have reason to be thankful for that same remarked larry who was a little disappointed that his new friends were not altogether irish but after a few minutes consideration he came to the conclusion that people whose father and mother were natives of the emerald isle could no more be americans simply because they happened to be born in america than they could be fish if they chanced to be born at sea  having settled this point to his satisfaction he proceeded to question the girl as to their past history and the cause of their present sad condition and gradually obtained from her the information that their father and mother were dead and that having heard of the mines of california her brother had sold off his farm in the backwoods and proceeded by the overland route to the new land of gold in company with many other western hunters and farmers  they reached it after the most inconceivable sufferings in the beginning of winter and took up their abode at little creek  the rush of emigration from the western states to california by the overland route that took place at this time was attended with the most appalling sufferings and loss of life  men sold off their snug farms packed their heavy waggons with the necessaries for a journey with their wives and little ones over a wilderness more than two thousand miles in extent and set off by scores over the prairies towards the ultima thule of the far west  the first part of their journey was prosperous enough but the weight of their waggons rendered the pace slow and it was late in the season ere they reached the great barrier of the rocky mountains  but severe although the sufferings of those first emigrants were they were as nothing compared with the dire calamities that befell those who started from home later in the season all along the route the herbage was cropped bare by those who had gone before their oxen broke down burning sandy deserts presented themselves when the wretched travellers were wellnigh exhausted and when at length they succeeded in reaching the great mountainchain its dark passes were filled with the ice and snow of early winter  hundreds of men women and children fell down and died on the burning plain or clambered up the rugged heights to pillow their dying heads at last on wreaths of snow  to add to the unheardof miseries of these poor people scurvy in its worst forms attacked them and the air of many of their camping places was heavy with the stench arising from the dead bodies of men and animals that had perished by the way  it was late in the season said kate morgan as larrys new friend was named when me brother patrick an i set off with our waggon and oxen an my little sister nelly who was just able to run about with her curly yellow hair streamin over her purty shoulders an her laughin blue eyes almost spakin when they looked at ye  the poor girl spoke with deep pathos as she mentioned nellys name while larry oneil sat with his hands clasped gazing at her with an expression of the deepest commiseration  we got pretty well on at first she continued after a pause because our waggon was lighter than most o the others but it was near winter before we got to the mountains an then our troubles begood  first of all one o the oxen fell and broke its leg  then darlin nelly fell sick and patrick had to carry her on his back up the mountains for i had got so weak meself that i wasnt fit to take her up  all the way over i was troubled with one o the emigrants that kep us company there was thirty o us altogetherhe was a very bad man and none o us liked him  he took a fancy to me an asked me to be his wife so often that i had to make patrick order him to kape away from us altogether he wint off in a black rage swearin hed be revengedan oh continued kate wringing her hands he kept his word  one day there was a dispute between our leaders which way we should go for we had got to two passes in the mountains so one party went one way and we went another  through the night mymy lover came into our camp to wish me goodbye he said for the last time as he was goin with the other party  after he was gone i missed nelly and went out to seek for her among the tents o my neighbours but she was nowhere to be found  at once i guessed he had taken her away for well did he know i would sooner have lost my life than my own darlin nell  again the girl paused a few moments then she resumed in a low voice  we never saw him or nelly again  it is said the whole party perished an i believe it for they were far spent and the road they took ive been towld is worse than the one we took  it was dead winter when we arrived and patrick and me came to live here  we made a good deal at first by diggin but we both fell sick o the ague and weve been scarce able to kape us alive till now  but it wont last long  dear patrick is broken down entirely as ye see and i havent strength amost to go down to the diggins for food  i havent been there for a month for its four miles away as i dare say ye know  well both be at rest soon  ah now dont say that again avic cried larry smiting his thigh with energy yell be nothin o the sort that ye wont sure yer brother pat is slaipin now like an infant he is an ill go down meself to the stores and git ye medicines an a doctor an what not cheer up now  larrys enthusiastic efforts to console his new friend were interrupted by the sick man who awoke at the moment and whispered the word food  his sister rose and taking up a small tin pan that simmered on the fire in front of the tent poured some of its contents into a dish  what is it ye give him inquired larry taking the dish from the girls hands and putting it to his lips  he instantly spat out the mouthful for it was soup made of rancid pork without vegetables of any kind  tis all ive got left said the girl  even if i was able to go down for more he wouldnt let me but i couldnt for ive tried more than once and near died on the road  besides i havent a grain o goold in the tent  o morther  tare an ages cried larry staring first at the girl and then at her brother while he slapped his thighs and twisted his fingers together as if he wished to wrench them out of joint  howld on faix ill do it  dont give it him plaze howld on do  larry oneil turned round as he spoke seized his cudgel sprang right over the bushes in front of the tent and in two minutes more was seen far down the ravine spurning the ground beneath him as if life and death depended on the race    chapter thirteen  kindness to strangers in distressremarks in reference to early risingdiggings wax unproductivened takes a ramble and has a small adventureplans formed and partly developedremarkable human creatures discovered and still more remarkable converse held with them  ill throuble ye for two pounds of flour cried larry oneil dashing into one of the stores which was thronged with purchasers whom he thrust aside rather unceremoniously  youll have to take your turn stranger i calculate answered the storekeeper somewhat sharply  ah thin avic plaze do attind to me at wance for sure ive run four miles to git stuff for a dyin familywont ye now  the earnest manner in which larry made this appeal was received with a laugh by the bystanders and a recommendation to the storekeeper to give him what he wanted  whats the price inquired larry as the man measured it out  two dollars a pound answered the man  musha  ive seed it chaiper  i guess so have i but provisions are gittin up for nothin has come from sacramento for a fortnight  tay an sugarll be as bad no doubt  wuss they are for theres next to none at all i opine in this here location  faix ill have a pound o both av they wos two dollars the halfounce  have ye got raisins an sago  yes  give

intirely but its little i care hand me wan bottle plaze  the bottle of brandy was added to his store and then the irishman shouldering his bundle of good things left the shop and directed his steps once more towards the ravine in which dwelt kate morgan and her brother pat  it was late when the irishman returned from his mission of kindness and he found the fire nearly out the tent closed and all his comrades sound asleep so gently lifting the curtain that covered the entrance he crept quietly in lay down beside bill jones whose nasal organ was performing a trombone solo and in five minutes was sound asleep  it seemed to him as if he had barely closed his eyes when he was roused by his comrades making preparations to resume work nevertheless he had rested several hours and the grey hue of early day that streamed in through the opening of the tent warned him that he must recommence the effort to realise his golden dreams  the pursuit of gold however engrossing it may be does not prevent men from desiring to lie still in the morning or abate one jot of the misery of their condition when they are rudely roused by early comrades and told that its time to get up  larry oneil tom collins and maxton groaned on receiving this information from ned turned and made as if they meant to go to sleep but they meant nothing of the sort it was merely a silent testimony to the fact of their thorough independencean expressive way of shewing that they scorned to rise at the bidding of any man and that they would not get up till it pleased themselves to do so  that this was the case became evident from their groaning again two minutes afterwards and turning round on their backs  then they stretched themselves and sitting up stared at each other like owls  a moment after maxton yawned vociferously and fell back again quite flat an act which was instantly imitated by the other two  such is the force of bad example  by this time the captain and jones had left the tent and ned sinton was buckling on his belt  now then get up and dont be lazy cried the latter as he stepped out dragging all the blankets off the trio as he took his departure an act which disclosed the fact that trousers and flannel shirts were the sleeping garments of maxton and tom and that larry had gone to bed in his boots  the three sprang up immediately and after performing their toilets sallied forth to the banks of the stream where the whole population of the place was already hard at work  having worked out their claims which proved to be pretty good they commenced new diggings close beside the old ones but these turned out complete failures excepting that selected by captain bunting which was as rich as the first  the gold deposits were in many places very irregular in their distribution and it frequently happened that one man took out thirty or forty dollars a day from his claim while another man working within a few yards of him was to use a mining phrase unable to raise the colour that is to find gold enough to repay his labour  this uncertainty disgusted many of the impatient goldhunters and not a few returned home saying that the finding of gold in california was a mere lottery who if they had exercised a little patience and observation would soon have come to know the localities in which gold was most likely to be found  there is no doubt whatever that the whole country is impregnated more or less with the precious material  the quartz veins in the mountains are full of it and although the largest quantities are usually obtained in the beds of streams and on their banks gold is to be found in smaller quantities even on the tops of the hills  hitherto the miners at little creek had found the diggings on the banks of the stream sufficiently remunerative but the discovery of several lumps of gold in its bed induced many of them to search for it in the shallow water and they were successful  one old seacaptain was met by bill jones with a nugget the size of a gooseegg in each hand and another man found a single lump of almost pure gold that weighed fourteen pounds  these discoveries induced ned sinton to think of adopting a plan which had been in his thoughts for some time past so one day he took up his rifle intending to wander up the valley for the double purpose of thinking out his ideas and seeing how the diggers higher up got on  as he sauntered slowly along he came to a solitary place where no miners were at work in consequence of the rugged nature of the banks of the stream rendering the labour severe  here on a projecting cliff which overhung a deep dark pool or eddy he observed the tall form of a naked man whose brown skin bespoke him the native of a southern clime while ned looked at him wondering what he could be about the man suddenly bent forward clasped his hands above his head and dived into the pool  ned ran to the margin immediately and stood for nearly a minute observing the dark indistinct form of the savage as he groped along the bottom  suddenly he rose and made for the shore with a nugget of gold in his hand  he seemed a little disconcerted on observing ned who addressed him in english french and spanish but without eliciting any reply save a grunt  this however did not surprise our hero who recognised the man to be a sandwich islander whom he had met before in the village and whose powers of diving were wellknown to the miners  he ascertained by signs however that there was much gold at the bottom of the stream which doubtless the diver could not detach from the rocks during the short period of his immersion so he hastened back to the tent determined to promulgate his plan to his comrades  it was noon when he arrived and the miners were straggling from all parts of the diggings to the huts tents and restaurants  ha  maxton glad ive found you alone cried ned seating himself on an empty box before the fire over which the former was engaged in culinary operations  i have been thinking over a plan for turning the course of the stream and so getting at a portion of its bed  now thats odd observed maxton i have been thinking of the very same thing all morning  indeed wits jump they say  i fancied that i had the honour of first hitting on the plan  first hitting on it rejoined maxton smiling  my dear fellow it has not only been hit upon but hit off many months ago with considerable success in some parts of the diggings  the only thing that prevents it being generally practised is that men require to work in companies for the preliminary labour is severe and miners seem to prefer working singly or in twos and threes as long as there is good paydirt on the banks  well then the difficulty does not affect us because we are already a pretty strong company although our vaquero has left us and i have seen a place this morning which i think will do admirably to begin upon it is a deep pool a few miles up the stream under  i know it interrupted maxton putting a large slice of pork into the fryingpan which hissed delightfully in the ears of hungry men  i know the place well but there is a much better spot not a quarter of a mile higher up where a chinaman named ahwow lives it will be more suitable youll find when i shew it you  well go and have a look at it after dinner observed ned meanwhile here are our comrades let us hear what they have to say about the proposal  as he spoke collins jones larry and the captain advanced in single file and with disconsolate looks that told of hard toil and little reward  well what have you got comrades  nothin answered bill jones drawing forth his comforter  bills comforter was black and short and had a bowl and was at all times redolent of tobacco  niver a speck cried larry oneil setting to with energy to assist in preparing dinner  well friends ive a plan to propose to you so let us take the edge off our appetites and ill explain  ned sat down tailorfashion on the ground with his companions round him and while they devoted themselves ravenously and silently to tea flourcake saltpork and beans he explained to them the details of his plan which explanation if it was not the dinner had the effect of raising their spirits greatly  instead therefore of repairing to their profitless claims after dinner they went in a body up the stream to visit the chinamans diggings  captain bunting alone remained behind as his claim was turning out a firstrate one  sure theres a human cried larry as they turned a projecting point about an hour and a half later and came in sight of ahwows location as the yankees termed it  it may be a human remarked ned laughing but its the most inhuman one i ever saw  i think yonder fellow must be performing a surgical operation on the chinamans head  ahwow was seated on a stone in front of his own loghut with his arms resting on his knees and an expression of supreme felicity on his yellow face while a countryman in what appeared a nightgown and an immense straw hat dressed his tail for him  lest uninformed readers should suppose that ahwow belonged to the monkeytribe we may mention that the chinamans head was shaved quite bald all round with the exception of a tail of hair about two feet long and upwards of an inch thick which jutted from the top of his caput and hung down his back  this tail he was in the act of getting dressed when our party of miners broke in upon the privacy of his dressingroom  ahwow had a nose which was very flat and remarkably broad with the nostrils pointing straight to the front  he also had a mouth which was extremely large frightfully thicklipped and quite the reverse of pretty  he had two eyes also not placed like the eyes of ordinary men across his face on either side of his nose but set in an angular manner on his visage so that the outer corners pointed a good deal upwards and the inner corners pointed a good deal downwards towards the point of his nose or rather towards that vacant space in front of his nostrils which would have been the point of his nose if that member had had a point at all  ahwow also had cheek bones which were uncommonly high and a forehead which was preposterously low and a body which was rather squat and a tout ensemble which was desperately ugly  like his hairdresser he wore a coat somewhat resembling a nightshirt with a belt round it and his feet were thrust into yellow slippers  these last when he went to dig for gold he exchanged for heavy boots  when ned and his friends walked up and stood in a grinning row before him ahwow opened his little eyes to the uttermost which wasnt much and said how  if he had affixed dye do to it the sentence would have been complete and intelligible  his companion attempted to vary the style of address by exclaiming ho  can you speak english inquired ned advancing  a shake of the head and a consequent waggle of the tail was the reply  or french  shake and waggle  maybe ye can do irish suggested larry  the shake and waggle were more vigorous than before but ahwow rose and drawing on his boots made signs to his visitors to follow him which they did through the bushes round the base of a steep precipice a short walk brought them to an open space quite close to the banks of the stream which at that place was broken by sundry miniature waterfalls and cascades whose puny turmoil fell like woodland music on the ear  here was another loghut of minute dimensions and ruinous aspect in front of which sat another chinaman eating his dinner  him ahwow addressed as kosing  after a brief conversation kosing turned to the strangers and said  ho  kin speek english me can  what you want  we want to look at your diggings answered ned  we are going to turn the river here if we can and if you and your companions choose to join us we will give you good wages  kin speek but not fery well kin onerstan  work work you say an pay we  yes thats it you work for us and well pay you  how moche inquired the cautious celestial  five dollars a day replied ned  the chinaman put on a broad grin and offered to shake hands which offer was accepted not only by ned but by the whole party and the contract was thus settled on the spot to the satisfaction of all parties  after this they spent some time in examining the bed of the stream and having fixed upon a spot on which to commence operations they prepared about sunset to return for their tent and mining tools intending to make a moonlight flitting in order to avoid being questioned by overcurious neighbours  all their horses and mules except neds charger having been sold a few days before to a yankee who was returning to sacramento they expected to get off without much noise with their goods and chattels on their backs  before starting on their return while the rest of the party were crowding round and questioning kosing bill joneswhose mind since he arrived in california seemed to be capable of only one sensation that of surprisewent up to ahwow and glancing round in order to make sure that he was not observed laid his hand on his shoulder and looked inquiringly into the chinamans face  the chinaman returned the compliment with interest throwing into his sallow countenance an expression of if possible blanker astonishment  owow said bill with solemn gravity and pausing as if to give him time to prepare for what was coming  owow wot do you dress your pigtail with  ho replied the chinaman  ho echoed bill now thats curious  i thought as how you did it with grease for it looks like it  tell me now how long did it take afore it growed that long  he lifted the end of the tail as he spoke  how ejaculated the chinaman  ay how long repeated bill  we regret that we cannot give ahwows answer to this question seeing that it was never given in consequence of bill being suddenly called away by ned sinton as he and his friends turned to go  come bill lets be off  ay ay sir answered bill turning from the chinaman and following his comrades with solemn stolidity or if you prefer the expression with stolid solemnity  dont linger larry shouted tom collins  ah thin its cruel to tear me away  goodnight to ye bowwow well be back before mornin ye purty creature  with this affectionate farewell larry ran after his friends and followed them down the banks of the tumbling stream towards the ryal bank o calyforny which was destined that night for a time at least to close its doors    chapter fourteen  the new diggingsbright prospectsgreat results spring from great exertions even in californiacaptain bunting is seized with a great passion for solitary rambling and has two desperate encounters one with a man the other with a rear  the part of the little creek diggings to which the goldhunters transported their camp was a wild secluded spot not much visited by the miners partly on account of its gloomy appearance and partly in consequence of a belief that the celestials located there were getting little or no gold  in this supposition they were correct  ahwow and kosing being inveterately lazy contented themselves with digging just enough gold to enable them to purchase a sufficiency of the necessaries of life  but the region was extremely rich as our adventurers found out very soon after their arrival  one of the ravines in particular gave indications of being full of gold and several panfuls of earth that were washed out shewed so promising a return that the captain and larry were anxious to begin at once  they were overruled however by the others who wished to make trial of the bed of the stream  six days of severe labour were undergone by the whole party ere their task was accomplished during which period they did not make an ounce of gold while at the same time their little store was rapidly melting away  nevertheless they worked heartily knowing that a few days of successful digging would amply replenish their coffers  at grey dawn they set to work some with trousers tucked up paddling about in the water all day carrying mud and stones while others felled trees and cut them into logs wherewith to form the dam required to turn the stream from its course  this was a matter of no small difficulty  a new bed had to be cut to the extent of eight or ten yards but for a long time the free and jovial little mountain stream scorned to make such a pitiful twist in its course preferring to burst its way headlong through the almost completed barricade by which it was pentup  twice did it accomplish this feat and twice in so doing did it sweep captain bunting off his legs and roll him along bodily in a turmoil of mud and stones and dirty water roaring as it gushed forth as if in savage triumph  on the second occasion bill jones shared the captains ducking and all who chanced to be working about the dam at the time were completely drenched  but however much their bodies might be moistened no untoward accident could damp the ardour of their spirits they resumed work again repaired the breach and finally turned the obstinate stream out of the course which probably it had occupied since creation  it rushed hissing as if spitefully along its new bed for a few yards and then darted at a right angle back into its former channel along which it leaped exultingly as before  but the object for which all this trouble had been undertaken was attained  about eight yards of the old bed of the torrent were laid bare and the water was drained away whereat each of the party exhibited his satisfaction after his own peculiar mannerlarry oneil as usual giving vent to his joy in a hearty cheer  the result was even more successful than had been anticipated  during the next few days the party conversed little their whole energies being devoted to eating sleeping and digging  the bed of the stream was filled with stones among which they picked up numerous nuggets of various sizesfrom a pea to a walnutsome being almost pure gold while others were more or less mixed with quartz  a large quantity of the heavy black sand was also found at the bottom of a hole which once had been an eddyit literally sparkled with golddust and afforded a rich return for the labour previously expended in order to bring it to light  the produce of the first two days work was no less than fourteen pounds weight of gold  the third day was the sabbath and they rested from their work  it is however impossible for those who have never been in similar circumstances to conceive how difficult it was for our party of goldhunters to refrain from resuming work as usual on that morning some of them had never been trained to love or keep the sabbath and would have certainly gone to work had not ned and the captain remonstrated  all were under great excitement in consequence of their valuable discovery and anxious to know whether the run of luck was likely to continue and not one of the party escaped the strong temptation to break the sabbathday except indeed the chinamen who were too easygoing and lazy to care whether they worked or rested  but the inestimable advantage of good early training told at this time on ned sinton  it is questionable whether his principles were strong enough to have carried him through the temptation but ned had been trained to reverence the lordsday from his earliest years and he looked upon working on the sabbath with a feeling of dread which he could not have easily shaken off even had he tried  the promise in his case was fulfilledtrain up a child in the way he should go and he will not depart from it when he is old and though no mothers voice of warning was heard in that wild region of the earth and no guardians hand was there to beckon back the straggler from the paths of rectitude yet he was not let alone the arm of the lord was around him and his voice whispered in tones that could not be misunderstood remember the sabbathday to keep it holy  we have already said that the sabbath at the mines was a day of rest as far as mere digging went but this was simply for the sake of resting the wearied frame not from a desire to glorify god  had any of the reckless miners who filled the gamblinghouses been anxious to work during sunday on a prolific claim he would not have hesitated because of gods command  the repose to their overworked muscles and the feeling that they had been preserved from committing a great sin enabled the party to commence work on monday with a degree of cheerfulness and vigour that told favourably on their profits that night and in the course of a few days they dug out gold to the extent of nearly two thousand pounds sterling  were goin to get rich no doubt of it said the captain one morning to ned as the latter was preparing to resume work in the creek but ill tell you what it is im tired o salt beef and pork and my old hull is gettin rheumatic with paddling about barefoot in the water so i mean to go off for a days shootin in the mountains  very good captain replied ned but i fear youll have to go by yourself for we must work out this claim as fast as we can seeing that the miners further down wont be long of scenting out our discovery  neds words were prophetic  in less than halfanhour after they were uttered a longvisaged yankee in a straw hat nankeen trousers and fishermans boots came to the spot where they were at work and seated himself on the trunk of a tree hard by to watch their proceedings  guess youve got somthin he said as larry after groping in the mud for a little picked up a lump of white quartz with a piece of gold the size of a marble embedded in the side of it  ah but yere good for sore eyes cried larry examining the nugget carefully  i say stranger inquired the yankee dye git many bits like that in this location  the irishman regarded his question with an expressive leer  arrah now ye wont tell he said in a hoarse whisper sure itll be the death o me av ye do  theres no end o them things hereas many as ye like to pick its only the day before tomorrow that i turned up a nugget of pure goold the size of me head and the capting got hold o wan thats only half dug out yet an wots seen o t is as big as the head o a fivegallon caskall pure goold  the yankee was not to be put off the scent by such a facetious piece of information  he continued to smoke in silence sauntered about with his hands in his nankeen pockets watched the proceedings of the party inspected the dirt cast ashore and finally dug out and washed a panful of earth from the banks of the stream after which he threw away the stump of his cigar and went off whistling  three hours later he returned with a party of friends laden with tents provisions and mining tools and they all took up their residence within twenty yards of our adventurers and commenced to turn the course of the river just below them  larry and jones were at first so angry that they seriously meditated committing an assault upon the intruders despite the remonstrances of tom collins and maxton who assured them that the newcomers had a perfect right to the ground they occupied and that any attempt to interrupt them by violence would certainly be brought under the notice of judge lynch whose favourite punishments they well knew were whipping and hanging  meanwhile captain bunting had proceeded a considerable way on his solitary hunting expedition into the mountains bent upon replenishing the larder with fresh provisions  he was armed with his favourite blunderbuss a pocketcompass and a couple of shipbiscuits  as he advanced towards the head of the valley the scenery became more and more gloomy and rugged but the captain liked this  having spent the greater part of his life at sea he experienced new and delightful sensations in viewing the mountainpeaks and ravines by which he was now surrounded and although of a sociable turn of mind he had no objection for once to be left to ramble alone and give full vent to the feelings of romance and enthusiastic admiration with which his nautical bosom had been filled since landing in california  towards noon the captain reached the entrance to a ravine or gorge which opened upon the larger valley into which it discharged a little stream from its dark bosom  there was an air of deep solitude and rugged majesty about this ravine that induced the wanderer to pause before entering it  just then certain sensations reminded him of the two biscuits in his pocket so he sat down on a rock and prepared to dine  we say prepared to dine advisedly for captain bunting had a pretty correct notion of what comfort meant and how it was to be attained  he had come out for the day to enjoy himself and although his meal was frugal he did not on that account eat it in an offhand easy way while sauntering along as many would have done  by no means  he brushed the surface of the rock on which he sat quite clean and laying the two biscuits on it looked first at one and then at the other complacently while he slowly and with great care cut his tobacco into delicate shreds and filled his pipe  then he rose and taking the tin prospectingpan from his belt went and filled it at the clear rivulet which murmured at his feet and placed it beside the biscuits on the rock  this done he completed the filling of his pipe and cast a look of benignity at the sun which at that moment happened in his course to pass an opening between two lofty peaks which permitted him to throw a cloth of gold over the captains table  captain buntings mind now became imbued with those aspirations after knowledge which would have induced him had he been at sea to inquire hows her head so he pulled out his pocketcompass and having ascertained that his nose when turned towards the sun pointed exactly southsouthwest and by south he began dinner  thereafter he lit his pipe and reclining on the green turf beside the rock with his head resting on his left hand and wreaths of smoke encircling his visage hehe enjoyed himself  to elaborate a description reader often weakens itwe cannot say more than that he enjoyed himself emphatically  had captain bunting known who was looking at him in that solitary place he would not have enjoyed himself quite so much nor would he have smoked his pipe so comfortably  on the summit of the precipice at his back stood or rather sat one of the natives of the country in the shape of a grizzlybear  bruin had observed the captain from the time he appeared at the entrance of the ravine and had watched him with a curious expression of stupid interest during all his subsequent movements  he did not attempt to interrupt him in his meal however on two groundsfirst because the nature of the grizzlybear if not molested induces him to let others alone and secondly because the precipice on the top of which he sat although conveniently close for the purposes of observation was too high for a safe jump  thus it happened that captain bunting finished his meal in peace and went on his way up the wild ravine without being aware of the presence of so dangerous a spectator  he had not proceeded far when his attention was arrested by the figure of a man seated on a ledge of rock that over hung a yawning gulf into which the little stream plunged  so still did the figure remain with the head drooping on the chest as if in deep contemplation that it might have been mistaken for a statue cut out of the rock on which it sat  a deep shadow was cast over it by the neighbouring mountainpeaks yet as the white sheet of a waterfall formed the background it was distinctly visible  the captain advanced towards it with some curiosity and it was not until he was within a hundred yards that a movement at length proved it to be a living human being  the stranger rose hastily and advanced to meet a woman who at the same moment issued from an opening in the brushwood near him  the meeting was evidently disagreeable to the woman although from the manner of it and the place it did not seem to be accidental she pushed the man away several times but their words were inaudible to the captain who began to feel all the discomfort of being an unintentional observer uncertainty as to what he should do induced him to remain for a few moments inactive and he had half made up his mind to endeavour to retreat unobserved when the man suddenly struck down the female who fell with a faint cry to the earth  in another minute the captain was at the side of the dastardly fellow whom he seized by the neck with the left hand while with the right he administered a hearty blow to his ribs  the man turned round fiercely and grappled with his assailant and then captain bunting became aware that his antagonist was no other than smith alias black jim the murderer  smith although a strong man was no match for the captain who soon overpowered him  ha you villain have i got you cried he as he almost throttled the man  get up now an come along peaceably  if you dont ill knock your brains out with the butt of my gun  he permitted black jim to rise as he spoke but held him fast by the collar having previously taken from him his knife and rifle  black jim did not open his lips but the scowl on his visage shewed that feelings of deadly hatred burned in his bosom  meanwhile the girl had recovered and now approached  ah plase sir she said let him off  shure i dont mind the blow its done me no harmwont ye now  let him off exclaimed the captain violently no my good girl if he has not murdered you he has at any rate murdered one human being that i know of and if i can ill bring him to justice  kate for it was she started at this reply and looked earnestly at the man who hung his head and for the first time shewed symptoms of a softer feeling  ah its true i see an all hope is gone  if hed commit a murder hed tell a lie too  i thought he spoke truth when he said nelly was alive but  the girl turned as she spoke and left the spot hurriedly while the captain took out his pockethandkerchief and began to fasten the arms of his prisoner behind him  but black jim was not to be secured without a struggle  despair lent him energy and power  darting forward he endeavoured to throw his captor down and partially succeeded but captain buntings spirit was fully roused and like most powerful men whose dispositions are habitually mild and peaceful he was in a blaze of uncontrollable passion  for some time black jim writhed like a serpent in the strong grasp of his antagonist and once or twice it seemed as if he would succeed in freeing himself but the captains hands had been trained for years to grasp and hold on with vicelike tenacity and no efforts could disengage them  the two men swayed to and fro in their efforts no sound escaping them save an occasional gasp for breath as they put forth renewed energy in the deadly struggle at last black jim began to give way  he was forced down on one knee then he fell heavily on his side and the captain placed his knee on his chest  just then a peculiar hiss was heard behind them and the captain looking back observed that a third party had come upon the scene  the grizzlybear which has been described as watching captain bunting at dinner had left its former position on the brow of the precipice and whether from motives of curiosity or by accident we will not presume to say had followed the captains track  it now stood regarding the two men with an uncommonly ferocious aspect  its indignation may perhaps be accounted for by the fact that they stood in the only path by which it could advancea precipice on one side and a thicket on the other rendering the passage difficult or impossible  grizzlies are noted for their objection to turn out of their way for man or beast so the combatants no sooner beheld the ferociouslooking animal than they sprang up seized their weapons and fired together at their common enemy  bruin shook his head uttered a savage growl and charged  it seemed as if black jim had missed altogethernot to be wondered at considering the circumstancesand the mixture of shot and slugs from the blunderbuss was little more hurtful than a shower of hail to the thickskinned monarch of these western hills  be this as it may the two men were compelled to turn and flee for their lives  black jim being the nimbler of the two was soon out of sight among the rocks of the precipices and we may remark in passing he did not again make his appearance  inwardly thanking the bear for its timely appearance he ran at top speed into the mountains and hid himself among those wild lonely recesses that are visited but rarely by man or beast  captain bunting endeavoured to save himself by darting up the face of the precipice on his left but the foothold was bad and the bear proved about as nimble as himself compelling him to leap down again and make for the nearest tree  in doing so he tripped over a fallen branch and fell with stunning violence to the ground  he rose however instantly and grasping the lower limb of a small oak drew himself with some difficulty up among the branches  the bear came thundering on and reached the tree a few seconds later it made several abortive efforts to ascend and then sitting down at the foot it looked up grinning and growling horribly in disappointed rage  the captain had dropped the blunderbuss in his fall and now with deep regret and not a little anxiety found himself unarmed and a prisoner true his long knife was still in its place but he was too well aware of the strength and ferocity of the grizzlybearfrom hearsay and now from ocular demonstrationto entertain the idea of acting on the offensive with such a weapon  the sun sank behind the mountainpeaks and the shades of night began to fall upon the landscape and still did captain bunting and the bear sitthe one at the top and the other at the foot of the oaktree looking at each other  as darkness came on the form of the bear became indistinct and shadowy and the captains eyes waxed heavy from constant staring and fatigue so that at length bruin seemed to the alarmed fancy of the treed mariner to be twice the size of an elephant  at last the darkness became so deep that its form mingled with the shadows on the ground and for some time the uncertainty as to its actual presence kept the prisoner wakeful but soon his eyes began to close despite his utmost efforts to keep them open and for two hours he endured an agonising struggle with sleep compared to which his previous struggle with black jim was mere childsplay  he tried every possible position among the branches in the hope of finding one in which he might indulge in sleep without the risk of falling but no such position was to be found the limbs of the tree were too small and too far apart  at last however he did find a spot to lie down on and with a sigh of relief lay back to indulge in repose  alas the spot was a mythhe merely dreamed it the next moment he dropt like a huge overripe pear to the ground  fortunately a bush broke the violence of his fall and springing up with a cry of consternation he rushed towards the tree expecting each instant to feel the terrible hug of his ursine enemy the very marrow in his backbone seemed to shrink for he fancied that he actually felt the dreaded claws sinking into his flesh  in his haste he missed the branch and fell violently forward scratching himself terribly among the bushes  again he rose and a cold perspiration broke out upon him as he uttered an involuntary howl of terror and once more leaped up at the limb of the oak which he could just barely see  he caught it despair nerved him and in another moment he was safe and panting violently among the branches  we need scarcely say that this little episode gave his feelings such a tremendous shock that his tendency to sleep was thoroughly banished but another and a better result flowed from itthe involuntary hubbub created by his yells and crashing falls reached listening and not fardistant ears  during their evening meal that day ned sinton and his comrades had speculated pretty freely and somewhat jocularly on the probable result of the captains hunting expeditionexpressing opinions regarding the powers of the blunderbuss which it was a shame larry oneil said to spake behind its back but as night drew on they conversed more seriously and when darkness had fairly set in they became anxious  its quite clear that somethings wrong cried ned sinton entering the tent hastily we must up and search for him  the captains not the man to lose his way with a compass in his pocket and so many landmarks round him  all the party rose at once and began to buckle on belts and arm while eagerly suggesting plans of search  who can make a torch inquired ned  heres one ready made to hand cried maxton seizing a huge pineknot and lighting it  some one must stay behind to look after our things  the newcomers who camped beside us today are not used to mining life and dont sufficiently know the terrors of lynch law  do you stop maxton  now then the rest of you come along  ned issued from the tent as he spoke and walked at a rapid pace along the track leading up the valley followed closely by tom collins larry oneil and bill jonesall of whom were armed with rifles revolvers and bowieknives  for a long time they walked on in silence guided by the faint light of the stars until they came to the flat rock which had formed the captains dinnertable  here they called a halt in order to discuss the probability of their lost comrade having gone up the ravine the question was soon settled by larry who discovered a few crumbs of the biscuit lying on the rock and footprints leading up the ravine for the captain worthy man had stepped recklessly into the little stream when he went to fill his pannikin and his wet feet left a distinct track behind him for some distance  he cant have gone far up such a wild place as this said tom collins while they moved cautiously along  kindle the torch ned it will light us on our way and be a guide to the captain if hes within sight  it will enlighten enemies too if any are within range replied ned hesitating  oh no fear rejoined tom our greatest enemy is darkness here jones hand me your matchbox  in a few seconds the torch flared forth casting a broad glare of light on their path as they advanced examining the foot of precipices  give a shout larry said ned  larry obeyed and all listened intently but save the echo from the wild cliffs no reply was heard  had the captain been wideawake at the time he would doubtless have heard the friendly shout but his ears were dull from prolonged watching  it was thought needless to repeat the cry so the party resumed their search with anxious forebodings in their hearts though their lips were silent  they had not proceeded far however when the noise occasioned by the captains fall from the tree as already described struck upon their ears  och whats that exclaimed larry with a look of mingled surprise and superstitious fear  for a minute the party seemed transformed into statues as each listened intently to the mysterious sounds  they come from the other side of the point ahead remarked ned in a whisper  light another torch larry and come onquick  ned led the way at a run holding one of the torches high above his head and in a few minutes passed round the point above referred to the glare of his torch immediately swept far ahead and struck with gladsome beam on the now wakeful eye of the captain who instantly greeted it with one of his own peculiarly powerful and eminently nautical roars  hooroo yelled larry in reply dashing forward at full speed  here we are all right capting comin to the rescue dont give in capting pitch into the blackguards  look out for the grizzlybear roared the captain as his friends advanced at a run waving their torches encouragingly  the whole party came to a dead halt on this unexpected caution and each cocked his piece as they looked first into the gloom beyond and then at each other in surprise and perplexity  halloo captain where are you shouted ned  and wheres the bear added tom collins  right in front o you replied the captain about fifty yards on the bears at the bottom o the tree and im atop of it  come on and fire together but aim low dye hear  ay ay sir replied bill jones as if he were answering a command on shipboard while he advanced boldly in the direction indicated  the others were abreast of him instantly ned and larry holding the torches high in their left hands as they approached step by step with rifles ready for instant use  have a care cried the captain i see him  he seems to be crouchin to make a rush  this caused another halt but as no rush was made the party continued to advance very slowly  oh av ye would only shew yerself said larry in a suppressed tone of exasperation at being kept so long in nervous expectation  i see him cried ned taking aim  the rest of the party cried where aimed in the same direction and the whole fired a volley the result of which was that captain bunting fell a second time to the ground crashing through the branches with a terrible noise and alighting heavily at the foot of the tree  to the surprise of all he instantly jumped up and seizing ned and tom as they came up shook them warmly by the hand  och are ye not shot capting exclaimed larry  not a bit not even hurt answered the captain laughing  the fact was that captain bunting in his anxiety to escape being accidentally shot by his comrades had climbed to the utmost possible height among the tender top branches of the oak  when the volley was fired he lost his balance fell through the tree the under branches of which happily broke his fall and finally alighted on the back of the grizzlybear itself which lay extended and quite dead on the ground  faix weve polished him off for wance cried larry in the excess of his triumph as he stood looking at the fallen bear  faix weve done nothing of the sort retorted tom collins who was examining the carcase  its been dead for hours and is quite cold every bullet has missed too for the shot that settled him is on the side next the ground  so much for hasty shooting  had bruin been alive when we fired im inclined to think that some of us would not be alive now  now thats wot i wos sure of remarked bill jones  wot i says is thiswen yer goin aloft to reef tosails dont be in a hurry  its o no manner o use tryin to shove on the wind  if yeve got a thing to do do it slowslow an sure  if ye havent got a thing to do in coorse ye cant do it but if ye have dont be in a hurryi says  bill joness maxim is undoubtedly a good one  not a scratch had the bear received from any one of the party  the bullet of black jim had laid him low  although hurriedly aimed it had reached the animals heart and all the time that captain bunting was struggling to overcome his irresistible tendency to sleep poor bruin was lying a helpless and lifeless body at the foot of the oaktree    chapter fifteen  ahwow saved from an untimely fatelynch law enforcedned sinton resolves to renounce golddigging for a time and tom collins seconds him  ahwow sat on the stump of an oaktree looking to use a familiar though incorrect expression very blue indeed  and no wonder for ahwow was going to be hanged  perhaps courteous reader you think we are joking but we assure you we are not  ahwow had just been found guilty or pronounced guiltywhich at the diggings meant the same thingof stealing two thousand dollars worth of golddust and was about to expiate his crime on the branch of a tree  there could be no doubt of his guilt so said the enlightened jury who tried him so said the halftipsy judge who condemned him and so said the amiable populace which had assembled to witness his execution  it cannot be denied that appearances went very much against ahwowso much so that maxton and even captain bunting entertained suspicions as to his innocence though they pleaded hard for his pardon  the gold had been discovered hid near the chinamans tent and the bag containing it was recognised and sworn to by at least a dozen of the diggers as that belonging to the man from whom the gold had been stolen  the only point that puzzled the jury was the strong assertions of captain bunting maxton and collins that to their certain belief the poor celestial had dug beside them each day and slept beside them each night for three weeks past at a distance of three miles from the spot where the robbery took place  but the jury were determined to hang somebody so they shut their ears to all and sundry save and except to those who cried out string the riptile upsarves him right  kosing also sat on the treestump endeavouring to comfort ahwow by stroking his pigtail and howling occasionally in an undertone  it seemed indeed that the poor mans career was drawing to a close for two men advanced and seizing his pinioned arms led him under the fatal limb but a short respite occurred in consequence of a commotion in the outskirts of the crowd where two men were seen forcing a passage towards the centre  ned sinton and larry oneil had been away in the mountains prospecting at the time when ahwow was captured and led to the settlement near the first residence of our adventurers to stand his trial  the others accompanied the condemned man in order if possible to save him leaving jones behind to guard their property and acquaint ned with the state of affairs on his return  our hero knew too well the rapid course of lynch law to hesitate  he started at once with larry down the stream to save if possible the life of his servant for whom he felt a curious sort of patronising affection and who he was sure must be innocent  he arrived just in time  howld on boys cried larry flourishing his felt hat as they pushed through the crowd  stay friends cried ned gaining the centre of the circle at last dont act hastily  this man is my servant  that dont make him an honest man i guess said a cynical bystander  perhaps not retorted ned but it binds me in honour to clear him if i can  hear hear said several voices get up on the stump an fire away stranger  ned obeyed  gentlemen he began i can swear in the first place that the chinaman has not been a quarter of a mile from my tent for three weeks past so that he could not have stolen the gold  how then came it beside his tent inquired a voice  ill tell you if you will listen  this morning early i started on a prospecting ramble up the stream and not long after i set out i caught a glance of that villain black jim who you know has been supposed for some time back to have been lurking in the neighbourhood  he ran off the moment he caught sight of me and although i followed him at full speed for a considerable distance he succeeded in escaping  however i noticed the print of his footsteps in a muddy place over which he passed and observed that his right boot had no heel  on returning home this afternoon and hearing what had happened i went to the spot where the bag of gold had been discovered and there sure enough i found footprints one of which shewed that the wearers right boot had no heel  now gentlemen it dont need much speaking to make so clear a matter clearer i leave you to judge whether this robbery has been committed by the chinaman or not  neds speech was received with various cries some of which shewed that the diggers were not satisfied with his explanation and ahwows fate still trembled in the balance when the owner of the bag of gold stepped forward and admitted that he had observed similar footmarks in the neighbourhood of his tent just after the robbery was committed and said that he believed the chinaman was innocent  this set the matter at rest  ahwow was cast loose and congratulated by several of the bystanders on his escape but there seemed a pretty general feeling amongst many of the others that they had been unjustly deprived of their prey and there is no saying what might have happened had not another culprit appeared on the scene to divert their attention  the man who was led forward had all the marks of a thorough desperado about him  from his language it was impossible to judge what country had the honour of giving him birth but it was suspected that his last residence had been botany bay  had this mans innocence been ever so clearly proved he could not have escaped from such judges in their then disappointed state of mind but his guilt was unquestionable  he had been caught in the act of stealing from a monte table  the sum was not very large however so it was thought a little too severe to hang him but he was condemned to have his head shaved his ears cut off and to receive a hundred lashes  the sentence was executed promptly notwithstanding the earnest remonstrances of a few of the betterdisposed among the crowd and ned seeing that he could do nothing to mitigate the punishment of the poor wretch left the spot with his comrades and the rescued chinaman  that night as they all sat round their campfire eating supper with a degree of zest known only to those who labour at severe and outofdoor occupation all day ned sinton astonished his companions not a little by stating his intention to leave them for the purpose of making a tour through the country  make a tour exclaimed maxton in surprise  an lave all the goold cried larry oneil pausing in his mastication of a tough lump of bearsteak  why boy said captain bunting laying down his knife and looking at ned in amazement whats put that in your head eh  being somewhat tired of grubbing in the mud has put it into my head replied ned smiling  the fact is comrades that i feel disposed for a ramble and i dont feel bent on making a fortune  you may perhaps be surprised to hear such a statement but  not at allby no means interrupted bill jones im surprised at nothin in this here country  if i seed a firstrate manowar comin up the valley at fifteen knots with stunsails alow and aloft stem on against the wind an carryin all before it like nothin i wouldnt be surprised not a bit so i wouldnt  well perhaps not resumed ned but surprised or not my statement is true  i dont care about making my pile in a hurry  life was not given to us to spend it in making or digging gold and being quite satisfied in the meantime with the five or six hundred pounds of profits that fall to my share i am resolved to make over my unfinished claim to the firm and set out on my travels through the country  i shall buckle on my bowieknife and revolver and go where fancy leads me as long as my funds last when they are exhausted i will return and set to work again  now who will go with me  are you in earnest asked tom collins  in earnest ay that am i never was more so in my life  why i feel quite ashamed of myself  here have i been living for weeks in one of the most romantic and beautiful parts of this world without taking more notice of it almost than if it did not exist  do you think that with youth and health and a desire to see everything that is beautiful in creation im going to stand all day and every day up to the knees in dirty water scraping up little particles of gold  not i  i mean to travel as long as i have a dollar in my pocket when that is empty ill work  ned spoke in a halfjesting tone but there is no doubt that he gave utterance to the real feelings of his heart  he felt none of that eager thirst for gold which burned like a fever in the souls of hundreds and thousands of the men who poured at that time in a continuous and everincreasing stream into california  gold he valued merely as a means of accomplishing present ends he had no idea of laying it up for the future married men he thought might perhaps with propriety amass money for the benefit of their families but he wasnt a married man and didnt mean to be one so he felt in duty bound to spend all the gold he dug out of the earth  we do not pretend to enter into a disquisition as to the correctness or incorrectness of neds opinions we merely state them leaving our reader to exercise his own reasoning powers on the subject if so disposed  for a few seconds after neds last speech no sound escaped the lips of his comrades save those resulting from the process of mastication  at last tom collins threw down his knife and slapped his thigh energetically as he exclaimed ill go with you ned  ive made up my mind  im tired of digging too and im game for a ramble into the heart of the rocky mountains if you like  bravo  tom cried captain bunting slapping his companion on the shoulderwell and bravely spoken but youre a goose for all that and so saving his presence is commodore ned sinton  why youll just waste two months or so in profitless wandering and return beggars to the little creek to begin the work all over again  take my advice ladsthe advice of an old salt who knows a thing or twoand remain where you are till we have worked out all the gold hereabouts  after that you may talk of shifting  youre a very sour old salt to endeavour to damp our spirits in that way at the outset but it wont do my mind is made up and im glad to find that there is at least one of the party who is strong enough to break these golden chains  faix i comed here for goold an i stop here for the same raison remarked larry scraping the last morsels from the bottom of the kettle with an iron spoon ive thravelled more nor enough in me day so i can affoord to stop at home now  get out you renegade do you call this home cried ned  tis all thats of it at present anyhow  when shall we start inquired tom collins  tomorrow  we have few preparations to make and the sooner we go the better for when the rainy season sets in our journeying will be stopped perforce  i have a plan in my mind which i shall detail to you after we retire to rest  meanwhile ill go and improve my bed which has been so uncomfortable for some nights past that my very bones are aching  ned rose took up an axe and going into the bush in rear of the tent cut down a young pinetree the tender shoots and branches of which he stripped off and strewed thickly on the ground on which he was wont to sleep over these he spread two thick blankets and on this simple but springy and comfortable couch he and tom coffins lay down side by side to talk over their future plans while their comrades snored around them  daylight found them still talking so pausing by mutual consent they snatched an hours repose before commencing the needful preparations for their contemplated journey    chapter sixteen  ned and tom take to wanderingphilosophical speculationsa startling apparitionthe digger indianswater boiled in a basketthe gloomy passthe attack by robbersthe fighta surprisethe encampment  change is one of the laws of nature  we refer not to smallchange reader but to physical material change  everything is given to change men and things and place and circumstances all change more or less as time rolls on in its endless course  following then this inevitable law of nature we too will change the scene and convey our reader deeper in among the plains and mountains of the far far west  it is a beautiful evening in july  the hot season has not yet succeeded in burning up all nature into a dry russetbrown  the whole face of the country is green and fresh after a recent shower which has left myriads of diamonddrops trembling from the point of every leaf and blade  a wide valley of a noble parklike appearance is spread out before us with scattered groups of trees all over it blue mountainranges in the far distance circling round it and a bright stream winding down its emerald breast  on the hillsides the wildflowers grow so thickly that they form a soft thick couch to lie upon immense trees chiefly pines and cedars rise here and there like giants above their fellows  oaks too are numerous and the scene in many places is covered with mansanita underwood a graceful and beautiful shrub  the trees and shrubbery however are not so thickly planted as to intercept the view and the ground undulates so much that occasionally we overtop them and obtain a glimpse of the wide vale before us  over the whole landscape there is a golden sunny haze that enriches while it softens every object and the balmy atmosphere is laden with the sweet perfume called forth by the passing shower  one might fancy eden to have been somewhat similar to this and here as there the presence of the lord might be recognised in a higher degree than in most other parts of this earth for in this almost untrodden wilderness his preeminently beautiful works have not yet to any great extent been marred by the hand of man  far away towards the north two horsemen may be seen wending their way through the country at a slow ambling pace as if they would fain prolong their ride in such a lovely vale  the one is ned sinton the other tom collins  it had cost these worthies a week of steady riding to reach the spot on which we now find them during which time they had passed through great varieties of scenery had seen many specimens of digginglife and had experienced not a few vicissitudes but their griefs were few and slight compared with their enjoyments and at the moment we overtake them they were riding they knew not and they cared not whither  sufficient for them to know that the wilds before them were illimitable that their steeds were of the best and fleetest mexican breed that their purses were welllined with dollars and golddust that they were armed with rifles pistols knives and ammunition to the teeth and that the land was swarming with game  tis a perfect paradise exclaimed tom collins as they reined up on the brow of a hill to gaze at the magnificent prospect before them  strange murmured ned half soliloquising that although so wild and uncultivated it should remind me so forcibly of home  yonder bend in the stream and the scenery round it is so like to the spot where i was born and where i spent my earliest years that i can almost fancy the old house will come into view at the next turn  it does indeed remind one of the cultivated parks of england replied tom but almost all my early associations are connected with cities  i have seen little of uncontaminated nature all my life except the blue sky through chimney tops and even that was seen through a medium of smoke  do you know remarked ned as they resumed their journey at a slow pace it has always seemed to me that cities are unnatural monstrosities and that there should be no such things  indeed replied tom laughing how then would you have men to live  in the country of course in cottages and detached houses  i would sow london liverpool manchester etcetera broadcast over the land so that there would be no spot in britain in which there were not clusters of human dwellings each with its little garden around it and yet no spot on which a city could be found  hum rather awkward for the transaction of business i fear suggested tom  not a bit our distances would be greater but we could overcome that difficulty by using horses more than we doand railroads  and how would you manage with huge manufactories inquired tom  ive not been able to solve that difficulty yet replied ned smiling but my not being able to point out how things may be put right does not in the least degree alter the fact that as they are at present they are wrong  most true my sagacious friend said tom but pray how do you prove the fact that things are wrong  i prove it thusyou admit i suppose that the air of all large cities is unhealthy as compared with that of the country and that men and women who dwell in cities are neither so robust nor so healthy as those who dwell in country places  im not sure that i do admit it answered tom  surely you dont deny that people of the cities deem it a necessary of life to get off to the country at least once a year in order to recruit and that they invariably return better in health than when they left  true but that is the result of change  ay added ned the result of change from worse to better  well i admit it for the sake of argument  well then if the building of cities necessarily and inevitably creates a condition of atmosphere which is to some extent no matter how slight prejudicial to health those who build them and dwell in them are knowingly damaging the life which has been given them to be cherished and taken care of  ned said tom quietly youre a goose  tom retorted ned i know it but in the sense in which you apply the term all men are geese  they are divided into two classesnamely geese who are such because they cant and wont listen to reason and geese who are such because they take the trouble to talk philosophically to the former but to return from this digression what think you of the argument  tom replied by reining up his steed pointing to an object in front and inquiring what think you of that  the object referred to was a man but in appearance at least he was not many degrees removed from the monkey  he was a black squat hideouslooking native and his whole costume besides the little strip of cloth usually worn by natives round the loins consisted of a black silk hat and a pair of wellington boots  dear reader do not suppose that i am trying to impose upon your goodnatured credulity  what i state is a fact however unlikely it may appear in your eyes  the natives of this part of the country are called digger indians not with reference to golddigging but from the fact of their digging subterranean dwellings in which they pass the winter and also from the fact that they grub in the earth a good deal for roots on which they partly subsist  they are degraded miserable creatures and altogether uncivilised besides being diminutive in stature  soon after the first flood of goldhunters swept over their lands these poor creatures learned the value of gold but they were too lazy to work diligently for it  they contented themselves with washing out enough to purchase a few articles of luxury in the shape of castoff apparel from the white men  when stores began to be erected here and there throughout the country they visited them to purchase fresh provisions and articles of dress of which latter they soon became passionately fond  but the digger indians were not particular as to style or fashion glitter and gay colour were the chief elements of attraction  sometimes a naked savage might be seen going about with a secondhand dresscoat put on the wrong way and buttoned up the back  another would content himself with a red silk handkerchief tied round his head or shoulders a third would thrust his spindleshanks through the arms of a sleeved vest and button the body round his loins while a fourth like the one now under consideration would parade about in a hat and boots  the poor digger had drawn the right boot on the left foot and the left boot on the righta matter of little moment however as they were immensely too large for him as was also the hat which only remained on his brows by being placed very much back on the head  he was a most singular being and ned and tom after the first glance of astonishment were so unmannered as to laugh at him until they almost fell off their horses  the digger was by no means disconcerted  he evidently was accustomed to the free and easy manners of white men and while they rolled in their saddles he stood quietly beside them grinning hideously from ear to ear  truly a rare specimen of humanity cried ned when he recovered his composure  where did you come from old boy  the digger shook his head and uttered some unintelligible words  its of no use speaking to him he dont understand english said tom collins with a somewhat puzzled expression  the two friends made several attempts to ask him by signs where he lived but they utterly failed  their first efforts had the effect of making the man laugh but their second attempts being more energetic and extravagant frightened him so that he manifested a disposition to run away  this disposition they purposely encouraged until he fairly took to his heels and by following him they at last came upon the village in which his tribe resided  here they found an immense assemblage of men and women and children whose appearance denoted dirtiness laziness and poverty  they were almost all in a state bordering on nudity but a few of them wore miscellaneous portions of european apparel  the hair of the men was long except on the forehead where it was cut square just above the eyebrows  the children wore no clothes at all  the infants were carried on stiff cradles similar to those used by north american indians  they all resided in tents made of brushwood and sticks and hundreds of mangy halfstarved curs dwelt along with them  the hero of the hat and boots was soon propitiated by the gift of a few inches of tobacco and ned sinton and tom collins were quickly on intimate terms with the whole tribe  it is difficult to resist the tendency to laugh when a human being stands before you in a ludicrouslymeagre costume making hideous grimaces with his features and remarkable contortions with his limbs in the vain efforts to make himself understood by one who does not speak his language  neds powers of endurance were tested in this way by the chief of the tribe an elderly man with a beard so sparse that each stumpy hair might have been easily counted  this individual was clad in the rough ragged blue coat usually worn by irish labourers of the poorest class  it was donned with the tails in front and two brass buttons the last survivors of a once glittering double row fastened it across the back of its savage owner  what can he mean said ned at the close of a series of pantomimic speeches in which the indian vainly endeavoured to get him to understand something having reference to the mountains beyond for he pointed repeatedly towards them  it seems to me that he would have us understand said tom that the road lies before us and the sooner we take ourselves off the better  ned shook his head  i dont think that likely he seems rather to wish us to remain more than once he has pointed to his tent and beckoned us to enter  perhaps the old fellow wants us to become members of his tribe suggested tom  evidently he cannot lead his braves on the warpath as he was wont to do and he wishes to make you chief in his room  what think you  shall we remain  the blue coat would suit you admirably  during this colloquy the old savage looked from one speaker to another with great eagerness as if trying to comprehend what they said then renewing his gesticulations he succeeded at last in convincing the travellers that he wished them not to pursue their journey any further in the direction in which they were going  this was a request with which they did not however feel disposed to comply but seeing that he was particularly anxious that they should accept of his hospitality they dismounted and fastening their horses to a tree close beside the opening of the chiefs hut they entered  the inside of this curious beehive of a dwelling was dirty and dark besides being halffull of smoke created by the pipe of a squawthe old mans wifewho regaled herself there with the soothing weed  there were several dogs there also and two particularly small infants in wooden cradles who were tied up like mummies and did nothing but stare right before them into space  whats that inquired tom pointing to a basketful of smoking water  it looks like a basket replied ned  it is a basket remarked tom examining the article in question and as i live superb soup in it  tom said ned sinton solemnly have a care if it is soup depend upon it dogs or rats form the basis of its composition  ned said tom with equal solemnity eat and ask no questions  tom followed his own advice by accepting a dish of soup with a large lump of meat in it which was at that moment offered to him by the old chief who also urged ned sinton to partake but he declined and lighting his pipe proceeded to enjoy a smoke at the same time handing the old man a plug of tobacco which he accepted promptly and began to use forthwith  while thus engaged they had an opportunity of observing how the squaw boiled water in a basket  laying aside her pipe she hauled out a goodysized and very neatlymade basket of wickerwork so closely woven by her own ingenious hands that it was perfectly watertight this she threequarters filled and then put into it redhot stones which she brought in from a fire kindled outside  the stones were thrown in in succession till the temperature was raised to the boiling point and afterwards a little dead animal was put into the basket  the sight of this caused tom collins to terminate his meal somewhat abruptly and induced ned to advise him to try a little more  no thank you replied tom lighting his pipe hastily and taking up a bow and several arrows which he appeared to regard with more than usual interest  the bow was beautifully maderather short and tipped with horn  the arrows were formed of two distinct pieces of wood spliced together and were shod with flint they were feathered in the usual way  all the articles manufactured by these natives were neatly done and evinced considerable skill in the use of their few and simple tools  after resting halfanhour the two friends rose to depart and again the old indian manifested much anxiety to prevail on them to remain but resisting all his entreaties they mounted their horses and rode away carrying with them the good wishes of the community by the courtesy of their manners and a somewhat liberal distribution of tobacco at parting  the country through which they passed became wilder at every step for each hour brought them visibly nearer the mountainrange and towards nightfall they entered one of the smaller passes or ravines that divided the lower range of hills at which they first arrived  here a rugged precipice from which projected pendent rocks and scrubby trees rose abruptly on the right of the road and a dense thicket of underwood mingled with huge masses of fallen rock lay on their left we use the word road advisedly for the broad highway of the flowering plains over which the horsemen had just passed narrowed at this spot as it entered the ravine and was a prettywelldefined path over which parties of diggers and wandering indians occasionally passed  does not this wild spot remind you of the nursery tales we used to read said ned as they entered the somewhat gloomy defile which used to begin once upon a time  hist ned is that a grizzly  both riders drew up abruptly and grasped their rifles  i hear nothing whispered ned  it must have been imagination said tom throwing his rifle carelessly over his left arm as they again advanced  the gloom of the locality which was deepened by the rapidlygathering shades of night quieted their spirits and induced them to ride on in silence  about fifty yards further on the rustling in the bushes was again heard and both travellers pulled up and listened intently  pshaw cried ned at last urging his horse forward and throwing his piece on his shoulder we are starting at the rustling of the night wind come come tom dont let us indulge superstitious feelings  at that moment there was a crash in the bushes on both sides of them and their horses reared wildly as four men rushed upon them  before their steeds became manageable they were each seized by a leg and hurled from their saddles  in the fall their rifles were thrown out of their grasp into the bushes but this mattered little for in a close struggle pistols are better weapons  seizing their revolvers ned and tom instantly sprang up and fired at their assailants but without effect both being so much shaken by their fall  the robbers returned the fire also without effect  in the scuffle ned was separated from his friend and only knew that he maintained the fight manfully from the occasional shots that were fired near him  his whole attention however had to be concentrated on the two stalwart ruffians with whom he was engaged  five or six shots were fired at a few yards distance quick as lightning yet strange to say all missed  then the taller of the two opposed to ned hurled his revolver full in his face and rushed at him the pistol struck ned on the chest and almost felled him but he retained his position and met the highwayman with a welldirected blow of his fist right between the eyes  both went down under the impetus of the rush and the second robber immediately sprang upon ned and seized him by the throat  but he little knew the strength of the man with whom he had to deal  our hero caught him in the iron grasp of his right hand while with his left he hurled aside the almost inanimate form of his first assailant then throwing the other on his back he placed his knee on his chest and drew his bowieknife  even in the terrible passion of mortal combat ned shuddered at the thought of slaying a helpless opponent  he threw the knife aside and struck the man violently with his fist on the forehead and then sprang up to rescue tom who although he had succeeded at the outset in felling one of the robbers with the butt of his pistol was still engaged in doubtful strife with a man of great size and power  when ned came up the two were down on their knees each grasping the others wrist in order to prevent their bowieknives from being used  their struggles were terrible for each knew that the first who freed his right hand would instantly take the others life  ned settled the matter however by again using his fist which he applied so promptly to the back of the robbers neck that he dropped as if he had been shot  thank yougod bless you ned gasped tom as soon as he recovered breath you have saved my life for certainly i could not have held out a minute longer  the villain has all but broken my right arm  never mind cried ned stooping down and turning the stunned robber over on his face give me a hand boy we must not let the fellows recover and find themselves free to begin the work over again  take that fellows neckcloth and tie his hands behind his back  tom obeyed at once and in a few minutes the four highwaymen were bound hand and foot and laid at the side of the road  now said ned we must push on to the nearest settlement hothaste and bring a party out to escorthalloo  tom are you wounded  not badlya mere cut on the head  why your face is all covered with blood  its only in consequence of my wiping it with a bloody handkerchief then but you can examine and satisfy yourself  the wound is but slight i see rejoined ned after a brief manipulation of toms skull now then let us away  well have to catch our horses first and that wont be an easy matter  tom was right  it cost them halfanhour to secure them and recover their rifles and other arms which had been scattered over the field of battle  on returning to the spot where the robbers lay they found them all partially recovered and struggling violently to free themselves three of them failed even to slacken their bonds but the fourth the powerful man who had nearly overcome tom collins had wellnigh freed his hands when his captors came up  lie quiet said ned in a low tone if you dont want the butt of my rifle on your skull  the man lay down instantly  tom go and cut a stake six feet long and ill watch these fellows till you come back  the stake was soon brought and lashed to the robbers back in such a manner that he was rendered utterly powerless  the others were secured in a similar manner and then the two travellers rode forward at a gallop  for nearly an hour they continued to advance without speaking or drawing rein  at the end of that time while sweeping round the jutting base of a precipitous rock they almost ran into a band of horsemen who were trotting briskly towards them  both parties halted and threw forward their rifles or drew their revolvers for instant use gazing at each other the while in silent surprise at the suddenness of their meeting  give in ye villains at last shouted a stern voice or well blow ye out o the saddle  youve no chance down your arms i say  not until i know what right you have to command us replied ned somewhat nettled at the overbearing tone of his opponent  we are peaceable travellers desiring to hurt no one but if we were not surely so large a party need not be afraid  we dont intend to run away still less do we intend to dispute your passage  the strangers lowered their firearms as if halfashamed at being surprised into a state of alarm by two men  who said we were afraid young man continued the first speaker riding up with his comrades and eyeing the travellers narrowly  where have you come from and how comes it that your clothes are torn and your faces covered with blood  the party of horsemen edged forward as he spoke in such a manner as to surround the two friends but ned although he observed the movement was unconcerned as from the looks of the party he felt certain they were good men and true  you are a close interrogator for a stranger he replied  perhaps you will inform me where you have come from and what is your errand in these lonesome places at this hour of the night  ill tell ye wot it is stranger answered another of the partya big insolent sort of fellowwere out after a band o scoundrels that have infested them parts for a long time an it strikes me you know more about them than we do  perhaps you are right answered ned  mayhap theyre not very far off from where were standin continued the man laying his hand on tom collinss shoulder  tom gave him a look that induced him to remove the hand  right again rejoined ned with a smile  i know where the villains are and ill lead you to them in an hour if you choose to follow me  the men looked at each other in surprise  youll not object to some o us ridin before an some behind ye said the second speaker jist by way o preventin yer hosses from runnin away they looks a little skeary  by no means answered ned lead on but keep off the edge of the track till i call a halt  why so stranger  never mind but do as i bid you  the tone in which this was said effectually silenced the man and during the ride no further questions were asked  about a quarterofanhour afterwards the moon rose and they advanced at such a rapid pace that in a short time they were close upon the spot where the battle had taken place  just before reaching it ned called a halt and directed the party to dismount and follow him on foot  although a good deal surprised they obeyed without question for our hero possessed in an eminent degree the power of constituting himself a leader among those with whom he chanced to come into contact  fastening his horse to a tree ned led the men forward a hundred yards  are these the men you search for he inquired  they are sir exclaimed one of the party in surprise as he stooped to examine the features of the robbers who lay where they had been left  halloo exclaimed tom collins i say the biggest fellows gone didnt we lay him hereabouts  eh dear me yes why this is the very spot i do believe  all further remarks were checked at that moment by the sound of horses hoofs approaching and almost before any one could turn round a horseman came thundering down the pass at full gallop  uttering a savage laugh of derision he discharged his pistol full into the centre of the knot of men as he passed and in another moment was out of sight  several of the onlookers had presence of mind enough to draw their pistols and fire at the retreating figure but apparently without effect  its him cried tom collins and hes mounted on your horse ned  after him lads shouted ned as he ran back towards the place where the horses were fastened  whose is the best horse  hold on stranger said one of the men as he ran up to ned ye may save yer wind  none o the horses can overtake your one i guess  i was lookin at him as we came along  it would only be losin time for nothin an hes miles ahead by this time  ned sinton felt that the mans remarks were too true so he returned to the spot where the remaining robbers lay and found that the miners had cut their fastenings and were busily engaged in rebinding their hands behind them preparatory to carrying them back to their settlement  it was discovered that the lashings of one of the men had been partly severed with a knife and as he could not have done it himself it was plain that the robber who had escaped must have done it and that the opportune arrival of the party had prevented him from accomplishing his purpose  how the man had broken his own bonds was a mystery that could not now be solved but it was conjectured they must have been too weak and that he had burst them by main strength  another discovery was now made namely that one of the three robbers secured was no other than black jim himself the darkness of the night had prevented ned and tom from making this discovery during the fight  in less time than we have taken to describe it the robbers were secured and each was mounted behind one of his captors  aint you goin with us inquired one of the men observing that ned sinton stood leaning on his rifle as if he meant to remain behind  no answered ned my companion and i have travelled far today besides fighting a somewhat tough battle we mean to camp here for the night and shall proceed to your settlement tomorrow  the men endeavoured to dissuade them from their purpose but they were both fatigued and persisted in their determination  the impression they had made however on their new friends was so favourable that one of their number a yankee offered the loan of his horse to ned an offer which the latter accepted thankfully promising to return it safe and sound early on the following day  five minutes later the sound of the retreating hoofs died away and the travellers stood silently side by side in the gloomy ravine  for a few minutes neither spoke then ned heaved a sigh and looking in his companions face with a seriocomicallysad expression said  it may not perhaps have occurred to you tom but are you aware that we are a couple of beggars  if you use the term in its slang sense and mean to insinuate that we are a couple of unfortunate beggars i agree with you  well ive no objection rejoined ned to your taking my words in that sense but i mean to say that over and above that we are real veritable bona fide beggars inasmuch as we have not a sixpence in the world  tom collinss visage grew exceedingly long  our united purse pursued ned hung as you are aware at my saddlebow and yon unmitigated villain who appropriated my good steed is now in possession of all our hardearned gold  toms countenance became preternaturally grave but he did not venture to speak  now continued ned forcing a smile there is nothing for it but to make for the nearest diggings commence work again and postpone our travels to a future and more convenient season  we may laugh at it as we please my dear fellow but theres no denying that we are in what the yankees would call an oncommon fix  neds remark as to laughing at it was altogether uncalled for and inappropriate for his own smile might have been more correctly termed a grin and nothing was further from tom collinss thoughts at that moment than laughing  are the victuals gone too inquired ned hastily  both turned their eyes towards tom collinss horse which grazed hard by and both heaved a sigh of relief on observing that the saddlebags were safe  this was a small drop of comfort in their otherwise bitter cup and they made the most of it  each as if by a common impulse pretending that he cared very little about the matter and assuming that the other stood in need of being cheered and comforted went about the preparations for encamping with a degree of reckless joviality that insensibly raised their spirits not only up to but considerably above the natural level and when at last they had spread out their viands and lighted their fire and their pipes they were according to toms assertion happy as kings  the choosing of a spot to encamp on formed the subject of an amicable dispute  i recommend the level turf under this oak said ned pointing to a huge old tree whose gnarled limbs covered a wide space of level sward  its too low objected tom tom could always objecta quality which while it acted like an agreeable dash of cayenne thrown into the conversation of some of his friends proved to be sparks applied to gunpowder in that of others its too low and doubtless moist  i think that yonder pine with its spreading branches and sweetsmelling cones and carpet of moss below is a much more fitting spot  now who is to decide the question if i dont give in tom  for i assume of course that you will never give in  at that moment an accident occurred which decided the question for them it frequently happens that some of the huge heavy branches of the oaks in america become so thoroughly dried and brittle by the intense heat of summer that they snap off without a moments warning often when there is not a breath of air sufficient to stir a leaf  this propensity is so wellknown to californian travellers that they are somewhat careful in selecting their camping ground yet despite all their care an occasional life is lost by the falling of such branches  an event of this kind occurred at the present time  the words had barely passed neds lips when a large limb of the oak beside which they stood snapt off with a loud report and fell with a crash to the ground  that settles it said tom somewhat seriously as he led his horse towards the pinetree and proceeded to spread his blanket beneath its branches  in a few minutes the bright flame of their campfire threw a lurid glare on the trees and projecting cliffs of the wild pass while they cooked and ate their frugal meal of jerked beef and biscuit  they conversed little during the repast or after it for drowsiness began to steal over them and it was not long before they laid their heads side by side on their saddles and murmuring goodnight forgot their troubles in the embrace of deep refreshing slumber    chapter seventeen  a curious and valuable draughtlynch law appliedblack jims confessionned becomes a painter and finds the profession profitable as well as amusingthe first portrait  next morning the travellers were up and away by daybreak and in the afternoon they came upon a solitary miner who was prospecting in a gulch near the roadside  this word gulch is applied to the peculiarly abrupt short ravines which are a characteristic feature in californian more than in any other mountains  the weather was exceedingly hot and the man took off his cap and wiped his streaming brow as he looked at the travellers who approached him  ha youve got water there i see cried tom collins leaping off his horse seizing a cup which stood on the ground full of clear water and draining it eagerly  stop cried the man quickly  why inquired tom smacking his lips  the miner took the empty cup and gazed inquiringly into it  humph youve drunk it every grain  drop you mean suggested tom laughing at the mans expression of course i have and why not  theres plenty more of the same tap here  oh i wouldnt mind the water replied the man if ye had only left the golddust behind but youve finished that too  you dont mean it gasped tom while the questions flashed across his mindis golddust poison  and if not is it digestible  howhow much have i swallowed  only about two dollarsit dont signify answered the man joining in the burst of laughter to which ned and tom gave way on this announcement  im afraid we must owe you the sum then said ned recovering his composure for we have only one dollar left having been robbed last night but as we mean to work in this neighbourhood i dare say you will trust us  the man agreed to this and having directed the travellers to the settlement of weaver creek resumed his work while they proceeded on their way  toms digestion did not suffer in consequence of his golden draught and we may here remark for the benefit of the curious that he never afterwards experienced any evil effects from it  we may further add that he did not forget to discharge the debt  after halfanhours ride they came in sight of a few straggling diggers from whom they learned that the settlement or village or town of weaver creek was about two miles further on and in a quarter of an hour they reached it  the spot on which it stood was wild and romantic embosomed among lofty wooded hills whose sides were indented by many a rich ravine and seamed by many a brawling watercourse  here digging was as the miners have it in full blast  pick and shovel and cradle and longtom and prospectingpanall were being plied with the utmost energy and with unwearied perseverance  the whole valley was cut up and converted into a network of holes and mudheaps and the mountain slopes were covered with the cabins huts and canvas tents of the miners  about the centre of the settlement which was a very scattered one stood a loghouse or cabin of somewhat larger dimensions than the generality of those around it  this was the grand hotel restaurant and gamblinghouse of the place besides being the scene of the trials and executions that occasionally took place  some such work was going forward when our travellers rode up for the area in front of the hotel was covered with a large concourse of miners  i suspect they are about to try the poor wretches who attacked us last night said ned dismounting at the door of the house  he had scarcely spoken when a couple of men ran towards them  here you are strangers they cried come along and bear witness agin them blackguards theyre just about to be strung up  well look after your horses  the duty was a disagreeable one but it could not be avoided so ned and tom suffered themselves to be led into the centre of the ring where the three culprits were standing already pinioned and with the ropes round their necks  for a short time silence was obtained while ned stated the circumstances of the robbery and also the facts regarding the murder of which black jim had been previously found guilty  then there was a general shout of string em up  up wi the varmints and such phrases but a short respite was granted in consequence of black jim expressing a desire to speak with ned sinton  what have you to say to me inquired ned in a low tone as he walked close up to the wretched man who although his minutes on earth were numbered looked as if he were absolutely indifferent to his fate  ive only to say answered the culprit sternly that of all the people i leaves behind me in this world theres but one i wish i hadnt bin bad to and thats kate morgan  you know something of her though youve never seen heri know that  tell her ino tell her shell find the gold i robbed her of at the foot o the pinetree behind the tent shes livin in jist now  an tell her that her little sisters not dead though she dont believe me  i took the child to  come come ha done wi yer whisperin cried several of the bystanders who were becoming impatient of delay  have patience said ned raising his hand  the man is telling me something of importance  ive done growled black jim scowling on the crowd with a look of hate i wish i hadnt said so much  the rope was tightened as he spoke and ned turning abruptly on his heel hurried away with his friend from the spot just as the three robbers were run up and suspended from the branch of the tree beneath and around which the crowd stood  entering the inn and seating themselves in a retired corner of the crowded gamblingroom ned and tom proceeded to discuss their present prospects and future plans in a frame of mind that was by no means enviable  they were several hundreds of miles distant from the scene of their first home at the diggings without a dollar in their pockets and only a horse between them  with the exception of the clothes on their backs and neds portfolio of drawing materials which he always carried slung across his shoulder they had nothing else in the world  their first and most urgent necessity was supper in order to procure which it behoved them to sell toms horse  this was easily done as on application to the landlord they were directed to a trader who was on the point of setting out on an expedition to sacramento city and who readily purchased the horse for less than half its value  being thus put in possession of funds sufficient at least for a few days they sat down to supper with relieved minds and afterwards went out to stroll about the settlement and take a look at the various diggings  the miners here worked chiefly at the bars or sandbanks thrown up in various places by the river which coursed through their valley but the labour was severe and the return not sufficient to attract impatient and sanguine miners although quite remunerative enough to those who wrought with steady perseverance  the district had been well worked and many of the miners were out prospecting for new fields of labour  a few companies had been formed and these by united action and with the aid of longtoms were well rewarded but single diggers and panwashers were beginning to become disheartened  our prospects are not bright observed tom sitting down on a rock close to the hut of a yankee who was delving busily in a hole hard by  true answered ned in one sense they are not bright but in another sense they are for i never yet in all my travels beheld so beautiful and bright a prospect of land and water as we have from this spot  just look at it tom forget your golden dreams for a little if you can and look abroad upon the splendid face of nature  neds eye brightened as he spoke for his love and admiration of the beauties and charms of nature amounted almost to a passion  tom also was a sincere admirer of lovely and especially of wild scenery although he did not express his feelings so enthusiastically  have you got your colours with you he inquired  i have and if you have patience enough to sit here for halfanhour ill sketch it  if not take a stroll and youll find me here when you return  i can admire nature for even longer than that period but i cannot consent to watch a sketcher of nature even for five minutes so ill take a stroll  in a few minutes ned with book on knee and pencil in hand was busily engaged in transferring the scene to paper oblivious of gold and prospects and everything else and utterly ignorant of the fact that the yankee digger having become curious as to what the stranger could be about had quitted his hole and now stood behind him quietly looking over his shoulder  the sketch was a very beautiful one for in addition to the varied character of the scenery and the noble background of the sierra nevada which here presented some of its wildest and most fantastic outlines the halfruined hut of the yankee with the tools and other articles scattered around it formed a picturesque foreground  we have elsewhere remarked that our hero was a good draughtsman  in particular he had a fine eye for colour and always when possible made coloured sketches during his travels in california  on the present occasion the rich warm glow of sunset was admirably given and the yankee stood gazing at the work transfixed with amazement and delight  ned first became aware of his proximity by the somewhat startling exclamation uttered close to his ear  wall stranger you air a screamer thats a fact  i presume you mean that for a compliment said ned looking up with a smile at the tall wiry sunburnt redflannelshirted strawhatted creature that leaned on his pickaxe beside him  no i dont i aint used to butter nobody  i guess youve bin raised to that sort o thing  no i merely practise it as an amateur answered ned resuming his work  now that is curous continued the yankee an im kinder sorry to heart for if ye was purfessional id give ye an order  ned almost laughed outright at this remark but he checked himself as the idea flashed across him that he might perhaps make his pencil useful in present circumstances  im not professional as yet he said gravely but i have no objection to become so if art is encouraged in these diggings  i guess it will be if you shew yer work  now whatll ye ax for that bit  this was a home question and a poser for ned had not the least idea of what sum he ought to ask for his work and at the same time he had a strong antipathy to that species of haggling which is usually prefaced by the seller with the reply whatll ye give  there was no other means however of ascertaining the marketvalue of his sketch so he put the objectionable question  ill give ye twenty dollars slick off  very good replied ned it shall be yours in ten minutes  an i say stranger continued the yankee while ned put the finishing touches to his work will ye do the inside o my hut for the same money  i will replied ned  the yankee paused for a few seconds and then added  id like to git myself throwd into the bargain but i guess yell ask more for that  no i wont ill do it for the same sum  thankee thats all square  ye see ive got a mother in ohio state an shed give her ears for any scrap of a thing o me or my new home an if yell git em both fixed off by the day arter tomorrow ill send em down to sacramento by sam scott the trader  ill rig out and fix up the hut tomorrow mornin so if ye come by breakfasttime ill be ready  ned promised to be there at the appointed hour as he rose and handed him the sketch which the man having paid the stipulated sum carried away to his hut with evident delight  halloo i say cried ned  wall answered the yankee stopping with a look of concern as if he feared the artist had repented of his bargain  mind you tell no one my prices for you see ive not had time to consider about them yet  all right mums the word replied the man vanishing into his little cabin just as tom collins returned from his ramble  halloo ned whats that i hear about prices  i hope youre not offering to speculate in halffinished holes or anything of that sort eh  sit down here my boy and ill tell you all about it  tom obeyed and with a halfsurprised and more than halfamused expression listened to his companions narration of the scene that had just taken place and of the plan which he had formed in his mind  this plan was carried out the following day  by daybreak ned was up preparing his drawing materials then he and tom breakfasted at the table dhote after which the latter went to hunt for a suitable loghut in which to carry on their joint labours while the former proceeded to fulfil his engagement  their nights lodging and breakfast made a terribly large gap in their slender fortune for prices at the time happened to be enormously high in consequence of expected supplies failing to arrive at the usual time  the bill at the hotel was ten dollars a day per man and provisions of all kinds were so dear that the daily earnings of the miners barely sufficed to find them in the necessaries of life  it therefore behoved our friends to obtain a private dwelling and remunerative work as fast as possible  on reaching the little loghut ned found the yankee ready to receive him  he wore a clean new redflannel shirt with a blue silk kerchief round the throat a broadbrimmed straw hat corduroys and fishermans long boots  to judge from his gait and the selfsatisfied expression of his bronzed countenance he was not a little proud of his personal appearance  while ned arranged his paper and colours and sharpened the point of his pencil the yankee kept up a running commentary on men and things in general rocking himself on a rudelyconstructed chair the while and smoking his pipe  the hut was very smallnot more than twelve feet by eight and just high enough inside to permit of a sixfoot man grazing the beams when he walked erect  but although small it was exceedingly comfortable  its owner was his own architect and builder being a jackofalltrades and everything about the wooden edifice betokened the hand of a thorough workman who cared not for appearance but was sensitively alive to comfort  comfort was stamped in unmistakeable characters on every article of furniture and on every atom that entered into the composition of the yankees hut  the logs of which it was built were undressed they were not even barked but those edges of them that lay together were fitted and bevelled with such nicety that the keenest and most searching blast of north wind failed to discover an entrance and was driven baffled and shrieking from the walls  the small fireplace and chimney composed of mud and dry grass were rude in appearance but they were substantial and well calculated for the work they had to perform  the seats of which there were fourtwo chairs a bench and a stoolwere of the plainest wood and the simplest form but they were solid as rocks and no complaining creak when heavy men sat down on them betokened bad or broken constitutions  the little tabletwo feet by sixteen incheswas in all respects worthy of the chairs  at one end of the hut there was a bedplace big enough for two it was variously termed a crib a shelf a tumblein and a bunk  its owner called it a snoosery  this was a model of plainness and comfort  it was a mere shell about two and a half feet broad projecting from the wall to which it was attached on one side the other side being supported by two wooden legs a foot high  a plank at the side and another at the foot in conjunction with the walls of the cottage converted the shelf into an oblong box  but the mattress of this rude couch was formed of buffaloskins covered with thick long luxurious hair above which were spread two large green mackinaw blankets of the thickest description and the canvas pillowcase was stuffed with the softest down purchased from the wildfowl of california with leaden coin transmitted through the yankees unerring rifle  there was a fishingrod in one corner a rifle in another a cupboard in a third poles and spears several unfinished axehandles and a small fishingnet lay upon the rafters overhead while various miscellaneous articles of clothing and implements for mining hung on pegs from the walls or lay scattered about everywhere but in the midst of apparent confusion comfort reigned supreme for nothing was placed so as to come in ones way everything was cleverly arranged so as to lie close and fit in no article or implement was superfluous no necessary of a miners life was wanting an air of thorough completeness invested the hut and everything about it and in the midst of all sat the presiding genius of the place with his long legs comfortably crossed the tobacco wreaths circling round his lantern jaws the broadbrimmed straw hat cocked jauntily on one side his arms akimbo and his rather languid black eyes gazing at ned sinton with an expression of comfortable selfsatisfaction and assurance that was quite comforting to behold  wall mister if youre ready i guess yed better fire away  one second more and i shall commence replied ned i beg pardon may i ask your name  jeffersonabel jefferson to command answered the yankee relighting the large clay pipe which he had just filled and stuffing down the glowing tobacco with the end of his little finger as slowly and deliberately as though that member were a salamander  whats yourn  edward sinton  now mr jefferson in what position do you intend to sit  jest as im settin now  then you must sit still at least for a few minutes at a time because i cannot sketch you while you keep rocking so  no now thats a pity for i never sits no other way when im to home an it would look more natral an raal like to the old ooman if i was drawd rockin  however fire away and sing out when ye want me to stop  mind ye put in the whole o me  none o yer halflengths  i never goes in for halflengths  i always goes the whole length an a leetle shave more  see that ye dont forget the mole on the side o my nose  my poor dear old mother wouldnt believe it was me if the mole warnt there as big as life with the two hairs in the middle of it an i say mister mind that i hate flatterers so dont flatter me no how  it wouldnt be easy to do so thought ned as he plied his pencil but he did not deem it advisable to give expression to his thoughts  now then sit still for a moment said ned  the yankee instantly let the front legs of his chair come to the ground with a bang and gazed right before him with that intenselygrave cataleptic stare that is wont to overspread the countenances of men when they are being photographed  ned laughed inwardly and proceeded with his work in silence  i guess theres sam at the door said abel jefferson blowing a cloud of smoke from his mouth that might have made a small cannon envious  the door flew open as he spoke and sam scott the trader strode into the hut  he was a tall rawboned man with a goodhumoured but intensely impudent expression of countenance and tanned to a rich dark brown by constant exposure to the weather in the prosecution of his arduous calling  halloo stranger what air you up to inquired sam sitting down on the bench behind ned and looking over his shoulder  ned might perhaps have replied to this question despite its unceremoniousness had not the yankee followed it up by spitting over his shoulder into the fireplace  as it was he kept silence and went on with his work  why i do declare continued sam if you aint photogged here as small as life mole an all like nothin  i say stranger aint you a britisher  sam again followed up his question with a shot at the fireplace  yes answered ned somewhat angrily and i am so much of a britisher that i positively object to your spitting past my ear  no you dont do you  now that is curous  i do believe if you britishers had your own way youd not let us spit at all  what air you better than we that you hold your heads so high and give yourselves sich airs thats what i want to know  neds disgust having subsided he replied  if we do hold our heads high it is because we are straightforward and not afraid to look any man in the face  as to giving ourselves airs you mistake our natural reserve and dislike to obtrude ourselves upon strangers for pride and in this respect at least if in no other we are better than youwe dont spit all over each others floors and close past each others noses  wall now stranger if you choose to be resarved and we choose to be freeaneasy wheres the differ  weve a right to have our own customs and do as we please as well as you i guess  hear hear cried abel jefferson commencing to rock himself again and to smoke more violently than ever  what say ye to that mister  only this answered ned as he put the finishing touches to his sketch that whereas we claim only the right to do to and with ourselves what we please you yankees claim the right to do to and with everybody else what you please  i have no objection whatever to your spitting but i do object to your spitting over my shoulder  do you said sam scott in a slightly sarcastic tone an suppose i dont stop firin over your shoulder what then  ill make you replied ned waxing indignant at the mans cool impudence  how inquired sam  ned rose and shook back the flaxen curls from his flushed face as he replied by opening the door and kicking you out of the hut  he repented of the hasty expression the moment it passed his lips so he turned to jefferson and handed him the drawing for inspection  sam scott remained seated  whether he felt that ned was thoroughly capable of putting his threat in execution or not we cannot tell but he evinced no feeling of anger as he continued the conversation  i guess if you did that youd have to fight me and youd find me pretty smart with the bowieknife an the revolver either in the dark or in daylight  sam here referred to the custom prevalent among the yankees in some parts of the united states of duelling with bowieknives or with pistols in a darkened room  and suppose answered ned with a smilesuppose that i refused to fight what then  why then youd be called a coward all over the diggins and youd have to fight to clear your character  and suppose i didnt care a straw for being called a coward and wouldnt attempt to clear my character  why then i guess id have to kick you in public till you were obligated to fight  but suppose still further continued ned assuming the air of a philosopher discussing a profoundlyabstruse point in sciencesuppose that being the stronger man i should prevent you from kicking me by knocking you down what then  why then id be compelled to snuff you out slick off  sam scott smiled as he spoke and touched the handle of his revolver  which means said ned that you would become a coldblooded murderer  so you britishers call it  and so judge lynch would call it if i am not mistaken which would insure your being snuffed out too pretty effectually  wrong you air stranger replied the trader judge lynch regards affairs of honour in a very different light i guess  i dont think hed scrag me for that  further investigation of this interesting topic was interrupted by abel jefferson who had been gazing in wrapt admiration at the picture for at least five minutes pronouncing the work fuss rate emphatically  its jest whatll warm up the old oomans heart like a big fire in a winter day  wont she screech when she claps her peepers ont an go yellin round among the neighbours shewin the pictur o her boy abel an his house at the gold diggins  the two friends commented pretty freely on the merits of the work without the smallest consideration for the feelings of the artist fortunately they had nothing but good to say about it  sam scott indeed objected a little to the sketchy manner in which some of the subordinate accessories were touched in and remarked that the two large hairs on the mole were almost invisible but jefferson persisted in maintaining that the work was fuss rate and faultless  the stipulated sum was paid and ned bidding his new friends goodmorning returned to the inn for the purpose of discussing dinner and plans with tom collins    chapter eighteen  neds new profession pays admirablyhe and tom wax philosophicalpat comes for a landscape of himselflynch law and the doctorsneds sittersa yankee swell receives a gentle rebuff  the ups and downs and the outs and ins of life are as every one is aware exceedingly curioussometimes pleasant often the reverse and not infrequently abrupt  on the day of their arrival at the settlement ned and tom were almost beggars a dollar or two being all the cash they possessed besides the golddust swallowed by the latter which being as tom remarked sunk money was not available for present purposes  one week later they were as abel jefferson expressed it driving a roaring trade in picturs and in the receipt of fifty dollars or 10 pounds a day  goods and provisions of all kinds had been suddenly thrown into the settlement by speculators so that living became comparatively cheap several new and profitable diggings had been discovered in consequence of which gold became plentiful and the result of all was that edward sinton esquire portrait and landscape painter had more orders than he could accept at almost any price he chose to name  men who every saturday came into the settlement to throw away their hardearned gains in the gamblinghouses or to purchase provisions for the campaign of the following week were delighted to have an opportunity of procuring their portraits and were willing to pay any sum for them so that had our hero been so disposed he could have fleeced the miners to a considerable extent  but ned was not so disposed either by nature or necessity  he fixed what he considered fair remunerative prices for his work according to the tariff of the diggings and so arranged it that he made as much per day as he would have realised had he been the fortunate possessor of one of the best claims in the neighbourhood  tom collins meanwhile went out prospecting and speedily discovered a spot of ground which when wrought with the pan turned him in twenty dollars a day  so that in the course of a fortnight our adventurers found themselves comparatively rich men  this was satisfactory and ned admitted as much one morning to tom as he sat on a threelegged stool in his studioie a dilapidated loghutpreparing for a sitter while the latter was busily engaged in concluding his morning repast of damper pork and beans  theres no doubt about it tom said he pegging a sheet of drawingpaper to a flat board we are rapidly making our fortunes my boy but dyou know im determined to postpone that desirable event and take to rambling again  there you go said tom somewhat testily as he lit a cigar and lay down on his bed to enjoy it you are never content i knew it wouldnt last youre a rolling stone and will end in being a beggar  do you really mean to say that you intend to give up a lucrative profession and become a vagrantfor such you will be if you take to wandering about the country without any object in view  indeed i do answered ned  how often am i to tell you that i dont and wont consider the making of money the chief good of this world doubtless it is an uncommonly necessary thing especially to those who have families to support but i am firmly convinced that this life was meant to be enjoyed and i mean to enjoy it accordingly  i agree with you ned heartily but if every one enjoyed life as you propose to do and took to rambling over the face of the earth there would be no work done and nothing could be had for love or money except what grew spontaneously and that would be a joyful state of things wouldnt it  tom collins indulging the belief that he had taken up an unassailable position propelled from his lips a long thin cloud of smoke and smiled through it at his friend  your style of reasoning is rather wild to say the least of it answered ned as he rubbed down his colours on the bottom of a broken plate  in the first place you assume that i propose to spend all my life in rambling and in the second place you found your argument on the absurd supposition that everybody else must find their sole enjoyment in the same occupation  how i wish sighed tom collins smoking languidly that there was no such thing as reasoning  you would be a much more agreeable fellow ned if you didnt argue  it takes two to make an argument remarked ned  well but couldnt you converse without arguing  certainly if you would never contradict what i say nor make an incorrect statement nor draw a wrong conclusion nor object to being contradicted when i think you are in the wrong  tom sighed deeply and drew comfort from his cigar  in a few minutes he resumedwell but what do you mean by enjoying life  ned sinton pondered the question a few seconds and then replied  i mean thisthe way to enjoy life is to do all the good you can by working just enough to support yourself and your family if you have one to assist in spreading the gospel and to enable you to help a friend in need and to alleviate the condition of the poor the sick and the destitute  to work for more than this is to be greedy to work for less is to be reprehensibly lazy  this amount of work being done men ought to mingle with their fellowcreatures and wander abroad as much as may be among the beautiful works of their creator  a very pretty theory doubtless replied tom but pray in what manner will your proposed ramble advance the interests of religion or enable you to do the extra ordinary amount of good you speak of  there you go again tom you ask me the abstract question what do you mean by enjoying life and when i reply you object to the answer as not being applicable to the present case  of course it is not  i did not intend it to be  the good i mean to do in my present ramble is chiefly if not solely to my own body and mind  stop my dear fellow interrupted tom dont become energetic  i accept your answer to the general question but how many people think you can afford to put your theory in practice  very very few replied ned earnestly but that does not affect the truth of my theory  men will toil night and day to accumulate gold until their bodies and souls are incapable of enjoying the good things which gold can purchase and they are infatuated enough to plume themselves on this account as being diligent men of business while others alas are compelled thus to toil in order to procure the bare necessaries of life but these melancholy facts do not prove the principle of grindandtoil to be a right one much less do they constitute a reason for my refusing to enjoy life in the right way when i have the power  tom made no reply but the vigorous puffs from his cigar seemed to indicate that he pondered these things deeply  a few minutes afterwards neds expected sitter entered  he was a tall burly irishman with a redflannel shirt open at the neck a pair of huge long boots and a wideawake  the top o the mornin to yees said the man pulling off his hat as he entered  goodmorning friend said ned as tom collins rose shouldered his pick and shovel and left the hut  you are punctual and deserve credit for so good a quality  pray sit down  faix then i dont know what a quality is but av its a good thing ive no objection replied the man taking a seat on the edge of the bed which tom had just vacated  i wos wantin to ax ye sir av ye could put in me pick and shovel in the lanscape  in the landscape pat exclaimed ned addressing his visitor by the generic name of the species i thought you wanted a portrait  troth then i dont know which it is ye call it but i wants a pictur o meself all over from the top o me hat to the sole o me boots isnt that a lanscape  no its a portrait  then its a porthraite i wants an if yell put in the pick and shovel ill give ye two dollars a pace for them  ill put them in pat for nothing replied ned smiling as he commenced his sketch  i suppose you intend to send this to some fair one in old ireland  pat did not reply at once  sure said he slowly i niver thought of her in that way before but maybe she was fair wance though shes been amost as black as bogoak for halfacintury  its for me grandmother i want it  your grandmother thats curious now the last man i painted meant to send the likeness to his mother  not so curous neither replied the man with some feeling its my opinion the further a man goes from the owld country and the rougher he becomes wi scrapin up and down through the world the more tinder his heart gits when he thinks o his mother  me own mother died whin i wos a bit spalpeen an i lived wi me grandmother bliss her heart ever sinceat laste till i took to wanderin which was tin years past  so long  pat you must have wandered far in that time  have you ever been away far into the interior of this country among the mountains in the course of your wanderings  among the mountains is it  indeed i have just an a most treemendous beautiful sight it is  wos ye goin there  ive been thinking about it  is the shooting good  shootin ah av yed bin wi me an bill simmons two summers ago yed have had more nor enough o shootin  the grizzlies are thick as paes and the buffaloes swarm in the valleys like muskaitoes not to mintion wolves and beavers and badgers and deer an sich likeforby the red injuns we shot six o them critters about the legs an arms in self defence an they shot us toothey put an arrow dane through the pint o bills nose an wan ripped up me left arm it did  pat bared the brawny limb and exhibited the wound as he spoke shootin is it faix theres the hoith o shootin there an no end o sainery  the conversation was interrupted at this point by the door being burst violently open and several men rushing into the hut  they grasped the irishman by the arms and attempted to drag him out but pat seized hold of the plank on the edge of which he sat and refused to move at first  come along boy cried one boisterously were goin to lynch a doctor an we want you to swear to him  ay an to swear at him too if ye like hes a riglar cheat bin killin us off by the dozen as cool as ye like and pretendin to be an md all the time  theres more than wan cried another man seizing pat again by the arm wont ye come man  och av coorse i will av its to do any good to the public im yer man  hooray for the people an down wi the aristockracy  this sentiment was received with a shout of delight and several exclamations of bah as the party hurried in a body from the studio ned having thus nothing to do rose and followed them towards the centre of the settlement where a large crowd was collecting to try the unhappy doctors above referred to  there were six of them all disreputablelooking rascals who had set up for doctors and had carried on a thriving business among the sick minersof whom there were many at that timeuntil a genuine doctor arrived at the place and discovered and exposed them  the miners were fortunately not bloodthirsty at this time so the six selfdubbed mds instead of being hanged were banished for ever from the settlement halfanhour later the miners were busy in their respective claims and ned sinton was again seated before his lanscape of the irishman  just as he was completing the sketch the door opened slowly and a very remarkable man swaggered into the room and spat on the centre of the floor  he was dressed in the extreme of the fashion then prevalent in the eastern states  a superfine black coat silk vest superfine black trousers patentleather boots kid gloves and a black silk hat  a more unnatural apparition at the diggings could not well be imagined ned sinton could hardly credit his eyes but no rubbing of them would dispel the vision  there he stood a regular broadway swell whose love of change had induced him to seek his fortune in the goldregions of california and whose vanity had induced him to retain his drawingroom costume  this man besides being possessed of a superabundance of supercilious impudence also possessed a set of digging tools the handles of which were made of polished oak and walnut with bright brass ferrules  with these he proposed to dig his fortune in a leisurely way meanwhile finding the weather rather hot he had made up his mind to have his portrait done  thrusting his hands into his pockets this gentleman shut the door with his heel turned his back to the fireplacefrom the mere force of habit for there was no fireand again spat upon the floor after which he said  i say stranger whats your charge for a likeness  you will excuse me sir answered ned if before replying to that question i beg of you not to spit on my floor  the yankee uttered an exclamation of surprise and asked why not stranger  because i dont like it  you wouldnt have me spit in my hat would you inquired the dandy  certainly not  where then  ned pointed to a large wooden box which stood close to the fireplace and said therei have provided a box for the accommodation of those sitters who indulge in that disagreeable practice  if you cant avoid spitting do it there  wall now you britishers are strange critters  but you havent told me your price for a portrait  i fear that i cannot paint you at any price replied ned without looking up from his paper while pat listened to the conversation with a comical leer on his broad countenance  why not stranger asked the dandy in surprise  because im giving up business and dont wish to take any more orders  then ill set here i guess an look at ye while ye knock off that one said the man sitting down close to neds elbow and again spitting on the floor  whether he did so intentionally or not we cannot tell probably not but the effect upon ned was so strong that he rose deliberately opened the door and pointed to the passage thus set free without uttering a word  his look however was quite sufficient  the dandy rose abruptly and walked out in silence leaving ned to shut the door quietly behind him and return to his work while the irishman rolled in convulsions of laughter on tom collinss bed  neds sitters as we have hinted were numerous and extremely various sometimes he was visited by sentimental and homesick miners and occasionally by dandy miners such as we have described but his chief customers were the rough hearty men from old england owld ireland and from the western states with all of whom he had many a pleasant and profitable hours conversation and from many of whom especially the latter he obtained valuable and interesting information in reference to the wild regions of the interior which he longed so much to see    chapter nineteen  the wilderness againa splendid valleygigantic trees and waterfalls tom meets with an accidentboth meet with many surprisesmysteries caverns doleful sounds and grizzlybearcatchers  mounted on gallant steeds ned and his friend again appear in the wilderness in the afternoon of a beautiful autumn day  they had ridden far that day  dust covered their garments and foam bespattered the chests of their horses but the spirits of men and beasts were not yet subdued for their muscles by long practice were inured to hardship many days had passed since they left the scene of their recent successful labours and many a weary league had been traversed over the unknown regions of the interior  they were lost in one sense of that termcharmingly romantically lostthat is to say neither ned nor tom had the most distant idea of where they were or what they were coming to but both of them carried pocketcompasses and they knew that by appealing to these and to the daily jotting of the route they had travelled they could ascertain pretty closely the direction that was necessary to be pursued in order to strike the great san joaquin river  very different was the scenery through which they now rode from that of the northern diggings  the most stupendous and magnificent mountains in the world surrounded on all sides the valley through which they passed giving to it an air of peaceful seclusion yet it was not gloomy for the level land was broad and fertile and so varied in aspect that it seemed as though a beautiful world were enclosed by those mighty hills  large tracts of the valley were covered with wild oats and rich grass affording excellent pasturage for the deer that roamed about in large herds  lakes of various sizes sustained thousands of wildfowl on their calm breasts and a noble river coursed down its entire length  oaks chestnuts and cypresses grew in groups all over the landscape and up on the hillsides firs of gigantic size reared their straight stems high above the surrounding trees  but the point in the scenery which struck the travellers as being most peculiar was the precipitous character of the sides of many of the vast mountains and the flatness of their summits  tom collins who was a good judge of heights having travelled in several mountainous regions of the world estimated the nearest precipices to be upwards of three thousand feet without a break from top to bottom but the ranges in the background towered far above these and must have been at least double  i never saw anything like this before tom said ned in a suppressed voice  i did not believe such sublime scenery existed replied his companion i have travelled in switzerland and norway but this surpasses both truly it was worth while to give up our golddigging in order to see this  yet there are many rejoined ned who travel just far enough into california to reach the diggings where they remain till their fortunes are made or till their hopes are disappointed and then return to england and write a book perchance in which they speak as authoritatively as if they had swept the whole region north and south east and west  little wonder that we find such travellers contradicting each other flatly  one speaks of california as being the most splendid agricultural country in the world and advises every one to emigrate at once while another condemns it as an arid unproductive region fit only for the support of indians and grizzlybearsthe fact being that both speak correctly enough it may be of the very small portion of california they have respectively visited  why the more i travel in this wonderful land the more i feel how very little i know about it and had i returned to england without having seen this valley i should have missed one of the most remarkable sights not only in the country but i verily believe in the world  if you ever return home tom and are persuaded at the earnest request of numerous friends to write a book dont dogmatise as to facts remember how limited your experience has been and dont forget that facts in one valley are not facts at all in another valley eight or ten miles off  perhaps suggested tom collins patting the arched neck of his steedperhaps the advice with which you have just favoured me might with greater propriety have proceeded from me to you for considering the copious variety of your sentiments on this and other subjects and the fluency with which you utter them it is likely that you will rush into print long before i timidly venture with characteristic modesty even to grasp the pen  as tom ceased speaking they came upon a forest of pine or fir trees in the midst of which towered a tree of such gigantic height that its appearance caused them simultaneously to draw up and gaze at it in silent wonder  can it be possible said ned that our eyes dont deceive us  surely some peculiarity in the atmosphere gives that tree false proportions  without answering tom galloped towards the tree in question closely followed by his friend  instead of any delusive haze being cleared away however the tree grew larger as they approached and when they halted about twenty yards from it they felt that they were indeed in the presence of the monarch of the forest  the tree which they measured after viewing it in wondering admiration from all points of view was ninetythree feet in circumference and it could not have been less than three hundred and sixty feet high  they little knew that many years afterwards the bark of this giant tree to the height of a hundred and sixteen feet was to be removed to england built up in its original form and exhibited in the great crystal palace of sydenham yet so it was and part of the mother of the forest may be seen there at this day  towards evening the travellers drew near to the head of the valley  we must be approaching a waterfall of no ordinary size remarked tom as they rode through the dark shades of the forest which were pretty extensive there  i have heard its roar for some time answered ned but until we clear this belt of trees we shant see it  just then the roar of the fall burst upon them with such deafening violence that they involuntarily started  it seemed as if a mighty torrent had burst its bounds and was about to sweep them away along with the forest through which they rode  pressing forward in eager haste they soon found that their having doubled round a huge mountain barrier which the trees had hitherto concealed from them was the cause of the sudden increase in the roar of the fall but they were still unable to see it owing to the dense foliage that overshadowed them  as they galloped on the thunder of falling waters became more deep and intense until they reached an elevated spot comparatively free from trees which overlooked the valley and revealed a sight such as is not equalled even by niagara itself  a succession of walllike mountains rose in two tiers before them literally into the clouds for several of the lower clouds floated far below the highest peaks and from the summit of the highest range a river equal to the thames at richmond dropt sheer down a fall of above two thousand feet  here it met the summit of the lower mountainrange on which it burst with a deeptoned sullen neverceasing roar comparable only to eternal thunder  a white cloud of spray received the falling river in its soft embrace and sent it forth againturbulent and foam bespeckledtowards its second leap another thousand feet into the plain below  the entire height of the fall was above three thousand feet  its sublimity no language can convey  its irresistible effect on the minds of the wanderers was to turn their thoughts to the almighty creator of so aweinspiring and wonderful a scene  here they discovered another tree which was so large that their thoughts were diverted even from the extraordinary cataract for a short time  unlike the previous one this monarch of the woods lay prostrate on the ground but its diameter near the root was so great that they could not see over it though seated on horseback  it measured a hundred and twenty feet in circumference and when standing must have been little if at all short of five hundred feet in height  surrounded as they were by such noble and stupendous works of god the travellers could not find words to express their feelings  deep emotion has no articulate language  the heaving breast and the glowing eye alone indicate the fervour of the thoughts within  for a long time they sat gazing round them in silent wonder and admiration then they dismounted to measure the great tree and after that ned sat down to sketch the fall while his companion rode forward to select a spot for camping on  tom had not proceeded far when he came upon the track of wheels in the grass a sight which surprised him much for into that remote region he had supposed few travellers ventured even on horseback  the depth and breadth of the tracks too surprised him not a little  they were much deeper and broader than those caused by any species of cart he had yet seen or heard of in the country and the width apart was so great that he began to suspect he must have mistaken a curious freak of nature for the tracks of a gigantic vehicle  following the track for some distance he came to a muddy spot where the footprints of men and horses became distinctly visible  a little further on he passed the mouth of what appeared to be a cavern and being of an inquisitive disposition he dismounted and tied his horse to a tree intending to examine the entrance  to enter a dark cave in a wild unknown region with the din of a thundering cataract filling the ears just after having discovered tracks of a mysterious nature in the neighbourhood was so trying to toms nervous system that he half resolved to give it up but the exploration of a cavern has a fascination to some dispositions which every one cannot understand  tom said pshaw to himself in an undertone and boldly stepping into the dark portals of the cave he disappeared  meanwhile edward sinton finished his sketch and supposing that tom was waiting for him in advance he mounted and galloped forward as fast as the nature of the ground would allow  soon he came to the tracks before mentioned and shortly after to the muddy spot with the footprints  here he drew rein and dismounted to examine the marks more closely  our hero was as much perplexed as his friend had been at the unusually broad tracks of the vehicle which had passed that way  leading his horse by the bridle he advanced slowly until he came to the spot where toms horse stood fastened to a treea sight which alarmed him greatly for the place was not such as any one would have selected for an encampment yet had any foul play befallen his friend he knew well that the horse would not have been left quietly there  sorely puzzled and filled with anxious fears he examined the spot carefully and at last came upon the entrance to the cavern before which he paused uncertain what to do  the shadows of evening were fast falling on the scene and he experienced a feeling of dread as he gazed into the profound gloom  he was convinced that tom must be there but the silence and the length of time he had been absent led him to fear that some accident had befallen his friend  ho  tom he shouted on entering are you there  there was a rolling echo within but no voice replied to the question  again ned shouted at the full pitch of his lungs and this time he thought he heard a faint reply  hurrying forward eagerly as quickly as he dared he repeated his shout but the declivity of the entrance became so great that he lost his footing and wellnigh fell headlong down a steep incline  he succeeded however in regaining his hold and clambered back to the entrance as quickly as possible  here he caught up a pineknot struck a light and kindled it and with this torch held high above his head advanced once more into the cavern  the voice of tom collins at this moment came loud and full from the interiortake care ned theres a sharp descent ive tumbled down it but i dont think im much hurt  cheer up my boy cried ned heartily ill get you out in a minute  the next moment he stood beside his friend who had risen from the rugged floor of the cave and sat on a piece of rock resting his head on his hand  are you badly hurt my poor fellow said ned anxiously going down on one knee and endeavouring to raise his friends head  i fear you are here try a drop of this brandy  thats it  why you look better already  come now let me examine you  the spirit revived tom at once and he replied cheerfully as he submitted to inspectionall right i was only stunned a little by the fall  catch me exploring again without a light  on examination ned found to his great relief that his friends hurts were slight  he had been stunned by the severity of his fall but no bones were broken and only a few scratches received so that after another sip of brandy he felt almost as well as ever  but he firmly resisted his companions entreaty to leave the cavern  no my boy said he after paying such a price as entrance fee im not going to quit until i have explored the whole of this cave so please go out for another pineknot or two and ill wait for you  seeing that he was determined ned obeyed and soon returned with several fresh torches two of which were ignited and a bright light sent far and wide into the roof of the cave which was at a great height above them  the walls were of curious and in some places grotesque forms  immense stalactites hung from the roof and these were of varied colourspale green pink and whitewhile some of them looked like cascades which sprang from the walls and had been petrified ere they quite reached the ground  the roof was supported by natural pillars and various arched openings led into similar chambers some of which were larger and more curious than the outer one  do you know said ned sinton as they sat down on a rock in one of the inner chambers to rest this place recalls vividly to my remembrance a strange dream which i had just before leaving england  indeed said tom i hope youre not a believer in dreams  dont i beseech you take it into your head that its going to be realised at this particular moment whatever it was  it would take a very strong amount of belief indeed to induce me to expect the realisation of that dream  shall i tell it you  is it a very ghostly one inquired tom  no not at all  then out with it  ned immediately began the narration of the remarkable dream with which this story opens and as he went on to tell of how the stout old gentleman snuffed golddust and ultimately shot up to the roof of the cave and became a golden stalactite tom collins whose risible tendencies were easily roused roared with laughter until the vaulted caverns echoed again  at the end of one of these explosions the two friends were struck dumb by certain doleful and mysterious sounds which proceeded from the further end of the inmost chamber  in starting to his feet tom collins let fall his torch and in the convulsive clutch which he made to catch it he struck the other torch out of neds hand so that instantly both were left in the profoundest darkness with their hearts beating like sledgehammers against their ribs  to flee was their first and natural impulse but to flee in the dark over rough ground and with very imperfect ideas as to the position of the caves outlet was dangerous  what is to be done ejaculated tom collins in a tone that indicated the perturbation of his heart too clearly  at that moment ned remembered that he had a box of matches in the pocket of his huntingcoat so without answering he drew it forth struck a light and reignited the torches  now tom he said dont let us give way to unmanly fears  i have no belief whatever in ghosts or spirits good or evil being permitted to come in visible or audible form to frighten poor mortals  every effect has a cause and im determined to find out the cause of these strange sounds  they certainly proceed from animal lungs whether from man or beast remains to be seen  go ahead then ill follow said tom whose courage had returned with the light im game for anything that i can see but i confess to you that i can not stand howls and groans and darkness  notwithstanding their utmost efforts they failed to discover the cause of the mysterious sounds which seemed at times to be voices muttering while at other times they swelled out into a loud cry  all that could be certainly ascertained was that they proceeded from the roof of the innermost cavern and that the centre of that roof was too high to be discerned by torchlight  what shall we do now inquired tom  we shall go to the summit of the hill above this cave and see what is to be seen there  always look at both sides of a mystery if you would fathom it come along  in a few minutes they stood in open air and once more breathed freely mounting their horses they ascended the steep slope of the hill above the cave and after some trouble reached the summit  here the first thing that met their gaze was a campfire and near to it several men engaged in harnessing their horses to a large waggon or van  the frantic haste with which they performed the operation convinced ned that he had discovered the cause of the mysterious voices and that he and tom had been the innocent cause of frightening the strangers nearly out of their wits  so engrossed were they with their work that our travellers advanced within the circle of light of their fire before they were discovered  the man who first saw them uttered a yell and the whole party turned round seized their rifles and with terror depicted on their countenances faced the intruders  who comes here shouted one  friends answered ned laying down his rifle and advancing  instantly the men threw down their arms and resumed the work of harnessing their horses  if ye be friends cried the one who spoke first give us a hand  i guess all the fiends in the bottomless pit are located jist below our feet  listen to me for one moment gentlemen cried ned sinton  i think i can relieve your minds  what have you heard or seen  at these words the men stopped and looked inquiringly at their questioner  seen stranger weve seed nothin but weve heard a sight we have i calclate  we heard the imps o darkness talkin as plain as i hear you  at first i thought it was somebody at the foot o the hill but all of a suddent the imps took to larfin as if theyd split jist under my feet so i yelled out to my mate here to come an yoke the beasts and git away as slick as we could  we wos jist about ready to slope when you appeared  ned now explained to them the cause of their alarms and on search being made a hole was found as he had anticipated close at hand among the bushes which communicated with the cavern below and formed a channel for the conveyance of the socalled mysterious sounds  and now said ned may i ask permission to pass the night with you  youre welcome stranger replied he who seemed to be the chief of the banda tall bearded american named croft who seemed more like a bandit than an honest man  his comrades too six in number appeared a wild and reckless set of fellows with whom one would naturally desire to hold as little intercourse as possible but most men at the californian diggings had more or less the aspect of brigands so ned sinton and his companion felt little concern as to their characters although they did feel a little curious as to what had brought them to such a wild region  if it is not taking too great a liberty said ned after answering the thousand questions put to him in rapid succession by his yankee host may i ask what has brought you to this outoftheway valley  bearcatchin answered the man shortly as he addressed himself to a large venison steak which a comrade had just cooked for him  bearcatching ejaculated ned  ay an screamin hard work it is too i guess but it pays well  what do you do with them when caught inquired tom collins in a somewhat sceptical tone  take em down to the cities an sells em to fight with wild bulls  at this answer our travellers stared at the man incredulously  youre strangers here i see he resumed else youd know that we have bull and bear fights  the grizzlies are chained by one leg and the bulls let loose at em  the bulls charge like all possessed but they find it hard to do much damage to caleb whose hide is like a doubleextra rhinoceros  the grizzlies ginerally git the best of it an if they was let loose theyd chaw up the bulls in no time they would  theres a great demand for em jist now an my trade is catchin em alive here in the mountains  the big yankee stretched out his long limbs and smoked his pipe with the complacent aspect of a man who felt proud of his profession  do you mean that you seven men catch fallgrown grizzlybears alive and take them down to the settlements inquired ned in amazement  sartinly i do replied the bearcatcher an why not stranger  because i should have thought it impossible  nothins impossible replied the man quietly  but how do you manage it  instead of replying the yankee inquired if the strangers would stay over next forenoon with them  with much pleasure answered ned not a little amused at the invitation as well as the mans brusque manner  well then continued the bearcatcher shaking the ashes out of his pipe and putting it into his hat ill let ye see how we do it in the mornin  goodnight  so saying he drew his blanket over his head and resigned himself to sleep an example which was speedily followed by the whole party    chapter twenty  grizzlybearcatching in the mountainsned and tom dine in the midst of romantic scenery and hold sagacious conversethe strange devices of woodpeckers  just as day began to peep on the following morning the camp was roused by one of the bearcatchers a mexican who had been away to visit the beartrap during the night and now came rushing in among the sleepers shouting  hoorroo boy him cotch him cotch big as twinty mans fact  at first ned thought the camp was attacked by savages and he and tom sprang to their feet and grasped their rifles while they sought to rub their eyes open hastily  a glance at the other members of the camp however shewed that they were unnecessarily alarmed  croft leisurely stretched his limbs and then gathered himself slowly into a sitting posture while the others arose with various degrees of reluctance  bin long in inquired croft  no jist cotched answered the mexican who sat down lit his pipe and smoked violently to relieve his impatient feelings  big un inquired croft again  to this the mexican answered by rolling his eyes and exclaiming hoh with a degree of vigour that left his hearers to imagine anything they pleased and then settle it in their minds that the thing so imagined was out of all sight short of the mark  the excitement of the man at last fully roused the sleepy crew and croft sprang up with the agility of a cat  ho boys he cried proceeding to buckle his garments round him up with you  ketch the hosses an put to  look alive will you grease your jints do  now strangers ill shew you how we ketch a bar in this location bring yer rules for sometimes he breaks his trap an isnt there a spree jist  we need scarcely remark that the latter part of this speech was made to sinton and his comrade who were drawing the charges of their revolvers and reloading  is the trap far off inquired ned  quarter of an hour or so  look sharp lads  this exhortation was unnecessary for the men had already caught three stout horses all of which were attached to an enormous waggon or van whose broad wheels accounted for the tracks discovered in the valley on the previous evening  thats his cage said the bearcatcher replying to neds look of inquiry  its all lined with sheetiron and would hold an ontamed streak o lightnin it would  now then drive ahead  the lumbering machine jolted slowly down the hill as he spoke and while several of the party remained with the horses croft and our travellers with the remainder pushed on ahead  in less than twenty minutes they came to a ravine filled with thick underwood from the recesses of which came forth sounds of fierce ursine wrath that would have deterred most men from entering but croft knew his game was secure and led the way confidently through the bushes until he reached a spot on which stood what appeared to be a small logcabin without door or window  inside of this cabin an enormous grizzlybear raged about furiously thrusting his snout and claws through the interstices of the logs and causing splinters to fly all round him while he growled in tones of the deepest indignation  oh aint he a bit o thunder cried croft as he walked round the trap gazing in with glittering eyes at every opening between the logs  how in the world did you get him in there asked ned sinton as soon as his astonishment had abated sufficiently to loosen his tongue  easy enough replied croft  if ye obsarve the top o the trap yell see the rope that suspended it from the limb o that oak  inside there was a bit o beef so fixed up that when mister caleb laid hold of it he pulled a sort o trigger an down came the trap shuttin him in slick as ye see  at this moment the powerful animal struggled so violently that he tilted his prison on one side and wellnigh overturned it  look out lads shouted croft darting towards a tree and cocking his rifleactions in which he was imitated by all the rest of the party with surprising agility  dont fire till it turns over he cried sternly on observing that two of the more timid members of his band were about to fire at the animals legs which appeared below the edge of the trap  fortunately the bear ceased its efforts just at that critical moment and the trap fell heavily back to its original position  by good luck shouted croft an here comes the cage  range up on the left boys and out with the hosses they wont stand this  the terrified animals were removed from the scene trembling violently from head to foot and the whole band applying their shoulders to the wheels slowly pushed the vehicle alongside of the trap until the sides of the two met  there was a strong door in the side of the trap which was now removed by being pulled inwards revealing to bruin an aperture which corresponded to another door opening into the ironlined cage  there were stout iron bars ready to be shot home the instant he condescended to pass through this entrance but caleb as croft called him shewed himself sadly destitute of an inquiring disposition  he knew that there was now a hole in his prisonwall for he looked at it he knew that a hole either conducted into a place or out of it for lifelong experience had taught him that yet he refused to avail himself of the opportunity and continued to rage round the trap glaring between the logs at his foes outside  it is unreasonable to suppose that he was afraid to go into the hole because it was a dark one for he was well accustomed to such dark dens besides no one who looked at him could for a moment suppose that he was or could be afraid of anything at all  we must therefore put his conduct down to sheer obstinacy  the men poked him with sticks shouted at him roared in his face threw water over him and even tried the effect of a shot of powder at his flank but all to no purpose although their efforts were continued vigorously for full two hours  the bear would not enter that hole on any account whatever  try another shot of powder at him cried croft whose patience was now almost exhausted  the shot was fired at his flank and was received with a ferocious growl while the strong woodwork of the trap trembled under his efforts to escape  aint it vexin said croft sitting down on the stump of a tree and wiping the perspiration from his forehead  ned sinton and tom who had done their utmost to assist their new acquaintance sat down beside him and admitted that it was vexing  as if by one impulse the whole party then sat down to rest and at that moment having as it were valiantly asserted his right of independent action the bear turned slowly round and quietly scrambled through the hole  the men sprang up the massive iron bars were shot into their sockets with a clang and bruin was a prisoner for life  as neither edward sinton nor tom collins had any particular desire to become bearcatchers they bade their new friends adieu that afternoon and continued their journey  the road as they advanced became more and more steep and rugged so that they could only proceed at a walk and in many places experienced considerable difficulty and ran no little risk in passing along the faces of cliffs where the precipices ascended hundreds of feet upwards like walls on the one hand and descended sheer down into an unfathomable abyss on the other  but the exceeding grandeur of the scenery amply repaid their toils and the deep roar of that mighty cataract ever sounded in their ears  at length they reached the head of the valley and stood under the spray of the fall which expanding far above and around the seething caldron whence it sprang drenched the surrounding country with perpetual showers  here a gap or pass in the mountains was discovered ascending on the left and affording apparently an exit from the valley  up this the travellers toiled until they cleared the spray of the falls and then sat down beside a clump of trees to dry their garments in the sunshine and to cook their midday meal  what a glorious thing it is tom to wander thus unrestrained amid such scenes said ned sinton as he busied himself roasting a piece of venison which his rifle had procured but halfanhour before  how infinitely more delightful than travelling in the civilised world where one is cheated at every turn and watched and guarded as if robbery or murder or high treason were the only probable objects a traveller could have in view  comparisons my dear fellowyou know the proverb replied tom collins dont uphold california at the expense of the continent besides there are many in this world who would rather a thousand times wander by the classic lake of como with its theatrical villas and its enchanting sunshine and perfume or paddle up the castellated rhine than scramble here among wild rocks and woods and cataracts with the chance of meeting an occasional savage or a grizzlybear  go on my boy said ned with a touch of sarcasm in his tone you havent read me half a lesson yet  besides the many you refer to are there not hundreds ay thousands whose chief enjoyment in travelling is derived from the historical associations called up by the sight of the ruined castles and temples of classic groundwhose delight it is to think that here napoleon crossed the alps as hannibal did before him and many a nobody has done after him that there within these mouldering ruins the oracles of old gave forth their voice forgetting perhaps too easily while they indulge in these reminiscences of the past that the warriors end was wholesale murder and that the oracle spoke only to deceive poor ignorant human nature ha  i would not give one hearty dash into pure uncontaminated nature for all the famous tours put together  ned looked round him as he spoke with a glow of enthusiasm that neither badinage nor philosophy could check  just look around thee he continued open thine ears tom to the music of yon cataract and expand thy nostrils to the wild perfume of these pines  i wouldnt at this moment quietly remarked tom exchange for it the perfume of that venison steak of which i pray thee to be more regardful else thoult upset it into the fire  oh  tomincorrigible  not at all ned  while you flatter yourself that you have all the enthusiastic study of nature to yourself here have i succeeded within the last few minutes in solving a problem in natural history which has puzzled my brains for weeks past  and pray thee what may that be most sapient philosopher  do you see yonder bird clinging to the stem of that tree and pitching into it as if it were its most deadly foe  i doa woodpecker it is  well continued tom sitting down before his portion of the venison steak that bird has cleared up two points in natural history which have up till this time been a mystery to me  the one was why woodpeckers should spend their time in pecking the trees so incessantly the other was how it happened that several trees i have cut down could have had so many little holes bored in their trunks and an acorn neatly inserted into each  now that little bird has settled the question for me  i caught him in the act not ten minutes ago  he flew to that tree with an acorn in his beak tried to insert it into a hole which didnt fit being too small so he tried another which did fit poked the nut in small end first and tapped it scientifically home  now why did he do it  thats the question  because he wanted to probably remarked ned and very likely he lays up a store of food for winter in this manner  very possibly  i shall make a note of this for im determined to have it sifted to the bottom  meanwhile ill trouble you for another junk of venison  it was many weeks afterwards ere tom collins succeeded in sifting this interesting point to the bottom but perhaps the reader may not object to have the result of his inquiries noted at this point in our story  many of the trees in california on being stripped of their bark are found to be perforated all over with holes about the size of a musketball  these are pierced by the woodpecker with such precision and regularity that one might believe they had been cut out by a shipcarpenter  the summer is spent by this busy little bird in making these holes and in filling them with acorns  one acorn goes to one hole and the bird will not try to force the nut into a hole that is too small for it but flutters round the tree until it finds one which fits it exactly  thus one by one the holes are filled and a store of food is laid up for winter use in a larder which secures it from the elements and places it within reach of the depositor when the winter snows have buried all the acorns that lie upon the ground and put them beyond the reach of woodpeckers  the birds never encroach on their store until the snow has covered the ground then they begin to draw upon their bank and it is a curious fact that the bills of these birds are always honoured for their instinct enables them to detect the bad nuts with unerring certainty so that their bank is always filled with good ones  this matter of selecting the good nuts is a mere chance with men for often those shells which seem the soundest are found to contain a grub instead of a nut  even the sagacious indian is an uncertain judge in this respect but the woodpecker provided by an allwise creator with an unerring instinct never makes a mistake in selecting its store of food for winter    chapter twenty one  curious trees and

any one can study  audubon the hunternaturalist of america knew this well and few men have added so much as he to the sum of human knowledge in his peculiar department while fewer still have so wonderfully enriched the pages of romantic adventure in wild unknown regions  in these wanderings too ned and tom learned to know experimentally that truth is indeed stranger than fiction and that if the writers of fairytales had travelled more they would have saved their imaginations a deal of trouble and produced more extraordinary works  the size of the trees they encountered was almost beyond belief though none of them surpassed the giant of which an account has been already given  among other curious trees they found sugarpines growing in abundance in one part of the country  this is perhaps the most graceful of all the pines  with a perfectly straight and cylindrical stem and smooth bark it rears its proud crest high above other trees and flings its giant limbs abroad like a sentinel guarding the forest the stem rises to about fourfifths of its height perfectly free of branches above this point the branches spread out almost horizontally drooping a little at the ends from the weight of the huge cones which they bear  these cones are about a footandahalf long and under each leaf lies a seed the size of a pea which has an agreeably sweet taste and is much esteemed by the indians who use it as an article of food  another remarkable sight they saw was a plain of some miles in extent completely covered with shattered pieces of quartz which shone with specks and veins of pure gold  of course they had neither time nor inclination to attempt the laborious task of pulverising this quartz in order to obtain the precious metal but ned moralised a little as they galloped over the plain spurning the gold beneath their horses hoofs as if it had been of no value whatever  they both puzzled themselves also to account for so strange an appearance but the only solution that seemed to them at all admissible was that a quartz vein had at some early period of the worlds history been shattered by a volcanic eruption and the plain thus strewn with gold  but from the contemplation of these and many other interesting sights and phenomena we must pass to an event which seriously affected the future plans of the travellers  one beautiful eveningsuch an evening as from its deep quiet and unusual softness leaves a lasting impression on the memorythe two horsemen found themselves slowly toiling up the steep acclivity of a mountainridge  their advance was toilsome for the way was rugged and no track of any kind assisted them in their ascent  i fear the poor horses will give in said ned dismounting and looking back at his companion who slowly followed him  we are near the summit answered tom and they shall have a long rest there  as he spoke they both dismounted and advanced on foot leading their fatigued horses by the bridles  do you know said tom with a sigh i feel more used up today than i have been since we started on this journey  i think we had better encamp and have a cup of tea there is a little left yet if i mistake not  with all my heart tom i too feel inclined to rest and  ned paused for at that moment they overtopped the highest edge of the ridge and the view that burst upon them was well fitted to put to flight every previous train of thought  the ridge on which they stood rose several hundred feet above the level of the plain beyond and commanded a view of unknown extent towards the far west  the richest possible sweep of country was spread out at their feet like a huge map bathed in a glow of yellow sunshine  lakes and streams crags and rocks sward and swamp and plainundulating and abrupt barren and verdantall were there and could be embraced in a single widesweeping glance  it seemed to the entranced travellers like the very garden of eden  waterfowl flew about in all directions the whistling of their wings and their wild cries being mellowed by distance into pleasant music and far away on the right where a clear lake mirrored each tree on its banks as if the image were reality a herd of deer were seen cooling their sides and limbs in the water while on the extreme horizon a line of light indicated the shores of the vast pacific ocean  ere the travellers could find words to express their feelings a rock with a piece of stick and a small rag attached to it attracted their attention  we are not the first who have set their feet here it seems said ned pointing to the signal  strange muttered tom collins as they turned towards the rock that does not look like an indian mark yet i would have thought that white men had never stood here before for the spot is far removed from any known diggings and as we know fail well is not easily reached  on gaining the rock they found that the rag was a shred of linen without mark of any kind to tell who had placed it there  it must have been the freak of some indian hunter said ned examining the rock on which the little flagstaff was raised  staynohere are some marks cut in the stone  look here tom can you decipher this  it looks like the letter ddb  db cried tom collins with a degree of energy that surprised his friend  let me see  tom carefully removed the moss and cleared out the letters which were unmistakeable  who can db have been said ned  tom looked up with a flushed countenance and a glittering eye as he exclaimed  who  who but daniel boone coopers great herohawkeye of the last of the mohicansdeerslayerleatherstocking  he has been here before usay brave spirit  long before other hunters had dared to venture far into the territory of the scalping torturing yelling redskin this bold heart had pushed westward fearless and alone until his eagle eye rested on the great pacific  it must have been he  i have followed him ned in spirit throughout all his wild career for i knew him to be a real man and no fiction but little did i think that i should see a spot where his manly foot had rested or live to discover his farthest step in the far west  ned sinton listened with interest to the words of his friend but he did not interrupt him for he respected the deep emotions that swelled his heart and beamed from his flashing eye  we spoke ned sometime ago of historical associations continued tomhere are historical associations worth coming all this way to call up  here are associations that touch my heart more than all the deeds of ancient chivalry  ah  daniel boone little didst thou think when thy hawks eye rested here that in a few short years the land would be overrun by golddiggers from all ends of the earth  but this flag said ned he could never have placed that here  it would have been swept away by storms years ago  you are right said tom turning over the stones that supported the staffhalloo what have we here  he pulled out a roll of oiled cloth as he spoke and on opening it discovered a scrap of paper on which were written in pencil the words help usfor gods sake help us  we are perishing at the foot of the hill to the southward of this  no name or date was attached to this strange paper but the purport of it was sufficiently clear so without wasting time in fruitless conjecture the young men immediately sprang on their horses and rode down the hill in the direction indicated  the route proved more rugged and steep than that by which they had ascended and for a considerable distance they wound their way between the trunks of a closelyplanted cypress grove after passing which they emerged upon a rocky plain of small extent at the further extremity of which a green oasis indicated the presence of a spring  towards this they rode in silence  ah exclaimed ned in a tone of deep pity as he reined up at the foot of an oaktree too late  they were indeed too late to succour the poor creatures who had placed the scrap of paper on the summit of that mountainridge in the faint hope that friendly hands might discover it in time  six dead forms lay at the foot of the oak side by side with their pale faces turned upwards and the expression of extreme suffering still lingering on their shrunken features  it needed no living witness to tell their sad history  the skeletons of oxen the broken cart the scattered mining tools and the empty provision casks shewed clearly enough that they were emigrants who had left their homesteads in the states and tried to reach the goldregions of california by the terrible overland journey  they had lost their way among the dreary fastnesses of the mountains travelled far from the right road to the mines and perished at last of exhaustion and hunger on the very borders of the golden land  the greyhaired father of the family lay beside a young girl with his arm clasped round her neck  two younger men also lay near them one lying as if in dying he had sought to afford support to the other  the bodies were still fresh and a glance shewed that nearly all of them were of one family  alas  ned had we arrived a few days sooner we might have saved them said tom  i think they must have been freed from their pains and sorrows here more than a week since replied the other fastening his horse to a tree and proceeding to search the clothes of the unfortunates for letters or anything that might afford a clue to their identity  we must stay here an hour or two tom and bury them  no scrap of writing however was foundnot even a book with a name on itto tell who the strangers were  with hundreds of others no doubt they had left their homes full of life and hope to seek their fortunes in the land of gold but the director of mans steps had ordered it otherwise and their golden dreams had ended with their lives in the unknown wilderness  the two friends covered the bodies with sand and stones and leaving them in their shallow grave pursued their way but they had not gone far when a few large drops of rain fell and the sky became overcast with dark leaden clouds  ned said tom anxiously i fear we shall be caught by the rainy season  its awkward being so far from the settlements at such a time  oh nonsense surely you dont mind a wetting cried ned we can push on in spite of rain  can we retorted tom with unwonted gravity  its clear that youve never seen the rainy season else you would not speak of it so lightly  why man you seem to have lost pluck all of a sudden come cheer up rain or no rain i mean to have a good supper and a good nights rest and here is just the spot that will suit us  ned sinton leaped off his horse as he spoke and fastening him to a tree loosened the saddlegirths and set about preparing the encampment  tom collins assisted him but neither the rallying of his comrade nor his own efforts could enable the latter to shake off the depression of spirits with which he was overpowered  that night the rain came down in torrents and drenched the travellers to the skin despite their most ingenious contrivances to keep it out  they spent the night in misery and when morning broke ned found that his companion was smitten down with ague  even neds buoyant spirits were swamped for a time at this unlookedfor catastrophe for the dangers of their position were not slight  it was clear that tom would not be able to travel for many days for his whole frame trembled when the fits came on with a violence that seemed to threaten dislocation to all his joints  ned felt that both their lives under god depended on his keeping well and being able to procure food for and nurse his friend  at the same time he knew that the rainy season if indeed it had not already begun would soon set in and perhaps render the country impassable  there was no use however in giving way to morbid fears so ned faced his difficulties manfully and remembering the promise which he had given his old uncle at parting from him in england he began by offering up a short but earnest prayer at the side of his friends couch  ned said tom sadly as his companion ceased i fear that youll have to return alone  come come dont speak that way tom it isnt right  god is able to help us here as well as in cities  i dont think you are so ill as you fancythe sight of these poor emigrants has depressed you  cheer up my boy and ill let you see that you were right when you said i could turn my hand to anything  ill be hunter woodcutter cook and nurse all at once and see if i dont make you all right in a day or two  you merely want rest so keep quiet for a little till i make a sort of sheltered place to put you in  the sun broke through the clouds as he spoke and shed a warm beam down on poor tom who was more revived by the sight of the cheering orb of day than by the words of his companion  in halfanhour tom was wrapped in the driest portion of the driest blanket his wet habiliments were hung up before a roaring fire to dry and a rude bower of willows covered with turf was erected over his head to guard him from another attack of rain should it come but it didnt come  the sun shone cheerily all day and neds preparations were completed before the next deluge came so that when it descended on the following morning comparatively little found its way to toms restingplace  it was scarcely a restingplace however  tom turned and groaned on his uneasy couch and proved to be an uncommonly restive patient  he complained particularly when ned left him for a few hours each day to procure fresh provisions but he smiled and confessed himself unreasonable when ned returned as he always did with a dozen wild ducks or several geese or hares attached to his belt or a fat deer on his shoulders  game of all kinds was plentiful the weather improved the young hunters rifle was good and his aim was true so that but for the sickness of his friend he would have considered the life he led a remarkably pleasant one  as day after day passed by however and tom collins grew no better but rather worse he began to be seriously alarmed about him  tom himself took the gloomiest view of his case and at last said plainly he believed he was dying  at first ned sought to effect a cure by the simple force of kind treatment and care but finding that this would not do he bethought him of trying some experiments in the medicinal way he chanced to have a box of pills with him and tried one although with much hesitation and fear for he had got them from a miner who could not tell what they were composed of but who assured him they were a sovereign remedy for the blues  ned it must be confessed was rather a reckless doctor  he was anxious at the time he procured the pills to relieve a poor miner who seemed to be knocked up with hard work but who insisted that he had a complication of ailments so ned bought the pills for twenty times their value and gave a few to the man advising him at the same time to rest and feed well which he did and the result was a complete cure  our hero did not feel so certain however that they would succeed as well in the present case but he resolved to try their virtues for tom was so prostrate that he could scarcely be induced to whisper a word when the cold fit seized him he trembled so violently that his teeth rattled in his head and when that passed off it was followed by a burning fever which was even worse to bear  at first he was restive and inclined to be peevish under his illness the result no doubt of a naturallyrobust constitution struggling unsuccessfully against the attacks of disease but when he was completely overcome his irascibility passed away and he became patient sweettempered and gentle as a child  come tom my boy said ned one evening advancing to the side of his companions couch and sitting down beside him while he held up the pillopen your mouth and shut your eyes as we used to say at school  what is it asked the sick man faintly  never you mind patients have no business to know what their doctors prescribe  its intended to cure ague and thats enough for you to know  if it doesnt cure you its not my fault anyhowopen your mouth sir  tom smiled sadly and obeyed the pill was dropt in a spoonful of water added to float it down and it disappeared  but the pill had no effect whatever  another was tried with like resultor rather with like absence of all result and at last the box was finished without the sick man being a whit the better or the worse for them  this was disheartening but ned having begun to dabble in medicines felt an irresistible tendency to go on  like the tiger who has once tasted blood he could not now restrain himself  i think youre a little better tonight tom he said on the third evening after the administration of the first pill im making you a decoction of bark here that will certainly do you good  tom shook his head but said nothing  he evidently felt that a negative sign was an appropriate reply to the notion of his being better or of any decoction whatever doing him good  however ned stirred the panful of bark and water vigorously chatting all the while in a cheering tone in order to keep up his friends spirits while the blaze of the campfire lit up his handsome face and bathed his broad chest and shoulders with a ruddy glow that rendered still more pallid the lustre of the pale stars overhead  its lucky the rain has kept off so long he said without looking up from the mysterious decoction over which he bent with the earnest gaze of an alchymist  i do believe that has something to do with your being better my boyeither that or the pills or both  ned totally ignored the fact that his friend did not admit that he was better  and this stuff he continued will set you up in a day or two  its as good as quinine any day and youve no notion what wonderful cures that medicine effects  it took me a long time too to find the right tree  i wandered over two or three leagues of country before i came upon one  luckily it was a fine sunny day and i enjoyed it much  i wish you had been with me tom but youll be all right soon  i lay down too once or twice in the sunshine and put my head in the long grass and tried to fancy myself in a miniature forest  did you ever try that tom  ned looked round as he spoke but the sick man gave a languid smile and shut his eyes so he resumed his stirring of the pot and his rambling talk  youve no idea if you never tried it how one can deceive onesself in that way  i often did it at home when i was a little boy  i used to go away with a companion into a grassfield and selecting a spot where the grass was long and tangled and mixed with various kinds of weeds we used to lie flat down with our faces as near to the ground as possible and gaze through the grassstems until we fancied the blades were trees and the pebbles were large rocks and the clods were mountains  sometimes a huge beetle would crawl past and we instantly thought of saint george and the dragon and as the unwieldy monster came stumbling on through the forest we actually became quite excited and could scarcely believe that what we tried to imagine was not real  we seldom spoke on these occasions my companion and i continued ned suspending the stirring of the decoction and filling his pipe as he sat down close to the blazing logs speaking we found always broke the spell so we agreed to keep perfect silence for as long a time as possible  you must try it tom some day for although it may seem to you a childish thing to do there are many childish things which when done in a philosophical spirit are deeply interesting and profitable to men  ned ceased talking for a few minutes while he ignited his pipe when he spoke again his thoughts had wandered into a new channel  im sorry we have no fresh meat today he said looking earnestly at his friend  the remainder of that hare is not very savoury but we must be content i walked all the country round today without getting within range of any living thing  there were plenty both of deer and birds but they were so wild i could not get near them  it would matter little if you were well tom but you require good food just now my poor fellow  do you feel better tonight  tom groaned and said that he felt easier in a very uneasy voice after which they both relapsed into silence and no sound was heard save the crackling of the logs and the bubbling of the mysterious decoction in the pot  suddenly tom uttered a slight hissthat peculiar sound so familiar to backwoods ears by which hunters indicate to each other that something unusual has been observed and that they had better be on the alert  ned sintons nerves were of that firm kind which can never be startled or taken by surprise  he did not spring to his feet but quick as thought he stretched forth his long arm and seizing his rifle cocked it while he glanced at his friends eye to see in what direction he was looking  tom pointed eagerly with his thin hand straight across the fire  ned turned in that direction and at once saw the objects which had attracted his attention  two bright gleaming balls shone in the dark background of the forest like two lustrous irish diamonds in a black field of bogoak  he knew at once that they were the eyes of a deer which with a curiosity wellknown as peculiar to many wild animals had approached the fire to stare at it  ned instantly threw forward his rifle the light of the fire enabled him easily to align the sights on the glittering eyes the deadly contents belched forth and a heavy crash told that his aim had been true  bravo shouted tom collins forgetting his ailments in the excitement of the moment while ned threw down his rifle drew his huntingknife sprang over the fire and disappeared in the surrounding gloom  in a few minutes he returned with a fine deer on his shoulders  so ho my boy he cried flinging the carcase down that was a lucky shot  we shall sup well tonight thanks to curiosity which is a most useful quality in beast as well as man  but whats wrong you look pale and eh you dont mean to say yourelaughing  tom was indeed pale for the sudden excitement in his exhausted condition had been too much for him yet there did seem a peculiar expression about the corners of his mouth that might have been the remains of a laugh  ned he said faintly thethe decoctions all gone  ned sprang up and ran to the fire where sure enough he found the pan over which he had bent so long with necromantic gaze upset and most of the precious liquid gone  ha he cried catching up the pot not all gone lad so your rejoicing was premature  theres quite enough left yet to physic you well and its in fit state to be taken so open your mouth at once and be a good boy  a little of the medicine mixed in water was administered and tom making a wry face fell back on his couch with a sigh  immediately after he was seized with perhaps the severest shaking fit he had yet experienced so that ned could not help recalling the wellknown caution so frequently met with on medicine vials when taken to be well shaken despite the anxiety he felt for his friend  but soon after the trembling fit passed away and tom sank into a quiet slumberthe first real rest he had enjoyed for several days  ned felt his pulse and his brow looked long and earnestly into his face nodded approvingly once or twice and having tucked the blankets gently in round the sick man he proceeded to prepare supper  he removed just enough of the deers skin to permit of a choice morsel being cut out this he put into the pot and made thereof a rich and savoury soup which he tasted and if smacking ones lips and tasting it again twice indicated anything the soup was good  but ned sinton did not eat it  that was toms supper and was put just near enough the fire to keep it warm  this being done ned cut out another choice morsel of deersmeat which he roasted and ate as only those can eat who are well and young and robust and in the heart of the wilderness  then he filled his pipe sat down close to toms couch placed his back against a tree crossed his arms on his breast and smoked and watched the whole night long  he rose gently several times during the night however partly for the purpose of battling off his tendency to sleep and partly for the purpose of replenishing the fire and keeping the soup warm  but tom collins took no supper that night  ned longed very much to see him awake but he didnt  towards morning ned managed for some time to fight against sleep by entering into a close and philosophical speculation as to what was the precise hour at which that pot of soup could not properly be called supper but would merge into breakfast this question still remained unsettled in his mind when grey dawn lit up the peaks of the eastern hills and he was still debating it and nodding like a chinese mandarin and staring at intervals like a confused owl when the sun shot over the treetops and alighting softly on the sleepers face aroused him  tom awoke refreshed ate his breakfast with relish took his medicine without grumbling smiled on his comrade and squeezed his hand as he went to sleep again with a heavy sigh of comfort  from that hour he mended rapidly and in a week after he was well enough to resume his journey    chapter twenty two  powerful effects of gold on the aspect of things in generalthe doings at little creek diggingslarry becomes speculative and digs a hole which nearly proves the grave of many minerscaptain bunting takes a fearful diveahwow is smitten to the eartha mysterious letter and a splendid dish  we must now beg our reader to turn with us to another scene  the appearance of little creek diggings altered considerably and for the worse after ned sinton and tom collins left  a rush of miners had taken place in consequence of the reports of the successful adventurers who returned to sacramento for supplies and in the course of a few weeks the whole valley was swarming with eager goldhunters  the consequence of this was that laws of a somewhat stringent nature had to be made  the ground was measured off into lots of about ten feet square and apportioned to the miners  of course in so large and rough a community there was a good deal of crime so that judge lynchs services were frequently called in but upon the whole considering the circumstances of the colony there was much less than might have been expected  at the time of which we write namely several weeks after the events narrated in our last chapter the whole colony was thrown into a state of excitement in consequence of large quantities of gold having been discovered on the banks of the stream in the ground on which the loghuts and tents were erected  the result of this discovery was that the whole place was speedily riddled with pits and their concomitant mudheaps and to walk about after nightfall was a difficult as well as a dangerous amusement  many of the miners pulled down their tents and began to work upon the spots on which they previously stood  others began to dig all round their wooden huts until these rude domiciles threatened to become insular and a few pulled their dwellings down in order to get at the gold beneath them  one man as he sat on his doorstep smoking his pipe after dinner amused himself by poking the handle of an axe into the ground and unexpectedly turned up a small nugget of gold worth several dollars in ten minutes there was a pit before his door big enough to hold a sheep and before night he realised about fifty dollars  another in the course of two days dug out one hundred dollars behind his tent and all were more or less fortunate  at this particular time it happened that captain bunting had been seized with one of his irresistible and romantic wandering fits and had gone off with the blunderbuss to hunt in the mountains  maxton having heard of better diggings elsewhere and not caring for the society of our adventurers when ned and tom were absent had bid them goodbye and gone off with his pick and shovel on his shoulder and his prospectingpan in his hand no one knew whither  bill jones was down at sacramento purchasing provisions as the prices at the diggings were ruinous and kosing had removed with one of the other chinamen to another part of the creek  thus it came to pass that larry oneil and ahwow the chinaman were left alone to work out the claims of the party  one fine day larry and his comrade were seated in the sunshine concluding their midday meal when a yankee passed and told them of the discoveries that had been made further down the settlement  good luck to ye said larry nodding facetiously to the man as he put a tin mug to his lips and drained its contents to the bottom  ha its the potheen im fond of not but that ive seen better faix ive seldom tasted worse but theres a vartue in goolddiggin that would make akifortis go down like milkit would  will ye try a drop  larry filled the pannikin as he spoke and handed it to the yankee who nothing loth drained it and returned it empty with thanks  theyre diggin goold out o the cabin floors are they said larry wiping his mouth with the sleeve of his shirt  they air answered the man  one feller dug up three hundred dollars yesterday from the very spot where hes bin snorin on the last six months  ah thin thats a purty little sum said larry with a leer that shewed he didnt believe a word of it  does he expect more tomorrow think ye  dont know said the man half offended at the doubt thus cast on his veracity ye better go an ax him  good day stranger and the yankee strode away rapidly  larry scratched his head then he rubbed his nose and then his chin without apparently deriving any particular benefit from these actions after that he looked up at ahwow who was seated crosslegged on the ground opposite to him smoking and asked him what was his opinion  dun no said the chinaman without moving a muscle of his stolid countenance  oh yere an entertainin cratur ye are ill just make a hole here where i sit an see what comes of it  sure its better nor doin nothin  saying this larry refilled his empty pipe stretched himself at full length on his side rested his head on his left hand and smoked complacently for three minutes after which he took up the long sheathknife with which he had just cut up his supper and began carelessly to turn over the sod  sure there is goold he said on observing several specks of the shining metal  as he dug deeper down he struck upon a hard substance which on being turned up proved to be a piece of quartz the size of a hens egg in which rich lumps and veins of gold were embedded  may i niver shouted the irishman starting up and throwing away his pipe in his excitement av it isnt a nugget  hooray wheres the pick  larry overturned the chinaman who sat in his way darted into the tent for his pick and shovel and in five minutes was a foot down into the earth  he came upon a solid rock however much to his chagrin a few inches further down  faix ill tell ye what ill do he said as a new idea struck him ill dig inside o the tint  it ll kape the sun an the rain off  this remark was made half to himself and half to ahwow who having gathered himself up and resumed his pipe was regarding him with as much interest as he ever regarded anything  as ahwow made no objection and did not appear inclined to volunteer an opinion larry entered the tent cleared all the things away into one corner and began to dig in the centre of it  it was fortunate that he adopted this plan first because the rainy season having now set in the tent afforded him shelter and secondly because the soil under the tent turned out to be exceedingly richso much so that in the course of the next few days he and the chinaman dug out upwards of a thousand dollars  but the rains which for some time past had given indubitable hints that they meant to pay a long visit to the settlement at last came down like a waterspout and flooded larry and his comrade out of the hole  they cut a deep trench round the tent however to carry off the water and continued their profitable labour unremittingly  the inside of the once comfortable tent now presented a very remarkable appearance  all the property of the party was thrust into the smallest possible corner and larrys bed was spread out above it the remainder of the space was a yawning hole six feet deep and a mound of earth about four feet high  this earth formed a sort of breastwork over which larry had to clamber night and morning in leaving and returning to his couch  the chinaman slept in his own little tent hard by  there was another inconvenience attending this style of mining which larry had not foreseen when he adopted it and which caused the tent of our adventurers to become a sort of public nuisance  larry had frequently to go down the stream for provisions and ahwow being given to sleep when no one watched him took advantage of those opportunities to retire to his own tent the consequence was that strangers who chanced to look in in passing frequently fell headlong into the hole ere they were aware of its existence and on more than one occasion larry returned and found a miner in the bottom of it with his neck wellnigh broken  to guard against this he hit upon the plan of putting up a cautionary ticket  he purchased a flat board and a pot of black paint with which he wrote the words  mind yer feet thars a big hol and fixed it up over the entrance  the device answered very well in as far as those who could read were concerned but as there were many who could not read at all and who mistook the ticket for the sign of a shop or store the accidents became rather more frequent than before  the irishman at last grew desperate and taking ahwow by the pigtail vowed that if he deserted his post again hed blow out all the brains he hadif he had any at allan if that wouldnt do hed cut him up into mincemeat so he would  the chinaman evidently thought him in earnest for he fell on his knees and promised with tears in his eyes that he would never do it again or words to that effect  one day larry and ahwow were down in the hole labouring for gold as if it were life  it was a terribly rainy dayso bad that it was almost impossible to keep the water out  larry had clambered out of the hole and was seated on the top of the mudheap resting himself and gazing down upon his companion who slowly but with the steady regularity of machinery dug out the clay and threw it on the heap when a voice called from without  is this mr edward sintons tent  it is that same cried larry rising dont come in or itll be worse for ye  heres a letter for him then and twenty dollars to pay  musha but its chape postage said larry lifting the curtain and stepping out couldnt ye say thirty now  come down with the cash and none o yer jaw said the man who was a surly fellow and did not seem disposed to stand joking  oh be all manes yer honour retorted larry with mock servility as he counted out the money  av it wouldnt displase yer lordship may i take the presumption to ax how the seal come to be broken  i know nothin about it answered the man as he pocketed the money i found it on the road between this an sacramento and as i was passin this way anyhow i brought it on  ah thin it was a great kindness intirely to go so far out o yer way an that for a stranger too an for nothinor nixt thing to it said larry looking after the man as he walked away  well now he continued reentering the tent and seating himself again on the top of the mudheap while he held the letter in his hand at arms length this bates all  an whot am i to do with it  sure its not right to break the seal o another mans letter but then its broke aready an there can be no sin in raidin it  maybe he continued with a look of anxiety the poor lads ill or dead an hes wrote to say so  sure i would like to raid itav i only knowd how but me edications bin forgot bad luck to the schoolmasters i can only make out big printwan letter at a time  the poor man looked wistfully at the letter feeling that it might possibly contain information of importance to all of them and that delay in taking action might cause irreparable misfortune  while he meditated what had best be done and scanned the letter in all directions a footstep was heard outside and the hearty voice of captain bunting shouted  ship ahoy whos within boys  hooroo capting shouted larry jumping up with delight mind yer fut capting dear dont come in  why not inquired the captain as he lifted the curtain  sure its no use tellin ye now said larry as captain bunting fell headforemost into ahwows arms and drove that worthy creature as he himself would have saidsternforemost into the mud and water at the bottom  the captain happened to have a haunch of venison on his shoulder and the blunderbuss under his arm so that the crash and the splash as they all floundered in the mud were too much for larry who sat down again on the mudheap and roared with laughter  it is needless to go further into the details of this misadventure captain bunting and the chinaman were soon restored to the upper world happily unhurt so having changed their garments they went into ahwows tent to discuss the letter  let me see it larry said the captain sitting down on an empty pork cask  larry handed him the missive and he read as follows  san francisco  edward sinton esquire little creek diggings  my dear siri have just time before the post closes to say that i only learned a few days ago that you were at little creek otherwise i should have written sooner to say that  here the captain seemed puzzled  now aint that aggravatin he said the seal has torn away the most important bit o the letter  i wish i had the villains by the nose that opened it  look here larry can you guess what it was  larry took the letter and after scrutinising it with intense gravity and earnestness returned it with the remark that it was beyant him entirely  thatthat said the captain again attempting to read that somethingreat success so you and captain bunting had better come down at once  believe me my dear sir yours faithfully john thomson  now remarked the captain with a look of chagrin as he laid down the letter folded his hands together and gazed into larrys grave visage nothin half so tantalisin as that has happened to me since the time when my good ship the roving bess was cast ashore at san francisco  its purvokin replied larry an preplexin  its most unfortunate too continued the captain knitting up his visage that sinton should be away just at this time without rudder chart or compass an bound for no port that any one knows of  why the fellow may be deep in the heart o the rocky mountains for all i can tell  i might start off at once without him but maybe that would be of no use  what can it be that old thompsons so anxious about  why didnt the old figurhead use his pen more freelyhis tongue goes fast enough to drive the engines of a seventyfour  what is to be done  although captain bunting asked the question with thorough earnestness and much energy looking first at larry and then at ahwow he received no reply  the former shook his head and the latter stared at him with a steady dead intensity as if he wished to stare him through  after a few minutes pause larry suddenly asked the captain if he was hungry to which the latter replied that he was whereupon the former suggested that it was worth while cookin the haunch o venson and offered to do it in a peculiar manner that had been taught to him not long ago by a hunter who had passed that way and fallen into the hole in the tent and sprained his ankle so that he larry was obliged to kape him for a week an trate him to the best all the time  the proposal was agreed to and larry seizing the haunch which was still covered with the mud contracted in the hole proceeded to exhibit his powers as a cook  the rain which had been coming down as if a second flood were about to deluge the earth had ceased at this time and the sun succeeded for a few hours in struggling through the murky clouds and pouring a flood of light and heat over hill and plain the result of which was that along the whole length of little creek there was an eruption of blankets and shirts and inexpressibles and other garments which stood much in need of being dried and which as they fluttered and flapped their manycoloured folds in the light breeze gave the settlement the appearanceas captain bunting expressed itof being dressed from stem to stern  the steam that arose from these habiliments and from the soaking earth and from the drenched forest covered the face of nature with a sort of luminous mist that was quite cheering by contrast with the leaden gloom that had preceded it and filled with a romantic glow the bosoms of such miners as had any romance left in their natures  larry oneil was one of these and he went about his work whistling violently  we will not take upon us to say how much of his romance was due to the haunch of venison  we would not if called on to do it undertake to say how much of the romance and enjoyment of a picnic party would evaporate if it were suddenly announced that the hamper had been forgotten or that it had fallen and the contents been smashed and mixed  we turn from such ungenerous and gross contemplations to the cooking of that haunch of venison which as it was done after a fashion never known to soyer and may be useful in afteryears to readers of this chronicle whose lot it may be perchance to stand in need of such knowledge we shall carefully describe  it is not necessary to enlarge upon the preliminaries  we need hardly say that larry washed off the mud and that he passed flattering remarks upon his own abilities and prowess and in very irreverent tones and terms addressed ahwow who smoked his pipe and looked at him  all that and a great deal more we leave to our readers wellknown and vivid imagination  suffice it that the venison was duly washed and a huge fire with much difficulty kindled and a number of large stones put into it to heat  this done larry cut off a lump of meat from the hauncha good deal larger than his own head which wasnt smallthe skin with the hair on being cut off along with the meat  a considerable margin of flesh was then pared off from the lump so as to leave an edging of hide all round which might overlap the remainder and enclose it as it were in a natural bag  at this stage of the process larry paused looked admiringly at his work winked over the edge of it at ahwow and went hastily into the tent whence he issued with two little tin canistersone containing pepper the other salt  why you beat the french all to nothing remarked the captain who sat on an upturned teabox smoking and watching the proceedings  ah thin dont spake capting itll spile yer appetite said larry sprinkling the seasoning into the bag and closing it up by means of a piece of cord  he then drew the redhot stones and ashes from the fire and making a hotbed thereof placed the venisondumplingif we may be allowed the termon the centre of it  before the green hide was quite burned through the dish was cooked as yankees express it to a curiosity and the tasting thereof would have evoked from an alderman a look he would have been past speaking of ecstasy while a lady might have exclaimed delicious or a schoolboy have said hlpluhplp see note 1 or some such term which ought only to be used in reference to intellectual treats and should never be applied to such low matters as meat and drink    note 1  hlpluhplp  as the reader may have some difficulty in pronouncing the above word we beg to inform him or her that it is easily done by simply drawing in the breath and at the same time waggling the tongue between the lips    chapter twenty three  the rainy season and its effectsdisease and misery at little creek reappearance of old friendsan emigrants deathan unexpected arrival  captain bunting after two days serious consideration made up his mind to go down alone to san francisco in order to clear up the mystery of the letter and do all that he could personally in the absence of his friend  to resolve however was easy to carry his resolution into effect was almost impracticable in consequence of the inundated state of the country  it was now the middle of november and the rainy season which extends over six months of the year was in full play  language is scarcely capable of conveying to those who have not seen it an adequate idea of how it rained at this period of the year  it did not pourthere were no dropsit roared a cataract of neverending ramrods as thick as your finger straight down from the black sky right through to the very vitals of the earth  it struck the tents like shot and spirted through the tightest canvas in the form of scotchmist  it swept down cabin chimneys and put out the fires it roared through every crevice and rent and seam of the hills in mad cataracts and swelled up the little creek into a mighty surging river  all work was arrested men sat in their tents on mudheaps that melted from below them or lay on logs that wellnigh floated away with them but there was not so much grumbling as one might have expected  it was too tremendous to be merely annoying  it was sublimely ridiculousso men grinned and bore it  but there were many poor miners there alas who could not regard that season in a light manner  there were dozens of young and middleaged men whose constitutions although good perhaps were not robust and who ought never to have ventured to seek their fortunes in the goldregions  men who might have lived their full time and have served their day and generation usefully in the civilised regions of the world but who despite the advice of friends probably and certainly despite the warnings of experienced travellers and authors rushed eagerly to california to find not a fortune but a grave  dysentery scurvy in its worst and most loathsome type ague rheumatism sciatica consumption and other diseases were now rife at the diggings cutting down many a youthful plant and blasting many a golden dream  doctors too became surprisingly numerous but these disciples of esculapius failed to effect cures and as their diplomas when sought for were not forthcoming they were ultimately banished en masse by the indignant miners  one or two old hunters and trappers turned out in the end to be the most useful doctors and effected a good many cures with the simple remedies they had become acquainted with among the redmen  what rendered things worse was that provisions became scarce and therefore enormously dear  no fresh vegetables of any kind were to be had  salt greasy and rancid pork bearsmeat and venison were all the poor people could procure although many a man there would have given a thousand dollarsay all he possessedfor a single meal of fresh potatoes  the men smitten with scurvy had therefore no chance of recovering  the valley became a huge hospital and the banks of the stream a cemetery  there were occasional lulls however in this dismal state of affairs sometimes the rain ceased the sun burst forth in irresistible splendour and the whole country began to steam like a caldron  a cart too succeeded now and then in struggling up with a load of fresh provisions reviving a few sinking spirits for a time and almost making the owners fortune but at the best it was a drearily calamitous seasonone which caused many a sick heart to hate the sight and name of gold and many a digger to resolve to quit the land and all its treasures at the first opportunity  doubtless too many deep and earnest thoughts of life and its aims and ends filled the minds of some men at that time  it is often in seasons of adversity that god shews to men how mistaken their views of happiness are and how mad as well as sinful it is in them to search for joy and peace apart from and without the slightest regard for the author of all felicity  yes there is reason to hope and believe that many seeds of eternal life were sown by the saviour and watered by the holy spirit in that disastrous time of disease and deathseed which perhaps is now blessing and fertilising many distant regions of the world  in one of the smallest and most wretched of the huts at the entrance of the valley of little creek lay a man whose days on earth were evidently few  the hut stood apart from the others in a lonely spot as if it shrank from observation and was seldom visited by the miners who were too much concerned about their own misfortunes to care much for those of others  here kate morgan sat by the couch of her dying brother endeavouring to soothe his last hours by speaking to him in the most endearing terms and reading passages from the word of god which lay open on her knee  but the dying man seemed to derive little comfort from what she said or read  his restless eye roamed anxiously round the wretched hut while his breath came short and thick from between his pale lips  shall i read to ye darlin said the woman bending over the couch to catch the faint whisper which was all the poor man had strength to utter  just then ere he could reply the clatter of hoofs was heard and a bronzed stalwart horseman was seen through the doorless entrance of the hut approaching at a brisk trot  both horse and man were of immense size and they came on with that swinging heavy tread which gives the impression of irresistible weight and power  the rider drew up suddenly and leaping off his horse cried can i have a draught of water my good woman as he fastened the bridle to a tree and strode into the hut  kate rose hurriedly and held up her finger to impose silence as she handed the stranger a can of water  but he had scarcely swallowed a mouthful when his eye fell on the sick man  going gently forward to the couch he sat down beside it and taking the invalids wrist felt his pulse  is he your husband inquired the stranger in a subdued voice  no sirmy brother  does he like to have the bible read to him  sometimes but before his voice failed he was always cryin out for the priest  hes a catholic sir though im not wan meself and thinks he cant be saved unless he sees the priest  the stranger took up the bible and turning towards the man whose bright eyes were fixed earnestly upon him read in a low impressive voice several of those passages in which a free salvation to the chief of sinners is offered through jesus christ  he did not utter a word of comment but he read with deep solemnity and paused ever and anon to look in the face of the sick man as he read the blessed words of comfort  the man was not in a state either to listen to arguments or to answer questions so the stranger wisely avoided both and gently quitted the hut after offering up a brief prayer and repeating twice the words  jesus says him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out  kate followed him out and thanked him earnestly for his kindness while tears stood in her eyes  have you no friends or relations here but him inquired the stranger  not wan  there was wan man as came to see us often when we stayed in a lonesome glen further up the creek but weve not seen him since we came here  more be token he didnt know we were goin to leave and we wint off in a hurry for my poor brother was impatient and thought the change would do him good  take this you will be the better of it  the stranger thrust a quantity of silver into kates hand and sprang upon his horse  i dont need it thank ee said kate hurriedly  but you may need it at any rate he does  stay what was the name of the man who used to visit you  oneil sirlarry oneil  indeed he is one of my mates  my name is sintonedward sinton you shall hear from me again ere long  ned put spurs to his horse as he spoke and in another moment was out of sight    chapter twenty four  ned decides on visiting san franciscolarry pays a visit and receives a severe disappointmentthe road and the cityunexpected news  few joys in this life are altogether without alloy  the delight experienced by larry oneil and captain bunting when they heard the hearty tones of ned sintons voice and the satisfaction with which they beheld his face when in their anxiety to prevent his falling headlong into the hole they both sprang out of the tent and rushed into his arms were somewhat damped on their observing that tom collins was not with him  but their anxieties were speedily relieved on learning that tom was at sacramento city and it was to be hoped doing well  as ned had eaten nothing on the day of his arrival since early morning the first care of his friends was to cook some food for him and larry took special care to brew for him as soon as possible a stiff tumbler of hot brandy and water which as he was wet and weary was particularly acceptable  while enjoying this over the fire in front of the tent ned related the adventures of himself and tom collins circumstantially in the course of which narration he explained what the reader does not yet know how that after tom had recovered from his illness sufficiently to ride he had conducted him by easy stages to the banks of the great san joaquin river down which they had proceeded by boat until they reached sacramento  here ned saw him comfortably settled in the best room of the best hotel in the town and then purchasing the largest and strongest horse he could find he set off in spite of the rains to let his comrades know that they were both safe and in neds case at least sound  and now with reference to that letter  ay that letter echoed the captain thats what ive bin wantin you to come to  what can it mean  i am as ignorant of that as yourself answered ned if it had only been you who were mentioned in the letter i could have supposed that your old ship had been relaunched and refitted and had made a successful voyage to china during your absence but as i left no property of any kind in san francisco and had no speculations afloat i cannot conceive what it can be  maybe suggested larry theyve heard o our remarkable talents up here in the diggins and theyve been successful in gittin us appinted to respansible sitivations in the new government ive heared theyre sottin up down there  i wouldnt object to be prime minister meself av theyd only allow me enough clarks to do the work  and did you say you were all ready for a start tomorrow captain inquired ned  quite  weve disposed of the claims and tools for fifteen hundred dollars an we sold ahwow along with the lot thats to say he remains a fixture at the same wage and the little we meant to take with us is stowed away in our saddlebags  ye see i couldnt foresee that youd plump down on us in this fashion and i felt that the letter was urgent and ought to be acted on at once  you did quite right returned ned  what a pity i missed seeing bill jones at sacramento but the city has grown so much and become so populous in a few months that two friends might spend a week in it unknown to each other without chancing to meet  and now as to the gold  have you been successful since i left  ay broke in larry that have we  its a great country intirely for men whose bones and muscles are made o iron  weve dug forty thousand dollarseight thousand poundsout o that same hole in the tint forby sprainin the ankles and wellnigh breakin the legs o eight or tin miners  its sorry ill be to lave it  but afther all its a sickly place so im contint to go  by the way larry that reminds me i met a friend o yours at the other end of the settlement  i belave ye answered larry ivery man in the creeks my frind theyd die for me they would av i only axed them  ay but a particular friend named kate who  och ye dont mane it cried the irishman starting up with an anxious look  sure they lived up in the dark glen there and they wint off wan fine day an ive niver been able to hear o them since  they are not very far off continued ned detailing his interview with the brother and sister and expressing a conviction that the former could not now be in life  ill go down tonight said larry drawing on his heavy boots  youd better wait till tomorrow suggested the captain  the poor thing will be in no humour to see any one tonight and we can make a halt near the hut for an hour or so  larry with some reluctance agreed to this delay and the rest of the evening was spent by the little party in making preparations for a start on the following day but difficulties arose in the way of settling with the purchasers of their claims so that another day passed ere they got fairly off on their journey towards sacramento  on reaching the mouth of the little creek larry oneil galloped ahead of his companions and turned aside at the little hut the locality of which sinton had described to him minutely  springing off his horse he threw the reins over a bush and crossed the threshold  it is easier to conceive than to describe his amazement and consternation on finding the place empty  dashing out he vaulted into the saddle and almost galloped through the doorway of the nearest hut in his anxiety to learn what had become of his friends  halloo stranger shouted a voice from within no thoroughfare this way an i wouldnt advise ye for to go an try for to make one  ho countryman wheres the sick irishman and his sister gone that lived close to ye here  wall i aint a countryman o yourn i guess but i can answer a civil question  theyre gone  the mans dead an the gal took him away in a cart day bfore yisterday  gone took him away in a cart echoed larry while he looked aghast at the man  are ye sure  wall i couldnt be surer  i made the coffin for em and helped to lift it into the cart  but where have they gone to  to sacramento i guess  i advised her not to go but she mumbled something about not havin him buried in sich a wild place an layin him in a churchyard so i gave her the loan o fifty dollarsit was all i could sparefor she hadnt a rap  she borrowed the horse and cart from a countryman who was goin to sacramento at any rate  youre a trump you are cried larry with energy give us your hand me boy  ah thin yer parents were irish ill be bound now heres your fifty dollars back again with compound interest to bootthough i dont know exactly what that is  i didnt ax ye for the fifty dollars said the man somewhat angrily who are you that offers em  im herherfriend answered larry in some confusion her intimate friend i might almost say a sort o distant relationonly not quite that  wall if thats all i guess im as much a friend as you said the man reentering his cabin and shutting the door with a bang  larry sighed dropped the fifty dollars into his leather purse and galloped away  the journey down to sacramento owing to the flooded state of the country was not an easy one  it took the party several days hard riding to accomplish it and during all that time larry kept a vigilant lookout for kate morgan and the cart but neither of them did he see each day he felt certain he would overtake them but each evening found him trying to console himself with the reflection that a stern chase is proverbially a long one and that next day would do it  thus they struggled on and finally arrived at the city of sacramento without having set eyes on the wanderer  poor larry little knew that having gone with a man who knew the road thoroughly kate although she travelled slowly had arrived there the day before him while ned had lengthened the road by unwittingly making a considerable and unnecessary detour  still less did he know that at the very hour he arrived in the city kate with her sad charge embarked on board a small river steamer and was now on her way to san francisco  as it was larry proposed to start back again supposing they must have passed them but on second thoughts he decided to remain where he was and make inquiries  so the three friends pushed forward to the city hotel to make inquiries after tom collins  mr collins said the waiter bowing to sintonhes gone sir about a week ago  gone exclaimed ned turning pale  yes sir gone down to san francisco  he saw some advertisement or other in the newspaper and started off by the next steamer  neds heart beat freely again  was he well when he left  yes sir pretty well  he would have been the better of a longer rest but he was quite fit to travel sir  captain bunting who during this colloquy had been standing with his legs apart and his eyes glaring at the waiter as if he had been mad gave a prolonged whistle but made no further remark  at this moment larry who had been conversing with one of the underwaiters came rushing in with a look of desperation on his countenance  would ye belave it he cried throwing himself down on a splendid crimson sofa that seemed very much out of keeping with the dress of the rough miners whom it was meant to accommodatewould ye belave it theyre gone  who are gone and where to inquired ned  kate anan the caffin  off to san francisco be all thats onlucky an only wint little more nor an hour ago  the three friends looked at each other  waiter said captain bunting in a solemn voice bearchops for three pipes and baccy for six an a brandysmash for one an dye hear let it be stiff  yes sir  a loud laugh from ned and larry relieved their overexcited and pentup feelings and both agreed that under the circumstances the captains order was the best that could be given at that stage of their perplexities  having ascertained that there was not another steamer to san francisco for a week they resolved to forget their anxieties as much as possible and enjoy themselves in the great city of sacramento during the next few days while they instituted inquiries as to what had become of their comrade bill jones who they concluded must still be in the city as they had not met him on the way down    chapter twenty five  gold not allpowerfulremarkable growth of sacramentonew style of bringing a hotel into noticea surprising discoverydeath of a mexican horsetamerthe concert and another discoverymademoiselle nelina creates a sensation  it is said that gold can accomplish anything and in some respects the saying is full of truth in some points of view however the saying is altogether wrong  gold can indeed accomplish almost anything in the material worldit can purchase stone and metal and timber and muscles bones thews and sinews with life in them to any extent  it can go a step furtherit can purchase brains intellect genius and throwing the whole together material and immaterial it can cut and carve and mould the world to such an extent that its occupants of fifty years ago were they permitted to return to earth would find it hard to recognise the scene of their brief existence  but there are things and powers which gold cannot purchase  that wornout old millionnaire would give tons of it for a mere tithe of the health that yonder ploughman enjoys  youth cannot be bought with gold  time cannot be purchased with gold  the prompt obedience of thousands of men and women may be bought with that precious metal but one powerful throb of a loving heart could not be procured by all the yellow gold that ever did or ever will enrich the human family  but we are verging towards digression  let us return to the simple idea with which we intended to begin this chapterthe wonderworking power of gold  in no country in the wide world we venture to affirm has this power been exemplified so strikingly as in california  the knowledge of the discovery of gold was so suddenly and widely disseminated over the earth that human beings flowed into the formerlyuninhabited wilderness like a mighty torrent while thousands of ships flooded the markets with the necessaries of life  then gold was found to be so abundant and at first so easily procured that the fever was kept up at whiteheat for several years  the result of this was as we have remarked elsewhere that changes worthy of aladdins lamp or harlequins wand were wrought in the course of a few weeks sometimes in a few days  the city of sacramento was one of the most remarkable of the many strange and sudden growths in the country  the river on which it stands is a beautiful stream from two to three hundred yards wide and navigable by large craft to a few miles above the city  the banks when our friends were there were fringed with rich foliage and the wild trees of the forest itself stood growing in the streets  the city was laid out in the form of a square with streets crossing each other at right angles a forest of masts along the embarcadero attested the growing importance and wealth of the place and nearly ten thousand inhabitants swarmed in its streets  many of those streets were composed of canvas tents or erections scarcely more durable  yet here little more than a year before there were only four thousand in the place  those who chanced to be in possession of the land here were making fortunes  lots twenty feet by seventy in the best situations brought upwards of 3500 dollars  rents too were enormous  one hotel paid 30000 dollars 6000 pounds per annum another 35000 dollars  small stores fetched ten and twelve thousand dollars a year while board at the best hotels was five dollars a day  truly if gold was plentiful it was needed for the common necessaries of life though plentiful were bought and sold at fabulous prices  the circulation of gold was enormous and the growth of the city did not suffer a check even for a day although the cost of building was unprecedented  and this commercial prosperity continued in spite of the fact that the place was unhealthybeing a furnace in summer and in winter little better than a swamp  its a capital hotel remarked captain bunting to his companions as they sat round their little table enjoying their pipes after dinner i wonder if they make a good thing out of it  sure if they dont said larry tilting his chair on its hind legs and calmly blowing a cloud of smoke towards the roof its a losin game theyre playin for they sarve out the grub at a tearin pace  they are doing well i doubt not said ned sinton and they deserve to for the owneror owners i dont know how many or few there are made a remarkable and enterprising start  how was that asked the captain  i heard of it when i was down here with tom continued sinton  you must know that this was the first regular hotel opened in the city and it was considered so great an event that it was celebrated by salvos of artillery and on the part of the proprietors by a great unlimited feast to all who chose to come  what cried larry free gratis for nothin  ay for nothing  it was done in magnificent style i assure you  any one who chose came and called for what he wanted and got it at once the attendance was prompt and as cheerfully given as though it had been paid for  ginslings cocktails mintjuleps and brandysmashes went round like a circular storm even champagne flowed like water and venison wildfowl salmon grizzlybearsteaks and pastryall the delicacies of the season in shortwere literally to be had for the asking  what it cost the spirited proprietors i know not but certainly it was a daring stroke of genius that deserved patronage  faix it did said larry emphatically and they shall have it too here waiter a brandysmash and a cheroot and be aisy as to the cost i think me bankll stand it  what say you to a stroll said ned rising  by all means replied captain bunting jumping up and laying down his pipe  larry preferred to remain where he was so the two friends left him to enjoy his cheroot and wandered away where fancy led to see the town  there was much to be seen  it required no theatrical representation of life to amuse one in sacramento at that time  the whole city was a vast series of plays in earnest  every conceivable species of comedy and farce met the eye at every turn costumes the most remarkable men the most varied and peculiar and things the most incomprehensible and unexpected presented themselves in endless succession  here a canvas restaurant stood or rather leaned against a logstore  there a tent spread its folds in juxtaposition to a deckcabin which seemed to have walked ashore from a neighbouring brig without leave and had been let out as a grogshop by way of punishment  chinamen in calico jostled sailors in canvas or diggers in scarlet flannel shirts or dandies in broadcloth and patentleather or red indians in nothing  bustle and hurry and uproar and joviality prevailed  a good deal of drinking too unfortunately went on and the results were occasional melodramas and sometimes serious rows  tragedies too were enacted but these seldom met the eye as is usually the case they were done in the dark  what have we here cried captain bunting stopping before a large placard and reading  grand concert this eveningwonderful singer mademoiselle nelina first appearanceethiopian serenaders  i say ned we must go to this ive not heard a song for ages that was worth listening to  at what hour inquired nedoh seven oclock well we can stroll back to the hotel have a cup of coffee and bring larry oneil with us come along  that evening our three adventurers occupied the back seat of a large concertroom in one of the most crowded thoroughfares of the town patiently awaiting the advent of the performers  the room was filled to overflowing long before the hour for the commencement of the performances with every species of mortal except woman  women were exceedingly rare creatures at that timethe meetings of all sorts were composed almost entirely of men in their varied and motley garbs  considering the circumstances in which it was got up the room was a very creditable one destitute indeed of ornament but well lighted by an enormous wooden chandelier full of wax candles which depended from the centre of the ceiling  at the further end of the room was a raised stage with footlights in front and three chairs in the middle of it there was a small orchestra in front consisting of two fiddles a cornopian a trombone a clarionet and a flute but at first the owners of these instruments kept out of sight wisely reserving themselves until that precise moment when the impatient audience wouldas all audiences do on similar occasionsthreaten to bring down the building with stamping of feet accompanied with steamenginelike whistles and savage cries of music  while ned sinton and his friends were quietly looking round upon the crowd larry oneils attention was arrested by the conversation of two men who sat just in front of him  one was a roughlooking miner in a wideawake and redflannel shirt the other was a negro in a shirt of bluestriped calico  who be this missey nelina inquired the negro turning to his companion  i dun know but i was here last night an id take my davy i saw the little gal in the ranche of a feller away in the plains five hundred miles to the eastard two months ago  her father poor chap was killed by a wild horse  how was dat inquired the negro with an expression of great interest  well it was this way it happened replied the other putting a quid of tobacco into his cheek such as only a sailor would venture to masticate  i was up at the diggins about six months without gittin more gold than jist kep me in lifefor ye see i was always an unlucky dogwhen one day i goes down to my claim and at the very first lick dug up two chunks o gold as big as yer fists so i sold my claim and shovel and came down here for a spree  well as i was sayin i come to the ranche o a feller called bangi or bongi or bungi or some sort o bang with a gi at the end o t  he was clappin his little gal on the head when i comed up and said goodbye to her  i didnt rightly hear what she said but i was so taken with her pretty face that i couldnt help axin if the little thing was hisn  yees says hefor he was a mexican and couldnt come round the english lingoshe me darter  i found the man was goin to catch a wild horse so says i ill go with ye an says he come long so away we went slappin over the plains at a great rate him and me and a yankee a friend o his and three or four servants after a drove o wild horses that had been seen that mornin near the house  well away we went after the wild horses  oh it was grand sport  the man had lent me one of his beasts an it went at such a spankin pace i could scarce keep my seat and had to hold on by the saddlenot bein used to ridin much dye see  we soon picked out a horsea splendidlookin feller with curved neck and free gallop and wide nostrils  my eye how he did snort and plunge when the mexican threw the lasso it went right over his head the first cast but the wild horse pulled the rope out o his grip  its all up thought i but never a bit  the mexican put spurs to his horse an while at full gallop made a dive with his body and actually caught the end o the line as it trailed over the ground and recovered his seat again  it was done in a crack an i believe he held on by means of his spurs which were big enough i think to make wheels for a small carronade takin a turn o the line round the horn of his saddle he reined in a bit and then gave the spurs for another spurt and soon after reined in againin fact he jist played the wild horse like a trout until he wellnigh choked him an in an hour or less he was led steamin and startin and jumpin into the corral where the man kept his other horses  at this point in the narrative the cries for music became so deafening that the sailor was obliged to pause to the evident annoyance of the negro who seemed intensely interested in what he had heard and also to the regret of larry who had listened eagerly the whole time  in a few minutes the music came in in the shape of two baldheaded frenchmen a wildlooking bearded german and several lean men who might as far as appearance went have belonged to almost any nation and who would have as far as musical ability went been repudiated by every nation except perhaps the chinese  during the quarter of an hour in which these performers quieted the impatient audience with sweet sounds the sailor continued his anecdote  well you see said he to the negro while larry bent forward to listen the mexican mounted and raced and spurred him for about an hour but just at the last the wild horse gave a tremendous leap and a plunge and we noticed the rider fall forward as if hed got a sprain the yankee an one o the servants ran up and caught the horse by the head but its rider didnt movehe was stone dead and was held in his seat by the spurs sticking in the saddlecloth  the last bound must have ruptured some bloodvessel inside for there was no sign of hurt upon him anywhere  you don say dat said the negro with a look of horror  deed do i an we took the poor feller home where his little daughter cried for him as if shed break her heart  i asked the yankee what we should do but he looked at me somewhat offended like an said he was a relation o the dead mans wife and could manage the affairs o the family without help so i bid him good mornin and went my way  but i believe in my heart he was tellin a lie and that hes no right to go hawkin the poor gal about the country in this fashion  larry was deeply interested in this narrative and felt so strong a disposition to make further inquiries that he made up his mind to question the sailor and was about to address him when a small bell tinkled the music ceased and three ethiopian minstrels banjo in hand advanced to the footlights made their bow and then seated themselves on the three chairs with that intensity of consummate impudent easy familiarity peculiar to the ebony sons of song  go it darkies shouted an enthusiastic individual in the middle of the room  three cheers for the niggers roared a sailor who had just returned from a twelvemonths cruise at the mines and whose delight at the prospect of once more hearing a good song was quite irrepressible  the audience responded to the call with shouts of laughter and a cheer that would have done your heart good to listen to while the niggers shewed their teeth in acknowledgment of the compliment  the first song was lilly dale and the men who we need scarcely say were fictitious negroes sang it so well that the audience listened with breathless attention and evident delight and encored it vociferously the next song was oh  massa how he wopped me a ditty of quite a different stamp but equally popular  it also was encored as indeed was every song sting that evening but the performers had counted on this  after the third song there was a hornpipe in the performance of which the dancers chief aim seemed to be to shew in what a variety of complex ways he could shake himself to pieces if he chose  then there was another trio and then a short pause in order duly to prepare the public mind for the reception of the great cantatrice mademoiselle nelina  when she was led to the footlights by the tallest of the three negroes there was a momentary pause as if men caught their breath then there was a prolonged cheer of enthusiastic admiration  and little wonder for the creature that appeared before these rough miners seemed more like an angelic visitant than a mortal  there was nothing strikingly beautiful about the child but she possessed that inexpressibly sweet character of face that takes the human heart by storm at first sight and this added to the fact that she was almost the only one of her sex who had been seen for many months by any of those presentthat she was fair blueeyed delicate modestly dressed and innocent filled them with an amount of enthusiasm that would have predisposed them to call a scream melodious had it been uttered by mademoiselle nelina  but the voice which came timidly from her lips was in harmony with her appearance  there was no attempt at execution and the poor child was too frightened to succeed in imparting much expression to the simple ballad which she warbled but there was an inherent richness in the tones of her voice that entranced the ear and dwelt for weeks and months afterwards on the memory of those who heard it that night  it is needless to add that all her songs were encored with rapturous applause  the second song she sang was the popular one erin my country and it created quite a furore among the audience many of whom were natives of the green isle  oh ye purty creature sing it again do yelled an irishman in the front seats while he waved his hat and cheered in mad enthusiasm  the multitude shouted encore and the song was sung for the third time  while it was singing larry oneil sat with his hands clasped before him his bosom heaving and his eyes riveted on the childs face  mr sinton he said in a deep earnest tone touching ned on the shoulder as the last sweet notes of the air were drowned in the thunder of applause that followed mademoiselle nelina off the stage mr sinton id lay me life that its her  who inquired ned smiling at the serious expression of his comrades face  who but nelly morgan av course  shes the born image o kate theyre as like as two paise  sure av its her ill know it i will an ill make that black thief of a yankee explain how he comed to possess stolen goods  ned and the captain at first expressed doubts as to larrys being able to swear to the identity of one whom he had never seen before but the earnest assurances of the irishman convinced them that he must be right and they at once entered into his feelings and planned in an eager undertone how the child was to be communicated with  it wont do said ned to tax the man right out with his villainy the miners would say we wanted to get possession of the child to make money by her  but if the child herself admitted that the man was not her relative suggested captain bunting  perhaps returned ned she might at the same time admit that she didnt like the appearance of the strangers who made such earnest inquiries about her and prefer to remain with her present guardian  niver fear said larry in a hoarse whisper shell not say that if i tell her i know her sister kate and can take her to her  besides hasnt she got an irish heart an dont i know the way to touch it jist stay where ye are both o ye an ill go behind the scenes  the niggers are comin on again so ill try maybe theres nobody there but herself  before they could reply larry was gone  in a few minutes he reached the front seats and leaning his back against the wall as if he were watching the performers he gradually edged himself into the dark corner where the side curtain shut off the orchestra from the public  to his great satisfaction he found that this was only secured to the wall by one or two nails which he easily removed and then in the midst of an uproarious laugh caused by a joke of the serenaders he pushed the curtain aside and stood before the astonished gaze of mademoiselle nelina who sat on a chair with her hands clasped and resting on her knee  unfortunately for the success of larrys enterprise he also stood before the curtainraisera broad sturdy man in rough miners costumewhose back was turned towards him but whose surprised visage instantly faced him on hearing the muffled noise caused by his entry there was a burly negro also in the place seated on a small stool who looked at him with unqualified astonishment  halloo wot do you want exclaimed the curtainraiser  eh tare an ages cried larry in amazement  may i niver  sure its draimin i am an the ghost o bill jones is comed to see me  it was indeed no other than bill jones who stood revealed before him but no friendly glance of recognition did his old comrade vouchsafe him he continued after the first look of surprise to frown steadily on the intruder  youve the advantage o me young man said bill in a stern though subdued tone for he feared to disturb the men on the stage moreover youve comed in where yeve got no right to be  when a man goes where he shouldnt ought to an things looks as if they wasnt all square in them circumstances blow high or blow low i always goes straight forard an shoves him out  if he dont shove easy why put on more steamthats wot i say  but sure ye dont forgit me bill pleaded larry in amazement  well praps i dont an praps i do  wen i last enjoyed the dishonour o yer acquaintance ye wos a blackguard  it aint likely yer improved so be good enough to back yer topsails and clear out  bill jones pointed as he spoke to the opening through which larry had entered but suddenly changing his mind he said hold on theres a back door an itll be easier to kick you through that than through the consartroom  so saying bill seized larry oneil by the collar and led that individual in a state of helpless and wondering consternation through a back door where however instead of kicking him out he released him and suddenly changed his tone to an eager whisper  oh  larry lad im glad to see ye  wherever did ye come from  ive no time to speak  uncle neds jist buried and jim crow comes on in three minutes  i had to pretend ye know cause it wouldnt do to let jim see i knowd yethat wos him on the stooli know wot brought ye herean ive fund out who she is  where dye stop  larrys surprise just permitted him to gasp out the words city hotel when a roar of laughter and applause met their ears followed by the tinkle of a small bell  bill sprang through the doorway and slammed the door in his old comrades face  it would be difficult to say looking at that face at that particular time whether the owner thereof was mad or drunkor bothso strangely did it wrinkle and contort as it gradually dawned upon its owner that bill jones true to his present profession was acting a part that he knew about the mystery of mademoiselle nelina was now acquainted with his larrys place of abode and would infallibly find him out after the concert was over  as these things crossed his mind larry smote his thigh so often and so vigorously that he ran the risk of being taken up for unwarrantably discharging his revolver in the streets and he whistled once or twice so significantly that at least five stray dogs answered to the call  at last he hitched up the band of his trousers and hastening round to the front door essayed to reenter the concertroom  pay here please cried the moneytaker in an extremely nasal tone as he passed the little hole in the wall  ive paid already answered larry  shew your check then  sure i dont know what that is  the doorkeeper smiled contemptuously and shut down with a bang the bar that kept off the public  larry doubled his fist and flushed crimson then he remembered the importance of the business he had on hand and quietly drew the requisite sum from his leather purse  come along said he to ned sinton on reentering the room  ive seed her an bill jones too  bill jones cried ned and the captain simultaneously  whist said larry dont be makin people obsarve us  come along home its all rightill tell ye all about it when were out  in another minute the three friends were in the street conversing eagerly and earnestly as they hastened to their quarters through the thronged and noisy streets of sacramento    chapter twenty six  deep plots and plansbill jones relates his misadventuresmademoiselle nelina consents to run off with larry oneila yankee musician outwittedthe escape  as larry had rightly anticipated bill jones made his appearance at the city hotel the moment the concert was over and found his old comrades waiting anxiously for him  it did not take long to tell him how they had discovered the existence of nelly morgan as we shall now call her but it took much longer to drag from bill the account of his career since they last met and the explanation of how he came to be placed in his present circumstances  ye see friends said he puffing at a pipe from which to look at him one would suppose he derived most of his information this is how it happened  when i set sail from the diggins to come here for grub i had a pleasant trip at first  but after a little things began to look bad the feller that steered us lost his reckoning an so we took two or three wrong turns by way o makin short cuts  thats always how it is  theres a proverb somewhere  in milton maybe or napiers book o logarithms suggested captain bunting  praps it wos and praps it wosnt retorted bill stuffing the end of his little finger if such a diminutive may be used in reference to any of his fingers into the bowl of his pipe  i raither think myself it wos in bells life or the royal almanac howsever thats wot it is  when yeve got a short road to go dont try to make it shorter say i  an when yeve got a long story to tell dont try to make it longer interrupted larry winking at his comrade through the smoke of his pipe  well as i wos sayin continued bill doggedly we didnt git on so well after a bit but somehow or other we got here at last and cast anchor in this very hotel  off i goes at once an buys a cart an a mule an then i sets to work to lay in provisions  now dye see lads twould ha bin better if i had bought the provisions first an the mule and the cart after for i had to pay ever so many dollars a day for their keep  at last i got it all square packed tight and tied up in the cartbarrels o flour and kegs o pork an beans an brandy an what not an away i went alone for dye see i carry a compass an when ive once made a voyage i never need to be told how to steer  but my troubles began soon  theres a ford across the river here which i was told id ha to cross and sure enough so i didbut its as bad as niagara if not worsean when i gits half way over we wos capsized and went down the river keel up  i dun know yet very well how i got ashore but i did somehow  and did the cart go for it inquired captain bunting aghast  no the cart didnt  she stranded halfamile further down on a rock where she lies to this hour with a wheel smashed and the bottom out and about three thousand tons o water swashin right through her every hour but all the provisions and the mule went slap down the sacramento an if they havent bin picked up on the way theyre cruisin off the port o san francisco by this time  the unfortunate seaman stopped at this point to relight his pipe while his comrades laughingly commented on his misadventure  ah ye may laugh but i can tell ye it warnt a thing to be laughed at an at this hour ive scarce one dollar to rub gainst another  never mind my boy said ned as he and the others laughed loud and long at the lugubrious visage of their comrade weve got welllined pockets i assure you and of course we have your share of the profits of our joint concern to hand over whenever you wish it  the expression of bill joness face was visibly improved by this piece of news and he went on with much greater animation  well my storys short now  i comed back here an by chance fell in with this fellerthis yankeeniggerwho offered me five dollars a day to haul up the curtain an do a lot o dirty work sich as bill stickin an lightin the candles an sweepin the floor but its hard work i tell ye to live on so little in sich a place as this where everythings so dear  youre not good at a bargain i fear remarked sinton but what of the little girl  well i wos comin to that  ye see i felt sure from some things i overheerd that she wasnt the mans daughter so one day i axed her who she wos an she said she didnt know except that her name was nelly morgan so it comed across me that morgan wos the name o the irish family you wos so thick with up at the diggins larry an i wos goin to ask if she knowd them when jollythats the name o the gitter up o the concertscatched me talkin an he took her away sharp and said hed thank me to leave the girl alone  ive been watchin to have another talk with her but jollys too sharp for me an i havent spoke to her yet  larry manifested much disappointment at this termination for he had been fully prepared to hear that the girl had made bill her confidant and would be ready to run away with him at a moments notice  however he consoled himself by saying that he would do the thing himself and after arranging that bill was to tell nelly that a friend of his knew where her sister was and would like to speak with her they all retired to rest at least to rest as well as they could in a house which like all the houses in california swarmed with rats  next night bill jones made a bold effort and succeeded in conveying larrys message to nelly very adroitly as he thought while she was standing close to him waiting for mr jolly to lead her to the footlights  the consequence was that the poor child trembled like a leaf when she attempted to sing and finally fainted on the stage to the consternation of a crowded house  the point was gained however nelly soon found an opportunity of talking in private with bill jones and appointed to meet larry in the street next morning early near the city hotel  it was with trembling eagerness mixed with timidity that she took the irishmans arm when they met and asked if he really knew where her sister was  oh how ive longed for her  but are you sure you know her  know her said larry with a smile  do i know meself  this argument was unanswerable so nelly made no reply and larry went on  yes avic i knowd her an faix i hope to know her better  but heres her picture for ye  larry then gave the earnest listener at his side a graphic description of her sister kates personal appearance and described her brother also but he did not at that time acquaint her with the death of the latter  he also spoke of black jim and described the circumstances of her being carried off  so ye see darlin said he i know all about ye an now i want ye to tell me what happened to ye after that  its a sad story said the child in a low tone as if her mind were recalling melancholy incidents in her career  then she told rapidly how she had been forsaken by those to whom she had been intrusted and left to perish in the mountain snow and how in her extremity god had sent help how another party of emigrants found her and carried her on how one by one they all died till she was left alone a second time and how a mexican horseman found her and carried her to his home and kept her there as his adopted daughter till he was killed while taming a wild horse  after that nellys story was a repetition of what larry had already overheard accidentally in the concertroom  now dear said larry we havent time to waste will ye go with me to san francisco  the tones of the rough mans voice rather than his words had completely won the confidence of the poor child so she said yes without hesitation  but how am i to escape from mr jolly she added he has begun to suspect mr jones i see quite well  lave that to me darlin an do you kape as much as ye can in the house the nixt day or two an be lookin out for what may turn up good day to ye mavourneen we must part here for fear were seen by any lynxeyed blackguards  kape up yer heart  nelly walked quickly away half laughing at and half perplexed by the ambiguity of her new friends parting advice  the four friends now set themselves to work to outwit mr jolly and rob him of mademoiselle nelina  at last they hit upon a device which did not indeed say much for the ingenuity of the party but which like many other bold plans succeeded admirably  a steamer was to start in three days for san franciscoone of those splendid new vessels which like floating palaces had suddenly made their appearance on these distant watershaving made the long and dangerous voyage from the united states round the horn  before the steamer started larry contrived to obtain another interview with nelly morgan and explained their plan which was as follows  on the day of the steamer sailing a few hours before the time of starting mr jolly was to receive the following letter dated from a wellknown ranche thirty miles up the river  siri trust that you will forgive a perfect stranger addressing you but the urgency of the case must be my excuse  there is a letter lying here for you which i have reason to know contains information of the utmost importance to yourself but whichowing to circumstances that i dare not explain in a letter that might chance to fall into wrong handsmust be opened here by your own hands  it will explain all when you arrive meanwhile as i am a perfect stranger to the state of your finances i send you a sufficient quantity of golddust by the bearer to enable you to hire a horse and come up  pray excuse the liberty i take and believe me to be  your obedient servant  edward sinton  at the appointed time larry delivered this epistle and the bag of gold into mr jollys hands and saying that no answer was required hurried away  if mr jolly had been suddenly informed that he had been appointed secretary of state to the king of ashantee he could not have looked more astonished than when he perused this letter and weighed the bag of gold in his hand  the letter itself had it arrived alone might very likely would have raised his suspicions but accompanied as it was by a bag of gold of considerable value it commended itself as a genuine document and the worthy musician was in the saddle halfanhour later before starting he cautioned nelly not to quit the house on any account whatever a caution which she heard but did not reply to  three hours later mr jolly reached his destination and had the following letter put into his hands  sirby the time you receive this your late charge mademoiselle nelina will be on her way to san francisco where you are welcome to follow her and claim her from her sister if you feel so disposed  i am sir etcetera  edward sinton  we need not repeat what mr jolly said or try to imagine what he felt on receipt of this letter  about the time it was put into his hands the magnificent steamer at the embarcadero gave a shrill whistle then it panted violently the paddles revolvedand our adventurers were soon steaming swiftly down the noble river on their way to san francisco    chapter twenty seven  san francisco againa terrible misfortunean old friend in surprisingly new circumstancesseveral remarkable discoveries and new lights  there is no time or place perhaps more suitable for indulging in ruminations cogitations and reminiscences than the quiet hours of a calm night out upon the sea when the watchful stars look down upon the bosom of the deep and twinkle at their reflections in placid brilliancy  late at night when all the noisy inmates of the steamer had ceased to eat and drink and laugh and had sought repose in their berths edward sinton walked the deck alone meditating on the past the present and the future  when he looked up at the serene heavens and down at the tranquil sea whose surface was unruffled save by the long pure white track of the vessel he could scarcely bring himself to believe that the whirl of incident and adventure in which he had been involved during the last few and short months was real  it seemed like a brilliant dream as long as he was on shore it all appeared real enough and the constant pressure of something to be done either immediately or in an hour or tomorrow kept his mind perpetually chained down to the consideration of visible and tangible and passing events but now the cord of connexion with land had been suddenly and completely severed the very land itself was out of sight  nothing around him tended to recall recent events and as he had nothing in the world to do but wait until the voyage should come to an end his mind was left free to bound over the recentpast into the region of the longpast and revel there at pleasure  but ned sinton was not altogether without anxieties  he felt a little uneasy as to the highhanded manner in which he had carried off nelly morgan from her late guardian and he was a good deal perplexed as to what the important affairs could be for which he had so hastily overturned all the golddigging plans of his whole party  with these thoughts mingled many philosophic inquiries as to the amount of advantage that layif indeed there was any advantage at allin making ones fortune suddenly and at the imminent hazard of ones life overpowering sleep at last put an end to neds wandering thoughts and he too bade the stars goodnight and sought his pillow  in due course the vessel cast anchor off the town of san francisco  there is many a slip tween the cup and the lip  it is an old proverb that but one which is proved by frequent use on the part of authors in all ages to be a salutary reminder to humanity  its truth was unpleasantly exemplified on the arrival of the steamer  as the tide was out at the time the captain ordered the boats to be lowered in order to land the passengers  the moment they touched the water they were filled by impatient miners who struggled to be first ashore  the boat into which ned and his friends got was soon overloaded with passengers and the captain ordered her to be shoved off  hold on shouted a big coarselooking fellow in a rough blue jacket and wideawake who was evidently drunk let me in first  theres no room cried several voices  shove off  theres room enough cried the man with an oath at the same time seizing the rope  if ye do come down said a sailor sternly ill pitch ye overboard  will ye growled the man and the next instant he sprang upon the edge of the boat which upset and left its freight struggling in the water the other boats immediately picked them all up and beyond a wetting they were physically none the worse  but alas the bags of gold which our adventurers were carrying ashore with them sank to the bottom of the sea  they were landed on the wharf at san francisco as penniless as they were on the day of their arrival in california  this reverse of fortune was too tremendous to be realised in a moment as they stood on the wharf dripping wet and gazing at each other in dismay they suddenly as if by one consent burst into a loud laugh but the laugh had a strong dash of bitterness in its tone and when it passed the expression of their countenances was not cheerful  bill jones was the first to speak as they wandered almost helplessly through the crowded streets while little nelly ever and anon looked wistfully up into larrys face as he led her by the hand  its a stunnin smash said bill fetching a deep sigh  but wen a things done an cant be undone then its unpossible thats wot it is and wots unpossible theres no use o tryin for to do  cause why it only wastes yer time an frets yer sperritthats my opinion  not one of the party ventured to smileas was their wont in happier circumstancesat the philosophy of their comrades remark  they wandered on in silence till they reachedthey scarce knew how or why the centre plaza of the town  its of no use giving way to it said ned sinton at last making a mighty effort to recover we must face our reverses like men and after all it might have been worse  we might have lost our lives as well as our gold so we ought to be thankful instead of depressed  what shall we do now inquired captain bunting in a tone that proved sufficiently that he at least could not benefit by neds advice  sure well have to go an work capting replied larry in a tone of facetious desperation but first of all well have to go an see mr thompson and git dry close for nelly poor thingare ye cowld darlin  no not in the least answered the child sadly  i think my things will dry soon if we walk in the sun  nellys voice seemed to rouse the energies of the party more effectually than neds moralising  yes cried the latter let us away to old thompsons  his daughter lizette will put you all to rights dear in a short time  come along  so saying ned led the way and the whole party speedily stood at the door of mr thompsons cottage  the door was merely fastened by a latch and as no notice was taken of their first knock ned lifted it and entered the hall then advancing to the parlour door he opened it and looked in  the sight that met his gaze was well calculated to make him open his eyes and his mouth too if that would in any way have relieved his feelings  seated in old mr thompsons easychair with one leg stretched upon an ottoman and the other reposing on a stool reclined tom collins looking perhaps a little paler than was his wont as if still suffering from the effects of recent illness but evidently quite happy and comfortable  beside tom on another stool with her arm resting on toms knee and looking up in his face with a quiet smile sat elizabeth thompson  tom  miss thompson cried ned sinton standing absolutely aghast  miss thompson sprang up with a face of crimson but tom sat coolly still and said while a broad grin overspread his handsome countenance no ned not miss thompsonmrs collins who i know is rejoiced to see you  you are jesting tom said ned as he advanced quickly and took the ladys hand while tom rose and heartily welcomed his old companions  not a bit of it my dear fellow he repeated  this i assure you is my wife  pray dear lizette corroborate my statement else our friends wont believe me  but sit down sit down and lets hear all about you go lizette get em something to eat  i knew you would make your appearance ere long  old thompsons letterhalloo why whats this youre wet and whos thisa wet little girl  faix ye may well be surprised mister tom said larry for were all wet beggars ivery wan o uswithout a dollar to bless ourselves with  tom collins looked perplexed as he turned from one to the other stay he shouted wife come here  theres a mystery going on  take this moist little one to your room and there he added throwing open a door you fellows will all find dry apparel to put onthough i dont say to fit  come along with me ned and while you change give an account of yourself  ned did as he was desired and in the course of a lengthened conversation detailed to tom the present condition of himself and his friends  its unfortunate said tom after a pause illluck seems to follow us wherever we go  you ought to be ashamed of yourself cried ned for saying so considering the wife you have got  true my boy replied the other i ought indeed to be ashamed but i spoke in reference to money matters  what say you to the fact that i am as much a beggar as yourself  outward appearances would seem to contradict you  nevertheless it is true i assure you  when you left me ned in the hotel at sacramento i became so lonely that i grew desperate and feeling much stronger in body i set off for this town in the new steamerthat in which you arrived  i came straight up here reintroduced myself to mr thompson and two days afterfor i count it folly to waste time in such matters when ones mind is made upi proposed to lizette and was accepted conditionally  of course the condition was that papa should be willing  but papa was not willing he said that three thousand dollars all i possessed was a capital sum but not sufficient to marry on and that he could not risk his daughters happiness etcetera etceterayou know the rest  well the very next day news came that one of thompsons best ships had been wrecked off cape horn  this was a terrible blow for the old mans affairs were in a rickety condition at any rate and this sank him altogether  his creditors were willing enough to wait but one rascal refused to do so and swore he would sequestrate him  i found that the sum due him was exactly three thousand dollars so i paid him the amount in full and handed thompson the discharged account  now said i im off to the diggings so goodbye for you see ned i felt that i could not urge my suit at that time as it would be like putting on the screwtaking an unfair advantage of him  why what do you mean my lad said he  that im off tomorrow replied i  that you must not do said he  why not said i  because said he now that things are going smooth i must go to england by the first ship that sails and get my affairs there put on a better footing so you must stay here to look after my business and tototake care of lizette  eh what said i what do you mean  you know that is impossible  not at all boy if you marry her  of course i could not refuse and so to cut it short we were married right off and here we are the representatives of the great firm of thompson and company of california  then do you mean to say that thompson is gone  inquired ned with a look of horror  near the horn i should think by this time but why so anxious  because sighed ned sitting down on the edge of the bed with a look of despair i came here by his invitation and  oh its all right interrupted tom i know all about it and am commissioned by him to settle the affair for you  but what is the affair inquired ned eagerly  ah my dear boy do try to exercise patience  if i tell you everything before we go down to our comrades i fear we shall have to send a message to say that we are not coming till tomorrow morning  tom rose as he spoke and led the way to the parlour where bread and cheese were spread out for them  the only drawback to my felicity whispered tom to sinton as they entered is that i find thompsons affairs far worse than he himself was aware of and its a fact that at this moment i can scarcely draw enough out of the business to supply the necessaries of life  there was a slight bitterness in toms tone as he said this but the next moment he was jesting with his old companions as lightheartedly as ever  during the meal he refused however to talk business and when it was concluded he proposed that they should go out for a stroll through the town  by the way remarked ned as they walked along what of captain buntings old ship  ay echoed the captain thats the uppermost thing in my mind but master tom seems determined to keep us in the dark  i do believe the roving bess has been burned an hes afraid to tell us  youre a desperately inquisitive set cried tom collins laughing could you not suppose that i wanted to give you a surprise by shewing you how curiously she has been surrounded by houses since you last saw her  youll think nothing of it now that i have told you  why where are ye goin cried larry as tom turned up a street that led a little away from the shore towards which they had been walking  tom made no reply but led on  they were now in that denselycrowded part of the town where shops were less numerous warehouses more plentiful and disagreeable odours more abundant than elsewhere  a dense mass of buildings lay between them and the sea and in the centre of these was a square or plaza on one side of which stood a large hotel out of the roof of which rose a gigantic flagstaff  a broad and magnificent flight of wooden steps led up to the door of this house of entertainment over which on a large board was written its namethe roving bess tavern  dear me thats a strange coincidence exclaimed the captain as his eye caught the name  tare an ages yelled larry av it isnt the owld ship  dont i know the mizzenmast as well as i know me right leg  the roving bess tavern muttered captain bunting while his eyes stared incredulously at the remarkable edifice before him  bill jones who up to this point had walked beside his comrades in silent meditation here lost presence of mind and putting both hands to his mouth sang out in true stentorian boatswain tones all hands ahoy tumble up theretumble up  ay ay sir roared halfadozen jack tars who chanced to be regaling themselves within and who rushed out hat in hand ready for a spree at the unexpected but wellknown summons  major whitlaw said tom collins springing up the steps and addressing a tall cadaverouslooking yankee allow me to introduce to you your landlord captain buntingyour tenant captain  i dare say you have almost forgotten each other  the captain held out his hand mechanically and gazed at his tenant unbelievingly while the major said  glad to see ye capn i guess  wanted to for a long time  couldnt come to terms with old thompson  wont you step in and take a cocktail or a ginsling  id like to have a private talkthis way  the landlord of the roving bess tavern led the captain to what was once his own cabin and begged him to be seated on his own locker at the head of his own table  he accepted these civilities staring round him in mute wonder all the time as if he thought it was a dream out of which he should wake in due course while from all parts of the tavern came sounds of mirth and clatter of knives and forks and dishes and odours of ginslings and bearsteaks and porkpies  jist sit there a minute said the yankee till i see to your friends bein fixed off comfortable of course mr collins may stay for he knows all about it  when he was gone the captain rose and looked into his old berth  it had been converted into a pantry so he shut the door quickly and returned to his seat  tom said he in a low whisper as if he feared to break the spell how did they get her up here  shes never been moved since you left her answered tom laughing the town has gradually surrounded her as you see and crept out upon the shore filling up the sea with rubbish till it has left her nearly a quarter of a mile inland  the captains eyes opened wider than ever but before he could find words again to speak major whitlaw returned  theyre all square now gentlemen so if you please well proceed to business  i suppose your friend has told you how the land lies  he certainly has replied the captain who accepted the phrase literally  wall i reckon your propertys riz since ye wor here now if you give me leave to make the alterations i want to ill give you 1000 dollars a month payable in advance  youd better tell captain bunting what the alterations you refer to are suggested tom collins who saw that the captains state of mind rendered him totally incapable of transacting business  thats soon done  ill give it ye slick off  i want to cut away the companionhatch and run up a regular stair to the deck then its advisable to cut away at least half o the main deck to heighten the gamin saloon  but i guess the main point is to knock out halfadozen windows in the hold for gaslight is plaguey dear when its goin full blast day and night  besides i must cut the entrancedoor down to the ground for this treemendous flight o stairsll be the ruin o the business  its only a week since a man was shot by a comrade here in the cabin an as they rushed out after him two customers fell down the stair and broke their arms  and i calclate the gentlemen thats overtaken by liquor every night wont stand it much longer  there isnt a single man that quits this house after 12 pm but goes down that flight headforemost  if you dont sanction that change i guess ill have to get em padded and spread featherbeds at the foot  now capn if you agrees to this right off ill give the sum named  captain buntings astonishment had now reached that point at which extremes are supposed to meet and a reaction began to take place  how much did you propose he inquired taking out a pencil and an old letter as if he were about to make notes at the same time knitting his brows and endeavouring to look intensely sagacious  one thousand dollars a month answered the yankee i railly cant stand more  let me see muttered the captain slowly in an under tone while he pressed his forehead with his forefinger one thousand dollars200 pounds sterlinghum equal to about 2400 pounds a year  well he added raising his voice i dont mind if i do  i suppose tom its not much below the thing as rents go  its a fair offer said tom carelessly we might perhaps get a higher but major whitlaw is in possession and is besides a good tenant  then ill conclude the bargainpray get pen ink and paper  while the major turned for a moment to procure writing materials the captain looked at tom and winked expressively  then a document was drawn up signed and witnessed and then the captain politely declining a brandysmash or any other smash whatever left the roving bess tavern with his friends and with 200 poundsthe first months rentin his pocket  it is needless to remark that his comrades congratulated him heartily and that the worthy captain walked along the streets of san francisco chuckling  in a few minutes tom collins stopped before a row of immense warehouses  there was one gap in the row a space of several yards square that might have held two goodsized houses  four wooden posts stood at the corners of the plot and an old boat turned keel up lay in the middle of it  i know it cried ned sinton laughing in gleeful surprise its my old boat isnt it  well i can scarcely credit my eyes  i saw it last on the seashore and now its a quarter of a mile into the town  more than that ned said tom collins the plot of ground is worth ten thousand dollars at this moment  had it been a little further south it would have been worth ten times that sum  and more than that still the irish family you lent the boat toyou remember themwell they dug up a bag from under the boat which contained five thousand dollars the honest people at once gave it up and mr thompson rewarded them well but they did not live to enjoy it long theyre all dead now so you see ned youre just 3000 pounds richer than you thought you were this morning  its a great day remarked larry oneil looking round upon his comrades who received all this information with an expression of doubting surprise a great day intirely  faix im only hopin we wont waken up an find its all a dhrame  larrys companions quite agreed with him  they did not indeed say so but as they returned home after that stroll talking eagerly of future plans and prospects the everrecurring sentiment broke from their lips in every style of phrase its a great day intirely    chapter twenty eight  more unexpected discoveriescaptain bunting makes bill jones a first matelarry oneil makes himself a first matethe partingned sinton proves himself a second time to be a friend in need and in deed  it never rains but it pours saith the proverb  we are fond of proverbs  we confess to a weakness that way  there is a depth of meaning in them which courts investigation from the strongest intellects  even when they are nonsensical which is not unfrequently the case their nonsense is unfathomable and therefore invested with all the zest which attaches metaphysically speaking to the incomprehensible  astonishing circumstances had been raining for some time past around our bewildered adventurers and latterly they had begun to pour  on the afternoon of the day the events of which have been recorded in the last chapter there was metaphorically speaking a regular thunderplump no sooner had the party returned to old mr thompsons cottage than down it came again heavy as ever  on entering the porch lizette ran up to tom in that pretty tripping style peculiar to herself and whispered in his ear  well you baggage said he ill go with you but i dont like secrets  walk into the parlour friends ill be with you in a minute  tom said lizette pursing up her little mouth and elevating her pert nose you cant guess what an interesting discovery ive made  of course i cant replied tom with affected impatience now pray dont ask me to try else i shall leave you instantly  what an impatient creature you are said lizette  only think  i have discovered that my maid whom we hired only two days ago has  bolted with the black cook or somebody else and married him interrupted tom with a look of horror as he threw himself into any easychair  not at all rejoined lizette hurriedly nothing of the sort she has discovered that the little girl mr sinton brought with him is her sister  what  kate morgans sister cried tom with a look of surprise  i knew it i was sure i had heard the name before but i couldnt remember when or where i see it now she must be the girl larry oneil used to talk about up at the diggins but as i never saw her there of course i couldnt know her  well i dont know about that i suppose youre right replied lizette but isnt it nice  theyre kissing and hugging each other and crying in the kitchen at this moment  oh  im so happythe dear little thing  if lizette was happy she took a strange way to shew it for she sat down beside tom and began to sob  while the above conversation was going on upstairs another conversationinteresting enough to deserve special noticewas going on in the parlour  sure dont i know me own feelins best remarked larry addressing ned sinton  its all very well at the diggins but when it comes to drawinrooms and parlours i feelsan so does bill jones herethat were out o place  in the matter o diggin were all equals no doubt but we feels that we aint gintlemen born and that its akard to the lady to be havin sich rough customers at her table so bill an me has agreed to make the most o ourselves in the kitchen  larry youre talking nonsense  we have messed together on equal terms for many months and whatever course we may follow after this you must sup with us tonight as usual  i know tom will be angry if you dont  ay sir but it aint as oosual suggested bill jones turning the quid in his cheek its quite onoosual for the likes o us to sup with a lady  thats it chimed in larry so mister ned yell jist plaise to make our excuges to mrs tom and tell her where weve gone to locate as the yankees say  come away bill  larry took his friend by the arm and leading him out of the room shut the door  five seconds after that there came an appalling female shriek and a dreadful masculine yell from the region of the kitchen accompanied by a subdued squeak of such extreme sweetness that it could have come only from the throat of mademoiselle nelina  ned and the captain sprang to the door and dashed violently against tom and his wife whom they unexpectedly met also rushing towards the kitchen  in another moment a curious and deeply interesting tableau vivant was revealed to their astonished gaze  in the middle of the room was larry oneil down on one knee while with both arms he supported the fainting form of kate morgan  by kates side knelt her sister nelly who bent over her pale face with anxious tearful countenance while presiding over the group like an amiable ogre stood bill jones with his hands in his breechespockets his legs apart one eye tightly screwed up and his mouth expanded from ear to ear  thats yer sort cried bill in ecstatic glee  wen a thing comes all right an tight an shipshape why wot then  in coorse its all squarethats wot i say  shes comin to whispered larry  ah thin spake wont ye darlin  itll do ye good maybe an help to open yer two purty eyes  kate morgan recoveredwe need scarcely tell our reader thatand nelly dried her eyes and that evening was spent in a fashion that conduced to the wellbeing and comfort and good humour of all parties concerned perhaps it is also needless to inform our reader that larry oneil and bill jones carried their point  they supped in the kitchen that night our informant does not say whether kate morgan and her sister nelly supped with thembut we rather think they did  a week afterwards captain bunting had matured his future plans  he resolved to purchase a clipperbrig that was lying at that time useless in the harbour and embark in the coasting trade of california  he made bill jones his first mate and offered to make larry oneil his second but larry wanted a mate himself and declined the honour so the captain gave him five hundred pounds to set him up in any line he chose  ned sinton sold his property and also presented his old comrade with a goodly sum of money saying that as he ned had been the means of dragging him away from the diggings he felt bound to assist him in the hour of need  so kate morgan became mrs oneil the week following and she with her husband and her little sister started off for the interior of the country to look after a farm  about the same time captain bunting having completed the lading of his brig succeeded in manning her by offering a high wage and bidding adieu to ned and tom set sail for the sacramento  two days afterwards ned got a letter from old mr shirleythe first that he had received since leaving england  it began thus  my dearest boywhat has become of you  i have written six letters at least but have never got a single line in reply  you must come home immediately as affairs here require your assistance and im getting too old to attend to business matters  do come at once my dear ned unless you wish me to reprove you  moxton says only a young and vigorous man of business can manage things properly but when i mentioned you he shook his head gravely  too wild and absurd in his notions said he  i stopped him however by saying that i was fully aware of your faults  the letter then went rambling on in a quaint prosy but interesting style and ned sat long in his room in old mr thompsons cottage poring over its contents and gradually maturing his future plans  its awkward soliloquised he resting his head on both hands  i shall have to go at once and so wont have a chance of seeing bunting again to tell him of poor toms circumstances  he would only be too glad to give him a helping hand but i know tom will never let him know how hardup he is  theres nothing else for it he added determinedly my uncle will laugh at my profitless tourbut nimporte i have learned muchcome in  this last remark was addressed to some one who had tapped gently at the door  its only me ned can i come in  i fear i interrupt you said tom as he entered the room  not at all sit down my boy  i have just been perusing a letter from my good old uncle shirley he writes so urgently that i fear i must return to england by the first homewardbound ship  return to england exclaimed tom in surprise  what leave the goldfields just as the sun is beginning to shine on you  even so tom  my dear ned you are mad  this is a splendid country  just see what fortunes we should have made but for the unfortunate accidents that have happened  tom sighed as he spoke  i know it replied his friend with sadden energy  this is a splendid country gold exists all over itnot only in the streams but on the hillsides and even on hilltops as you and i know from personal experiencebut gold tom is not everything in this world and the getting of it should not be our chief aim  moreover i have come to the conclusion that digging gold ought to be left entirely to such men as are accustomed to dig ditches and throw up railway embankments  men whose intelligence is of a higher order ought not to ignore the faculties that have been given to them and devote their timetoo often alas their livesto a species of work that the merest savage is equally capable of performing  navvies may work at the mines with propriety but educated men who devote themselves to such work are i fear among the number of those to whom scripture specially speaks when it says make not haste to be rich  but there are other occupations here besides digging for gold said tom  i know it and i would be happy and proud to rank among the merchants and engineers and such men of california but duty calls me home and to say truth added ned with a smile inclination points the way  tom collins still for some time attempted to dissuade his friend from quitting the country and his sweet little wife lizette seconded his efforts with much earnestness but ned sinton was immovable  he took passage in the first ship that sailed for england  the night before he sailed ned after retiring to his room for the last time in his friends house locked his door and went through a variety of little pieces of business that would have surprised his hosts had they seen him  he placed a large strongbox on the table and cautiously drew from under his bed a carpetbag which from the effort made to lift it seemed to be filled with some weighty substance unlocking the bag he proceeded to lift out handful after handful of shining dollars and gold pieces interspersed here and there with massive nuggets  these he transferred into the wooden box until it was full  this was nearly the whole of neds fortune  it amounted to a little more than 3000 pounds sterling  having completed the transfer ned counted the surplus left in the bag and found it to be about 500 pounds  this he secured in a leather purse and then sat down to write a letter  the letter was short when finished but it took him long to write for he meditated much during the writing of it and several times laid his head on his hands  at last it was completed put into the box and the lid screwed down above it  then ned read a chapter in the bible as was his wont and retired to rest  next day tom and lizette stood on the wharf to see him embark for england  long and earnest was the converse of the two friends as they were about to part probably for ever and then for the first time they became aware how deep was the attachment which each had formed for the other  at last the mate of the ship came up and touched his hat  now sir boats ready sir and we dont wish to lose the first of the ebb  goodbye lizettegoodbye tom  god be with and bless you my dear fellow  stay i had almost forgotten  tom you will find a box on the table in my room you can keep the contentsa letter in it will explain  farewell  toms heart was too full to speak  he squeezed his friends hand in silence and turning hurriedly round walked away with lizette the instant the boat left the shore  late in the evening tom and his wife remembered the box and went upstairs to open it  their surprise at its rich contents may be imagined  both at once understood its meaning and lizette sat down and covered her face with her hands to hide the tears that flowed while her husband read the letter  it ran thus  my dearest tomyou must not be angry with me for leaving this trifleit is a trifle compared with the amount of gold i would give you if i had it  but i need not apologise the spirit of love in which it is given demands that it shall be unhesitatingly received in the same spirit  may god who has blessed us and protected us in all our wanderings together cause your worldly affairs to prosper and especially may he bless your soul  seas and continents may separate us but i shall never forget you tom or your dear wife  but i must not write as if i were saying farewell  i intend this epistle to be the opening of a correspondence that shall continue as long as we live  you shall hear from me again ere long  your sincerelyattached friend  edward sinton  at the time tom collins was reading the above letter to lizette in a broken husky voice our hero was seated on the taffrail of the ship that bore him swiftly over the sea gazing wistfully at the receding shore and bidding a final adieu to california and all his golden dreams    chapter twenty nine  our story comes to an end  home  what a host of old and deep and heartstirring associations arise in every human breast at the sound of that old familiar word  how well we know ithow vividly it recalls certain scenes and faceshow pleasantly it falls on the ear and slips from the tongueyet how little do we appreciate home until we have left it and longed for it perhaps for many years  our hero ned sinton is home at last  he sits in his old place beside the fire with his feet on the fender  opposite to him sits old mr shirley with a bland smile on his kind wrinkled visage and two pair of spectacles on his brow  mr shirley as we formerly stated regularly loses one pair of spectacles and always searches for them in vain in consequence of his having pushed them too far up on his bald head he therefore is frequently compelled to put on his second pair and hence makes a spectacle to some extent of himself  exactly between the uncle and the nephew on a low stool sits the catthe cat par excellencemr shirleys cat a creature which he has always been passionately fond of since it was a kitten and to which after neds departure for california he had devoted himself so tenderly that he felt halfashamed of himself and would not like to have been asked how much he loved it  yes the cat sits there looking neither at old mr shirley nor at young mr sinton but bestowing its undivided attentions and affections on the fire which it enjoys extremely if we may judge from the placid manner in which it winks and purrs  ned has been a week at home and he has just reached that point of experience at which the wild life of the diggings through which he has passed begins to seem like a vivid dream rather than reality  breakfast had just been concluded although the cloth had not yet been removed  do you know uncle remarked ned settling his bulky frame more comfortably in the easychair and twirling his watchkey i find it more difficult every day to believe that the events of the last few months of my life have actually occurred  when i sit here in my old seat and look at you and the cat and the furnitureeverything in fact just the same as when i lefti cannot realise that i have been nearly two years away  i understand your feelings my dear boy replied mr shirley taking off his spectacles the lower pair wiping them with his handkerchief putting them on again and looking over them at his nephew with an expression of unmitigated admiration  i can sympathise with you ned for i have gone through the same experience more than once in the course of my life  its a strange life boy a very strange life this as youll come to know if youre spared to be as old as i am  ned thought that his knowledge was already pretty extended in reference to life and even flattered himself that he had had some stranger views of it than his uncle but he prudently did not give expression to his thoughts and after a short pause mr shirley resumed  yes lad its a very strange life and the strangest part of it is that the longer we live the stranger it gets  i travelled once in switzerland the old gentleman paused as if to allow the statement to have its full weight on neds youthful mind and its a curious fact that when i had been some months there home and all connected with it became like a dream to me and switzerland became a reality but after i came back to england and had spent some time here home again became the reality and switzerland appeared like a dream so that i sometimes said to myself can it be possible that i have been there very odd isnt it  it is uncle and i have very much the same feelings now  very odd indeed repeated mr shirley  by the way that reminds me that we have to talk about that farm of which i spoke to you on the day of your arrival  we might feel surprised that the above conversation could in any way have the remotest connexion with that farm of which mr shirley was so suddenly reminded did we not know that the subject was in fact never out of his mind  true uncle i had almost forgotten about it but you know ive been so much engaged during the last few days in visiting my old friends and college companions that  i know it i know it ned and i dont want to bother you with business matters sooner than i can help but  my dear uncle how can you for a moment suppose that i could be bothered by  of course not boy interrupted mr shirley  well now let me ask you ned how much gold have you brought back from the diggings  ned fidgeted uncomfortably on his seatthe subject could no longer be avoided  iimust confess said he with hesitation that i havent brought much  of course you couldnt be expected to have done much in so short a time but how much  only 500 pounds replied ned with a sigh while a slight blush shone through the deep bronze of his countenance  oh said mr shirley pursing up his mouth while an arch twinkle lurked in the corners of each eye  ah but uncle you mustnt quiz me  i had more and might have brought it home too if i had chosen  then why didnt you  ned replied to this question by detailing how most of his money had been lost and how at the last he gave nearly all that remained to his friend tom collins  you did quite right ned quite right said mr shirley when his nephew had concluded and now ill tell you what i want you to do  you told me the other day i think that you wished to become a farmer  yes uncle  i do think that that life would suit me better than any other  im fond of the country and a quiet life and i dont like cities but then i know nothing about farming and i doubt whether i should succeed without being educated to it to some extent at least  a very modest and proper feeling to entertain said mr shirley with a smile particularly when it is considered that farming is an exceedingly difficult profession to acquire a knowledge of  but i have thought of that for you ned and i think i see a way out of the difficulty  what way is that  i wont tell you just yet boy  but answer me this  are you willing to take any farm i suggest to you and henceforth to give up all notion of wandering over the face of the earth and devote yourself steadily to your new profession  i am uncle if you will point out to me how i am to pay the rent and stock the farm and how i am to carry it on in the meantime without a knowledge of husbandry  ill do that for you all in good time meanwhile will you put on your hat and run down to moxtons officeyou remember it  that i do replied ned with a smile  well go there and ask him for the papers i wrote about to him two days ago  bring them here as quickly as you can  we shall then take the train and run down to brixley and look at the farm  but are you really in earnest asked ned in some surprise  never more so in my life replied the old gentleman mildly  now be off i want to read the paper  ned rose and left the room scarcely believing that his uncle did not jest  as he shut the door old mr shirley took up the paper pulled down the upper pair of spectaclesan act which knocked the lower pair off his nose whereat he smiled more blandly than everand began to read  meanwhile edward sinton put on his greatcoatthe identical one he used to wear before he went awayand his hat and his gloves and walked out into the crowded streets of london with feelings somewhat akin probably to those of a somnambulist  having been so long accustomed to the freeandeasy costume of the mines ned felt about as uncomfortable and stiff as a warrior of old must have felt when armed capapie his stalwart frame was some what thinner and harder than when he last took the same walk his fair moustache and whiskers were somewhat more decided and less like wreaths of smoke and his countenance was of a deepbrown colour but in other respects ned was the same dashing fellow that he used to bedashing by nature we may remark not by affectation  in halfanhour he stood before moxtons door  there it was as large as life and as green as ever  ned really found it impossible to believe that it was so long since he last saw it  he felt as if it had been yesterday  the brass knocker and the brass plate were there too as dirty as everperhaps a thought dirtierand the dirty house still retreated a little behind its fellows and was still as much ashamed of itselfseeminglyas ever  ned raised the knocker and smote the brass knob  the result was as formerly a disagreeablelooking old woman who replied to the question is mr moxton in with a sharp short yes  the dingy little office with its insufficient allowance of daylight and its compensating mixture of yellow gas was inhabited by the same identical small dishevelled clerk who nearly two years before was busily employed in writing his name interminably on scraps of paper and who now as then answered to the question can i see mr moxton by pointing to the door which opened into the inner apartment and resuming his occupationthe same occupationwriting his name on scraps of paper  ned tappedas of yore  come in cried a stern voiceas of ditto  ned entered and there sure enough was the same tall gaunt man with the sour cast of countenance standing as formerly with his back to the fire  ah exclaimed moxton youre young sinton i suppose  ned almost started at the perfect reproduction of events and questions and answers  he felt a species of reckless incredulity in reference to everything steal over him as he replied  yes i came at my uncles request for some papers that  ah yes theyre all ready interrupted the lawyer advancing to the table  tell your uncle that i shall be glad to hear from him again in reference to the subject of those papers and take care of themthey are of value  goodmorning  goodmorning replied our hero retreating  stay said moxton  ned stopped and turned round  youve been in california since i last saw you i understand  i have replied ned  umph  you havent made your fortune i fancy  no not quite  its a wild place if all reports are true  rather replied ned smiling theres a want of law there  ha and lawyers remarked moxton sarcastically  indeed there is replied ned with some enthusiasm as he thought of the goldhunting spirit that prevailed in the cities of california there is great need out there of men of learningmen who can resist the temptation to collect gold and are capable of doing good to the colony in an intellectual and spiritual point of view  clergymen doctors and lawyers are much wanted there  youd find it worth your while to go sir  had edward sinton advised mr moxton to go and rent an office in the moon he could scarcely have surprised that staid gentleman more than he did by this suggestion  the lawyer gazed at him for one moment in amazement  then he said  these papers are of value young man be careful of them goodmorning and sat down at his desk to write  ned did not venture to reply but instantly retired and found himself in the street with not as formerly an indistinct buta distinct impression that he had heard the dishevelled clerk chuckling vociferously as he passed through the office  that afternoon ned and old mr shirley alighted from the train at a small village not a hundred miles out of london and wended their way leisurelyfor it was a warm sunny day for the seasontowards a large quaint old farmhouse about two miles distant from the station  what a very pleasantlooking house that is on the hilltop remarked ned as he gave his arm to his uncle  dyou think so  well im glad of it because thats the farm i wish you to take  indeed exclaimed ned in surprise  surely the farm connected with such a house must be a large one  so it is replied the other  ned laughed  my dear uncle said he how can i manage such a place without means or knowledge  i said before boy that i would overcome both these difficulties for you  you did dear uncle and if you were a rich man i could understand how you might overcome the first but you have often told me you had no money in the world except the rent of a small property  right ned i said so and i say it again  i shant leave you a sixpence when i die and i cant afford to give you one while i am alive  then i must just leave the matter in your own hands replied ned smiling for i cannot comprehend your plans  they had now reached the gate of the park that surrounded the fine old building of brixley hall  the house was one of those rambling picturesque old mansions which although not very large in reality have a certain air of magnitude and even grandeur about them  the windows were modern and large so that the rooms were well lighted and the view in all directions was magnificent  wherever the eye turned it met knolls and mounds and fields and picturesque groves with here and there a substantial farmsteading or a little hamlet with its modest churchspire pointing ever upwards to the bright sky  cattle and sheep lowed and bleated in the meadows while gentle murmurs told that a rivulet flowed along its placid course at no great distance  the spot was simply enchantingand ned said so in the fulness of his heart emphatically  tis a sweet spot remarked his uncle in a low sad tone as he entered the open door of the dwelling and walked deliberately into the drawingroom  now ned sit downhere opposite that window where you can see the viewand ill tell you how we shall manage  you tell me you have 500 pounds  yes uncle  well your dear mother left you her fortune when she diedit amounts to the small sum of 200 pounds  i never told you of it before my boy for reasons of my own  that makes 700 pounds  will that suffice to stock and carry on so large a farm inquired ned  not quite replied mr shirley but the farm is partly stocked already so itll do  now ive made arrangements with the proprietor to let you have it for the first year or two rent free  his last tenants lease happens to have expired six months ago and he is anxious to have it let immediately  ned opened his eyes very wide at this  he says continued the old gentleman that if you cant manage to make the two ends meet in the course of a year or two he will extend the gratis lease  ned began to think his uncle had gone deranged  why what do you mean said he who is this extraordinary proprietor  hes an eccentric old fellow ned who lives in londonthey call him shirley i believe  yourself uncle cried ned starting up  dear reader the conversation that followed was so abrupt exclamatory interjectional and occasionally ungrammatical as well as absurd that it could not be reduced to writing  we therefore leave it to your imagination  after a time the uncle and nephew subsided and again became sane  but said ned i shall have to get a stewardis that what you call him or overseer to manage affairs until i am able to do it myself  true ned but i have provided one already  indeedbut i might have guessed that  what shall i have to pay him a good round sum i suppose  no replied mr shirley he is very moderate in his expectations  he only expects his food and lodging besides a little care and attention and love particularly in his old age  he must be a cautious fellow to look so far forward said ned laughing  whats his name  his nameis shirley  what yourself again  and why not nephew  ive as much right to count myself fit to superintend a farm as you had a year ago to think yourself able to manage a gold mine  nay i have a better rightfor i was a farmer the greater part of my life before i went to reside in london  now boy as i went to live in the great citywhich i dont likein order to give you a good education i expect that youll take me to the countrywhich i do liketo be your overseer  i was born and bred here ned this was my fathers property and when i am gone it shall be yours  it is not much to boast of  you wont be able to spend an idle life of it here for although a goodly place it must be carefully tended if you would make it pay  i dont need to tell you replied ned that i have no desire to lead an idle life  but uncle i think your terms are very high  how so boy  love is a very high price to pay for service replied ned  your kindness and your generosity in this matter make me very happy and very grateful and perhaps might make me very obedient and extremely attentive but i cannot give you love at any price  i must refuse you as an overseer but if you will come to me as old uncle shirley  well well ned interrupted the old gentleman with a benign smile well not dispute about that  let us now go and take a run round the grounds    it is needless dear reader to prolong our story  perchance we have taxed your patience too much alreadybut we cannot close without a word or two regarding the subsequent life of those whose fortunes we have followed so long  ned sinton and old mr shirley applied themselves with diligence and enthusiasm to the cultivation of their farm and to the cultivation of the friendship and goodwill of their neighbours all round  in both efforts they were eminently successful  ned made many interesting discoveries during his residence at brixley hall chief among which was a certain louisa leslie with whom he fell desperately in loveso desperately that his case was deemed hopeless louisa therefore took pity on him and became mrs sinton to the unutterable delight of old mr shirleyand the cat both of whom benefited considerably by this addition to the household  about the time this event occurred ned received a letter from tom collins desiring him to purchase a farm for him as near to his own as possible  tom had been successful as a merchant and had made a large fortuneas was often the case in those daysin the course of a year or two  at first indeed he had had a hard struggle and was more than once nearly driven by desperation to the gamingtable but neds advice and warnings came back upon him again and againso he fought against the temptation manfully and came off victorious  improved trade soon removed the temptationperhaps we should say that his heavenly father took that means to remove itand at last as we have said he made a fortune as many had done in like circumstances before him  ned bought a farm three miles from his own and in the course of a few months tom and he were once more walking together arm in arm recalling other days andarguing  lizette and louisa drew together like two magnets the instant they met but the best of it was tom had brought home larry oneil as his butler and mrs kate oneil as his cook while nelly became his wifes maid  larry it seems had not taken kindly to farming in california the more so that he pitched unluckily on an unproductive piece of land which speedily swallowed up his little fortune and refused to yield any return  larry therefore like some men who thought themselves much wiser fellows pronounced the country a wretched one in reference to agriculture and returned to san francisco where he found tom collins prospering and ready to employ himself and his family  as butler to an english squire larry oneil was according to his own statement a continted man  may he long remain so  nelly morgan soon became out of sight the sweetest girl in the countryside and ere long one of the best young fellows in the district carried her off triumphantly and placed her at the head of affairs in his own cottage  we say he was one of the best young fellowsthis husband of nellysbut he was by no means the handsomest many a handsome strapping youth there failed to obtain so good a wife as nelly  her husband was a steady hard working thriving good manand quite goodlooking enough for herso nelly said  as for captain bunting and bill jones they stuck to each other to the last like two limpets and both of them stuck to the sea like fish  no shoregoing felicities could tempt these hardy sons of neptune to forsake their native element again  he had done it once bill jones said in one o the splendidest countries goin where gold was to be had for the pickin up and all sorts o agues and rheumatizes for nothin but wen things didnt somehow go all square an the anchor got foul with a gale o adwerse circumstances springin up astarn why wot thengo to sea again of coorse an stick to it them wos his sentiments  as these were also captain buntings sentiments they naturally took to the same boat for life  but although captain bunting and bill did not live on shore they occasionally at long intervals condescended to revisit
