96124101	the surgeons daughter  chronicles of the canongate  sic itur ad astra     introduction1831  the tale of the surgeons daughter formed part of the second series of chronicles of the canongate published in 1827 but has been separated from the stories of the highland widow c which it originally accompanied and deferred to the close of this collection for reasons which printers and publishers will understand and which would hardly interest the general reader  the author has nothing to say now in reference to this little novel but that the principal incident on which it turns was narrated to him one morning at breakfast by his worthy friend mr train of castle douglas in galloway whose kind assistance he has so often had occasion to acknowledge in the course of these prefaces and that the military friend who is alluded to as having furnished him with some information as to eastern matters was colonel james ferguson of huntly burn one of the sons of the venerable historian and philosopher of that namewhich name he took the liberty of concealing under its gaelic form of macerries  abbotsford september 1831                                       appendix to introduction  mr train was requested by sir walter scott to give him in writing the story as nearly as possible in the shape in which he had told it but the following narrative which he drew up accordingly did not reach abbotsford until july 1832  in the old stock of fife there was not perhaps an individual whose exertions were followed by consequences of such a remarkable nature as those of davie duff popularly called the thane of fife who from a very humble parentage rose to fill one of the chairs of the magistracy of his native burgh by industry and economy in early life he obtained the means of erecting solely on his own account one of those ingenious manufactories for which fifeshire is justly celebrated from the day on which the industrious artisan first took his seat at the council board he attended so much to the interests of the little privileged community that civic honours were conferred on him as rapidly as the set of the royalty footnote the constitution of the borough could legally admit  to have the right of walking to church on holydays preceded by a phalanx of halberdiers in habiliments fashioned as in former times seems in the eyes of many a guild brother to be a very enviable pitch of worldly grandeur few persons were ever more proud of civic honours than the thane of fife but he knew well how to turn his political influence to the best account the council court and other business of the burgh occupied much of his time which caused him to intrust the management of his manufactory to a near relation whose name was d a young man of dissolute habits but the thane seeing at last that by continuing that extravagant person in that charge his affairs would in all probability fall into a state of bankruptcy applied to the member of parliament for that district to obtain a situation for his relation in the civil department of the state the knight whom it is here unnecessary to name knowing how effectually the thane ruled the little burgh applied in the proper quarter and actually obtained an appointment for d in the civil service of the east india company  a respectable surgeon whose residence was in a neighbouring village had a beautiful daughter named emma who had long been courted by d immediately before his departure to india as a mark of mutual affection they exchanged miniatures taken by an eminent artist in fife and each set in a locket for the purpose of having the object of affection always in view  the eyes of the old thane were now turned towards hindostan with much anxiety but his relation had not long arrived in that distant quarter of the globe before he had the satisfaction of receiving a letter conveying the welcome intelligence of his having taken possession of his new station in a large frontier town of the companys dominions and that great emoluments were attached to the situation which was confirmed by several subsequent communications of the most gratifying description to the old thane who took great pleasure in spreading the news of the reformed habits and singular good fortune of his intended heir none of all his former acquaintances heard with such joy the favourable report of the successful adventurer in the east as did the fair and accomplished daughter of the village surgeon but his previous character caused her to keep her own correspondence with him secret from her parents to whom even the circumstance of her being acquainted with d was wholly unknown till her father received a letter from him in which he assured him of his attachment to emma long before his departure from fife that having been so happy as to gain her affections he would have made her his wife before leaving his native country had he then had the means of supporting her in a suitable rank through life and that having it now in his power to do so he only waited the consent of her parents to fulfil the vow he had formerly made  the doctor having a large family with a very limited income to support them and understanding that d had at last become a person of sober and industrious habits he gave his consent in which emmas mother fully concurred  aware of the straitened circumstances of the doctor d remitted a sum of money to complete at edinburgh emmas oriental education and fit her out in her journey to india she was to embark at sheerness on board one of the companys ships for a port in india at which place he said he would wait her arrival with a retinue suited to a person of his rank in society  emma set out from her fathers house just in time to secure a passage as proposed by her intended husband accompanied by her only brother who on their arrival at sheerness met one c an old schoolfellow captain of the ship by which emma was to proceed to india  it was the particular desire of the doctor that his daughter should be committed to the care of that gentleman from the time of her leaving the shores of britain till the intended marriage ceremony was duly performed on her arrival in india a charge that was frankly undertaken by the generous seacaptain  on the arrival of the fleet at the appointed port d with a large cavalcade of mounted pindarees was as expected in attendance ready to salute emma on landing and to carry her direct into the interior of the country c who had made several voyages to the shores of hindostan knowing something of hindoo manners and customs was surprised to see a private individual in the companys service with so many attendants and when d declined having the marriage ceremony performed according to the rites of the church till he returned to the place of his abode c more and more confirmed in his suspicion that all was not right resolved not to part with emma till he had fulfilled in the most satisfactory manner the promise he had made before leaving england of giving her duly away in marriage not being able by her entreaties to alter the resolution of d emma solicited her protector c to accompany her to the place of her intended destination to which he most readily agreed taking with him as many of his crew as he deemed sufficient to ensure the safe custody of his innocent protege should any attempt be made to carry her away by force  both parties journeyed onwards till they arrived at a frontier town where a native rajah was waiting the arrival of the fair maid of fife with whom he had fallen deeply in love from seeing her miniature likeness in the possession of d to whom he had paid a large sum of money for the original and had only intrusted him to convey her in state to the seat of his government  no sooner was this villanous action of d known to c than he communicated the whole particulars to the commanding officer of a regiment of scotch highlanders that happened to be quartered in that part of india begging at the same time for the honour of caledonia and protection of injured innocence that he would use the means in his power of resisting any attempt that might be made by the native chief to wrest from their hands the virtuous female who had been so shamefully decoyed from her native country by the worst of mankind honour occupies too large a space in the heart of the gael to resist such a call of humanity  the rajah finding his claim was not to be acceded to and resolving to enforce the same assembled his troops and attacked with great fury the place where the affrighted emma was for a time secured by her countrymen who fought in her defence with all their native valour which at length so overpowered their assailants that they were forced to retire in every direction leaving behind many of their slain among whom was found the mangled corpse of the perfidious d  c was immediately afterwards married to emma and my informant assured me he saw them many years afterwards living happily together in the county of kent on the fortune bequeathed by the thane of fife    j t   castle douglas july 1832       mr croftangrys preface     indite my muse indite     subpoenad is thy lyre   the praises to requite     which rules of court require                probationary odes  the concluding a literary undertaking in whole or in part is to the inexperienced at least attended with an irritating titillation like that which attends on the healing of a wounda prurient impatience in short to know what the world in general and friends in particular will say to our labours some authors i am told profess an oysterlike indifference upon this subject for my own part i hardly believe in their sincerity others may acquire it from habit but in my poor opinion a neophyte like myself must be for a long time incapable of such sang froid  frankly i was ashamed to feel how childishly i felt on the occasion no person could have said prettier things than myself upon the importance of stoicism concerning the opinion of others when their applause or censure refers to literary character only and i had determined to lay my work before the public with the same unconcern with which the ostrich lays her eggs in the sand giving herself no farther trouble concerning the incubation but leaving to the atmosphere to bring forth the young or otherwise as the climate shall serve but though an ostrich in theory i became in practice a poor hen who has no sooner made her deposit but she runs cackling about to call the attention of every one to the wonderful work which she has performed  as soon as i became possessed of my first volume neatly stitched up and boarded my sense of the necessity of communicating with some one became ungovernable janet was inexorable and seemed already to have tired of my literary confidence for whenever i drew near the subject after evading it as long as she could she made under some pretext or other a bodily retreat to the kitchen or the cockloft her own peculiar and inviolate domains my publisher would have been a natural resource but he understands his business too well and follows it too closely to desire to enter into literary discussions wisely considering that he who has to sell books has seldom leisure to read them then my acquaintance now that i have lost mrs bethune baliol are of that distant and accidental kind to whom i had not face enough to communicate the nature of my uneasiness and who probably would only have laughed at me had i made any attempt to interest them in my labours  reduced thus to a sort of despair i thought of my friend and man of business mr fairscribe his habits it was true were not likely to render him indulgent to light literature and indeed i had more than once noticed his daughters and especially my little songstress whip into her reticule what looked very like a circulating library volume as soon as her father entered the room still he was not only my assured but almost my only friend and i had little doubt that he would take an interest in the volume for the sake of the author which the work itself might fail to inspire i sent him therefore the book carefully sealed up with an intimation that i requested the favour of his opinion upon the contents of which i affected to talk in the depreciatory style which calls for pointblank contradiction if your correspondent possess a grain of civility  this communication took place on a monday and i daily expected what i was ashamed to anticipate by volunteering my presence however sure of a welcome an invitation to eat an egg as was my friends favourite phrase or a card to drink tea with misses fairscribe or a provocation to breakfast at least with my hospitable friend and benefactor and to talk over the contents of my enclosure but the hours and days passed on from monday till saturday and i had no acknowledgment whatever that my packet had reached its destination this is very unlike my good friends punctuality thought i and having again and again vexed james my male attendant by a close examination concerning the time place and delivery i had only to strain my imagination to conceive reasons for my friends silence sometimes i thought that his opinion of the work had proved so unfavourable that he was averse to hurt my feelings by communicating itsometimes that escaping his hands to whom it was destined it had found its way into his writingchamber and was become the subject of criticism to his smart clerks and conceited apprentices sdeath thought i if i were sure of this i would  and what would you do said reason after a few moments reflection you are ambitious of introducing your book into every writing and readingchamber in edinburgh and yet you take fire at the thoughts of its being criticised by mr fairscribes young people be a little consistentfor shame  i will be consistent said i doggedly but for all that i will call on mr fairscribe this evening  i hastened my dinner donnd my greatcoat for the evening threatened rain and went to mr fairscribes house the old domestic opened the door cautiously and before i asked the question said mr fairscribe is at home sir but it is sunday night recognising however my face and voice he opened the door wider admitted me and conducted me to the parlour where i found mr fairscribe and the rest of his family engaged in listening to a sermon by the late mr walker of edinburgh footnote robert walker the colleague and rival of dr hugh blair in st giless church edinburgh which was read by miss catherine with unusual distinctness simplicity and judgment welcomed as a friend of the house i had nothing for it but to take my seat quietly and making a virtue of necessity endeavour to derive my share of the benefit arising from an excellent sermon but i am afraid mr walkers force of logic and precision of expression were somewhat lost upon me i was sensible i had chosen an improper time to disturb mr fairscribe and when the discourse was ended i rose to take my leave somewhat hastily i believe a cup of tea mr croftangry said the young lady you will wait and take part of a presbyterian supper said mr fairscribenine oclocki make it a point of keeping my fathers hours on sunday at een perhaps drnaming an excellent clergyman may look in  i made my apology for declining his invitation and i fancy my unexpected appearance and hasty retreat had rather surprised my friend since instead of accompanying me to the door he conducted me into his own apartment  what is the matter he said mr croftangry this is not a night for secular business but if any thing sudden or extraordinary has happened  nothing in the world said i forcing myself upon confession as the best way of clearing myself out of the scrapeonlyonly i sent you a little parcel and as you are so regular in acknowledging letters and communications ii thought it might have miscarriedthats all  my friend laughed heartily as if he saw into and enjoyed my motives and my confusion safeit came safe enough he said the wind of the world always blows its vanities into haven but this is the end of the session when i have little time to read any thing printed except innerhouse papers yet if you will take your kail with us next saturday i will glance over your work though i am sure i am no competent judge of such matters  with this promise i was fain to take my leave not without half persuading myself that if once the phlegmatic lawyer began my lucubrations he would not be able to rise from them till he had finished the perusal nor to endure an interval betwixt his reading the last page and requesting an interview with the author  no such marks of impatience displayed themselves time blunt or keen as my friend joanna says swift or leisurely held his course and on the appointed saturday i was at the door precisely as it struck four the dinner hour indeed was five punctually but what did i know but my friend might want half an hours conversation with me before that time i was ushered into an empty drawingroom and from a needlebook and workbasket hastily abandoned i had some reason to think i interrupted my little friend miss katie in some domestic labour more praiseworthy than elegant in this critical age filial piety must hide herself in a closet if she has a mind to darn her fathers linen  shortly after i was the more fully convinced that i had been too early an intruder when a wench came to fetch away the basket and recommend to my courtesies a red and green gentleman in a cage who answered all my advances by croaking out youre a foolyoure a fool i tell you until upon my word i began to think the creature was in the right at last my friend arrived a little overheated he had been taking a turn at golf to prepare him for colloquy sublime and wherefore not since the game with its variety of odds lengths bunkers teed balls and so on may be no inadequate representation of the hazards attending literary pursuits in particular those formidable buffets which make one ball spin through the air like a rifleshot and strike another down into the very earth it is placed upon by the maladroitness or the malicious purpose of the playerwhat are they but parallels to the favourable or depreciating notices of the reviewers who play at golf with the publications of the season even as altisidora in her approach to the gates of the infernal regions saw the devils playing at racket with the new books of cervantes days  well every hour has its end five oclock came and my friend with his daughters and his handsome young son who though fairly buckled to the desk is every now and then looking over his shoulder at a smart uniform set seriously about satisfying the corporeal wants of nature i stimulated by a nobler appetite after fame wished that the touch of a magic wand could without all the ceremony of picking and choosing carving and slicing masticating and swallowing have transported a quantum sufficit of the good things on my friends hospitable board into the stomachs of those who surrounded it to be there at leisure converted into chyle while their thoughts were turned on higher matters at length all was over but the young ladies sat still and talked of the music of the freischutz for nothing else was then thought of so we discussed the wild hunters song and the tame hunters song c c in all which my young friends were quite at home luckily for me all this horning and hooping drew on some allusion to the seventh hussars which gallant regiment i observe is a more favourite theme with both miss catherine and her brother than with my old friend who presently looked at his watch and said something significantly to mr james about office hours the youth got up with the ease of a youngster that would be thought a man of fashion rather than of business and endeavoured with some success to walk out of the room as if the locomotion was entirely voluntary miss catherine and her sisters left us at the same time and now thought i my trial comes on  reader did you ever in the course of your life cheat the courts of justice and lawyers by agreeing to refer a dubious and important question to the decision of a mutual friend if so you may have remarked the relative change which the arbiter undergoes in your estimation when raised though by your own free choice from an ordinary acquaintance whose opinions were of as little consequence to you as yours to him into a superior personage on whose decision your fate must depend pro tanto as my friend mr fairscribe would say his looks assume a mysterious if not a minatory expression his hat has a loftier air and his wig if he wears one a more formidable buckle  i felt accordingly that my good friend fairscribe on the present occasion had acquired something of a similar increase of consequence but a week since he had in my opinion been indeed an excellentmeaning man perfectly competent to every thing within his own profession but immured at the same time among its forms and technicalities and as incapable of judging of matters of taste as any mighty goth whatsoever of or belonging to the ancient senatehouse of scotland but what of that i had made him my judge by my own election and i have often observed that an idea of declining such a reference on account of his own consciousness of incompetency is as it perhaps ought to be the last which occurs to the referee himself he that has a literary work subjected to his judgment by the author immediately throws his mind into a critical attitude though the subject be one which he never before thought of no doubt the author is well qualified to select his own judge and why should the arbiter whom he has chosen doubt his own talents for condemnation or acquittal since he has been doubtless picked out by his friend from his indubitable reliance on their competence surely the man who wrote the production is likely to know the person best qualified to judge of it  whilst these thoughts crossed my brain i kept my eyes fixed on my good friend whose motions appeared unusually tardy to me while he ordered a bottle of particular claret decanted it with scrupulous accuracy with his own hand caused his old domestic to bring a saucer of olives and chips of toasted bread and thus on hospitable thoughts intent seemed to me to adjourn the discussion which i longed to bring on yet feared to precipitate  he is dissatisfied thought i and is ashamed to show it afraid doubtless of hurting my feelings what had i to do to talk to him about any thing save charters and sasinesstay he is going to begin  we are old fellows now mr croftangry said my landlord scarcely so fit to take a poor quart of claret between us as we would have been in better days to take a pint in the old scottish liberal acceptation of the phrase maybe you would have liked me to have kept james to help us but if it is not a holyday or so i think it is best he should observe office hours  here the discourse was about to fall i relieved it by saying mr james was at the happy time of life when he had better things to do than to sit over the bottle i suppose said i your son is a reader  umyesjames may be called a reader in a sense but i doubt there is little solid in his studiespoetry and plays mr croftangry all nonsensethey set his head agadding after the army when he should be minding his business  i suppose then that romances do not find much more grace in your eyes than dramatic and poetical compositions  deil a bit deil a bit mr croftangry nor historical productions either there is too much fighting in history as if men only were brought into this world to send one another out of it it nourishes false notions of our being and chief and proper end mr croftangry  still all this was general and i became determined to bring our discourse to a focus i am afraid then i have done very ill to trouble you with my idle manuscripts mr fairscribe but you must do me the justice to remember that i had nothing better to do than to amuse myself by writing the sheets i put into your hands the other day i may truly plead    i left no calling for this idle trade  i cry your mercy mr croftangry said my old friend suddenly recollectingyes yes i have been very rude but i had forgotten entirely that you had taken a spell yourself at that idle mans trade  i suppose replied i you on your side have been too busy a man to look at my poor chronicles  no no said my friend i am not so bad as that neither i have read them bit by bit just as i could get a moments time and i believe i shall very soon get through them  well my good friend said i interrogatively  and well mr croftangry cried he i really think you have got over the ground very tolerably well i have noted down here two or three bits of things which i presume to be errors of the press otherwise it might be alleged perhaps that you did not fully pay that attention to the grammatical rules which one would desire to see rigidly observed  i looked at my friends notes which in fact showed that in one or two grossly obvious passages i had left uncorrected such solecisms in grammar  well well i own my fault but setting apart these casual errors how do you like the matter and the manner of what i have been writing mr fairscribe  why said my friend pausing with more grave and important hesitation than i thanked him for there is not much to be said against the manner the style is terse and intelligible mr croftangry very intelligible and that i consider as the first point in every thing that is intended to be understood there are indeed here and there some flights and fancies which i comprehended with difficulty but i got to your meaning at last there are people that are like ponies their judgments cannot go fast but they go sure  that is a pretty clear proposition my friend but then how did you like the meaning when you did get at it or was that like some ponies too difficult to catch and when caught not worth the trouble  i am far from saying that my dear sir in respect it would be downright uncivil but since you ask my opinion i wish you could have thought about something more appertaining to civil policy than all this bloody work about shooting and dirking and downright hanging i am told it was the germans who first brought in such a practice of choosing their heroes out of the porteous roll footnote list of criminal indictments so termed in scotland but by my faith we are like to be upsides with them the first was as i am credibly informed mr scolar as they call him a scholarlike piece of work he has made of it with his robbers and thieves  schiller said i my dear sir let it be schiller  schiller or what you like said mr fairscribe i found the book where i wish i had found a better one and that is in kates workbasket i sat down and like an old fool began to read but there i grant you have the better of schiller mr croftangry  i should be glad my dear sir that you really think i have approached that admirable author even your friendly partiality ought not to talk of my having excelled him  but i do say you have excelled him mr croftangry in a most material particular for surely a book of amusement should be something that one can take up and lay down at pleasure and i can say justly i was never at the least loss to put aside these sheets of yours when business came in the way but faith this schiller sir does not let you off so easily i forgot one appointment on particular business and i wilfully broke through another that i might stay at home and finish his confounded book which after all is about two brothers the greatest rascals i ever heard of the one sir goes near to murder his own father and the other which you would think still stranger sets about to debauch his own wife  i find then mr fairscribe that you have no taste for the romance of real lifeno pleasure in contemplating those spiritrousing impulses which force men of fiery passions upon great crimes and great virtues  why as to that i am not just so sure but then to mend the matter continued the critic you have brought in highlanders into every story as if you were going back again velis et remis into the old days of jacobitism i must speak my plain mind mr croftangry i cannot tell what innovations in kirk and state may now be proposed but our fathers were friends to both as they were settled at the glorious revolution and liked a tartan plaid as little as they did a white surplice i wish to heaven all this tartan fever bode well to the protestant succession and the kirk of scotland  both too well settled i hope in the minds of the subject said i to be affected by old remembrances on which we look back as on the portraits of our ancestors without recollecting while we gaze on them any of the feuds by which the originals were animated while alive but most happy should i be to light upon any topic to supply the place of the highlands mr fairscribe i have been just reflecting that the theme is becoming a little exhausted and your experience may perhaps supply  ha ha hamy experience supply interrupted mr fairscribe with a laugh of derisionwhy you might as well ask my son jamess experience to supply a case about thirlage no no my good friend i have lived by the law and in the law all my life and when you seek the impulses that make soldiers desert and shoot their sergeants and corporals and highland drovers dirk english graziers to prove themselves men of fiery passions it is not to a man like me you should come i could tell you some tricks of my own trade perhaps and a queer story or two of estates that have been lost and recovered but to tell you the truth i think you might do with your muse of fiction as you call her as many an honest man does with his own sons in flesh and blood  and how is that my dear sir  send her to india to be sure that is the true place for a scot to thrive in and if you carry your story fifty years back as there is nothing to hinder you you will find as much shooting and stabbing there as ever was in the wild highlands if you want rogues as they are so much in fashion with you you have that gallant caste of adventurers who laid down their consciences at the cape of good hope as they went out to india and forgot to take them up again when they returned then for great exploits you have in the old history of india before europeans were numerous there the most wonderful deeds done by the least possible means that perhaps the annals of the world can afford  i know it said i kindling at the ideas his speech inspired i remember in the delightful pages of orme the interest which mingles in his narratives from the very small number of english which are engaged each officer of a regiment becomes known to you by name nay the noncommissioned officers and privates acquire an individual share of interest they are distinguished among the natives like the spaniards among the mexicans what do i say they are like homers demigods among the warring mortals men like clive and caillaud influenced great events like jove himself inferior officers are like mars or neptune and the sergeants and corporals might well pass for demigods then the various religious costumes habits and manners of the people of hindustanthe patient hindhu the warlike rajahpoot the haughty moslemah the savage and vindictive malayglorious and unbounded subjects the only objection is that i have never been there and know nothing at all about them  nonsense my good friend you will tell us about them all the better that you know nothing of what you are saying and come well finish the bottle and when katie her sisters go to the assembly has given us tea she will tell you the outline of the story of poor menie gray whose picture you will see in the drawingroom a distant relation of my fathers who had however a handsome part of cousin menies succession there are none living that can be hurt by the story now though it was thought best to smother it up at the time as indeed even the whispers about it led poor cousin menie to live very retired i mind her well when a child there was something very gentle but rather tiresome about poor cousin menie  when we came into the drawingroom my friend pointed to a picture which i had before noticed without however its having attracted more than a passing look now i regarded it with more attention it was one of those portraits of the middle of the eighteenth century in which artists endeavoured to conquer the stiffness of hoops and brocades by throwing a fancy drapery around the figure with loose folds like a mantle or dressing gown the stays however being retained and the bosom displayed in a manner which shows that our mothers like their daughters were as liberal of their charms as the nature of the dress might permit to this the wellknown style of the period the features and form of the individual added at first sight little interest it represented a handsome woman of about thirty her hair wound simply about her head her features regular and her complexion fair but on looking more closely especially after having had a hint that the original had been the heroine of a tale i could observe a melancholy sweetness in the countenance that seemed to speak of woes endured and injuries sustained with that resignation which women can and do sometimes display under the insults and ingratitude of those on whom they have bestowed their affections  yes she was an excellent and an illused woman said mr fairscribe his eye fixed like mine on the pictureshe left our family not less i dare say than five thousand pounds and i believe she died worth four times that sum but it was divided among the nearest of kin which was all fair  but her history mr fairscribe said ito judge from her look it must have been a melancholy one  you may say that mr croftangry melancholy enough and extraordinary enough toobut added he swallowing in haste a cup of the tea which was presented to him i must away to my businesswe cannot be gowfling all the morning and telling old stories all the afternoon katie knows all the outs and the ins of cousin menies adventures as well as i do and when she has given you the particulars then i am at your service to condescend more articulately upon dates or particulars  well here was i a gay old bachelor left to hear a love tale from my young friend katie fairscribe who when she is not surrounded by a bevy of gallants at which time to my thinking she shows less to advantage is as pretty wellbehaved and unaffected a girl as you see tripping the new walks of princes street or heriot row old bachelorship so decided as mine has its privileges in such a teteatete providing you are or can seem for the time perfectly goodhumoured and attentive and do not ape the manners of your younger years in attempting which you will only make yourself ridiculous i dont pretend to be so indifferent to the company of a pretty young woman as was desired by the poet who wished to sit beside his mistress    as unconcernd as when     her infant beauty could beget   nor happiness nor pain  on the contrary i can look on beauty and innocence as something of which i know and esteem the value without the desire or hope to make them my own a young lady can afford to talk with an old stager like me without either artifice or affectation and we may maintain a species of friendship the more tender perhaps because we are of different sexes yet with which that distinction has very little to do  now i hear my wisest and most critical neighbour remark mr croftangry is in the way of doing a foolish thing he is well to passold fairscribe knows to a penny what he is worth and miss katie with all her airs may like the old brass that buys the new pan i thought mr croftangry was looking very cadgy when he came in to play a rubber with us last night poor gentleman i am sure i should be sorry to see him make a fool of himself  spare your compassion dear madam there is not the least danger the beaux yeux de ma casette are not brilliant enough to make amends for the spectacles which must supply the dimness of my own i am a little deaf too as you know to your sorrow when we are partners and if i could get a nymph to marry me with all these imperfections who the deuce would marry janet mcevoy and from janet mcevoy chrystal croftangry will not part  miss katie fairscribe gave me the tale of menie gray with much taste and simplicity not attempting to suppress the feelings whether of grief or resentment which justly and naturally arose from the circumstances of the tale her father afterwards confirmed the principal outlines of the story and furnished me with some additional circumstances which miss katie had suppressed or forgotten indeed i have learned on this occasion what old lintot meant when he told pope that he used to propitiate the critics of importance when he had a work in the press by now and then letting them see a sheet of the blotted proof or a few leaves of the original manuscript our mystery of authorship has something about it so fascinating that if you admit any one however little he may previously have been disposed to such studies into your confidence you will find that he considers himself as a party interested and if success follows will think himself entitled to no inconsiderable share of the praise  the reader has seen that no one could have been naturally less interested than was my excellent friend fairscribe in my lucubrations when i first consulted him on the subject but since he has contributed a subject to the work he has become a most zealous coadjutor and halfashamed i believe yet halfproud of the literary stockcompany in which he has got a share he never meets me without jogging my elbow and dropping some mysterious hints as i am sayingwhen will you give us any more of yonor yons not a bad narrativei like yon  pray heaven the reader may be of his opinion     the surgeons daughter   chapter the first     when fainting nature calld for aid     and hovering death prepared the blow   his vigorous remedy displayd     the power of art without the show   in miserys darkest caverns known     his useful care was ever nigh   where hopeless anguish pourd his groan     and lonely want retired to die   no summons mockd by cold delay     no petty gains disclaimd by pride   the modest wants of every day     the toil of every day supplied                            samuel johnson  the exquisitely beautiful portrait which the rambler has painted of his friend levett well describes gideon gray and many other village doctors from whom scotland reaps more benefit and to whom she is perhaps more ungrateful than to any other class of men excepting her schoolmasters  such a rural man of medicine is usually the inhabitant of some pretty borough or village which forms the central point of his practice but besides attending to such cases as the village may afford he is day and night at the service of every one who may command his assistance within a circle of forty miles in diameter untraversed by roads in many directions and including moors mountains rivers and lakes for late and dangerous journeys through an inaccessible country for services of the most essential kind rendered at the expense or risk at least of his own health and life the scottish village doctor receives at best a very moderate recompense often one which is totally inadequate and very frequently none whatever he has none of the ample resources proper to the brothers of the profession in an english town the burgesses of a scottish borough are rendered by their limited means of luxury inaccessible to gout surfeits and all the comfortable chronic diseases which are attendant on wealth and indolence four years or so of abstemiousness enable them to stand an election dinner and there is no hope of broken heads among a score or two of quiet electors who settle the business over a table there the mothers of the state never make a point of pouring in the course of every revolving year a certain quantity of doctors stuff through the bowels of their beloved children every old woman from the townhead to the townfit can prescribe a dose of salts or spread a plaster and it is only when a fever or a palsy renders matters serious that the assistance of the doctor is invoked by his neighbours in the borough  but still the man of science cannot complain of inactivity or want of practice if he does not find patients at his door he seeks them through a wide circle like the ghostly lover of burgers leonora he mounts at midnight and traverses in darkness paths which to those less accustomed to them seem formidable in daylight through straits where the slightest aberration would plunge him into a morass or throw him over a precipice on to cabins which his horse might ride over without knowing they lay in his way unless he happened to fall through the roofs when he arrives at such a stately termination of his journey where his services are required either to bring a wretch into the world or prevent one from leaving it the scene of misery is often such that far from touching the hardsaved shillings which are gratefully offered to him he bestows his medicines as well as his attendancefor charity i have heard the celebrated traveller mungo park who had experienced both courses of life rather give the preference to travelling as a discoverer in africa than to wandering by night and day the wilds of his native land in the capacity of a country medical practitioner he mentioned having once upon a time rode forty miles sat up all night and successfully assisted a woman under influence of the primitive curse for which his sole remuneration was a roasted potato and a draught of buttermilk but his was not the heart which grudged the labour that relieved human misery in short there is no creature in scotland that works harder and is more poorly requited than the country doctor unless perhaps it may be his horse yet the horse is and indeed must be hardy active and indefatigable in spite of a rough coat and indifferent condition and so you will often find in his master under an unpromising and blunt exterior professional skill and enthusiasm intelligence humanity courage and science  mr gideon gray surgeon in the village of middlemas situated in one of the midland counties of scotland led the rough active and illrewarded course of life which we have endeavoured to describe he was a man between forty and fifty devoted to his profession and of such reputation in the medical world that he had been more than once as opportunities occurred advised to exchange middlemas and its meagre circle of practice for some of the larger towns in scotland or for edinburgh itself this advice he had always declined he was a plain blunt man who did not love restraint and was unwilling to subject himself to that which was exacted in polite society he had not himself found out nor had any friend hinted to him that a slight touch of the cynic in manner and habits gives the physician to the common eye an air of authority which greatly tends to enlarge his reputation mr gray or as the country people called him doctor gray he might hold the title by diploma for what i know though he only claimed the rank of master of arts had few wants and these were amply supplied by a professional income which generally approached two hundred pounds a year for which upon an average he travelled about five thousand miles on horseback in the course of the twelve months nay so liberally did this revenue support himself and his ponies called pestle and mortar which he exercised alternately that he took a damsel to share it jean watson namely the cherrycheeked daughter of an honest farmer who being herself one of twelve children who had been brought up on an income of fourscore pounds a year never thought there could be poverty in more than double the sum and looked on gray though now termed by irreverent youth the old doctor as a very advantageous match for several years they had no children and it seemed as if doctor gray who had so often assisted the efforts of the goddess lucina was never to invoke her in his own behalf yet his domestic roof was on a remarkable occasion decreed to be the scene where the goddesss art was required  late of an autumn evening three old women might be observed plying their aged limbs through the single street of the village at middlemas towards the honoured door which fenced off from the vulgar causeway was defended by a broken paling enclosing two slips of ground half arable half overrun with an abortive attempt at shrubbery the door itself was blazoned with the name of gideon gray m a surgeon c c some of the idle young fellows who had been a minute or two before loitering at the other end of the street before the door of the alehouse for the pretended inn deserved no better name now accompanied the old dames with shouts of laughter excited by their unwonted agility and with bets on the winner as loudly expressed as if they had been laid at the starting post of middlemas races half a mutchkin on luckie simsonauld peg tamson against the fieldmair speed alison jaup yell tak the wind out of them yetcanny against the hill lasses or we may have a burstern auld earline amang ye these and a thousand such gibes rent the air without being noticed or even heard by the anxious racers whose object of contention seemed to be which should first reach the doctors door  guide us doctor what can be the matter now said mrs gray whose character was that of a goodnatured simpleton heres peg tamson jean simson and alison jaup running a race on the hie street of the burgh  the doctor who had but the moment before hung his wet greatcoat before the fire for he was just dismounted from a long journey hastened down stairs arguing some new occasion for his services and happy that from the character of the messengers it was likely to be within burgh and not landward  he had just reached the door as luckie simson one of the racers arrived in the little area before it she had got the start and kept it but at the expense for the time of her power of utterance for when she came in presence of the doctor she stood blowing like a grampus her loose toy flying back from her face making the most violent effort to speak but without the power of uttering a single intelligible word peg thompson whipped in before her  the leddy sir the leddy  instant help instant helpscreeched rather than uttered alison jaup while luckie simson who had certainly won the race found words to claim the prize which had set them all in motion  and i hope sir you will recommend me to be the sicknurse i was here to bring you the tidings lang before ony o thae lazy queans  loud were the counterprotestations of the two competitors and loud the laugh of the idle loons who listened at a little distance  hold your tongue ye flyting fools said the doctor and you ye idle rascals if i come out among you so saying he smacked his longlashed whip with great emphasis producing much the effect of the celebrated quos ego of neptune in the first aeneidand now said the doctor where or who is this lady  the question was scarce necessary for a plain carriage with four horses came at a foots pace towards the door of the doctors house and the old women now more at their ease gave the doctor to understand that the gentleman thought the accommodation of the swan inn totally unfit for his ladys rank and condition and had by their advice each claiming the merit of the suggestion brought her here to experience the hospitality of the west rooma spare apartment in which doctor gray occasionally accommodated such patients as he desired to keep for a space of time under his own eye  there were two persons only in the vehicle the one a gentleman in a riding dress sprung out and having received from the doctor an assurance that the lady would receive tolerable accommodation in his house he lent assistance to his companion to leave the carriage and with great apparent satisfaction saw her safely deposited in a decent sleeping apartment and under the respectable charge of the doctor and his lady who assured him once more of every species of attention to bind their promise more firmly the stranger slipped a purse of twenty guineas for this story chanced in the golden age into the hand of the doctor as an earnest of the most liberal recompense and requested he would spare no expense in providing all that was necessary or desirable for a person in the ladys condition and for the helpless being to whom she might immediately be expected to give birth he then said he would retire to the inn where he begged a message might instantly acquaint him with the expected change in the ladys situation  she is of rank he said and a foreigner let no expense be spared we designed to have reached edinburgh but were forced to turn off the road by an accident once more he said let no expense be spared and manage that she may travel as soon as possible  that said the doctor is past my control nature must not be hurried and she avenges herself of every attempt to do so  but art said the stranger can do much and he proffered a second purse which seemed as heavy as the first  art said the doctor may be recompensed but cannot be purchased you have already paid me more than enough to take the utmost care i can of your lady should i accept more money it could only be for promising by implication at least what is beyond my power to perform every possible care shall be taken of your lady and that affords the best chance of her being speedily able to travel now go you to the inn sir for i may be instantly wanted and we have not yet provided either an attendant for the lady or a nurse for the child but both shall be presently done  yet a moment doctorwhat languages do you understand  latin and french i can speak indifferently and so as to be understood and i read a little italian  but no portuguese or spanish continued the stranger  no sir  that is unlucky but you may make her understand you by means of french take notice you are to comply with her request in everythingif you want means to do so you may apply to me  may i ask sir by what name the lady is to be  it is totally indifferent said the stranger interrupting the question you shall know it at more leisure  so saying he threw his ample cloak about him turning himself half round to assist the operation with an air which the doctor would have found it difficult to imitate and walked down the street to the little inn here he paid and dismissed the postilions and shut himself up in an apartment ordering no one to be admitted till the doctor should call  the doctor when he returned to his patients apartment found his wife in great surprise which as is usual with persons of her character was not unmixed with fear and anxiety  she cannot speak a word like a christian being said mrs gray  i know it said the doctor  but she threeps to keep on a black fauseface and skirls if we offer to take it away  well then let her wear itwhat harm will it do  harm doctor was ever honest woman brought to bed with a fauseface on  seldom perhaps but jean my dear those who are not quite honest must be brought to bed all the same as those who are and we are not to endanger the poor things life by contradicting her whims at present  approaching the sick womans bed he observed that she indeed wore a thin silk mask of the kind which do such uncommon service in the elder comedy such as women of rank still wore in travelling but certainly never in the situation of this poor lady it would seem she had sustained importunity on the subject for when she saw the doctor she put her hand to her face as if she was afraid he would insist on pulling off the vizard  he hastened to say in tolerable french that her will should be a law to them in every respect and that she was at perfect liberty to wear the mask till it was her pleasure to lay it aside she understood him for she replied by a very imperfect attempt in the same language to express her gratitude for the permission as she seemed to regard it of retaining her disguise  the doctor proceeded to other arrangements and for the satisfaction of those readers who may love minute information we record that luckie simson the first in the race carried as a prize the situation of sicknurse beside the delicate patient that peg thomson was permitted the privilege of recommending her gooddaughter bet jamieson to be wetnurse and an oe or grandchild of luckie jaup was hired to assist in the increased drudgery of the family the doctor thus like a practised minister dividing among his trusty adherents such good things as fortune placed at his disposal  about one in the morning the doctor made his appearance at the swan inn and acquainted the stranger gentleman that he wished him joy of being the father of a healthy boy and that the mother was in the usual phrase as well as could be expected  the stranger heard the news with seeming satisfaction and then exclaimed he must be christened doctor he must be christened instantly  there can be no hurry for that said the doctor  we think otherwise said the stranger cutting his argument short i am a catholic doctor and as i may be obliged to leave this place before the lady is able to travel i desire to see my child received into the pale of the church there is i understand a catholic priest in this wretched place  there is a catholic gentleman sir mr goodriche who is reported to be in orders  i commend your caution doctor said the stranger it is dangerous to be too positive on any subject i will bring that same mr goodriche to your house tomorrow  gray hesitated for a moment i am a presbyterian protestant sir he said a friend to the constitution as established in church and state as i have a good right having drawn his majestys pay god bless him for four years as surgeons mate in the cameronian regiment as my regimental bible and commission can testify but although i be bound especially to abhor all trafficking or trinketing with papists yet i will not stand in the way of a tender conscience sir you may call with mr goodriche when you please at my house and undoubtedly you being as i suppose the father of the child you will arrange matters as you please only i do not desire to be though an abettor or countenancer of any part of the popish ritual  enough sir said the stranger haughtily we understand each other  the next day he appeared at the doctors house with mr goodriche and two persons understood to belong to that reverend gentlemans communion the party were shut up in an apartment with the infant and it may be presumed that the solemnity of baptism was administered to the unconscious being thus strangely launched upon the world when the priest and witnesses had retired the strange gentleman informed mr gray that as the lady had been pronounced unfit for travelling for several days he was himself about to leave the neighbourhood but would return thither in the space of ten days when he hoped to find his companion able to leave it  and by what name are we to call the child and mother  the infants name is richard  but it must have some sirnameso must the ladyshe cannot reside in my house yet be without a name  call them by the name of your town heremiddlemas i think it is  yes sir  well mrs middlemas is the name of the mother and richard middlemas of the childand i am matthew middlemas at your service this he continued will provide mrs middlemas in every thing she may wish to possessor assist her in case of accidents with that he placed l100 in mr grays hand who rather scrupled receiving it saying he supposed the lady was qualified to be her own pursebearer  the worst in the world i assure you doctor replied the stranger if she wished to change that piece of paper she would scarce know how many guineas she should receive for it no mr gray i assure you you will find mrs middletonmiddlemaswhat did i call heras ignorant of the affairs of this world as any one you have met with in your practice so you will please to be her treasurer and administrator for the time as for a patient that is incapable to look after her own affairs  this was spoke as it struck dr gray in rather a haughty and supercilious manner the words intimated nothing in themselves more than the same desire of preserving incognito which might be gathered from all the rest of the strangers conduct but the manner seemed to say i am not a person to be questioned by any onewhat i say must be received without comment how little soever you may believe or understand it it strengthened gray in his opinion that he had before him a case either of seduction or of private marriage betwixt persons of the very highest rank and the whole bearing both of the lady and the gentleman confirmed his suspicions it was not in his nature to be troublesome or inquisitive but he could not fail to see that the lady wore no marriagering and her deep sorrow and perpetual tremor seemed to indicate an unhappy creature who had lost the protection of parents without acquiring a legitimate right to that of a husband he was therefore somewhat anxious when mr middlemas after a private conference of some length with the lady bade him farewell it is true he assured him of his return within ten days being the very shortest space which gray could be prevailed upon to assign for any prospect of the lady being moved with safety  i trust in heaven that he will return said gray to himself but there is too much mystery about all this for the matter being a plain and wellmeaning transaction if he intends to treat this poor thing as many a poor girl has been used before i hope that my house will not be the scene in which he chooses to desert her the leaving the money has somewhat a suspicious aspect and looks as if my friend were in the act of making some compromise with his conscience welli must hope the best meantime my path plainly is to do what i can for the poor ladys benefit  mr gray visited his patient shortly after mr middlemass departureas soon indeed as he could be admitted he found her in violent agitation grays experience dictated the best mode of relief and tranquillity he caused her infant to be brought to her she wept over it for a long time and the violence of her agitation subsided under the influence of parental feelings which from her appearance of extreme youth she must have experienced for the first time  the observant physician could after this paroxysm remark that his patients mind was chiefly occupied in computing the passage of the time and anticipating the period when the return of her husbandif husband he wasmight be expected she consulted almanacks enquired concerning distances though so cautiously as to make it evident she desired to give no indication of the direction of her companions journey and repeatedly compared her watch with those of others exercising it was evident all that delusive species of mental arithmetic by which mortals attempt to accelerate the passage of time while they calculate his progress at other times she wept anew over her child which was by all judges pronounced as goodly an infant as needed to be seen and gray sometimes observed that she murmured sentences to the unconscious infant not only the words but the very sound and accents of which were strange to him and which in particular he knew not to be portuguese  mr goodriche the catholic priest demanded access to her upon one occasion she at first declined his visit but afterwards received it under the idea perhaps that he might have news from mr middlemas as he called himself the interview was a very short one and the priest left the ladys apartment in displeasure which his prudence could scarce disguise from mr gray he never returned although the ladys condition would have made his attentions and consolations necessary had she been a member of the catholic church  our doctor began at length to suspect his fair guest was a jewess who had yielded up her person and affections to one of a different religion and the peculiar style of her beautiful countenance went to enforce this opinion the circumstance made no difference to gray who saw only her distress and desolation and endeavoured to remedy both to the utmost of his power he was however desirous to conceal it from his wife and the others around the sick person whose prudence and liberality of thinking might be more justly doubted he therefore so regulated her diet that she could not be either offended or brought under suspicion by any of the articles forbidden by the mosaic law being presented to her in other respects than what concerned her health or convenience he had but little intercourse with her  the space passed within which the strangers return to the borough had been so anxiously expected by his female companion the disappointment occasioned by his nonarrival was manifested in the convalescent by inquietude which was at first mingled with peevishness and afterwards with doubt and fear when two or three days had passed without message or letter of any kind gray himself became anxious both on his own account and the poor ladys lest the stranger should have actually entertained the idea of deserting this defenceless and probably injured woman he longed to have some communication with her which might enable him to judge what enquiries could be made or what else was most fitting to be done but so imperfect was the poor young womans knowledge of the french language and perhaps so unwilling she herself to throw any light on her situation that every attempt of this kind proved abortive when gray asked questions concerning any subject which appeared to approach to explanation he observed she usually answered him by shaking her head in token of not understanding what he said at other times by silence and with tears and sometimes referring him to monsieur  for monsieurs arrival then gray began to become very impatient as that which alone could put an end to a disagreeable species of mystery which the good company of the borough began now to make the principal subject of their gossip some blaming gray for taking foreign landloupers footnote strollers into his house on the subject of whose morals the most serious doubts might be entertained others envying the bonny hand the doctor was like to make of it by having disposal of the wealthy strangers travelling funds a circumstance which could not be well concealed from the public when the honest mans expenditure for trifling articles of luxury came far to exceed its ordinary bounds  the conscious probity of the honest doctor enabled him to despise this sort of tittletattle though the secret knowledge of its existence could not be agreeable to him he went his usual rounds with his usual perseverance and waited with patience until time should throw light on the subject and history of his lodger it was now the fourth week after her confinement and the recovery of the stranger might be considered as perfect when gray returning from one of his tenmile visits saw a postchaise and four horses at the door this man has returned he said and my suspicions have done him less than justice with that he spurred his horse a signal which the trusty steed obeyed the more readily as its progress was in the direction of the stable door but when dismounting the doctor hurried into his own house it seemed to him that the departure as well as the arrival of this distressed lady was destined to bring confusion to his peaceful dwelling several idlers had assembled about his door and two or three had impudently thrust themselves forward almost into the passage to listen to a confused altercation which was heard from within  the doctor hastened forward the foremost of the intruders retreating in confusion on his approach while he caught the tones of his wifes voice raised to a pitch which he knew by experience boded no good for mrs gray goodhumoured and tractable in general could sometimes perform the high part in a matrimonial duet having much more confidence in his wifes good intentions than her prudence he lost no time in pushing into the parlour to take the matter into his own hands here he found his helpmate at the head of the whole militia of the sick ladys apartment that is wet nurse and sick nurse and girl of all work engaged in violent dispute with two strangers the one was a darkfeatured elderly man with an eye of much sharpness and severity of expression which now seemed partly quenched by a mixture of grief and mortification the other who appeared actively sustaining the dispute with mrs gray was a stout boldlooking hardfaced person armed with pistols of which he made rather an unnecessary and ostentatious display  here is my husband sir said mrs gray in a tone of triumph for she had the grace to believe the doctor one of the greatest men livinghere is the doctorlet us see what you will say now  why just what i said before maam answered the man which is that my warrant must be obeyed it is regular maam regular  so saying he struck the forefinger of his right hand against a paper which he held towards mrs gray with his left  address yourself to me if you please sir said the doctor seeing that he ought to lose no time in removing the cause into the proper court i am the master of this house sir and i wish to know the cause of this visit  my business is soon told said the man i am a kings messenger and this lady has treated me as if i was a baronbailies officer  that is not the question sir replied the doctor if you are a kings messenger where is your warrant and what do you propose to do here at the same time he whispered the little wench to call mr lawford the townclerk to come thither as fast as he possibly could the gooddaughter of peg thomson started off with an activity worthy of her motherinlaw  there is my warrant said the official and you may satisfy yourself  the shameless loon dare not tell the doctor his errand said mrs gray exultingly  a bonny errand it is said old lucky simson to carry away a lyingin woman as a gled footnote or kite would do a clockinghen  a woman no a month deliveredechoed the nurse jamieson  twentyfour days eight hours and seven minutes to a second said mrs gray  the doctor having looked over the warrant which was regular began to be afraid that the females of his family in their zeal for defending the character of their sex might be stirred up into some sudden fit of mutiny and therefore commanded them to be silent  this he said is a warrant for arresting the bodies of richard tresham and of zilia de moncada on account of high treason sir i have served his majesty and this is not a house in which traitors are harboured i know nothing of any of these two persons nor have i ever heard even their names  but the lady whom you have received into your family said the messenger is zilia de moncada and here stands her father matthias de moncada who will make oath to it  if this be true said mr gray looking towards the alleged officer you have taken a singular duty on you it is neither my habit to deny my own actions nor to oppose the laws of the land there is a lady in this house slowly recovering from confinement having become under this roof the mother of a healthy child if she be the person described in this warrant and this gentlemans daughter i must surrender her to the laws of the country  here the esculapian militia were once more in motion  surrender dr gray its a shame to hear you speak and you that lives by women and weans abune your other means so exclaimed his fair better part  i wonder to hear the doctor said the younger nurse theres no a wife in the town would believe it o him  i aye thought the doctor was a man till this moment said luckie simson but i believe him now to be an auld wife little baulder than mysell and i dinna wonder that poor mrs gray  hold your peace you foolish woman said the doctor do you think this business is not bad enough already that you are making it worse with your senseless claver footnote tattlinggentlemen this is a very sad case here is a warrant for a high crime against a poor creature who is little fit to be removed from one house to another much more dragged to a prison i tell you plainly that i think the execution of this arrest may cause her death it is your business sir if you be really her father to consider what you can do to soften this matter rather than drive it on  better death than dishonour replied the sternlooking old man with a voice as harsh as his aspect and you messenger he continued look what you do and execute the warrant at your peril  you hear said the man appealing to the doctor himself i must have immediate access to the lady  in a lucky time said mr gray here comes the townclerkyou are very welcome mr lawford your opinion here is much wanted as a man of law as well as of sense and humanity i was never more glad to see you in all my life  he then rapidly stated the case and the messenger understanding the newcomer to be a man of some authority again exhibited his warrant  this is a very sufficient and valid warrant dr gray replied the man of law nevertheless if you are disposed to make oath that instant removal would be unfavourable to the ladys health unquestionably she must remain here suitably guarded  it is not so much the mere act of locomotion which i am afraid of said the surgeon but i am free to depone on soul and conscience that the shame and fear of her fathers anger and the sense of the affront of such an arrest with terror for its consequences may occasion violent and dangerous illnesseven death itself  the father must see the daughter though they may have quarrelled said mr lawford the officer of justice must execute his warrant though it should frighten the criminal to death these evils are only contingent not direct and immediate consequences you must give up the lady mr gray though your hesitation is very natural  at least mr lawford i ought to be certain that the person in my house is the party they search for  admit me to her apartment replied the man whom the messenger termed moncada  the messenger whom the presence of lawford had made something more placid began to become impudent once more he hoped he said by means of his female prisoner to acquire the information necessary to apprehend the more guilty person if more delays were thrown in his way that information might come too late and he would make all who were accessary to such delay responsible for the consequences  and i said mr gray though i were to be brought to the gallows for it protest that this course may be the murder of my patientcan bail not be taken mr lawford  not in cases of high treason said the official person and then continued in a confidential tone come mr gray we all know you to be a person well affected to our royal sovereign king george and the government but you must not push this too far lest you bring yourself into trouble which every body in middlemas would be sorry for the fortyfive has not been so far gone by but we can remember enough of warrants of high treasonay and ladies of quality committed upon such charges but they were all favourably dealt withlady ogilvy lady macintosh flora macdonald and all no doubt this gentleman knows what he is doing and has assurances of the young ladys safetyso you must jouk and let the jaw gae by as we say  follow me then gentleman said gideon and you shall see the young lady and then his strong features working with emotion at anticipation of the distress which he was about to inflict he led the way up the small staircase and opening the door said to moncada who had followed him this is your daughters only place of refuge in which i am alas too weak to be her protector enter sir if your conscience will permit you  the stranger turned on him a scowl into which it seemed as if he would willingly have thrown the power of the fabled basilisk then stepping proudly forward he stalked into the room he was followed by lawford and gray at a little distance the messenger remained in the doorway the unhappy young woman had heard the disturbance and guessed the cause too truly it is possible she might even have seen the strangers on their descent from the carriage when they entered the room she was on her knees beside an easy chair her face in a silk wrapper that was hung over it the man called moncada uttered a single word by the accent it might have been something equivalent to wretch but none knew its import the female gave a convulsive shudder such as that by which a halfdying soldier is affected on receiving a second wound but without minding her emotion moncada seized her by the arm and with little gentleness raised her to her feet on which she seemed to stand only because she was supported by his strong grasp he then pulled from her face the mask which she had hitherto worn the poor creature still endeavoured to shroud her face by covering it with her left hand as the manner in which she was held prevented her from using the aid of the right with little effort her father secured that hand also which indeed was of itself far too little to serve the purpose of concealment and showed her beautiful face burning with blushes and covered with tears  you alcalde and you surgeon he said to lawford and gray with a foreign action and accent this woman is my daughter the same zilia moncada who is signald in that protocol make way and let me carry her where her crimes may be atoned for  are you that persons daughter said lawford to the lady  she understands no english said gray and addressing his patient in french conjured her to let him know whether she was that mans daughter or not assuring her of protection if the fact were otherwise the answer was murmured faintly but was too distinctly intelligiblehe was her father  all farther title of interference seemed now ended the messenger arrested his prisoner and with some delicacy required the assistance of the females to get her conveyed to the carriage in waiting  gray again interferedyou will not he said separate the mother and the infant  zilia de moncada heard the question which being addressed to the father gray had inconsiderately uttered in french and it seemed as if it recalled to her recollection the existence of the helpless creature to which she had given birth forgotten for a moment amongst the accumulated horrors of her fathers presence she uttered a shriek expressing poignant grief and turned her eyes on her father with the most intense supplication  to the parish with the bastardsaid moncada while the helpless mother sunk lifeless into the arms of the females who had now gathered round her  that will not pass sir said gideonif you are father to that lady you must be grandfather to the helpless child and you must settle in some manner for its future provision or refer us to some responsible person  moncada looked towards lawford who expressed himself satisfied of the propriety of what gray said  i object not to pay for whatever the wretched child may require said he and if you sir addressing gray choose to take charge of him and breed him up you shall have what will better your living  the doctor was about to refuse a charge so uncivilly offered but after a moments reflection he replied i think so indifferently of the proceedings i have witnessed and of those concerned in them that if the mother desires that i should retain the charge of this child i will not refuse to do so  moncada spoke to his daughter who was just beginning to recover from her swoon in the same language in which he had at first addressed her the proposition which he made seemed highly acceptable as she started from the arms of the females and advancing to gray seized his hand kissed it bathed it in her tears and seemed reconciled even in parting with her child by the consideration that the infant was to remain under his guardianship  good kind man she said in her indifferent french you have saved both mother and child  the father meanwhile with mercantile deliberation placed in mr lawfords hands notes and bills to the amount of a thousand pounds which he stated was to be vested for the childs use and advanced in such portions as his board and education might require in the event of any correspondence on his account being necessary as in case of death or the like he directed that communication should be made to signor matthias moncada under cover to a certain banking house in london  but beware he said to gray how you trouble me about these concerns unless in case of absolute necessity  you need not fear sir replied gray i have seen nothing today which can induce me to desire a more intimate correspondence with you than may be indispensable  while lawford drew up a proper minute of this transaction by which he himself and gray were named trustees for the child mr gray attempted to restore to the lady the balance of the considerable sum of money which tresham if such was his real name had formally deposited with him with every species of gesture by which hands eyes and even feet could express rejection as well as in her own broken french she repelled the reimbursement while she entreated that gray would consider the money as his own property and at the same time forced upon him a ring set with brilliants which seemed of considerable value the father then spoke to her a few stern words which she heard with an air of mingled agony and submission  i have given her a few minutes to see and weep over the miserable being which has been the seal of her dishonour said the stern father let us retire and leave her aloneyou to the messenger watch the door of the room on the outside  gray lawford and moncada retired to the parlour accordingly where they waited in silence each busied with his own reflections till within the space of half an hour they received information that the lady was ready to depart  it is well replied moncada i am glad she has yet sense enough left to submit to that which needs must be  so saying he ascended the stair and returned leading down his daughter now again masked and veiled as she passed gray she uttered the wordsmy child my child in a tone of unutterable anguish then entered the carriage which was drawn up as close to the door of the doctors house as the little enclosure would permit the messenger mounted on a led horse and accompanied by a servant and assistant followed the carriage which drove rapidly off taking the road which leads to edinburgh all who had witnessed this strange scene now departed to make their conjectures and some to count their gains for money had been distributed among the females who had attended on the lady with so much liberality as considerably to reconcile them to the breach of the rights of womanhood inflicted by the precipitate removal of the patient     chapter the second   the last cloud of dust which the wheels of the carriage had raised was dissipated when dinner which claims a share of human thoughts even in the midst of the most marvellous and affecting incidents recurred to those of mrs gray  indeed doctor you will stand glowering out of the window till some other patient calls for you and then have to set off without your dinnerand i hope mr lawford will take potluck with us for it is just his own hour and indeed we had something rather better than ordinary for this poor ladylamb and spinage and a veal florentine  the surgeon started as from a dream and joined in his wifes hospitable request to which lawford willingly assented  we will suppose the meal finished a bottle of old and generous antigua upon the table and a modest little punchbowl judiciously replenished for the accommodation of the doctor and his guest their conversation naturally turned on the strange scene which they had witnessed and the townclerk took considerable merit for his presence of mind  i am thinking doctor said he you might have brewed a bitter browst to yourself if i had not come in as i did  troth and it might very well so be answered gray for to tell you the truth when i saw yonder fellow vapouring with his pistols among the womanfolk in my own house the old cameronian spirit began to rise in me and little thing would have made me cleek to the poker  hoot hoot that would never have done na na said the man of law this was a case where a little prudence was worth all the pistols and pokers in the world  and that was just what i thought when i sent to you clerk lawford said the doctor  a wiser man he could not have called on to a difficult case added mrs gray as she sat with her work at a little distance from the table  thanks tye and heres tye my good neighbour answered the scribe will you not let me help you to another glass of punch mrs gray this being declined he proceeded i am jalousing that the messenger and his warrant were just brought in to prevent any opposition ye saw how quietly he behaved after i had laid down the lawill never believe the lady is in any risk from him but the father is a dour chield depend upon it he has bred up the young filly on the curbrein and that has made the poor thing start off the course i should not be surprised that he took her abroad and shut her up in a convent  hardly replied doctor gray if it be true as i suspect that both the father and daughter are of the jewish persuasion  a jew said mrs gray and have i been taking a this fyke about a jewi thought she seemed to gie a scunner at the eggs and bacon that nurse simson spoke about to her but i thought jews had aye had lang beards and yon mans face is just like one of our ain folksi have seen the doctor with a langer beard himsell when he has not had leisure to shave  that might have been mr moncadas case said lawford for he seemed to have had a hard journey but the jews are often very respectable people mrs graythey have no territorial property because the law is against them there but they have a good hank in the money market plenty of stock in the funds mrs gray and indeed i think this poor young woman is better with her ain father though he be a jew and a dour chield into the bargain than she would have been with the loon that wranged her who is by your account dr gray baith a papist and a rebel the jews are well attached to government they hate the pope the devil and the pretender as much as any honest man among ourselves  i cannot admire either of the gentlemen said gideon but it is but fair to say that i saw mr moncada when he was highly incensed and to all appearance not without reason now this other man tresham if that be his name was haughty to me and i think something careless of the poor young woman just at the time when he owed her most kindness and me some thankfulness i am therefore of your opinion clerk lawford that the christian is the worse bargain of the two  and you think of taking care of this wean yourself doctor that is what i call the good samaritan  at cheap cost clerk the child if it lives has enough to bring it up decently and set it out in life and i can teach it an honourable and useful profession it will be rather an amusement than a trouble to me and i want to make some remarks on the childish diseases which with gods blessing the child must come through under my charge and since heaven has sent us no children  hoot hoot said the townclerk you are in ower great hurry now you have na been sae lang married yetmrs gray dinna let my daffing chase you awaywe will be for a dish of tea believe for the doctor and i are nae glassbreakers  four years after this conversation took place the event happened at the possibility of which the townclerk had hinted and mrs gray presented her husband with an infant daughter but good and evil are strangely mingled in this sublunary world the fulfilment of his anxious longing for posterity was attended with the loss of his simple and kindhearted wife one of the most heavy blows which fate could inflict on poor gideon and his house was made desolate even by the event which had promised for months before to add new comforts to its humble roof gray felt the shock as men of sense and firmness feel a decided blow from the effects of which they never hope again fully to raise themselves he discharged the duties of his profession with the same punctuality as ever was easy and even to appearance cheerful in his intercourse with society but the sunshine of existence was gone every morning he missed the affectionate charges which recommended to him to pay attention to his own health while he was labouring to restore that blessing to his patients every evening as he returned from his weary round it was without the consciousness of a kind and affectionate reception from one eager to tell and interested to hear all the little events of the day his whistle which used to arise clear and strong so soon as middlemas steeple was in view was now for ever silenced and the riders head drooped while the tired horse lacking the stimulus of his masters hand and voice seemed to shuffle along as if it experienced a share of his despondency there were times when he was so much dejected as to be unable to endure even the presence of his little menie in whose infant countenance he could trace the lineaments of the mother of whose loss she had been the innocent and unconscious cause had it not been for this poor childhe would think but instantly aware that the sentiment was sinful he would snatch the infant to his breast and load it with caressesthen hastily desire it to be removed from the parlour  the mahometans have a fanciful idea that the true believer in his passage to paradise is under the necessity of passing barefooted over a bridge composed of redhot iron but on this occasion all the pieces of paper which the moslem has preserved during his life lest some holy thing being written upon them might be profaned arrange themselves between his feet and the burning metal and so save him from injury in the same manner the effects of kind and benevolent actions are sometimes found even in this world to assuage the pangs of subsequent afflictions  thus the greatest consolation which poor gideon could find after his heavy deprivation was in the frolic fondness of richard middlemas the child who was in so singular a manner thrown upon his charge even at this early age he was eminently handsome when silent or out of humour his dark eyes and striking countenance presented some recollections of the stern character imprinted on the features of his supposed father but when he was gay and happy which was much more frequently the case these clouds were exchanged for the most frolicsome mirthful expression that ever dwelt on the laughing and thoughtless aspect of a child he seemed to have a tact beyond his years in discovering and conforming to the peculiarities of human character his nurse one prime object of richards observance was nurse jamieson or as she was more commonly called for brevity and par excellence nurse this was the person who had brought him up from infancy she had lost her own child and soon after her husband and being thus a lone woman had as used to be common in scotland remained a member of dr grays family after the death of his wife she gradually obtained the principal superintendence of the whole household and being an honest and capable manager was a person of very great importance in the family  she was bold in her temper violent in her feelings and as often happens with those in her condition was as much attached to richard middlemas whom she had once nursed at her bosom as if he had been her own son this affection the child repaid by all the tender attentions of which his age was capable  little dick was also distinguished by the fondest and kindest attachment to his guardian and benefactor dr gray he was officious in the right time and place quiet as a lamb when his patron seemed inclined to study or to muse active and assiduous to assist or divert him whenever it seemed to be wished and in choosing his opportunities he seemed to display an address far beyond his childish years  as time passed on this pleasing character seemed to be still more refined in everything like exercise or amusement he was the pride and the leader of the boys of the place over the most of whom his strength and activity gave him a decided superiority at school his abilities were less distinguished yet he was a favourite with the master a sensible and useful teacher  richard is not swift he used to say to his patron dr gray but then he is sure and it is impossible not to be pleased with a child who is so very desirous to give satisfaction  young middlemass grateful affection to his patron seemed to increase with the expanding of his faculties and found a natural and pleasing mode of displaying itself in his attentions to little menie footnote marion gray her slightest hint was richards law and it was in vain that he was summoned forth by a hundred shrill voices to take the lead in hyespye or at football if it was little menies pleasure that he should remain within and build cardhouses for her amusement at other times he would take the charge of the little damsel entirely under his own care and be seen wandering with her on the borough common collecting wild flowers or knitting caps made of bulrushes menie was attached to dick middlemas in proportion to his affectionate assiduities and the father saw with pleasure every new mark of attention to his child on the part of his protege  during the time that richard was silently advancing from a beautiful child into a fine boy and approaching from a fine boy to the time when he must be termed a handsome youth mr gray wrote twice ayear with much regularity to mr moncada through the channel that gentleman had pointed out the benevolent man thought that if the wealthy grandfather could only see his relative of whom any family might be proud he would be unable to persevere in his resolution of treating as an outcast one so nearly connected with him in blood and so interesting in person and disposition he thought it his duty therefore to keep open the slender and oblique communication with the boys maternal grandfather as that which might at some future period lead to a closer connexion yet the correspondence could not in other respects be agreeable to a man of spirit like mr gray his own letters were as short as possible merely rendering an account of his wards expenses including a moderate board to himself attested by mr lawford his cotrustee and intimating richards state of health and his progress in education with a few words of brief but warm eulogy upon his goodness of head and heart but the answers he received were still shorter mr moncada such was their usual tenor acknowledges mr grays letter of such a date notices the contents and requests mr gray to persist in the plan which he has hitherto prosecuted on the subject of their correspondence on occasions where extraordinary expenses seemed likely to be incurred the remittances were made with readiness  that day fortnight after mrs grays death fifty pounds were received with a note intimating that it was designed to put the child r m into proper mourning the writer had added two or three words desiring that the surplus should be at mr grays disposal to meet the additional expenses of this period of calamity but mr moncada had left the phrase unfinished apparently in despair of turning it suitably into english gideon without farther investigation quietly added the sum to the account of his wards little fortune contrary to the opinion of mr lawfordwho aware that he was rather a loser than a gainer by the boys residence in his house was desirous that his friend should not omit an opportunity of recovering some part of his expenses on that score but gray was proof against all remonstrances  as the boy advanced towards his fourteenth year dr gray wrote a more elaborate account of his wards character acquirements and capacity he added that he did this for the purpose of enabling mr moncada to judge how the young mans future education should be directed richard he observed was arrived at the point where education losing its original and general character branches off into different paths of knowledge suitable to particular professions and when it was therefore become necessary to determine which of them it was his pleasure that young richard should be trained for and he would on his part do all he could to carry mr moncadas wishes into execution since the amiable qualities of the boy made him as dear to him though but a guardian as he could have been to his own father  the answer which arrived in the course of a week or ten days was fuller than usual and written in the first personmr gray such was the tenor our meeting has been under such circumstances as could not make us favourably known to each other at the time but i have the advantage of you since knowing your motives for entertaining an indifferent opinion of me i could respect them and you at the same time whereas you unable to comprehend the motivesi say you being unacquainted with the infamous treatment i had received could not understand the reasons that i have for acting as i have done deprived sir by the act of a villain of my child and she despoiled of honour i cannot bring myself to think of beholding the creature however innocent whose look must always remind me of hatred and of shame keep the poor child by youeducate him to your own profession but take heed that he looks no higher than to fill such a situation in life as you yourself worthily occupy or some other line of like importance for the condition of a farmer a country lawyer a medical practitioner or some such retired course of life the means of outfit and education shall be amply supplied but i must warn him and you that any attempt to intrude himself on me further than i may especially permit will be attended with the total forfeiture of my favour and protection so having made known my mind to you i expect you will act accordingly  the receipt of this letter determined gideon to have some explanation with the boy himself in order to learn if he had any choice among the professions thus opened to him convinced at the same time from his docility of temper that he would refer the selection to his dr grays better judgment  he had previously however the unpleasing task of acquainting richard middlemas with the mysterious circumstances attending his birth of which he presumed him to be entirely ignorant simply because he himself had never communicated them but had let the boy consider himself as the orphan child of a distant relation but though the doctor himself was silent he might have remembered that nurse jamieson had the handsome enjoyment of her tongue and was disposed to use it liberally  from a very early period nurse jamieson amongst the variety of legendary lore which she instilled into her fosterson had not forgotten what she called the awful season of his coming into the worldthe personable appearance of his father a grand gentleman who looked as if the whole world lay at his feetthe beauty of his mother and the terrible blackness of the mask which she wore her een that glanced like diamonds and the diamonds she wore on her fingers that could be compared to nothing but her own een the fairness of her skin and the colour of her silk rokelay with much proper stuff to the same purpose then she expatiated on the arrival of his grandfather and the awful man armed with pistol dirk and claymore the last weapons existed only in nurses imagination the very ogre of a fairy talethen all the circumstances of the carrying off his mother while banknotes were flying about the house like screeds of brown paper and gold guineas were as plenty as chuckiestanes all this partly to please and interest the boy partly to indulge her own talent for amplification nurse told with so many additional circumstances and gratuitous commentaries that the real transaction mysterious and odd as it certainly was sunk into tameness before the nurses edition like humble prose contrasted with the boldest nights of poetry  to hear all this did richard seriously incline and still more was he interested with the idea of his valiant father coming for him unexpectedly at the head of a gallant regiment with music playing and colours flying and carrying his son away on the most beautiful pony eyes ever beheld or his mother bright as the day might suddenly appear in her coachandsix to reclaim her beloved child or his repentant grandfather with his pockets stuffed out with banknotes would come to atone for his past cruelty by heaping his neglected grandchild with unexpected wealth sure was nurse jamieson that it wanted but a blink of her bairns bonny ee to turn their hearts as scripture sayeth and as strange things had been as they should come athegither to the town at the same time and make such a day as had never been seen in middlemas and then her bairn would never be called by that lowland name of middlemas any more which sounded as if it had been gathered out of the town gutter but would be called galatian footnote galatian is a name of a person famous in christmas gambols or sir william wallace or robin hood or after some other of the great princes named in storybooks  nurse jamiesons history of the past and prospects of the future were too flattering not to excite the most ambitious visions in the mind of a boy who naturally felt a strong desire of rising in the world and was conscious of possessing the powers necessary to his advancement the incidents of his birth resembled those he found commemorated in the tales which he read or listened to and there seemed no reason why his own adventures should not have a termination corresponding to those of such veracious histories in a word while good doctor gray imagined that his pupil was dwelling in utter ignorance of his origin richard was meditating upon nothing else than the time and means by which he anticipated his being extricated from the obscurity of his present condition and enabled to assume the rank to which in his own opinion he was entitled by birth  so stood the feelings of the young man when one day after dinner the doctor snuffing the candle and taking from his pouch the great leathern pocketbook in which he deposited particular papers with a small supply of the most necessary and active medicines he took from it mr moncadas letter and requested richard middlemass serious attention while he told him some circumstances concerning himself which it greatly imported him to know richards dark eyes flashed firethe blood flushed his broad and wellformed foreheadthe hour of explanation was at length come he listened to the narrative of gideon gray which the reader may believe being altogether divested of the gilding which nurse jamiesons imagination had bestowed upon it and reduced to what mercantile men termed the needful exhibited little more than the tale of a child of shame deserted by its father and mother and brought up on the reluctant charity of a more distant relation who regarded him as the living though unconscious evidence of the disgrace of his family and would more willingly have paid for the expenses of his funeral than that of the food which was grudgingly provided for him temple and tower a hundred flattering edifices of richards childish imagination went to the ground at once and the pain which attended their demolition was rendered the more acute by a sense of shame that he should have nursed such reveries he remained while gideon continued his explanation in a dejected posture his eyes fixed on the ground and the veins of his forehead swoln with contending passions  and now my dear richard said the good surgeon you must think what you can do for yourself since your grandfather leaves you the choice of three honourable professions by any of which well and wisely prosecuted you may become independent if not wealthy and respectable if not great you will naturally desire a little time for consideration  not a minute said the boy raising his head and looking boldly at his guardian i am a freeborn englishman and will return to england if i think fit  a freeborn fool you aresaid gray you were born as i think and no one can know better than i do in the blue room of stevenlaws land in the townhead of middlemas if you call that being a freeborn englishman  but tom hillarythis was an apprentice of clerk lawford who had of late been a great friend and adviser of young middlemastom hillary says that i am a freeborn englishman notwithstanding in right of my parents  pooh child what do we know of your parentsbut what has your being an englishman to do with the present question  oh doctor answered the boy bitterly you know we from the south side of tweed cannot scramble so hard as you do the scots are too moral and too prudent and too robust for a poor puddingeater to live amongst them whether as a parson or as a lawyer or as a doctorwith your pardon sir  upon my life dick said gray this tom hillary will turn your brain what is the meaning of all this trash  tom hillary says that the parson lives by the sins of the people the lawyer by their distresses and the doctor by their diseasesalways asking your pardon sir  tom hillary replied the doctor should be drummed out of the borough a whippersnapper of an attorneys apprentice run away from newcastle if i hear him talking so ill teach him to speak with more reverence of the learned professions let me hear no more of tom hillary whom you have seen far too much of lately think a little like a lad of sense and tell me what answer i am to give to mr moncada  tell him said the boy the tone of affected sarcasm laid aside and that of injured pride substituted in its room tell him that my soul revolts at the obscure lot he recommends to me i am determined to enter my fathers profession the army unless my grandfather chooses to receive me into his house and place me in his own line of business  yes and make you his partner i suppose and acknowledge you for his heir said dr gray a thing extremely likely to happen no doubt considering the way in which he has brought you up all along and the terms in which he now writes concerning you  then sir there is one thing which i can demand of you replied the boy there is a large sum of money in your hands belonging to me and since it is consigned to you for my use i demand you should make the necessary advances to procure a commission in the armyaccount to me for the balanceand so with thanks for past favours i will give you no trouble in future  young man said the doctor gravely i am very sorry to see that your usual prudence and good humour are not proof against the disappointment of some idle expectations which you had not the slightest reason to entertain it is very true that there is a sum which in spite of various expenses may still approach to a thousand pounds or better which remains in my hands for your behoof but i am bound to dispose of it according to the will of the donor and at any rate you are not entitled to call for it until you come to years of discretion a period from which you are six years distant according to law and which in one sense you will never reach at all unless you alter your present unreasonable crotchets but come dick this is the first time i have seen you in so absurd a humour and you have many things i own in your situation to apologize for impatience even greater than you have displayed but you should not turn your resentment on me that am no way in fault you should remember that i was your earliest and only friend and took charge of you when every other person forsook you  i do not thank you for it said richard giving way to a burst of uncontrolled passion you might have done better for me had you pleased  and in what manner you ungrateful boy said gray whose composure was a little ruffled  you might have flung me under the wheels of their carriages as they drove off and have let them trample on the body of their child as they have done on his feelings  so saying he rushed out of the room and shut the door behind him with great violence leaving his guardian astonished at his sudden and violent change of temper and manner  what the deuce can have possessed him ah well highspirited and disappointed in some follies which that tom hillary has put into his head but his is a case for anodynes and shall be treated accordingly  while the doctor formed this goodnatured resolution young middlemas rushed to nurse jamiesons apartment where poor menie to whom his presence always gave holyday feelings hastened to exhibit for his admiration a new doll of which she had made the acquisition no one generally was more interested in menies amusements than richard but at present richard like his celebrated namesake was not ithe vein he threw off the little damsel so carelessly almost so rudely that the doll flew out of menies hand fell on the hearthstone and broke its waxen face the rudeness drew from nurse jamieson a rebuke even although the culprit was her darling  hout awa richardthat wasna like yoursell to guide miss menie that gatehaud your tongue miss menie and ill soon mend the babys face  but if menie cried she did not cry for the doll and while the tears flowed silently down her cheeks she sat looking at dick middlemas with a childish face of fear sorrow and wonder nurse jamieson was soon diverted from her attention to menie grays distresses especially as she did not weep aloud and her attention became fixed on the altered countenance red eyes and swoln features of her darling fosterchild she instantly commenced an investigation into the cause of his distress after the usual inquisitorial manner of matrons of her class what is the matter wi my bairn and wha has been vexing my bairn with similar questions at last extorted this reply  i am not your bairni am no ones bairnno ones son i am an outcast from my family and belong to no one dr gray has told me so himself  and did he cast up to my bairn that he was a bastardtroth he was na blatemy certie your father was a better man than ever stood on the doctors shanksa handsome grand gentleman with an ee like a gleds and a step like a highland piper  nurse jamieson had got on a favourite topic and would have expatiated long enough for she was a professed admirer of masculine beauty but there was something which displeased the boy in her last simile so he cut the conversation short by asking whether she knew exactly how much money his grandfather had left with dr gray for his maintenance she could not saydidna kenan awfu sum it was to pass out of ae mans handshe was sure it wasna less than ae hundred pounds and it might weel be twa in short she knew nothing about the matter but she was sure dr gray would count to him to the last farthing for everybody kend that he was a just man where siller was concerned however if her bairn wanted to ken mair about it to be sure the townclerk could tell him all about it  richard middlemas arose and left the apartment without saying more he went immediately to visit the old townclerk to whom he had made himself acceptable as indeed he had done to most of the dignitaries about the burgh he introduced the conversation by the proposal which had been made to him for choosing a profession and after speaking of the mysterious circumstances of his birth and the doubtful prospects which lay before him he easily led the townclerk into conversation as to the amount of the funds and heard the exact state of the money in his guardians hands which corresponded with the information he had already received he next sounded the worthy scribe on the possibility of his going into the army but received a second confirmation of the intelligence mr gray had given him being informed that no part of the money could be placed at his disposal till he was of age and then not without the especial consent of both his guardians and particularly that of his master he therefore took leave of the townclerk who much approving the cautious manner in which he spoke and his prudent selection of an adviser at this important crisis of his life intimated to him that should he choose the law he would himself receive him into his office upon a very moderate apprenticefee and would part with tom hillary to make room for him as the lad was rather pragmatical and plagued him with speaking about his english practice which they had nothing to do with on this side of the borderthe lord be thanked  middlemas thanked him for his kindness and promised to consider his kind offer in case he should determine upon following the profession of the law  from tom hillarys master richard went to tom hillary himself who chanced then to be in the office he was a lad about twenty as smart as small but distinguished for the accuracy with which he dressed his hair and the splendour of a laced hat and embroidered waistcoat with which he graced the church of middlemas on sundays tom hillary had been bred an attorneys clerk in newcastleupontyne but for some reason or other had found it more convenient of late years to reside in scotland and was recommended to the townclerk of middlemas by the accuracy and beauty with which he transcribed the records of the burgh it is not improbable that the reports concerning the singular circumstances of richard middlemass birth and the knowledge that he was actually possessed of a considerable sum of money induced hillary though so much his senior to admit the lad to his company and enrich his youthful mind with some branches of information which in that retired corner his pupil might otherwise have been some time in attaining amongst these were certain games at cards and dice in which the pupil paid as was reasonable the price of initiation by his losses to his instructor after a long walk with this youngster whose advice like the unwise son of the wisest of men he probably valued more than that of his more aged counsellors richard middlemas returned to his lodgings in stevenlaws land and went to bed sad and supperless  the next morning richard arose with the sun and his nights rest appeared to have had its frequent effect in cooling the passions and correcting the understanding little menie was the first person to whom he made the amende honorable and a much smaller propitiation than the new doll with which he presented her would have been accepted as an atonement for a much greater offence menie was one of those pure spirits to whom a state of unkindness if the estranged person has been a friend is a state of pain and the slightest advance of her friend and protector was sufficient to regain all her childish confidence and affection  the father did not prove more inexorable than menie had done mr gray indeed thought he had good reason to look cold upon richard at their next meeting being not a little hurt at the ungrateful treatment which he had received on the preceding evening but middlemas disarmed him at once by frankly pleading that he had suffered his mind to be carried away by the supposed rank and importance of his parents into an idle conviction that he was one day to share them the letter of his grandfather which condemned him to banishment and obscurity for life was he acknowledged a very severe blow and it was with deep sorrow that he reflected that the irritation of his disappointment had led him to express himself in a manner far short of the respect and reverence of one who owed mr gray the duty and affection of a son and ought to refer to his decision every action of his life gideon propitiated by an admission so candid and made with so much humility readily dismissed his resentment and kindly enquired of richard whether he had bestowed any reflection upon the choice of profession which had been subjected to him offering at the same time to allow him all reasonable time to make up his mind  on this subject richard middlemas answered with the same promptitude and candourhe had he said in order to forming his opinion more safely consulted with his friend the townclerk the doctor nodded approbation mr lawford had indeed been most friendly and had even offered to take him into his own office but if his father and benefactor would permit him to study under his instructions the noble art in which he himself enjoyed such a deserved reputation the mere hope that he might byandby be of some use to mr gray in his business would greatly overbalance every other consideration such a course of education and such a use of professional knowledge when he had acquired it would be a greater spur to his industry than the prospect even of becoming townclerk of middlemas in his proper person  as the young man expressed it to be his firm and unalterable choice to study medicine under his guardian and to remain a member of his family dr gray informed mr moncada of the lads determination who to testify his approbation remitted to the doctor the sum of l100 as apprentice fee a sum nearly three times as much as grays modesty had hinted at as necessary  shortly after when dr gray and the townclerk met at the small club of the burgh their joint theme was the sense and steadiness of richard middlemas  indeed said the townclerk he is such a friendly and disinterested boy that i could not get him to accept a place in my office for fear he should be thought to be pushing himself forward at the expense of tam hillary  and indeed clerk said gray i have sometimes been afraid that he kept too much company with that tam hillary of yours but twenty tam hillarys would not corrupt dick middlemas     chapter the third    dick was come to high renown    since he commenced physician  tom was held by all the town    the better politician                    tom and dick  at the same period when dr gray took under his charge his youthful lodger richard middlemas he received proposals from the friends of one adam hartley to receive him also as an apprentice the lad was the son of a respectable farmer on the english side of the border who educating his eldest son to his own occupation desired to make his second a medical man in order to avail himself of the friendship of a great man his landlord who had offered to assist his views in life and represented a doctor or surgeon as the sort of person to whose advantage his interest could be most readily applied middlemas and hartley were therefore associated in their studies in winter they were boarded in edinburgh for attending the medical classes which were necessary for taking their degree three or four years thus passed on and from being mere boys the two medical aspirants shot up into young men who being both very goodlooking well dressed well bred and having money in their pockets became personages of some importance in the little town of middlemas where there was scarce any thing that could be termed an aristocracy and in which beaux were scarce and belles were plenty  each of the two had his especial partizans for though the young men themselves lived in tolerable harmony together yet as usual in such cases no one could approve of one of them without at the same time comparing him with and asserting his superiority over his companion  both were gay fond of dancing and sedulous attendants on the practeezings as he called them of mr mcfittoch a dancing master who itinerant during the summer became stationary in the winter season and afforded the youth of middlemas the benefit of his instructions at the rate of twenty lessons for five shillings sterling on these occasions each of dr grays pupils had his appropriate praise hartley danced with most spiritmiddlemas with a better grace mr mcfittoch would have turned out richard against the countryside in the minuet and wagered the thing dearest to him in the world and that was his kit upon his assured superiority but he admitted hartley was superior to him in hornpipes jigs strathspeys and reels  in dress hartley was most expensive perhaps because his father afforded him better means of being so but his clothes were neither so tasteful when new nor so well preserved when they began to grow old as those of richard middlemas adam hartley was sometimes fine at other times rather slovenly and on the former occasions looked rather too conscious of his splendour his chum was at all times regularly neat and well dressed while at the same time he had an air of goodbreeding which made him appear always at ease so that his dress whatever it was seemed to be just what he ought to have worn at the time  in their persons there was a still more strongly marked distinction adam hartley was full middle size stout and well limbed and an open english countenance of the genuine saxon mould showed itself among chestnut locks until the hairdresser destroyed them he loved the rough exercises of wrestling boxing leaping and quarterstaff and frequented when he could obtain leisure the bullbaitings and football matches by which the burgh was sometimes enlivened  richard on the contrary was dark like his father and mother with high features beautifully formed but exhibiting something of a foreign character and his person was tall and slim though muscular and active his address and manners must have been natural to him for they were in elegance and ease far beyond any example which he could have found in his native burgh he learned the use of the smallsword while in edinburgh and took lessons from a performer at the theatre with the purpose of refining his mode of speaking he became also an amateur of the drama regularly attending the playhouse and assuming the tone of a critic in that and other lighter departments of literature to fill up the contrast so far as taste was concerned richard was a dexterous and successful angleradam a bold and unerring shot their efforts to surpass each other in supplying dr grays table rendered his housekeeping much preferable to what it had been on former occasions and besides small presents of fish and game are always agreeable amongst the inhabitants of a country town and contributed to increase the popularity of the young sportsmen  while the burgh was divided for lack of better subject of disputation concerning the comparative merits of dr grays two apprentices he himself was sometimes chosen the referee but in this as on other matters the doctor was cautious he said the lads were both good lads and would be useful men in the profession if their heads were not carried with the notice which the foolish people of the burgh took of them and the parties of pleasure that were so often taking them away from their business no doubt it was natural for him to feel more confidence in hartley who came of kend folk and was very near as good as a born scotsman but if he did feel such a partiality he blamed himself for it since the stranger child so oddly cast upon his hands had peculiar good right to such patronage and affection as he had to bestow and truly the young man himself seemed so grateful that it was impossible for him to hint the slightest wish that dick middlemas did not hasten to execute  there were persons in the burgh of middlemas who were indiscreet enough to suppose that miss menie must be a better judge than any other person of the comparative merits of these accomplished personages respecting which the public opinion was generally divided no one even of her greatest intimates ventured to put the question to her in precise terms but her conduct was narrowly observed and the critics remarked that to adam hartley her attentions were given more freely and frankly she laughed with him chatted with him and danced with him while to dick middlemas her conduct was more shy and distant the premises seemed certain but the public were divided in the conclusions which were to be drawn from them  it was not possible for the young men to be the subject of such discussions without being sensible that they existed and thus contrasted together by the little society in which they moved they must have been made of better than ordinary clay if they had not themselves entered by degrees into the spirit of the controversy and considered themselves as rivals for public applause  nor is it to be forgotten that menie gray was by this time shot up into one of the prettiest young women not of middlemas only but of the whole county in which the little burgh is situated this indeed had been settled by evidence which could not be esteemed short of decisive at the time of the races there were usually assembled in the burgh some company of the higher classes from the country around and many of the sober burghers mended their incomes by letting their apartments or taking in lodgers of quality for the busy week all the rural thanes and thanesses attended on these occasions and such was the number of cocked hats and silken trains that the little town seemed for a time totally to have changed its inhabitants on this occasion persons of a certain quality only were permitted to attend upon the nightly balls which were given in the old townhouse and the line of distinction excluded mr grays family  the aristocracy however used their privileges with some feelings of deference to the native beaux and belles of the burgh who were thus doomed to hear the fiddles nightly without being permitted to dance to them one evening in the raceweek termed the hunters ball was dedicated to general amusement and liberated from the usual restrictions of etiquette on this occasion all the respectable families in the town were invited to share the amusement of the evening and to wonder at the finery and be grateful for the condescension of their betters this was especially the case with the females for the number of invitations to the gentlemen of the town was much more limited now at this general muster the beauty of miss grays face and person had placed her in the opinion of all competent judges decidedly at the head of all the belles present saving those with whom according to the ideas of the place it would hardly have been decent to compare her  the laird of the ancient and distinguished house of louponheight did not hesitate to engage her hand during the greater part of the evening and his mother renowned for her stern assertion of the distinctions of rank placed the little plebeian beside her at supper and was heard to say that the surgeons daughter behaved very prettily indeed and seemed to know perfectly well where and what she was as for the young laird himself he capered so high and laughed so uproariously as to give rise to a rumour that he was minded to shoot madly from his sphere and to convert the village doctors daughter into a lady of his own ancient name  during this memorable evening middlemas and hartley who had found room in the music gallery witnessed the scene and as it would seem with very different feelings hartley was evidently annoyed by the excess of attention which the gallant laird of louponheight stimulated by the influence of a couple of bottles of claret and by the presence of a partner who danced remarkably well paid to miss menie gray he saw from his lofty stand all the dumb show of gallantry with the comfortable feelings of a famishing creature looking upon a feast which he is not permitted to share and regarded every extraordinary frisk of the jovial laird as the same might have been looked upon by a gouty person who apprehended that the dignitary was about to descend on his toes at length unable to restrain his emotion he left the gallery and returned no more  far different was the demeanour of middlemas he seemed gratified and elevated by the attention which was generally paid to miss gray and by the admiration she excited on the valiant laird of louponheight he looked with indescribable contempt and amused himself with pointing out to the burgh dancingmaster who acted pro tempore as one of the band the frolicsome bounds and pirouettes in which that worthy displayed a great deal more of vigour than of grace  but ye shouldna laugh sae loud master dick said the master of capers he hasna had the advantage of a real gracefu teacher as ye have had and troth if he listed to tak some lessons i think i could make some hand of his feet for he is a souple chield and has a gallant instep of his ain and sic a laced hat hasna been seen on the causeway of middlemas this mony a dayye are standing laughing there dick middlemas i would have you be sure he does not cut you out with your bonny partner yonder  he be middlemas was beginning a sentence which he could not have concluded with strict attention to propriety when the master of the band summoned mcfittoch to his post by the following ireful expostulationwhat are ye about sir mind your bowhand how the deil dye think three fiddles is to keep down a bass if yin o them stands girning and gabbling as yere doing play up sir  dick middlemas thus reduced to silence continued from his lofty station like one of the gods of the epicureans to survey what passed below without the gaieties which he witnessed being able to excite more than a smile which seemed however rather to indicate a goodhumoured contempt for what was passing than a benevolent sympathy with the pleasures of others     chapter the fourth     now hold thy tongue billy bewick he said     of peaceful talking let me be   but if thou art a man as i think thou art     come ower the dyke and fight with me                            border minstrelsy   on the morning after this gay evening the two young men were labouring together in a plot of ground behind stevenlaws land which the doctor had converted into a garden where he raised with a view to pharmacy as well as botany some rare plants which obtained the place from the vulgar the sounding name of the physic garden footnote the botanic garden is so termed by the vulgar of edinburgh mr grays pupils readily complied with his wishes that they would take some care of this favourite spot to which both contributed their labours after which hartley used to devote himself to the cultivation of the kitchen garden which he had raised into this respectability from a spot not excelling a common kailyard while richard middleman did his utmost to decorate with flowers and shrubs a sort of arbour usually called miss menies bower  at present they were both in the botanic patch of the garden when dick middlemas asked hartley why he had left the ball so soon the evening before  i should rather ask you said hartley what pleasure you felt in staying therei tell you dick it is a shabby low place this middlemas of ours in the smallest burgh in england every decent freeholder would have been asked if the member gave a ball  what hartley said his companion are you of all men a candidate for the honour of mixing with the firstborn of the earth mercy on us how will canny northumberland throwing a true northern accent on the letter r acquit himself methinks i see thee in thy peagreen suit dancing a jig with the honourable miss maddie macfudgeon while chiefs and thanes around laugh as they would do at a hog in armour  you dont or perhaps you wont understand me said hartley i am not such a fool as to desire to be hailfellowwellmet with these fine folksi care as little for them as they do for me but as they do not choose to ask us to dance i dont see what business they have with our partners  partners said you answered middlemas i dont think menie is very often yours  as often as i ask her answered hartley rather haughtily  ay indeedi did not think thatand hang me if i think so yet said middlemas with the same sarcastic tone i tell thee adam i will bet you a bowl of punch that miss gray will not dance with you the next time you ask her all i stipulate is to know the day  i will lay no bets about miss gray said hartley her father is my master and i am obliged to himi think i should act very scurvily if i were to make her the subject of any idle debate betwixt you and me  very right replied middlemas you should finish one quarrel before you begin another pray saddle your pony ride up to the gate of louponheight castle and defy the baron to mortal combat for having presumed to touch the fair hand of menie gray  i wish you would leave miss grays name out of the question and take your defiances to your fine folks in your own name and see what they will say to the surgeons apprentice  speak for yourself if you please mr adam hartley i was not born a clown like some folks and should care little if i saw it fit to talk to the best of them at the ordinary and make myself understood too  very likely answered hartley losing patience you are one of themselves you knowmiddlemas of that ilk  you scoundrel said richard advancing on him in fury his taunting humour entirely changed into rage  stand back said hartley or you will come by the worst if you will break rude jests you must put up with rough answers  i will have satisfaction for this insult by heaven  why so you shall if you insist on it said hartley but better i think to say no more about the matter we have both spoken what would have been better left unsaid i was in the wrong to say what i said to you although you did provoke me and now i have given you as much satisfaction as a reasonable man can ask  sir repeated middlemas the satisfaction which i demand is that of a gentlemanthe doctor has a pair of pistols  and a pair of mortars also which are heartily at your service gentlemen said mr gray coming forward from behind a yew hedge where he had listened to the whole or greater part of this dispute a fine story it would be of my apprentices shooting each other with my own pistols let me see either of you fit to treat a gunshot wound before you think of inflicting one go you are both very foolish boys and i cannot take it kind of either of you to bring the name of my daughter into such disputes as these hark ye lads ye both owe me i think some portion of respect and even of gratitudeit will be a poor return if instead of living quietly with this poor motherless girl like brothers with a sister you should oblige me to increase my expense and abridge my comfort by sending my child from me for the few months that you are to remain here let me see you shake hands and let us have no more of this nonsense  while their master spoke in this manner both the young men stood before him in the attitude of selfconvicted criminals at the conclusion of his rebuke hartley turned frankly round and offered his hand to his companion who accepted it but after a moments hesitation there was nothing farther passed on the subject but the lads never resumed the same sort of intimacy which had existed betwixt them in their earlier acquaintance on the contrary avoiding every connexion not absolutely required by their situation and abridging as much as possible even their indispensable intercourse in professional matters they seemed as much estranged from each other as two persons residing in the same small house had the means of being  as for menie gray her father did not appear to entertain the least anxiety upon her account although from his frequent and almost daily absence from home she was exposed to constant intercourse with two handsome young men both it might be supposed ambitious of pleasing her more than most parents would have deemed entirely prudent nor was nurse jamiesonher menial situation and her excessive partiality for her fosterson consideredaltogether such a matron as could afford her protection gideon however knew that his daughter possessed in its fullest extent the upright and pure integrity of his own character and that never father had less reason to apprehend that a daughter should deceive his confidence and justly secure of her principles he overlooked the danger to which he exposed her feelings and affections  the intercourse betwixt menie and the young men seemed now of a guarded kind on all sides their meeting was only at meals and miss gray was at pains perhaps by her fathers recommendation to treat them with the same degree of attention this however was no easy matter for hartley became so retiring cold and formal that it was impossible for her to sustain any prolonged intercourse with him whereas middlemas perfectly at his ease sustained his part as formerly upon all occasions that occurred and without appearing to press his intimacy assiduously seemed nevertheless to retain the complete possession of it  the time drew nigh at length when the young men freed from the engagements of their indentures must look to play their own independent part in the world mr gray informed richard middlemas that he had written pressingly upon the subject to moncada and that more than once but had not yet received an answer nor did he presume to offer his own advice until the pleasure of his grandfather should be known richard seemed to endure this suspense with more patience than the doctor thought belonged naturally to his character he asked no questionsstated no conjecturesshowed no anxiety but seemed to await with patience the turn which events should take my young gentleman thought mr gray has either fixed on some course in his own mind or he is about to be more tractable than some points of his character have led me to expect  in fact richard had made an experiment on this inflexible relative by sending mr moncada a letter full of duty and affection and gratitude desiring to be permitted to correspond with him in person and promising to be guided in every particular by his will the answer to this appeal was his own letter returned with a note from the bankers whose cover had been used saying that any future attempt to intrude on mr moncada would put a final period to their remittances  while things were in this situation in stevenlaws land adam hartley one evening contrary to his custom for several months sought a private interview with his fellowapprentice he found him in the little arbour and could not omit observing that dick middlemas on his appearance shoved into his bosom a small packet as if afraid of its being seen and snatching up a hoe began to work with great devotion like one who wished to have it thought that his whole soul was in his occupation  i wished to speak with you mr middlemas said hartley but i fear i interrupt you  not in the least said the other laying down his hoe i was only scratching up the weeds which the late showers have made rush up so numerously i am at your service  hartley proceeded to the arbour and seated himself richard imitated his example and seemed to wait for the proposed communication  i have had an interesting communication with mr graysaid hartley and there stopped like one who finds himself entering upon a difficult task  i hope the explanation has been satisfactory said middlemas  you shall judgedoctor gray was pleased to say something to me very civil about my proficiency in the duties of our profession and to my great astonishment asked me whether as he was now becoming old i had any particular objection to continue in my present situation but with some pecuniary advantages for two years longer at the end of which he promised to me that i should enter into partnership with him  mr gray is an undoubted judge said middlemas what person will best suit him as a professional assistant the business may be worth l200 ayear and an active assistant might go nigh to double it by riding strathdevan and the carse no great subject for division after all mr hartley  but continued hartley that is not all the doctor sayshe proposesin short if i can render myself agreeable in the course of these two years to miss menie gray he proposes that when they terminate i should become his son as well as his partner  as he spoke he kept his eye fixed on richards face which was for a moment strongly agitated but instantly recovering he answered in a tone where pique and offended pride vainly endeavoured to disguise themselves under an affectation of indifference well master adam i cannot but wish you joy of the patriarchal arrangement you have served five years for a professional diplomaa sort of leah that privilege of killing and curing now you begin a new course of servitude for a lovely rachel undoubtedlyperhaps it is rude in me to askbut undoubtedly you have accepted so flattering an arrangement  you cannot but recollect there was a condition annexed said hartley gravely  that of rendering yourself acceptable to a girl you have known for so many years said middlemas with a halfsuppressed sneer no great difficulty in that i should think for such a person as mr hartley with doctor grays favour to back him no nothere could be no great obstacle there  both you and i know the contrary mr middlemas said hartley very seriously  i knowhow should i know any thing more than yourself about the state of miss grays inclinations said middlemas i am sure we have had equal access to know them  perhaps so but some know better how to avail themselves of opportunities mr middlemas i have long suspected that you have had the inestimable advantages of possessing miss grays affections and  i interrupted middlemas you are jesting or you are jealous you do yourself less and me more than justice but the compliment is so great that i am obliged to you for the mistake  that you may know answered hartley i do not speak either by guess or from what you call jealousy i tell you frankly that menie gray herself told me the state of her affections i naturally communicated to her the discourse i had with her father i told her i was but too well convinced that at the present moment i did not possess that interest in her heart which alone might entitle me to request her acquiescence in the views which her fathers goodness held out to me but i entreated her not at once to decide against me but give me an opportunity to make way in her affections if possible trusting that time and the services which i should render to her father might have an ultimate effect in my favour  a most natural and modest request but what did the young lady say in reply  she is a noblehearted girl richard middlemas and for her frankness alone even without her beauty and her good sense deserves an emperor i cannot express the graceful modesty with which she told me that she knew too well the kindliness as she was pleased to call it of my heart to expose me to the protracted pain of an unrequited passion she candidly informed me that she had been long engaged to you in secretthat you had exchanged portraitsand though without her fathers consent she would never become yours yet she felt it impossible that she should ever so far change her sentiments as to afford the most distant prospect of success to another  upon my word said middlemas she has been extremely candid indeed and i am very much obliged to her  and upon my honest word mr middlemas returned hartley you do miss gray the greatest injusticenay you are ungrateful to her if you are displeased at her making this declaration she loves you as a woman loves the first object of her affectionshe loves you betterhe stopped and middlemas completed the sentence  better than i deserve perhapsfaith it may well be so and i love her dearly in return but after all you know the secret was mine as well as hers and it would have been better that she had consulted me before making it public  mr middlemas said hartley earnestly if the least of this feeling on your part arises from the apprehension that your secret is less safe because it is in my keeping i can assure you that such is my grateful sense of miss grays goodness in communicating to save me pain an affair of such delicacy to herself and you that wild horses should tear me limb from limb before they forced a word of it from my lips  nay nay my dear friend said middlemas with a frankness of manner indicating a cordiality that had not existed between them for some time you must allow me to be a little jealous in my turn your true lover cannot have a title to the name unless he be sometimes unreasonable and somehow it seems odd she should have chosen for a confidant one whom i have often thought a formidable rival and yet i am so far from being displeased that i do not know that the dear sensible girl could after all have made a better choice it is time that the foolish coldness between us should be ended as you must be sensible that its real cause lay in our rivalry i have much need of good advice and who can give it to me better than the old companion whose soundness of judgment i have always envied even when some injudicious friends have given me credit for quicker parts  hartley accepted richards proffered hand but without any of the buoyancy of spirit with which it was offered  i do not intend he said to remain many days in this place perhaps not very many hours but if in the meanwhile i can benefit you by advice or otherwise you may fully command me it is the only mode in which i can be of service to menie gray  love my mistress love me a happy pendant to the old proverb love me love my dog well then for menie grays sake if not for dick middlemass plague on that vulgar telltale name will you that are a standerby tell us who are the unlucky players what you think of this game of ours  how can you ask such a question when the field lies so fair before you i am sure that dr gray would retain you as his assistant upon the same terms which he proposed to me you are the better match in all worldly respects for his daughter having some capital to begin the world with  all truebut methinks mr gray has showed no great predilection for me in this matter  if he has done injustice to your indisputable merit said hartley dryly the preference of his daughter has more than atoned for it  unquestionably and dearly therefore do i love her otherwise adam i am not a person to grasp at the leavings of other people  richard replied hartley that pride of yours if you do not check it will render you both ungrateful and miserable mr grays ideas are most friendly he told me plainly that his choice of me as an assistant and as a member of his family had been a long time balanced by his early affection for you until he thought he had remarked in you a decisive discontent with such limited prospects as his offer contained and a desire to go abroad into the world and push as it is called your fortune he said that although it was very probable that you might love his daughter well enough to relinquish these ambitious ideas for her sake yet the demons of ambition and avarice would return after the exorciser love had exhausted the force of his spells and then he thought he would have just reason to be anxious for his daughters happiness  by my faith the worthy senior speaks scholarly and wisely answered richardi did not think he had been so clearsighted to say the truth but for the beautiful menie gray i should feel like a millhorse walking my daily round in this dull country while other gay rovers are trying how the world will receive them for instance where do you yourself go  a cousin of my mothers commands a ship in the companys service i intend to go with him as surgeons mate if i like the sea service i will continue in it if not i will enter some other line this hartley said with a sigh  to india answered richard happy dogto india you may well bear with equanimity all disappointments sustained on this side of the globe oh delhi oh golconda have your names no power to conjure down idle recollectionsindia where gold is won by steel where a brave man cannot pitch his desire for fame and wealth so high but that he may realize it if he have fortune to his friend is it possible that the bold adventurer can fix his thoughts on you and still be dejected at the thoughts that a bonny blueeyed lass looked favourably on a less lucky fellow than himself can this be  less lucky said hartley can you the accepted lover of menie gray speak in that tone even though it be in jest  nay adam said richard dont be angry with me because being thus far successful i rate my good fortune not quite so rapturously as perhaps you do who have missed the luck of it your philosophy should tell you that the object which we attain or are sure of attaining loses perhaps even by that very certainty a little of the extravagant and ideal value which attached to it while the object of feverish hopes and aguish fears but for all that i cannot live without my sweet menie i would wed her tomorrow with all my soul without thinking a minute on the clog which so early a marriage would fasten on our heels but to spend two additional years in this infernal wilderness cruising after crowns and halfcrowns when worse men are making lacs and crores of rupeesit is a sad falling off adam counsel me my friendcan you not suggest some mode of getting off from these two years of destined dulness  not i replied hartley scarce repressing his displeasure and if i could induce dr gray to dispense with so reasonable a condition i should be very sorry to do so you are but twentyone and if such a period of probation was in the doctors prudence judged necessary for me who am full two years older i have no idea that he will dispense with it in yours  perhaps not replied middlemas but do you not think that these two or call them three years of probation had better be spent in india where much may be done in a little while than here where nothing can be done save just enough to get salt to our broth or broth to our salt methinks i have a natural turn for india and so i ought my father was a soldier by the conjecture of all who saw him and gave me a love of the sword and an arm to use one my mothers father was a rich trafficker who loved wealth i warrant me and knew how to get it this petty two hundred ayear with its miserable and precarious possibilities to be shared with the old gentleman sounds in the ears of one like me who have the world for the winning and a sword to cut my way through it like something little better than a decent kind of beggary menie is in herself a gema diamondi admit it but then one would not set such a precious jewel in lead or popper but in pure gold ay and add a circlet of brilliants to set it off with be a good fellow adam and undertake the setting my project in proper colours before the doctor i am sure the wisest thing for him and menie both is to permit me to spend this short time of probation in the land of cowries i am sure my heart will be there at any rate and while i am bleeding some bumpkin for an inflammation i shall be in fancy relieving some nabob or rajahpoot of his plethora of wealth comewill you assist will you be auxiliary ten chances but you plead your own cause man for i may be brought up by a sabre or a bowstring before i make my pack up then your road to menie will be free and open and as you will be possessed of the situation of comforter ex officio you may take her with the tear in her ee as old saws advise  mr richard middlemas said hartley i wish it were possible for me to tell you in the few words which i intend to bestow on you whether i pity you or despise you the most heaven has placed happiness competence and content within your power and you are willing to cast them away to gratify ambition and avarice were i to give any advice on this subject either to dr gray or his daughter it would be to break of all connexion with a man who however clever by nature may soon show himself a fool and however honestly brought up may also upon temptation prove himself a villainyou may lay aside the sneer which is designed to be a sarcastic smile i will not attempt to do this because i am convinced that my advice would be of no use unless it could come unattended with suspicion of my motives i will hasten my departure from this house that we may not meet again and i will leave it to god almighty to protect honesty and innocence against the dangers which must attend vanity and folly so saying he turned contemptuously from the youthful votary of ambition and left the garden  stop said middlemas struck with the picture which had been held up to his consciencestop adam hartley and i will confess to you but his words were uttered in a faint and hesitating manner and either never reached hartleys ear or failed in changing his purpose of departure  when he was out of the garden middlemas began to recall his usual boldness of dispositionhad he staid a moment longer he said i would have turned papist and made him my ghostly confessor the yeomanly churli would give something to know how he has got such a hank over me what are menie grays engagements to him she has given him his answer and what right has he to come betwixt her and me if old moncada had done a grandfathers duty and made suitable settlements on me this plan of marrying the sweet girl and settling here in her native place might have done well enough but to live the life of the poor drudge her fatherto be at the command and call of every boor for twenty miles roundwhy the labours of a higgler who travels scores of miles to barter pins ribbons snuff and tobacco against the housewifes private stock of eggs mortskins and tallow is more profitable less laborious and faith i think equally respectable no nounless i can find wealth nearer home i will seek it where every one can have it for the gathering and so i will down to the swan inn and hold a final consultation with my friend     chapter the fifth   the friend whom middlemas expected to meet at the swan was a person already mentioned in this history by the name of tom hillary bred an attorneys clerk in the ancient town of novum castrumdoctus utriusque juris as far as a few months in the service of mr lawford townclerk of middlemas could render him so the last mention that we made of this gentleman was when his goldlaced hat veiled its splendour before the fresher mounted beavers of the prentices of dr gray that was now about five years since and it was within six months that he had made his appearance in middlemas a very different sort of personage from that which he seemed at his departure  he was now called captain his dress was regimental and his language martial he appeared to have plenty of cash for he not only to the great surprise of the parties paid certain old debts which he had left unsettled behind him and that notwithstanding his having as his old practice told him a good defence of prescription but even sent the minister a guinea to the assistance of the parish poor these acts of justice and benevolence were bruited abroad greatly to the honour of one who so long absent had neither forgotten his just debts nor hardened his heart against the cries of the needy his merits were thought the higher when it was understood he had served the honourable east india companythat wonderful company of merchants who may indeed with the strictest propriety be termed princes it was about the middle of the eighteenth century and the directors in leadenhall street were silently laying the foundation of that immense empire which afterwards rose like an exhalation and now astonishes europe as well as asia with its formidable extent and stupendous strength britain had now begun to lend a wondering ear to the account of battles fought and cities won in the east and was surprised by the return of individuals who had left their native country as adventurers but now reappeared there surrounded by oriental wealth and oriental luxury which dimmed even the splendour of the most wealthy of the british nobility in this newfound el dorada hillary had it seems been a labourer and if he told truth to some purpose though he was far from having completed the harvest which he meditated he spoke indeed of making investments and as a mere matter of fancy he consulted his old master clerk lawford concerning the purchase of a moorland farm of three thousand acres for which he would be content to give three or four thousand guineas providing the game was plenty and the trouting in the brook such as had been represented by advertisement but he did not wish to make any extensive landed purchase at present it was necessary to keep up his interest in leadenhall street and in that view it would be impolitic to part with his india stock and india bonds in short it was folly to think of settling on a poor thousand or twelve hundred a year when one was in the prime of life and had no liver complaint and so he was determined to double the cape once again ere he retired to the chimney corner for life all he wished was to pick up a few clever fellows for his regiment or rather for his own company and as in all his travels he had never seen finer fellows than about middlemas he was willing to give them the preference in completing his levy in fact it was making men of them at once for a few white faces never failed to strike terror into these black rascals and then not to mention the good things that were going at the storming of a pettah or the plundering of a pagoda most of these tawny dogs carried so much treasure about their persons that a won battle was equal to a mine of gold to the victors  the natives of middlemas listened to the noble captains marvels with different feelings as their temperaments were saturnine or sanguine but none could deny that such things had been and as the narrator was known to be a bold dashing fellow possessed of some abilities and according to the general opinion not likely to be withheld by any peculiar scruples of conscience there was no giving any good reason why hillary should not have been as successful as others in the field which india agitated as it was by war and intestine disorders seemed to offer to every enterprising adventurer he was accordingly received by his old acquaintances at middlemas rather with the respect due to his supposed wealth than in a manner corresponding with his former humble pretensions  some of the notables of the village did indeed keep aloof among these the chief was dr gray who was an enemy to every thing that approached to fanfaronade and knew enough of the world to lay it down as a sort of general rule that he who talks a great deal of fighting is seldom a brave soldier and he who always speaks about wealth is seldom a rich man at bottom clerk lawford was also shy notwithstanding his communings with hillary upon the subject of his intended purchase the coolness of the captains old employer towards him was by some supposed to arise out of certain circumstances attending their former connexion but as the clerk himself never explained what these were it is unnecessary to make any conjectures upon the subject  richard middlemas very naturally renewed his intimacy with his former comrade and it was from hillarys conversation that he had adopted the enthusiasm respecting india which we have heard him express it was indeed impossible for a youth at once inexperienced in the world and possessed of a most sanguine disposition to listen without sympathy to the glowing descriptions of hillary who though only a recruiting captain had all the eloquence of a recruiting sergeant palaces rose like mushrooms in his descriptions groves of lofty trees and aromatic shrubs unknown to the chilly soils of europe were tenanted by every object of the chase from the royal tiger down to the jackal the luxuries of a natch and the peculiar oriental beauty of the enchantresses who perfumed their voluptuous eastern domes for the pleasure of the haughty english conquerors were no less attractive than the battles and sieges on which the captain at other times expatiated not a stream did he mention but flowed over sands of gold and not a palace that was inferior to those of the celebrated fata morgana his descriptions seemed steeped in odours and his every phrase perfumed in ottar of roses the interviews at which these descriptions took place often ended in a bottle of choicer wine than the swan inn afforded with some other appendages of the table which the captain who was a bonvivant had procured from edinburgh from this good cheer middlemas was doomed to retire to the homely evening meal of his master where not all the simple beauties of menie were able to overcome his disgust at the coarseness of the provisions or his unwillingness to answer questions concerning the diseases of the wretched peasants who were subjected to his inspection  richards hopes of being acknowledged by his father had long since vanished and the rough repulse and subsequent neglect on the part of moncada had satisfied him that his grandfather was inexorable and that neither then nor at any future time did he mean to realize the visions which nurse jamiesons splendid figments had encouraged him to entertain ambition however was not lulled to sleep though it was no longer nourished by the same hopes which had at first awakened it the indian captains lavish oratory supplied the themes which had been at first derived from the legends of the nursery the exploits of a lawrence and a clive as well as the magnificent opportunities of acquiring wealth to which these exploits opened the road disturbed the slumbers of the young adventurer there was nothing to counteract these except his love for menie gray and the engagements into which it had led him but his addresses had been paid to menie as much for the gratification of his vanity as from any decided passion for that innocent and guileless being he was desirous of carrying off the prize for which hartley whom he never loved had the courage to contend with him then menie gray had been beheld with admiration by men his superiors in rank and fortune but with whom his ambition incited him to dispute the prize no doubt though urged to play the gallant at first rather from vanity than any other cause the frankness and modesty with which his suit was admitted made their natural impression on his heart he was grateful to the beautiful creature who acknowledged the superiority of his person and accomplishments and fancied himself as devotedly attached to her as her personal charms and mental merits would have rendered any one who was less vain or selfish than her lover still his passion for the surgeons daughter ought not he prudentially determined to bear more than its due weight in a case so very important as the determining his line of life and this he smoothed over to his conscience by repeating to himself that menies interest was as essentially concerned as his own in postponing their marriage to the establishment of his fortune how many young couples had been ruined by a premature union  the contemptuous conduct of hartley in their last interview had done something to shake his comrades confidence in the truth of this reasoning and to lead him to suspect that he was playing a very sordid and unmanly part in trifling with the happiness of this amiable and unfortunate young woman it was in this doubtful humour that he repaired to the swan inn where he was anxiously expected by his friend the captain  when they were comfortably seated over a bottle of paxarete middlemas began with characteristical caution to sound his friend about the ease or difficulty with which an individual desirous of entering the companys service might have an opportunity of getting a commission if hillary had answered truly he would have replied that it was extremely easy for at that time the east india service presented no charms to that superior class of people who have since struggled for admittance under its banners but the worthy captain replied that though in the general case it might be difficult for a young man to obtain a commission without serving for some years as a cadet yet under his own protection a young man entering his regiment and fitted for such a situation might be sure of an ensigncy if not a lieutenancy as soon as ever they set foot in india if you my dear fellow continued he extending his hand to middlemas would think of changing sheephead broth and haggis for mulagatawny and curry i can only say that though it is indispensable that you should enter the service at first simply as a cadet yet by you should live like a brother on the passage with me and no sooner were we through the surf at madras than i would put you in the way of acquiring both wealth and glory you have i think some trifle of moneya couple of thousands or so  about a thousand or twelve hundred said richard affecting the indifference of his companion but feeling privately humbled by the scantiness of his resources  it is quite as much as you will find necessary for the outfit and passage said his adviser and indeed if you had not a farthing it would be the same thing for if i once say to a friend ill help you tom hillary is not the man to start for fear of the cowries however it is as well you have something of a capital of your own to begin upon  yes replied the proselyte i should not like to be a burden on any one i have some thoughts to tell you the truth to marry before i leave britain and in that case you know cash will be necessary whether my wife goes out with us or remains behind till she hear how luck goes with me so after all i may have to borrow a few hundreds of you  what the devil is that you say dick about marrying and giving in marriage replied his friend what can put it into the head of a gallant young fellow like you just rising twentyone and six feet high on your stockingsoles to make a slave of yourself for life no no dick that will never do remember the old song    bachelor bluff bachelor bluff     hey for a heart that is rugged and tough  ay ay that sounds very well replied middlemas but then one must shake off a number of old recollections  the sooner the better dick old recollections are like old clothes and should be sent off by wholesale they only take up room in ones wardrobe and it would be oldfashioned to wear them but you look grave upon it who the devil is it that has made such a hole in your heart  pshaw answered middlemas im sure you must remembermeniemy masters daughter  what miss green the old pottercarriers daughtera likely girl enough i think  my master is a surgeon said richard not an apothecary and his name is gray  ay ay green or graywhat does it signify he sells his own drugs i think which we in the south call being a pottercarrier the girl is a likely girl enough for a scottish ballroom but is she up to any thing has she any nouz  why she is a sensible girl save in loving me answered richard and that as benedict says is no proof of her wisdom and no great argument of her folly  but has she spiritspunkdasha spice of the devil about her  not a pennyweightthe kindest simplest and most manageable of human beings answered the lover  she wont do then said the monitor in a decisive tone i am sorry for it dick but she will never do there are some women in the world that can bear their share in the bustling life we live in indiaay and i have known some of them drag forward husbands that would otherwise have stuck fast in the mud till the day of judgment heaven knows how they paid the turnpikes they pushed them through but these were none of your simple susans that think their eyes are good for nothing but to look at their husbands or their fingers but to sew babyclothes depend on it you must give up your matrimony or your views of preferment if you wilfully tie a clog round your throat never think of running a race but do not suppose that your breaking off with the lass will make any very terrible catastrophe a scene there may be at parting but you will soon forget her among the native girls and she will fall in love with mr tapeitout the ministers assistant and successor she is not goods for the indian market i assure you  among the capricious weaknesses of humanity that one is particularly remarkable which inclines us to esteem persons and things not by their real value or even by our own judgment so much as by the opinion of others who are often very incompetent judges dick middlemas had been urged forward in his suit to menie gray by his observing how much her partner a booby laird had been captivated by her and she was now lowered in his esteem because an impudent lowlived coxcomb had presumed to talk of her with disparagement either of these worthy gentlemen would have been as capable of enjoying the beauties of homer as judging of the merits of menie gray  indeed the ascendency which this boldtalking promisemaking soldier had acquired over dick middlemas wilful as he was in general was of a despotic nature because the captain though greatly inferior in information and talent to the youth whose opinions he swayed had skill in suggesting those tempting views of rank and wealth to which richards imagination had been from childhood most accessible one promise he exacted from middlemas as a condition of the services which he was to render himit was absolute silence on the subject of his destination for india and the views upon which it took place my recruits said the captain have been all marched off for the depot at the isle of wight and i want to leave scotland and particularly this little burgh without being worried to death of which i must despair should it come to be known that i can provide young griffins as we call them with commissions gad i should carry off all the firstborn of middlemas as cadets and none are so scrupulous as i am about making promises i am as trusty as a trojan for that and you know i cannot do that for every one which i would for an old friend like dick middlemas  dick promised secrecy and it was agreed that the two friends should not even leave the burgh in company but that the captain should set off first and his recruit should join him at edinburgh where his enlistment might be attested and then they were to travel together to town and arrange matters for their indian voyage  notwithstanding the definitive arrangement which was thus made for his departure middlemas thought from time to time with anxiety and regret about quitting menie gray after the engagement which had passed between them the resolution was taken however the blow was necessarily to be struck and her ungrateful lover long since determined against the life of domestic happiness which he might have enjoyed had his views been better regulated was now occupied with the means not indeed of breaking off with her entirely but of postponing all thoughts of their union until the success of his expedition to india  he might have spared himself all anxiety on this last subject the wealth of that india to which he was bound would not have bribed menie gray to have left her fathers roof against her fathers commands still less when deprived of his two assistants he must be reduced to the necessity of continued exertion in his declining life and therefore might have accounted himself altogether deserted had his daughter departed from him at the same time but though it would have been her unalterable determination not to accept any proposal of an immediate union of their fortunes menie could not with all a lovers power of selfdeception succeed in persuading herself to be satisfied with richards conduct towards her modesty and a becoming pride prevented her from seeming to notice but could not prevent her from bitterly feeling that her lover was preferring the pursuits of ambition to the humble lot which he might have shared with her and which promised content at least if not wealth  if he had loved me as he pretended such was the unwilling conviction that rose on her mind my father would surely not have ultimately refused him the same terms which he held out to hartley his objections would have given way to my happiness nay to richards importunities which would have removed his suspicions of the unsettled cast of his disposition but i feari fear richard hardly thought the terms proposed were worthy of his acceptance would it not have been natural too that he should have asked me engaged as we stand to each other to have united our faith before his quitting europe when i might either have remained here with my father or accompanied him to india in quest of that fortune which he is so eagerly pushing for it would have been wrongvery wrongin me to have consented to such a proposal unless my father had authorised it but surely it would have been natural that richard should have offered it alas men do not know how to love like women their attachment is only one of a thousand other passions and predilectionsthey are daily engaged in pleasures which blunt their feelings and in business which distracts them wewe sit at home to weep and to think how coldly our affections are repaid  the time was now arrived at which richard middlemas had a right to demand the property vested in the hands of the townclerk and doctor gray he did so and received it accordingly his late guardian naturally enquired what views he had formed in entering on life the imagination of the ambitious aspirant saw in this simple question a desire on the part of the worthy man to offer and perhaps press upon him the same proposal which he had made to hartley he hastened therefore to answer dryly that he had some hopes held out to him which he was not at liberty to communicate but that the instant he reached london he would write to the guardian of his youth and acquaint him with the nature of his prospects which he was happy to say were rather of a pleasing character  gideon who supposed that at this critical period of his life the father or grandfather of the young man might perhaps have intimated a disposition to open some intercourse with him only repliedyou have been the child of mystery richard and as you came to me so you leave me then i was ignorant from whence you came and now i know not whither you are going it is not perhaps a very favourable point in your horoscope that every thing connected with you is a secret but as i shall always think with kindness on him whom i have known so long so when you remember the old man you ought not to forget that he has done his duty to you to the extent of his means and power and taught you that noble profession by means of which wherever your lot casts you you may always gain your bread and alleviate at the same time the distresses of your fellow creatures middlemas was excited by the simple kindness of his master and poured forth his thanks with the greater profusion that he was free from the terror of the emblematical collar and chain which a moment before seemed to glisten in the hand of his guardian and gape to enclose his neck  one word more said mr gray producing a small ringcase this valuable ring was forced upon me by your unfortunate mother i have no right to it having been amply paid for my services and i only accepted it with the purpose of keeping it for you till this moment should arrive it may be useful perhaps should there occur any question about your identity  thanks once more my more than father for this precious relic which may indeed be useful you shall be repaid if india has diamonds left  india and diamonds said gray is your head turned child  i mean stammered middlemas if london has any indian diamonds  pooh you foolish lad answered gray how should you buy diamonds or what should i do with them if you gave me ever so many get you gone with you while i am angrythe tears were glistening in the old mans eyesif i get pleased with you again i shall not know how to part with you  the parting of middlemas with poor menie was yet more affecting her sorrow revived in his mind all the liveliness of a first love and he redeemed his character for sincere attachment by not only imploring an instant union but even going so far as to propose renouncing his more splendid prospects and sharing mr grays humble toil if by doing so he could secure his daughters hand but though there was consolation in this testimony of her lovers faith menie gray was not so unwise as to accept of sacrifices which might afterwards have been repented of  no richard she said it seldom ends happily when people alter in a moment of agitated feeling plans which might have been adopted under mature deliberation i have long seen that your views were extended far beyond so humble a station as this place affords promise of it is natural they should do so considering that the circumstances of your birth seemed connected with riches and with rank go then seek that riches and rank it is possible your mind may be changed in the pursuit and if so think no more about menie gray but if it should be otherwise we may meet again and do not believe for a moment that there can be a change in menie grays feelings towards you  at this interview much more was said than it is necessary to repeat much more thought than was actually said nurse jamieson in whose chamber it took place folded her bairns as she called them in her arms and declared that heaven had made them for each other and that she would not ask of heaven to live beyond the day when she should see them bridegroom and bride  at length it became necessary that the parting scene should end and richard middlemas mounting a horse which he had hired for the journey set off for edinburgh to which metropolis he had already forwarded his heavy baggage upon the road the idea more than once occurred to him that even yet he had better return to middlemas and secure his happiness by uniting himself at once to menie gray and to humble competence but from the moment that he rejoined his friend hillary at their appointed place of rendezvous he became ashamed even to hint at any change of purpose and his late excited feelings were forgotten unless in so far as they confirmed his resolution that as soon as he had attained a certain portion of wealth and consequence he would haste to share them with menie gray yet his gratitude to her father did not appear to have slumbered if we may judge from the gift of a very handsome cornelian seal set in gold and bearing engraved upon it gules a lion rampant within a bordure or which was carefully despatched to stevenlaws land middlemas with a suitable letter menie knew the handwriting and watched her fathers looks as he read it thinking perhaps that it had turned on a different topic her father pshawed and poohed a good deal when he had finished the billet and examined the seal  dick middlemas he said is but a fool after all menie i am sure i am not like to forget him that he should send me a token of remembrance add if he would be so absurd could he not have sent me the improved lithotomical apparatus and what have i gideon gray to do with the arms of my lord grayno nomy old silver stamp with the double g upon it will serve my turnbut put the bonnie dye footnote pretty toy away menie my dearit was kindly meant at any rate  the reader cannot doubt that the seal was safely and carefully preserved     chapter the sixth     a lazarhouse it seemed wherein were laid   numbers of all diseased                                      milton  after the captain had finished his business amongst which he did not forget to have his recruit regularly attested as a candidate for glory in the service of the honourable east india company the friends left edinburgh from thence they got a passage by sea to newcastle where hillary had also some regimental affairs to transact before he joined his regiment at newcastle the captain had the good luck to find a small brig commanded by an old acquaintance and schoolfellow which was just about to sail for the isle of wight i have arranged for our passage with him he said to middlemasfor when you are at the depot you can learn a little of your duty which cannot be so well taught on board of ship and then i will find it easier to have you promoted  do you mean said richard that i am to stay at the isle of wight all the time that you are jigging it away in london  ay indeed do i said his comrade and its best for you too whatever business you have in london i can do it for you as well or something better than yourself  but i choose to transact my own business myself captain hillary said richard  then you ought to have remained your own master mr cadet middlemas at present you are an enlisted recruit of the honourable east india company i am your officer and should you hesitate to follow me aboard why you foolish fellow i could have you sent on board in handcuffs  this was jestingly spoken but yet there was something in the tone which hurt middlemass pride and alarmed his fears he had observed of late that his friend especially when in company of others talked to him with an air of command or superiority difficult to be endured and yet so closely allied to the freedom often exercised betwixt two intimates that he could not find any proper mode of rebuffing or resenting it such manifestations of authority were usually followed by an instant renewal of their intimacy but in the present case that did not so speedily ensue  middlemas indeed consented to go with his companion to the isle of wight perhaps because if he should quarrel with him the whole plan of his indian voyage and all the hopes built upon it must fall to the ground but he altered his purpose of intrusting his comrade with his little fortune to lay out as his occasions might require and resolved himself to overlook the expenditure of his money which in the form of bank of england notes was safely deposited in his travelling trunk captain hillary finding that some hint he had thrown out on this subject was disregarded appeared to think no more about it  the voyage was performed with safety and celerity and having coasted the shores of that beautiful island which he who once sees never forgets through whatever part of the world his future path may lead him the vessel was soon anchored off the little town of ryde and as the waves were uncommonly still richard felt the sickness diminish which for a considerable part of the passage had occupied his attention more than any thing else  the master of the brig in honour to his passengers and affection to his old schoolfellow had formed an awning upon deck and proposed to have the pleasure of giving them a little treat before they left his vessel lobscous seapie and other delicacies of a naval description had been provided in a quantity far disproportionate to the number of the guests but the punch which succeeded was of excellent quality and portentously strong captain hillary pushed it round and insisted upon his companion taking his full share in the merry bout the rather that as he facetiously said there had been some dryness between them which good liquor would be sovereign in removing he renewed with additional splendours the various panoramic scenes of india and indian adventures which had first excited the ambition of middlemas and assured him that even if he should not be able to get him a commission instantly yet a short delay would only give him time to become better acquainted with his military duties and middlemas was too much elevated by the liquor he had drank to see any difficulty which could oppose itself to his fortunes whether those who shared in the compotation were more seasoned toperswhether middlemas drank more than theyor whether as he himself afterwards suspected his cup had been drugged like those of king duncans bodyguard it is certain that on this occasion he passed with unusual rapidity through all the different phases of the respectable state of drunkennesslaughed sung whooped and hallooed was maudlin in his fondness and frantic in his wrath and at length fell into a fast and imperturbable sleep  the effect of the liquor displayed itself as usual in a hundred wild dreams of parched deserts and of serpents whose bite inflicted the most intolerable thirstof the suffering of the indian on the deathstakeand the torments of the infernal regions themselves when at length he awakened and it appeared that the latter vision was in fact realized the sounds which had at first influenced his dreams and at length broken his slumbers were of the most horrible as well as the most melancholy description they came from the ranges of palletbeds which were closely packed together in a species of military hospital where a burning fever was the prevalent complaint many of the patients were under the influence of a high delirium during which they shouted shrieked laughed blasphemed and uttered the most horrible imprecations others sensible of their condition bewailed it with low groans and some attempts at devotion which showed their ignorance of the principles and even the forms of religion those who were convalescent talked ribaldry in a loud tone or whispered to each other in cant language upon schemes which as far as a passing phrase could be understood by a novice had relation to violent and criminal exploits  richard middlemass astonishment was equal to his horror he had but one advantage over the poor wretches with whom he was classed and it was in enjoying the luxury of a pallet to himselfmost of the others being occupied by two unhappy beings he saw no one who appeared to attend to the wants or to heed the complaints of the wretches around him or to whom he could offer any appeal against his present situation he looked for his clothes that he might arise and extricate himself from this den of horrors but his clothes were nowhere to be seen nor did he see his portmanteau or seachest it was much to be apprehended he would never see them more  then but too late he remembered the insinuations which had passed current respecting his friend the captain who was supposed to have been discharged by mr lawford on account of some breach of trust in the townclerks service but that he should have trepanned the friend who had reposed his whole confidence in himthat he should have plundered him of his fortune and placed him in this house of pestilence with the hope that death might stifle his tonguewere iniquities not to have been anticipated even if the worst of these reports were true  but middlemas resolved not to be awanting to himself this place must be visited by some officer military or medical to whom he would make an appeal and alarm his fears at least if he could not awaken his conscience while he revolved these distracting thoughts tormented at the same time by a burning thirst which he had no means of satisfying he endeavoured to discover if amongst those stretched upon the pallets nearest him he could not discern some one likely to enter into conversation with him and give him some information about the nature and customs of this horrid place but the bed nearest him was occupied by two fellows who although to judge from their gaunt cheeks hollow eyes and ghastly looks they were apparently recovering from the disease and just rescued from the jaws of death were deeply engaged in endeavouring to cheat each other of a few halfpence at a game of cribbage mixing the terms of the game with oaths not loud but deep each turn of luck being hailed by the winner as well as the loser with execrations which seemed designed to blight both body and soul now used as the language of triumph and now as reproaches against fortune  next to the gamblers was a pallet occupied indeed by two bodies but only one of which was livingthe other sufferer had been recently relieved from his agony  he is deadhe is dead said the wretched survivor  then do you die too and be dd answered one of the players and then there will be a pair of you as pugg says  i tell you he is growing stiff and cold said the poor wretchthe dead is no bedfellow for the livingfor gods sake help to rid me of the corpse  ay and get the credit of having done himas may be the case with yourself friendfor he had some two or three hoggs about him  you know you took the last rap from his breechespocket not an hour ago expostulated the poor convalescentbut help me to take the body out of the bed and i will not tell the jiggerdubber that you have been beforehand with him  you tell the jiggerdubber answered the cribbage player such another word and i will twist your head round till your eyes look at the drummers handwriting on your back hold your peace and dont bother our game with your gammon or i will make you as mute as your bedfellow  the unhappy wretch exhausted sunk back beside his hideous companion and the usual jargon of the game interlarded with execrations went on as before  from this specimen of the most obdurate indifference contrasted with the last excess of misery middlemas became satisfied how little could be made of an appeal to the humanity of his fellowsufferers his heart sunk within him and the thoughts of the happy and peaceful home which he might have called his own rose before his overheated fancy with a vividness of perception that bordered upon insanity he saw before him the rivulet which wanders through the burghmuir of middlemas where he had so often set little mills for the amusement of menie while she was a child one draught of it would have been worth all the diamonds of the east which of late he had worshipped with such devotion but that draught was denied to him as to tantalus  rallying his senses from this passing illusion and knowing enough of the practice of the medical art to be aware of the necessity of preventing his ideas from wandering if possible he endeavoured to recollect that he was a surgeon and after all should not have the extreme fear for the interior of a military hospital which its horrors might inspire into strangers to the profession but though he strove by such recollections to rally his spirits he was not the less aware of the difference betwixt the condition of a surgeon who might have attended such a place in the course of his duty and a poor inhabitant who was at once a patient and a prisoner  a footstep was now heard in the apartment which seemed to silence all the varied sounds of woe that filled it the cribbage party hid their cards and ceased their oaths other wretches whose complaints had arisen to frenzy left off their wild exclamations and entreaties for assistance agony softened her shriek insanity hushed its senseless clamours and even death seemed desirous to stifle his parting groan in the presence of captain seelencooper this official was the superintendent or as the miserable inhabitants termed him the governor of the hospital he had all the air of having been originally a turnkey in some illregulated jaila stout short bandylegged man with one eye and a double portion of ferocity in that which remained he wore an oldfashioned tarnished uniform which did not seem to have been made for him and the voice in which this minister of humanity addressed the sick was that of a boatswain shouting in the midst of a storm he had pistols and a cutlass in his belt for his mode of administration being such as provoked even hospital patients to revolt his life had been more than once in danger amongst them he was followed by two assistants who carried handcuffs and straitjackets  as seelencooper made his rounds complaint and pain were hushed and the flourish of the bamboo which he bore in his hand seemed powerful as the wand of a magician to silence all complaint and remonstrance  i tell you the meat is as sweet as a nosegayand for the bread its good enough and too good for a set of lubbers that lie shamming abraham and consuming the right honourable companys victualsi dont speak to them that are really sick for god knows i am always for humanity  if that be the case sir said richard middlemas whose lair the captain had approached while he was thus answering the low and humble complaints of those by whose bedside he passedif that be the case sir i hope your humanity will make you attend to what i say  andwho the devil are you said the governor turning on him his single eye of fire while a sneer gathered on his harsh features which were so well qualified to express it  my name is middlemasi come from scotland and have been sent here by some strange mistake i am neither a private soldier nor am i indisposed more than by the heat of this cursed place  why then friend all i have to ask you is whether you are an attested recruit or not  i was attested at edinburgh said middlemas but  but what the devil would you have thenyou are enlistedthe captain and the doctor sent you heresurely they know best whether you are private or officer sick or well  but i was promised said middlemas promised by tom hillary  promised were you why there is not a man here that has not been promised something by somebody or another or perhaps has promised something to himself this is the land of promise my smart fellow but you know it is india that must be the land of performance so good morning to you the doctor will come his rounds presently and put you all to rights  stay but one momentone moment onlyi have been robbed  robbed look you there now said the governoreverybody that comes here has been robbedegad i am the luckiest fellow in europeother people in my line have only thieves and blackguards upon their hands but none come to my ken but honest decent unfortunate gentlemen that have been robbed  take care how you treat this so lightly sir said middlemas i have been robbed of a thousand pounds  here governor seelencoopers gravity was totally overcome and his laugh was echoed by several of the patients either because they wished to curry favour with the superintendent or from the feeling which influences evil spirits to rejoice in the tortures of those who are sent to share their agony  a thousand pounds exclaimed captain seelencooper as he recovered his breathcome thats a good onei like a fellow that does not make two bites of a cherrywhy there is not a cull in the ken that pretends to have lost more than a few hoggs and here is a servant to the honourable company that has been robbed of a thousand pounds well done mr tom of ten thousandyoure a credit to the house and to the service and so good morning to you  he passed on and richard starting up in a storm of anger and despair found as he would have called after him that his voice betwixt thirst and agitation refused its office water water he said laying hold at the same time of one of the assistants who followed seelencooper by the sleeve the fellow looked carelessly round there was a jug stood by the side of the cribbage players which he reached to middlemas bidding him drink and be dd  the mans back was no sooner turned than the gamester threw himself from his own bed into that of middlemas and grasping firm hold of the arm of richard ere he could carry the vessel to his head swore he should not have his booze it may be readily conjectured that the pitcher thus anxiously and desperately reclaimed contained something better than the pure element in fact a large proportion of it was gin the jug was broken in the struggle and the liquor spilt middlemas dealt a blow to the assailant which was amply and heartily repaid and a combat would have ensued but for the interference of the superintendent and his assistants who with a dexterity that showed them well acquainted with such emergencies clapped a straightwaistcoat upon each of the antagonists richards efforts at remonstrance only procured him a blow from captain seelencoopers rattan and a tender admonition to hold his tongue if he valued a whole skin  irritated at once by sufferings of the mind and of the body tormented by raging thirst and by the sense of his own dreadful situation the mind of richard middlemas seemed to be on the point of becoming unsettled he felt an insane desire to imitate and reply to the groans oaths and ribaldry which as soon as the superintendent quitted the hospital echoed around him he longed though he struggled against the impulse to vie in curses with the reprobate and in screams with the maniac but his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth his mouth itself seemed choked with ashes there came upon him a dimness of sight a rushing sound in his ears and the powers of life were for a time suspended     chapter the seventh     a wise physician skilld our wounds to heal   is more than armies to the common weal                                 popes homer  as middlemas returned to his senses he was sensible that his blood felt more cool that the feverish throb of his pulsation was diminished that the ligatures on his person were removed and his lungs performed their functions more freely one assistant was binding up a vein from which a considerable quantity of blood had been taken another who had just washed the face of the patient was holding aromatic vinegar to his nostrils as he began to open his eyes the person who had just completed the bandage said in latin but in a very low tone and without raising his head annon sis ricardus ille middlemas ex civitate middlemassiense responde in lingua latina  sum ille miserrimus replied richard again shutting his eyes for strange as it may seem the voice of his comrade adam hartley though his presence might be of so much consequence in this emergency conveyed a pang to his wounded pride he was conscious of unkindly if not hostile feelings towards his old companion he remembered the tone of superiority which he used to assume over him and thus to lie stretched at his feet and in a manner at his mercy aggravated his distress by the feelings of the dying chieftain earl percy sees my fall this was however too unreasonable an emotion to subsist above a minute in the next he availed himself of the latin language with which both were familiar for in that time the medical studies at the celebrated university of edinburgh were in a great measure conducted in latin to tell in a few words his own folly and the villany of hillary  i must be gone instantly said hartleytake couragei trust to be able to assist you in the meantime take food and physic from none but my servant who you see holds the sponge in his hand you are in a place where a mans life has been taken for the sake of his gold sleevebuttons  stay yet a moment said middlemaslet me remove this temptation from my dangerous neighbours  he drew a small packet from his under waistcoat and put it into hartleys hands  if i die he said be my heir you deserve her better than i  all answer was prevented by the hoarse voice of seelencooper  well doctor will you carry through your patient  symptoms are dubious yet said the doctorthat was an alarming swoon you must have him carried into the private ward and my young man shall attend him  why if you command it doctor needs mustbut i can tell you there is a man we both know that has a thousand reasons at least for keeping him in the public ward  i know nothing of your thousand reasons said hartley i can only tell you that this young fellow is as welllimbed and likely a lad as the company have among their recruits it is my business to save him for their service and if he dies by your neglecting what i direct depend upon it i will not allow the blame to lie at my door i will tell the general the charge i have given you  the general said seelencooper much embarrassedtell the generalay about his health but you will not say any thing about what he may have said in his lightheaded fits my eyes if you listen to what feverish patients say when the tantivy is in their brain your back will soon break with talebearing for i will warrant you plenty of them to carry  captain seelencooper said the doctor i do not meddle with your department in the hospital my advice to you is not to trouble yourself with mine i suppose as i have a commission in the service and have besides a regular diploma as a physician i know when my patient is lightheaded or otherwise so do you let the man be carefully looked after at your peril  thus saying he left the hospital but not till under pretext of again consulting the pulse he pressed the patients hand as if to assure him once more of his exertions for his liberation  my eyes muttered seelencooper this

this fell on richards ear to suggest hopes of deliverance which were increased when he was shortly afterwards removed to a separate ward a place much more decent in appearance and inhabited only by two patients who seemed petty officers although sensible that he had no illness save that weakness which succeeds violent agitation he deemed it wisest to suffer himself still to be treated as a patient in consideration that he should thus remain under his comrades superintendence yet while preparing to avail himself of hartleys good offices the prevailing reflection of his secret bosom was the ungrateful sentiment had heaven no other means of saving me than by the hands of him i like least on the face of the earth  meanwhile ignorant of the ungrateful sentiments of his comrade and indeed wholly indifferent how he felt towards him hartley proceeded in doing him such service as was in his power without any other object than the discharge of his own duty as a man and as a christian the manner in which he became qualified to render his comrade assistance requires some short explanation  our story took place at a period when the directors of the east india company with that hardy and persevering policy which has raised to such a height the british empire in the east had determined to send a large reinforcement of european troops to the support of their power in india then threatened by the kingdom of mysore of which the celebrated hyder ali had usurped the government after dethroning his master considerable difficulty was found in obtaining recruits for that service those who might have been otherwise disposed to be soldiers were afraid of the climate and of the species of banishment which the engagement implied and doubted also how far the engagements of the company might be faithfully observed towards them when they were removed from the protection of the british laws for these and other reasons the military service of the king was preferred and that of the company could only procure the worst recruits although their zealous agents scrupled not to employ the worst means indeed the practice of kidnapping or crimping as it is technically called was at that time general whether for the colonies or even for the kings troops and as the agents employed in such transactions must be of course entirely unscrupulous there was not only much villany committed in the direct prosecution of the trade but it gave rise incidentally to remarkable cases of robbery and even murder such atrocities were of course concealed from the authorities for whom the levies were made and the necessity of obtaining soldiers made men whose conduct was otherwise unexceptionable cold in looking closely into the mode in which their recruiting service was conducted  the principal depot of the troops which were by these means assembled was in the isle of wight where the season proving unhealthy and the men themselves being many of them of a bad habit of body a fever of a malignant character broke out amongst them and speedily crowded with patients the military hospital of which mr seelencooper himself an old and experienced crimp and kidnapper had obtained the superintendence irregularities began to take place also among the soldiers who remained healthy and the necessity of subjecting them to some discipline before they sailed was so evident that several officers of the companys naval service expressed their belief that otherwise there would be dangerous mutinies on the passage  to remedy the first of these evils the court of directors sent down to the island several of their medical servants amongst whom was hartley whose qualifications had been amply certified by a medical board before which he had passed an examination besides his possessing a diploma from the university of edinburgh as m d  to enforce the discipline of their soldiers the court committed full power to one of their own body general witherington the general was an officer who had distinguished himself highly in their service he had returned from india five or six years before with a large fortune which he had rendered much greater by an advantageous marriage with a rich heiress the general and his lady went little into society but seemed to live entirely for their infant family those in number being three two boys and a girl although he had retired from the service he willingly undertook the temporary charge committed to him and taking a house at a considerable distance from the town of ryde he proceeded to enrol the troops into separate bodies appoint officers of capacity to each and by regular training and discipline gradually to bring them into something resembling good order he heard their complaints of ill usage in the articles of provisions and appointments and did them upon all occasions the strictest justice save that he was never known to restore one recruit to his freedom from the service however unfairly or even illegally his attestation might have been obtained  it is none of my business said general witherington how you became soldierssoldiers i found you and soldiers i will leave you but i will take especial care that as soldiers you shall have every thing to a penny or a pins head that you are justly entitled to he went to work without fear or favour reported many abuses to the board of directors had several officers commissaries c removed from the service and made his name as great a terror to the peculators at home as it had been to the enemies of britain in hindostan  captain seelencooper and his associates in the hospital department heard and trembled fearing that their turn should come next but the general who elsewhere examined all with his own eyes showed a reluctance to visit the hospital in person public report industriously imputed this to fear of infection such was certainly the motive though it was not fear for his own safety that influenced general witherington but he dreaded lest he should carry the infection home to the nursery on which he doated the alarm of his lady was yet more unreasonably sensitive she would scarcely suffer the children to walk abroad if the wind but blew from the quarter where the hospital was situated  but providence baffles the precautions of mortals in a walk across the fields chosen as the most sheltered and sequestered the children with their train of eastern and european attendants met a woman who carried a child that was recovering from the smallpox the anxiety of the father joined to some religious scruples on the mothers part had postponed inoculation which was then scarcely come into general use the infection caught like a quickmatch and ran like wildfire through all those in the family who had not previously had the disease one of the generals children the second boy died and two of the ayas or black female servants had the same fate the hearts of the father and mother would have been broken for the child they had lost had not their grief been suspended by anxiety for the fate of those who lived and who were confessed to be in imminent danger they were like persons distracted as the symptoms of the poor patients appeared gradually to resemble more nearly that of the child already lost  while the parents were in this agony of apprehension the generals principal servant a native of northumberland like himself informed him one morning that there was a young man from the same county among the hospital doctors who had publicly blamed the mode of treatment observed towards the patients and spoken of another which he had seen practised with eminent success  some impudent quack said the general who would force himself into business by bold assertions doctor tourniquet and doctor lancelot are men of high reputation  do not mention their reputation said the mother with a mothers impatience did they not let my sweet reuben die what avails the reputation of the physician when the patient perisheth  if his honour would but see doctor hartley said winter turning half towards the lady then turning back again to his master he is a very decent young man who i am sure never expected what he said to reach your honours earsand he is a native of northumberland  send a servant with a led horse said the general let the young man come hither instantly  it is well known that the ancient mode of treating the smallpox was to refuse to the patient every thing which nature urged him to desire and in particular to confine him to heated rooms beds loaded with blankets and spiced wine when nature called for cold water and fresh air a different mode of treatment had of late been adventured upon by some practitioners who preferred reason to authority and gideon gray had followed it for several years with extraordinary success  when general witherington saw hartley he was startled at his youth but when he heard him modestly but with confidence state the difference of the two modes of treatment and the rationale of his practice he listened with the most serious attention so did his lady her streaming eyes turning from hartley to her husband as if to watch what impression the arguments of the former were making upon the latter general witherington was silent for a few minutes after hartley had finished his exposition and seemed buried in profound reflection to treat a fever he said in a manner which tends to produce one seems indeed to be adding fuel to fire  it isit is said the lady let us trust this young man general witherington we shall at least give our darlings the comforts of the fresh air and cold water for which they are pining  but the general remained undecided your reasoning he said to hartley seems plausible but still it is only hypothesis what can you show to support your theory in opposition to the general practice  my own observation replied the young man here is a memorandumbook of medical cases which i have witnessed it contains twenty cases of smallpox of which eighteen were recoveries  and the two others said the general  terminated fatally replied hartley we can as yet but partially disarm this scourge of the human race  young man continued the general were i to say that a thousand gold mohrs were yours in case my children live under your treatment what have you to peril in exchange  my reputation answered hartley firmly  and you could warrant on your reputation the recovery of your patients  god forbid i should be presumptuous but i think i could warrant my using those means which with gods blessing afford the fairest chance of a favourable result  enoughyou are modest and sensible as well as bold and i will trust you  the lady on whom hartleys words and manner had made a great impression and who was eager to discontinue a mode of treatment which subjected the patients to the greatest pain and privation and had already proved unfortunate eagerly acquiesced and hartley was placed in full authority in the sick room  windows were thrown open fires reduced or discontinued loads of bedclothes removed cooling drinks superseded mulled wine and spices the sicknurses cried out murder doctors tourniquet and lancelot retired in disgust menacing something like a general pestilence in vengeance of what they termed rebellion against the neglect of the aphorisms of hippocrates hartley proceeded quietly and steadily and the patients got into a fair road of recovery  the young northumbrian was neither conceited nor artful yet with all his plainness of character he could not but know the influence which a successful physician obtains over the parents of the children whom he has saved from the grave and especially before the cure is actually completed he resolved to use this influence in behalf of his old companion trusting that the military tenacity of general witherington would give way on consideration of the obligation so lately conferred upon him  on his way to the generals house which was at present his constant place of residence he examined the package which middlemas had put into his hand it contained the picture of menie gray plainly set and the ring with brilliants which doctor gray had given to richard as his mothers last gift the first of these tokens extracted from honest hartley a sigh perhaps a tear of sad remembrance i fear he said she has not chosen worthily but she shall be happy if i can make her so  arrived at the residence of general witherington our doctor went first to the sick apartment and then carried to their parents the delightful account that the recovery of the children might be considered as certain  may the god of israel bless thee young man said the lady trembling with emotion thou hast wiped the tear from the eye of the despairing mother and yetalas alas still it must flow when i think of my cherub reubenoh mr hartley why did we not know you a week soonermy darling had not then died  god gives and takes away my lady answered hartley and you must remember that two are restored to you out of three it is far from certain that the treatment i have used towards the convalescents would have brought through their brother for the case as reported to me waa of a very inveterate description  doctor said witherington his voice testifying more emotion than he usually or willingly gave way to you can comfort the sick in spirit as well as the sick in body but it is time we settle our wager you betted your reputation which remains with you increased by all the credit due to your eminent success against a thousand gold mohrs the value of which you will find in that pocketbook  general witherington said hartley you are wealthy and entitled to be generousi am poor and not entitled to decline whatever may be even in a liberal sense a compensation for my professional attendance but there is a bound to extravagance both in giving and accepting and i must not hazard the newly acquired reputation with which you flatter me by giving room to have it said that i fleeced the parents when their feelings were all afloat with anxiety for their childrenallow me to divide this large sum one half i will thankfully retain as a most liberal recompense for my labour and if you still think you owe me any thing let me have it in the advantage of your good opinion and countenance  if i acquiesce in your proposal doctor hartley said the general reluctantly receiving back a part of the contents of the pocketbook it is because i hope to serve you with my interest even better than with my purse  and indeed sir replied hartley it was upon your interest that i am just about to make a small claim  the general and his lady spoke both in the same breath to assure him his boon was granted before asked  i am not so sure of that said hartley for it respects a point on which i have heard say that your excellency is rather inflexiblethe discharge of a recruit  my duty makes me so replied the generalyou know the sort of fellows that we are obliged to content ourselves withthey get drunkgrow potvaliantenlist overnight and repent next morning if i am to dismiss all those who pretend to have been trepanned we should have few volunteers remain behind every one has some idle story of the promises of a swaggering sergeant kiteit is impossible to attend to them but let me hear yours however  mine is a very singular case the party has been robbed of a thousand pounds  a recruit for this service possessing a thousand pounds my dear doctor depend upon it the fellow has gulled you bless my heart would a man who had a thousand pounds think of enlisting as a private sentinel  he had no such thoughts answered hartley he was persuaded by the rogue whom he trusted that he was to have a commission  then his friend must have been tom hillary or the devil for no other could possess so much cunning and impudence he will certainly find his way to the gallows at last still this story of the thousand pounds seems a touch even beyond tom hillary what reason have you to think that this fellow ever had such a sum of money  i have the best reason to know it for certain answered hartley he and i served our time together under the same excellent master and when he came of age not liking the profession which he had studied and obtaining possession of his little fortune he was deceived by the promises of this same hillary  who has had him locked up in our wellordered hospital yonder said the general  even so please your excellency replied hartley not i think to cure him of any complaint but to give him the opportunity of catching one which would silence all enquiries  the matter shall be closely looked into but how miserably careless the young mans friends must have been to let a raw lad go into the world with such a companion and guide as tom hillary and such a sum as a thousand pounds in his pocket his parents had better have knocked him on the head it certainly was not done like canny northumberland as my servant winter calls it  the youth must indeed have had strangely hardhearted or careless parents said mrs witherington in accents of pity  he never knew them madam said hartley there was a mystery on the score of his birth a cold unwilling and almost unknown hand dealt him out his portion when he came of lawful age and he was pushed into the world like a bark forced from shore without rudder compass or pilot  here general witherington involuntarily looked to his lady while guided by a similar impulse her looks were turned upon him they exchanged a momentary glance of deep and peculiar meaning and then the eyes of both were fixed on the ground  were you brought up in scotland said the lady addressing herself in a faltering voice to hartleyand what was your masters name  i served my apprenticeship with mr gideon gray of the town of middlemas said hartley  middlemas gray repeated the lady and fainted away  hartley offered the succours of his profession the husband flew to support her head and the instant that mrs witherington began to recover he whispered to her in a tone betwixt entreaty and warning zilia bewarebeware  some imperfect sounds which she had begun to frame died away upon her tongue  let me assist you to your dressingroom my love said her obviously anxious husband  she arose with the action of an automaton which moves at a touch of a spring and half hanging upon her husband half dragging herself on by her own efforts had nearly reached the door of the room when hartley following asked if he could be of any service  no sir said the general sternly this is no case for a strangers interference when you are wanted i will send for you  hartley stepped back on receiving a rebuff in a tone so different from that which general witherington had used towards him in their previous intercourse and felt disposed for the first time to give credit to public report which assigned to that gentleman with several good qualities the character of a very proud and haughty man hitherto he thought i have seen him tamed by sorrow and anxiety now the mind is regaining its natural tension but he must in decency interest himself for this unhappy middlemas  the general returned into the apartment a minute or two afterwards and addressed hartley in his usual tone of politeness though apparently still under great embarrassment which he in vain endeavoured to conceal  mrs witherington is better he said and will be glad to see you before dinner you dine with us i hope  hartley bowed  mrs witherington is rather subject to this sort of nervous fits and she has been much harassed of late by grief and apprehension when she recovers from them it is a few minutes before she can collect her ideas and during such intervalsto speak very confidentially to you my dear doctor hartleyshe speaks sometimes about imaginary events which have never happened and sometimes about distressing occurrences in an early period of life i am not therefore willing that any one but myself or her old attendant mrs lopez should be with her on such occasions  hartley admitted that a certain degree of lightheadedness was often the consequence of nervous fits  the general proceeded as to this young manthis friend of yoursthis richard middlemasdid you not call him so  not that i recollect answered hartley but your excellency has hit upon his name  that is odd enoughcertainly you said something about middlemas replied general witherington  i mentioned the name of the town said hartley  ay and i caught it up as the name of the recruiti was indeed occupied at the moment by my anxiety about my wife but this middlemas since such is his name is a wild young fellow i suppose  i should do him wrong to say so your excellency he may have had his follies like other young men but his conduct has so far as i know been respectable but considering we lived in the same house we were not very intimate  that is badi should have liked himthat isit would have been happy for him to have had a friend like you but i suppose you studied too hard for him he would be a soldier hais he goodlooking  remarkably so replied hartley and has a very prepossessing manner  is his complexion dark or fair asked the general  rather uncommonly dark said hartleydarker if i may use the freedom than your excellencys  nay then he must be a black ouzel indeeddoes he understand languages  latin and french tolerably well  of course he cannot fence or dance  pardon me sir i am no great judge but richard is reckoned to do both with uncommon skill  indeedsum this up and it sounds well handsome accomplished in exercises moderately learned perfectly wellbred not unreasonably wild all this comes too high for the situation of a private sentinel he must have a commission doctorentirely for your sake  your excellency is generous  it shall be so and i will find means to make tom hillary disgorge his plunder unless he prefers being hanged a fate he has long deserved you cannot go back to the hospital today you dine with us and you know mrs witheringtons fears of infection but tomorrow find out your friend winter shall see him equipped with every thing needful tom hillary shall repay advances you know and he must be off with the first detachment of the recruits in the middlesex indiaman which sails from the downs on monday fortnight that is if you think him fit for the voyage i dare say the poor fellow is sick of the isle of wight  your excellency will permit the young man to pay his respects to you before his departure  to what purpose sir said the general hastily and peremptorily but instantly added you are righti should like to see him winter shall let him know the time and take horses to fetch him hither but he must have been out of the hospital for a day or two so the sooner you can set him at liberty the better in the meantime take him to your own lodgings doctor and do not let him form any intimacies with the officers or any others in this place where he may light on another hillary  had hartley been as well acquainted as the reader with the circumstances of young middlemass birth he might have drawn decisive conclusions from the behaviour of general witherington while his comrade was the topic of conversation but as mr gray and middlemas himself were both silent on the subject he knew little of it but from general report which his curiosity had never induced him to scrutinize minutely nevertheless what he did apprehend interested him so much that he resolved upon trying a little experiment in which he thought there could be no great harm he placed on his finger the remarkable ring intrusted to his care by richard middlemas and endeavoured to make it conspicuous in approaching mrs witherington taking care however that this occurred during her husbands absence her eyes had no sooner caught a sight of the gem than they became riveted to it and she begged a nearer sight of it as strongly resembling one which she had given to a friend taking the ring from his finger and placing it in her emaciated hand hartley informed her it was the property of the friend in whom he had just been endeavouring to interest the general mrs witherington retired in great emotion but next day summoned hartley to a private interview the particulars of which so far as are necessary to be known shall be afterwards related  on the succeeding day after these important discoveries middlemas to his great delight was rescued from his seclusion in the hospital and transferred to his comrades lodgings in the town of ryde of which hartley himself was a rare inmate the anxiety of mrs witherington detaining him at the generals house long after his medical attendance might have been dispensed with  within two or three days a commission arrived for richard middlemas as a lieutenant in the service of the east india company winter by his masters orders put the wardrobe of the young officer on a suitable footing while middlemas enchanted at finding himself at once emancipated from his late dreadful difficulties and placed under the protection of a man of such importance as the general obeyed implicitly the hints transmitted to him by hartley and enforced by winter and abstained from going into public or forming acquaintances with any one even hartley himself he saw seldom and deep as were his obligations he did not perhaps greatly regret the absence of one whose presence always affected him with a sense of humiliation and abasement     chapter the eighth   the evening before he was to sail for the downs where the middlesex lay ready to weigh anchor the new lieutenant was summoned by winter to attend him to the generals residence for the purpose of being introduced to his patron to thank him at once and to bid him farewell on the road the old man took the liberty of schooling his companion concerning the respect which he ought to pay to his master who was though a kind and generous man as ever came from northumberland extremely rigid in punctiliously exacting the degree of honour which was his due  while they were advancing towards the house the general and his wife expected their arrival with breathless anxiety they were seated in a superb drawingroom the general behind a large chandelier which shaded opposite to his face threw all the light to the other side of the table so that he could observe any person placed there without becoming the subject of observation in turn on a heap of cushions wrapped in a glittering drapery of gold and silver muslins mingled with shawls a luxury which was then a novelty in europe sate or rather reclined his lady who past the full meridian of beauty retained charms enough to distinguish her as one who had been formerly a very fine woman though her mind seemed occupied by the deepest emotion  zilia said her husband you are unable for what you have undertakentake my adviceretireyou shall know all and everything that passesbut retire to what purpose should you cling to the idle wish of beholding for a moment a being whom you can never again look upon  alas answered the lady and is not your declaration that i shall never see him more a sufficient reason that i should wish to see him nowshould wish to imprint on my memory the features and the form which i am never again to behold while we are in the body do not my richard be more cruel than was my poor father even when his wrath was in its bitterness he let me look upon my infant and its cherub face dwelt with me and was my comfort among the years of unutterable sorrow in which my youth wore away  it is enough ziliayou have desired this booni have granted it and at whatever risk my promise shall be kept but think how much depends on this fatal secretyour rank and estimation in societymy honour interested that that estimation should remain uninjured zilia the moment that the promulgation of such a secret gives prudes and scandalmongers a right to treat you with scorn will be fraught with unutterable misery perhaps with bloodshed and death should a man dare to take up the rumour  you shall be obeyed my husband answered zilia in all that the frailness of nature will permit but oh god of my fathers of what clay hast thou fashioned us poor mortals who dread so much the shame which follows sin yet repent so little for the sin itself in a minute afterwards steps were heardthe door openedwinter announced lieutenant middlemas and the unconscious son stood before his parents  witherington started involuntarily up but immediately constrained himself to assume the easy deportment with which a superior receives a dependent and which in his own case was usually mingled with a certain degree of hauteur the mother had less command of herself she too sprung up as if with the intention of throwing herself on the neck of her son for whom she had travailed and sorrowed but the warning glance of her husband arrested her as if by magic and she remained standing with her beautiful head and neck somewhat advanced her hands clasped together and extended forward in the attitude of motion but motionless nevertheless as a marble statue to which the sculptor has given all the appearance of life but cannot impart its powers so strange a gesture and posture might have excited the young officers surprise but the lady stood in the shade and he was so intent in looking upon his patron that he was scarce even conscious of mrs witheringtons presence  i am happy in this opportunity said middlemas observing that the general did not speak to return my thanks to general witherington to whom they never can be sufficiently paid  the sound of his voice though uttering words so indifferent seemed to dissolve the charm which kept his mother motionless she sighed deeply relaxed the rigidity of her posture and sunk back on the cushions from which she had started up middlemas turned a look towards her at the sound of the sigh and the rustling of her drapery the general hastened to speak  my wife mr middlemas has been unwell of lateyour friend mr hartley might mention it to youan affection of the nerves  mr middlemas was of course sorry and concerned  we have had distress in our family mr middlemas from the ultimate and heartbreaking consequences of which we have escaped by the skill of your friend mr hartley we will be happy if it is in our power to repay a part of our obligations in service to his friend and protege mr middlemas  i am only acknowledged as his protege then thought richard but he said every one must envy his friend in having had the distinguished good fortune to be of use to general witherington and his family  you have received your commission i presume have you any particular wish or desire respecting your destination  no may it please your excellency answered middlemas i suppose hartley would tell your excellency my unhappy statethat i am an orphan deserted by the parents who cast me on the wide world an outcast about whom nobody knows or cares except to desire that i should wander far enough and live obscurely enough not to disgrace them by their connexion with me  zilia wrung her hands as he spoke and drew her muslin veil closely around her head as if to exclude the sounds which excited her mental agony  mr hartley was not particularly communicative about your affairs said the general nor do i wish to give you the pain of entering into them what i desire to know is if you are pleased with your destination to madras  perfectly please your excellencyanywhere so that there is no chance of meeting the villain hillary  oh hillarys services are too necessary in the purlieus of st giless the lowlights of newcastle and such like places where human carrion can be picked up to be permitted to go to india however to show you the knave has some grace there are the notes of which you were robbed you will find them the very same paper which you lost except a small sum which the rogue had spent but which a friend has made up in compassion for your sufferings richard middlemas sunk on one knee and kissed the hand which restored him to independence  pshaw said the general you are a silly young man but he withdrew not his hand from his caresses this was one of the occasions on which dick middlemas could be oratorical  o my more than father he said how much greater a debt do i owe to you than to the unnatural parents who brought me into this world by their sin and deserted me through their cruelty  zilia as she heard these cutting words flung back her veil raising it on both hands till it floated behind her like a mist and then giving a faint groan sunk down in a swoon pushing middlemas from him with a hasty movement general witherington flew to his ladys assistance and carried her in his arms as if she had been a child into the anteroom where an old servant waited with the means of restoring suspended animation which the unhappy husband too truly anticipated might be useful these were hastily employed and succeeded in calling the sufferer to life but in a state of mental emotion that was dreadful  her mind was obviously impressed by the last words which her son had uttereddid you hear him richard she exclaimed in accents terribly loud considering the exhausted state of her strengthdid you hear the words it was heaven speaking our condemnation by the voice of our own child but do not fear my richard do not weep i will answer the thunder of heaven with its own music  she flew to a harpsichord which stood in the room and while the servant and master gazed on each other as if doubting whether her senses were about to leave her entirely she wandered over the keys producing a wilderness of harmony composed of passages recalled by memory or combined by her own musical talent until at length her voice and instrument united in one of those magnificent hymns in which her youth had praised her maker with voice and harp like the royal hebrew who composed it the tear ebbed insensibly from the eyes which she turned upwardsher vocal tones combining with those of the instrument rose to a pitch of brilliancy seldom attained by the most distinguished performers and then sunk into a dying cadence which fell never again to risefor the songstress had died with her strain  the horror of the distracted husband may be conceived when all efforts to restore life proved totally ineffectual servants were despatched for medical menhartley and every other who could be found the general precipitated himself into the apartment they had so lately left and in his haste ran against middlemas who at the sound of the music from the adjoining apartment had naturally approached nearer to the door and surprised and startled by the sort of clamour hasty steps and confused voices which ensued had remained standing there endeavouring to ascertain the cause of so much disorder  the sight of the unfortunate young man wakened the generals stormy passions to frenzy he seemed to recognise his son only as the cause of his wifes death he seized him by the collar and shook him violently as he dragged him into the chamber of mortality  come hither he said thou for whom a life of lowest obscurity was too mean a fatecome hither and look on the parents whom thou hast so much enviedwhom thou hast so often cursed look at that pale emaciated form a figure of wax rather than flesh and bloodthat is thy motherthat is the unhappy zilia moncada to whom thy birth was the source of shame and misery and to whom thy illomened presence has now brought death itself and behold mehe pushed the lad from him and stood up erect looking wellnigh in gesture and figure the apostate spirit he describedbehold me he said see you not my hair streaming with sulphur my brow scathed with lightning i am the archfiendi am the father whom you seeki am the accursed richard tresham the seducer of zilia and the father of her murderer  hartley entered while this horrid scene was passing all attention to the deceased he instantly saw would be thrown away and understanding partly from winter partly from the tenor of the generals frantic discourse the nature of the disclosure which had occurred he hastened to put an end if possible to the frightful and scandalous scene which had taken place aware how delicately the general felt on the subject of reputation he assailed him with remonstrances on such conduct in presence of so many witnesses but the mind had ceased to answer to that once powerful keynote  i care not if the whole world hear my sin and my punishment said witherington it shall not be again said of me that i fear shame more than i repent sin i feared shame only for zilia and zilia is dead  but her memory generalspare the memory of your wife in which the character of your children is involved  i have no children said the desperate and violent man my reuben is gone to heaven to prepare a lodging for the angel who has now escaped from the earth in a flood of harmony which can only be equalled where she is gone the other two cherubs will not survive their mother i shall be nay i already feel myself a childless man  yet i am your son replied middlemas in a tone sorrowful but at the same time tinged with sullen resentmentyour son by your wedded wife pale as she lies there i call upon you both to acknowledge my rights and all who are present to bear witness to them  wretch exclaimed the maniac father canst thou think of thine own sordid rights in the midst of death and frenzy my sonthou art the fiend who has occasioned my wretchedness in this world and who will share my eternal misery in the next hence from my sight and my curse go with thee  his eyes fixed on the ground his arms folded on his breast the haughty and dogged spirit of middlemas yet seemed to meditate reply but hartley winter and other bystanders interfered and forced him from the apartment as they endeavoured to remonstrate with him he twisted himself out of their grasp ran to the stables and seizing the first saddled horse that he found out of many that had been in haste got ready to seek for assistance he threw himself on its back and rode furiously off hartley was about to mount and follow him but winter and the other domestics threw themselves around him and implored him not to desert their unfortunate master at a time when the influence which he had acquired over him might be the only restraint on the violence of his passions  he had a coup de soleil in india whispered winter and is capable of any thing in his fits these cowards cannot control him and i am old and feeble  satisfied that general witherington was a greater object of compassion than middlemas whom besides he had no hope of overtaking and who he believed was safe in his own keeping however violent might be his present emotions hartley returned where the greater emergency demanded his immediate care  he found the unfortunate general contending with the domestics who endeavoured to prevent his making his way to the apartment where his children slept and exclaiming furiouslyrejoice my treasuresrejoicehe has fled who would proclaim your fathers crime and your mothers dishonourhe has fled never to return whose life has been the death of one parent and the ruin of anothercourage my children your father is with youhe will make his way to you through a hundred obstacles  the domestics intimidated and undecided were giving way to him when adam hartley approached and placing himself before the unhappy man fixed his eye firmly on the generals while he said in a low but stern voicemadman would you kill your children  the general seemed staggered in his resolution but still attempted to rush past him but hartley seizing him by the collar of his coat on each side you are my prisoner he said i command you to follow me  ha prisoner and for high treason dog thou hast met thy death  the distracted man drew a poniard from his bosom and hartleys strength and resolution might not perhaps have saved his life had not winter mastered the generals right hand and contrived to disarm him  i am your prisoner then he said use me civillyand let me see my wife and children  you shall see them tomorrow said hartley follow us instantly and without the least resistance  general witherington followed like a child with the air of one who is suffering for a cause in which he glories  i am not ashamed of my principles he saidi am willing to die for my king  without exciting his frenzy by contradicting the fantastic idea which occupied his imagination hartley continued to maintain over his patient the ascendency he had acquired he caused him to be led to his apartment and beheld him suffer himself to be put to bed administering then a strong composing draught and causing a servant to sleep in the room he watched the unfortunate man till dawn of morning  general witherington awoke in his full senses and apparently conscious of his real situation which he testified by low groans sobs and tears when hartley drew near his bedside he knew him perfectly and said do not fear methe fit is overleave me now and see after yonder unfortunate let him leave britain as soon as possible and go where his fate calls him and where we can never meet more winter knows my ways and will take care of me  winter gave the same advice i can answer he said for my masters security at present but in heavens name prevent his ever meeting again with that obdurate young man     chapter the ninth     well then the worlds mine oyster     which i with sword will open                 merry wives of windsor  when adam hartley arrived at his lodgings in the sweet little town of ryde his first enquiries were after his comrade he had arrived last night late man and horse all in a foam he made no reply to any questions about supper or the like but snatching a candle ran up stairs into his apartment and shut and doublelocked the door the servants only supposed that being something intoxicated he had ridden hard and was unwilling to expose himself  hartley went to the door of his chamber not without some apprehensions and after knocking and calling more than once received at length the welcome return who is there  on hartley announcing himself the door opened and middlemas appeared well dressed and with his hair arranged and powdered although from the appearance of the bed it had not been slept in on the preceding night and richards countenance haggard and ghastly seemed to bear witness to the same fact it was however with an affectation of indifference that he spoke  i congratulate you on your improvement in worldly knowledge adam it is just the time to desert the poor heir and to stick by him that is in immediate possession of the wealth  i staid last night at general witheringtons answered hartley because he is extremely ill  tell him to repent of his sins then said richard old gray used to say a doctor had as good a title to give ghostly advice as a parson do you remember doctor dulberry the minister calling him an interloper ha ha ha  i am surprised at this style of language from one in your circumstances  why ay said middlemas with a bitter smileit would be difficult to most men to keep up their spirits after gaining and losing father mother and a good inheritance all in the same day but i had always a turn for philosophy  i really do not understand you mr middlemas  why i found my parents yesterday did i not answered the young man my mother as you know had waited but that moment to die and my father to become distracted and i conclude both were contrived purposely to cheat me of my inheritance as he has taken up such a prejudice against me  inheritance repeated hartley bewildered by richards calmness and half suspecting that the insanity of the father was hereditary in the family in heavens name recollect yourself and get rid of these hallucinations what inheritance are you dreaming of  that of my mother to be sure who must have inherited old moncadas wealthand to whom should it descend save to her childreni am the eldest of themthat fact cannot be denied  but consider richardrecollect yourself  i do said richard and what then  then you cannot but remember said hartley that unless there was a will in your favour your birth prevents you from inheriting  you are mistaken sir i am legitimateyonder sickly brats whom you rescued from the grave are not more legitimate than i amyes our parents could not allow the air of heaven to breathe on themme they committed to the winds and the wavesi am nevertheless their lawful child as well as their puling offspring of advanced age and decayed health i saw them adamwinter showed the nursery to me while they were gathering courage to receive me in the drawingroom there they lay the children of predilection the riches of the east expended that they might sleep soft and wake in magnificence i the eldest brotherthe heiri stood beside their bed in the borrowed dress which i had so lately exchanged for the rags of an hospital their couches breathed the richest perfumes while i was reeking from a pesthouse and ii repeat itthe heir the produce of their earliest and best love was thus treated no wonder that my look was that of a basilisk  you speak as if you were possessed with an evil spirit said hartley or else you labour under a strange delusion  you think those only are legally married over whom a drowsy parson has read the ceremony from a dogseared prayerbook it may be so in your english lawbut scotland makes love himself the priest a vow betwixt a fond couple the blue heaven alone witnessing will protect a confiding girl against the perjury of a fickle swain as much as if a dean had performed the rites in the loftiest cathedral in england nay more if the child of love be acknowledged by the father at the time when he is baptizedif he present the mother to strangers of respectability as his wife the laws of scotland will not allow him to retract the justice which has in these actions been done to the female whom he has wronged or the offspring of their mutual love this general tresham or witherington treated my unhappy mother as his wife before gray and others quartered her as such in the family of a respectable man gave her the same name by which he himself chose to pass for the time he presented me to the priest as his lawful offspring and the law of scotland benevolent to the helpless child will not allow him now to disown what he so formally admitted i know my rights and am determined to claim them  you do not then intend to go on board the middlesex think a little you will lose your voyage and your commission  i will save my birthright answered middlemas when i thought of going to india i knew not my parents or how to make good the rights which i had through them that riddle is solved i am entitled to at least a third of moncadas estate which by winters account is considerable but for you and your mode of treating the smallpox i should have had the whole little did i think when old gray was likely to have his wig pulled off for putting out fires throwing open windows and exploding whisky and water that the new system of treating the smallpox was to cost me so many thousand pounds  you are determined then said hartley on this wild course  i know my rights and am determined to make them available answered the obstinate youth  mr richard middlemas i am sorry for you  mr adam hartley i beg to know why i am honoured by your sorrow  i pity you answered hartley both for the obstinacy of selfishness which can think of wealth after the scene you saw last night and for the idle vision which leads you to believe that you can obtain possession of it  selfish cried middlemas why i am a dutiful son labouring to clear the memory of a calumniated motherand am i a visionarywhy it was to this hope that i awakened when old moncadas letter to gray devoting me to perpetual obscurity first roused me to a sense of my situation and dispelled the dreams of my childhood do you think that i would ever have submitted to the drudgery which i shared with you but that by doing so i kept in view the only traces of these unnatural parents by means of which i proposed to introduce myself to their notice and if necessary enforce the rights of a legitimate child the silence and death of moncada broke my plans and it was then only i reconciled myself to the thoughts of india  you were very young to have known so much of the scottish law at the time when we were first acquainted said hartley but i can guess your instructor  no less authority than tom hillarys replied middlemas his good counsel on that head is a reason why i do not now prosecute him to the gallows  i judged as much replied hartley for i heard him before i left middlemas debating the point with mr lawford and i recollect perfectly that he stated the law to be such as you now lay down  and what said lawford in answer demanded middlemas  he admitted replied hartley that in circumstances where the case was doubtful such presumptions of legitimacy might be admitted but he said they were liable to be controlled by positive and precise testimony as for instance the evidence of the mother declaring the illegitimacy of the child  but there can exist none such in my case said middlemas hastily and with marks of alarm  i will not deceive you mr middlemas though i fear i cannot help giving you pain i had yesterday a long conference with your mother mrs witherington in which she acknowledged you as her son but a son born before marriage this express declaration will therefore put an end to the suppositions on which you ground your hopes if you please you may hear the contents of her declaration which i have in her own handwriting  confusion is the cup to be for ever dashed from my lips muttered richard but recovering his composure by exertion of the selfcommand of which he possessed so large a portion he desired hartley to proceed with his communication hartley accordingly proceeded to inform him of the particulars preceding his birth and those which followed after it while middlemas seated on a seachest listened with inimitable composure to a tale which went to root up the flourishing hopes of wealth which he had lately so fondly entertained  zilia moncada was the only child of a portuguese jew of great wealth who had come to london in prosecution of his commerce among the few christians who frequented his house and occasionally his table was richard tresham a gentleman of a high northumbrian family deeply engaged in the service of charles edward during his short invasion and though holding a commission in the portuguese service still an object of suspicion to the british government on account of his wellknown courage and jacobitical principles the highbred elegance of this gentleman together with his complete acquaintance with the portuguese language and manners had won the intimacy of old moncada and alas the heart of the inexperienced zilia who beautiful as an angel had as little knowledge of the world and its wickedness as the lamb that is but a week old  tresham made his proposals to moncada perhaps in a manner which too evidently showed that he conceived the highborn christian was degrading himself in asking an alliance with the wealthy jew moncada rejected his proposals forbade him his house but could not prevent the lovers from meeting in private tresham made a dishonourable use of the opportunities which the poor zilia so incautiously afforded and the consequence was her ruin the lover however had every purpose of righting the injury which he had inflicted and after various plans of secret marriage which were rendered abortive by the difference of religion and other circumstances flight for scotland was determined on the hurry of the journey the fear and anxiety to which zilia was subjected brought on her confinement several weeks before the usual time so that they were compelled to accept of the assistance and accommodation offered by mr gray they had not been there many hours ere tresham heard by the medium of some sharpsighted or keeneared friend that there were warrants out against him for treasonable practices his correspondence with charles edward had become known to moncada during the period of their friendship he betrayed it in vengeance to the british cabinet and warrants were issued in which at moncadas request his daughters name was included this might be of use he apprehended to enable him to separate his daughter from tresham should he find the fugitives actually married how far he succeeded the reader already knows as well as the precautions which he took to prevent the living evidence of his childs frailty from being known to exist his daughter he carried with him and subjected her to severe restraint which her own reflections rendered doubly bitter it would have completed his revenge had the author of zilias misfortunes been brought to the scaffold for his political offences but tresham skulked among his friends in the highlands and escaped until the affair blew over  he afterwards entered into the east india companys service under his mothers name of witherington which concealed the jacobite and rebel until these terms were forgotten his skill in military affairs soon raised him to riches and eminence when he returned to britain his first enquiries were after the family of moncada his fame his wealth and the late conviction that his daughter never would marry any but him who had her first love induced the old man to give that encouragement to general witherington which he had always denied to the poor and outlawed major tresham and the lovers after having been fourteen years separated were at length united in wedlock  general witherington eagerly concurred in the earnest wish of his fatherinlaw that every remembrance of former events should be buried by leaving the fruit of the early and unhappy intrigue suitably provided for but in a distant and obscure situation zilia thought far otherwise her heart longed with a mothers longing towards the object of her first maternal tenderness but she dared not place herself in opposition at once to the will of her father and the decision of her husband the former his religious prejudices much effaced by his long residence in england had given consent that she should conform to the established religion of her husband and her countrythe latter haughty as we have described him made it his pride to introduce the beautiful convert among his highborn kindred the discovery of her former frailty would have proved a blow to her respectability which he dreaded like death and it could not long remain a secret from his wife that in consequence of a severe illness in india even his reason became occasionally shaken by anything which violently agitated his feelings she had therefore acquiesced in patience and silence in the course of policy which moncada had devised and which her husband anxiously and warmly approved yet her thoughts even when their marriage was blessed with other offspring anxiously reverted to the banished and outcast child who had first been clasped to the maternal bosom  all these feelings subdued and cherished long were set afloat in full tide by the unexpected discovery of this son redeemed from a lot of extreme misery and placed before his mothers imagination in circumstances so disastrous  it was in vain that her husband had assured her that he would secure the young mans prosperity by his purse and his interest she could not be satisfied until she had herself done something to alleviate the doom of banishment to which her eldestborn was thus condemned she was the more eager to do so as she felt the extreme delicacy of her health which was undermined by so many years of secret suffering  mrs witherington was in conferring her maternal bounty naturally led to employ the agency of hartley the companion of her son and to whom since the recovery of her younger children she almost looked up as to a tutelar deity she placed in his hands a sum of l2000 which she had at her own unchallenged disposal with a request uttered in the fondest and most affectionate terms that it might be applied to the service of richard middlemas in the way hartley should think most useful to him she assured him of further support as it should be needed and a note to the following purport was also intrusted him to be delivered when and where the prudence of hartley should judge it proper to confide to him the secret of his birth  oh benoni oh child of my sorrow said this interesting document why should the eyes of thy unhappy mother be about to obtain permission to look on thee since her arms were denied the right to fold thee to her bosom may the god of jews and of gentiles watch over thee and guard thee may he remove in his good time the darkness which rolls between me and the beloved of my heartthe first fruit of my unhappy nay unhallowed affection do notdo not my belovedthink thyself a lonely exile while thy mothers prayers arise for thee at sunrise and at sunset to call down every blessing on thy headto invoke every power in thy protection and defence seek not to see meoh why must i say sobut let me humble myself in the dust since it is my own sin my own folly which i must blamebut seek not to see or speak with meit might be the death of both confide thy thoughts to the excellent hartley who hath been the guardian angel of us alleven as the tribes of israel had each their guardian angel what thou shalt wish and he shall advise in thy behalf shall be done if in the power of a motherand the love of a mother is it bounded by seas or can deserts and distance measure its limits oh child of my sorrow oh benoni let thy spirit be with mine as mine is with thee z m  all these arrangements being completed the unfortunate lady next insisted with her husband that she should be permitted to see her son in that parting interview which terminated so fatally hartley therefore now discharged as her executor the duty intrusted to him as her confidential agent  surely he thought as having finished his communication he was about to leave the apartment surely the demons of ambition and avarice will unclose the talons which they have fixed upon this man at a charm like this  and indeed richards heart had been formed of the nether millstone had he not been duly affected by these first and last tokens of his mothers affection he leant his head upon a table and his tears flowed plentifully hartley left him undisturbed for more than an hour and on his return found him in nearly the same attitude in which he had left him  i regret to disturb you at this moment he said but i have still a part of my duty to discharge i must place in your possession the deposit which your mother made in my handsand i must also remind you that time flies fast and that you have scarce an hour or two to determine whether you will prosecute your indian voyage under the new view of circumstances which i have opened to you  middlemas took the bills which his mother had bequeathed him as he raised his head hartley could observe that his face was stained with tears yet he counted over the money with mercantile accuracy and though he assumed the pen for the purpose of writing a discharge with an air of inconsolable dejection yet he drew it up in good set terms like one who had his senses much at his command  and now he said in a mournful voice give me my mothers narrative  hartley almost started and answered hastily you have the poor ladys letter which was addressed to yourselfthe narrative is addressed to me it is my warrant for disposing of a large sum of moneyit concerns the rights of third parties and i cannot part with it  surely surely it were better to deliver it into my hands were it but to weep over it answered middlemas my fortune hartley has been very cruel you see that my parents purposed to have made me their undoubted heir yet their purpose was disappointed by accident and now my mother comes with wellintended fondness and while she means to advance my fortune furnishes evidence to destroy itcome come hartleyyou must be conscious that my mother wrote those details entirely for my information i am the rightful owner and insist on having them  i am sorry i must insist on refusing your demand answered hartley putting the papers in his pocket you ought to consider that if this communication has destroyed the idle and groundless hopes which you have indulged in it has at the same time more than trebled your capital and that if there are some hundreds or thousands in the world richer than yourself there are many millions not half so well provided set a brave spirit then against your fortune and do not doubt your success in life  his words seemed to sink into the gloomy mind of middlemas he stood silent for a moment and then answered with a reluctant and insinuating voice  my dear hartley we have long been companionsyou can have neither pleasure nor interest in ruining my hopesyou may find some in forwarding them moncadas fortune will enable me to allow five thousand pounds to the friend who should aid me in my difficulties  good morning to you mr middlemas said hartley endeavouring to withdraw  one momentone moment said middlemas holding his friend by the button at the same time i meant to say ten thousandandandmarry whomsoever you likei will not be your hindrance  you are a villain said hartley breaking from him and i always thought you so  and you answered middlemas are a fool and i never thought yon better off he goeslet himthe game has been played and losti must hedge my bets india must be my backplay  all was in readiness for his departure a small vessel and a favouring gale conveyed him and several other military gentlemen to the downs where the indiaman which was to transport them from europe lay ready for their reception  his first feelings were sufficiently disconsolate but accustomed from his infancy to conceal his internal thoughts he appeared in the course of a week the gayest and best bred passenger who ever dared the long and weary space betwixt old england and her indian possessions at madras where the sociable feelings of the resident inhabitants give ready way to enthusiasm in behalf of any stranger of agreeable qualities he experienced that warm hospitality which distinguishes the british character in the east  middlemas was well received in company and in the way of becoming an indispensable guest at every entertainment in the place when the vessel on board of which hartley acted as surgeons mate arrived at the same settlement the latter would not from his situation have been entitled to expect much civility and attention but this disadvantage was made up by his possessing the most powerful introductions from general witherington and from other persons of weight in leadenhall street the generals friends to the principal inhabitants in the settlement he found himself once more therefore moving in the same sphere with middlemas and under the alternative of living with him on decent and distant terms or of breaking off with him altogether  the first of these courses might perhaps have been the wisest but the other was most congenial to the blunt and plain character of hartley who saw neither propriety nor comfort in maintaining a show of friendly intercourse to conceal hate contempt and mutual dislike  the circle at fort st george was much more restricted at that time than it has been since the coldness of the young men did not escape notice it transpired that they had been once intimates and fellowstudents yet it was now found that they hesitated at accepting invitations to the same parties rumour assigned many different and incompatible reasons for this deadly breach to which hartley gave no attention whatever while lieutenant middlemas took care to countenance those which represented the cause of the quarrel most favourably to himself  a little bit of rivalry had taken place he said when pressed by gentlemen for an explanation he had only had the good luck to get further in the good graces of a fair lady than his friend hartley who had made a quarrel of it as they saw he thought it very silly to keep up spleen at such a distance of time and space he was sorry more for the sake of the strangeness of the appearance of the thing than any thing else although his friend had really some very good points about him  while these whispers were working their effect in society they did not prevent hartley from receiving the most flattering assurances of encouragement and official promotion from the madras government as opportunity should arise soon after it was intimated to him that a medical appointment of a lucrative nature in a remote settlement was conferred on him which removed him for some time from madras and its neighbourhood  hartley accordingly sailed on his distant expedition and it was observed that after his departure the character of middlemas as if some check had been removed began to display itself in disagreeable colours it was noticed that this young man whose manners were so agreeable and so courteous during the first months after his arrival in india began now to show symptoms of a haughty and overbearing spirit he had adopted for reasons which the reader may conjecture but which appeared to be mere whim at fort st george the name of tresham in addition to that by which he had hitherto been distinguished and in this he presisted with an obstinacy which belonged more to the pride than the craft of his character the lieutenantcolonel of the regiment an old crosstempered martinet did not choose to indulge the captain such was now the rank of middlemas in this humour  he knew no officer he said by any name save that which he bore in his commission and he middlemassd the captain on all occasions  one fatal evening the captain was so much provoked as to intimate peremptorily that he knew his own name best  why captain middlemas replied the colonel it is not every child that knows its own father so how can every man be so sure of his own name  the bow was drawn at a venture but the shaft found the rent in the armour and stung deeply in spite of all the interposition which could be attempted middlemas insisted on challenging the colonel who could be persuaded to no apology  if captain middlemas he said thought the cap fitted he was welcome to wear it  the result was a meeting in which after the parties had exchanged shots the seconds tendered their mediation it was rejected by middlemas who at the second fire had the misfortune to kill his commanding officer in consequence he was obliged to fly from the british settlements for being universally blamed for having pushed the quarrel to extremity there was little doubt that the whole severity of military discipline would be exercised upon the delinquent middlemas therefore vanished from fort st george and though the affair had made much noise at the time was soon no longer talked of it was understood in general that he had gone to seek that fortune at the court of some native prince which he could no longer hope for in the british settlements     chapter the tenth   three years passed away after the fatal encounter mentioned in the last chapter and doctor hartley returning from his appointed mission which was only temporary received encouragement to settle in madras in a medical capacity and upon having done so soon had reason to think he had chosen a line in which he might rise to wealth and reputation his practice was not confined to his countrymen but much sought after among the natives who whatever may be their prejudices against the europeans in other respects universally esteem their superior powers in the medical profession this lucrative branch of practice rendered it necessary that hartley should make the oriental languages his study in order to hold communication with his patients without the intervention of an interpreter he had enough of opportunities to practise as a linguist for in acknowledgment as he used jocularly to say of the large fees of the wealthy moslemah and hindoos he attended the poor of all nations gratis whenever he was called upon  it so chanced that one evening he was hastily summoned by a message from the secretary of the government to attend a patient of consequence yet he is after all only a fakir said the message you will find him at the tomb of cara razi the mahomedan saint and doctor about one coss from the fort enquire for him by the name of barak el hadgi such a patient promises no fees but we know how little you care about the pagodas and besides the government is your paymaster on this occasion  that is the last matter to be thought on said hartley and instantly repaired in his palanquin to the place pointed out to him  the tomb of the owliah or mahomedan saint cara razi was a place held in much reverence by every good mussulman it was situated in the centre of a grove of mangos and tamarindtrees and was built of red stone having three domes and minarets at every corner there was a court in front as usual around which were cells constructed for the accommodation of the fakirs who visited the tomb from motives of devotion and made a longer or shorter residence there as they thought proper subsisting upon the alms which the faithful never fail to bestow on them in exchange for the benefit of their prayers these devotees were engaged day and night in reading verses of the koran before the tomb which was constructed of white marble inscribed with sentences from the book of the prophet and with the various titles conferred by the koran upon the supreme being such a sepulchre of which there are many is with its appendages and attendants respected during wars and revolutions and no less by feringis franks that is and hindoos than by mahomedans themselves the fakirs in return act as spies for all parties and are often employed in secret missions of importance  complying with the mahomedan custom our friend hartley laid aside his shoes at the gates of the holy precincts and avoiding to give offence by approaching near to the tomb he went up to the principal moullah or priest who was distinguishable by the length of his beard and the size of the large wooden beads with which the mahomedans like the catholics keep register of their prayers such a person venerable by his age sanctity of character and his real or supposed contempt of worldly pursuits and enjoyments is regarded as the head of an establishment of this kind  the moullah is permitted by his situation to be more communicative with strangers than his younger brethren who in the present instance remained with their eyes fixed on the koran muttering their recitations without noticing the european or attending to what he said as he enquired at their superior for barak el hadgi  the moullah was seated on the earth from which he did not arise or show any mark of reverence nor did he interrupt the tale of his beads which he continued to count assiduously while hartley was speaking when he finished the old man raised his eyes and looked at him with an air of distraction as if he was endeavouring to recollect what he had been saying he at length pointed to one of the cells and resumed his devotions like one who felt impatient of whatever withdrew his attention from his sacred duties were it but for an instant  hartley entered the cell indicated with the usual salutation of salam alaikum his patient lay on a little carpet in a corner of the small whitewashed cell he was a man of about forty dressed in the black robe of his order very much torn and patched he wore a high conical cap of tartarian felt and had round his neck the string of black beads belonging to his order his eyes and posture indicated suffering which he was enduring with stoical patience  salam alaikum said hartley you are in pain my fathera title which he gave rather to the profession than to the years of the person he addressed  salam alaikum bema sebastem answered the fakir well is it for you that you have suffered patiently the book saith such shall be the greeting of the angels to those who enter paradise  the conversation being thus opened the physician proceeded to enquire into the complaints of the patient and to prescribe what he thought advisable having done this he was about to retire when to his great surprise the fakir tendered him a ring of some value  the wise said hartley declining the present and at the same time paying a suitable compliment to the fakirs cap and robethe wise of every country are brethren my left hand takes no guerdon of my right  a feringi can then refuse gold said the fakir i thought they took it from every hand whether pure as that of an houri or leprous like gehaziseven as the hungry dog recketh not whether the flesh he eateth be of the camel of the prophet saleth or of the ass of degialon whose head be curses  the book says replied hartley that it is allah who closes and who enlarges the heart frank and mussulman are all alike moulded by his pleasure  my brother hath spoken wisely answered the patient welcome the disease if it bring thee acquainted with a wise physician for what saith the poetit is well to have fallen to the earth if while grovelling there thou shalt discover a diamond  the physician made repeated visits to his patient and continued to do so even after the health of el hadgi was entirely restored he had no difficulty in discerning in him one of those secret agents frequently employed by asiatic sovereigns his intelligence his learning above all his versatility and freedom from prejudices of every kind left no doubt of baraks possessing the necessary qualifications for conducting such delicate negotiations while his gravity of habit and profession could not prevent his features from expressing occasionally a perception of humour not usually seen in devotees of his class  barak el hadgi talked often amidst their private conversations of the power and dignity of the nawaub of mysore and hartley had little doubt that he came from the court of hyder ali on some secret mission perhaps for achieving a more solid peace betwixt that able and sagacious prince and the east india companys governmentthat which existed for the time being regarded on both parts as little more than a hollow and insincere truce he told many stories to the advantage of this prince who certainly was one of the wisest that hindostan could boast and amidst great crimes perpetrated to gratify his ambition displayed many instances of princely generosity and what was a little more surprising of evenhanded justice  on one occasion shortly before barak el hadgi left madras he visited the doctor and partook of his sherbet which he preferred to his own perhaps because a few glasses of rum or brandy were usually added to enrich the compound it might be owing to repeated applications to the jar which contained this generous fluid that the pilgrim became more than usually frank in his communications and not contented with praising his nawaub with the most hyperbolic eloquence he began to insinuate the influence which he himself enjoyed with the invincible the lord and shield of the faith of the prophet  brother of my soul he said do but think if thou needest aught that the allpowerful hyder ali khan bohander can give and then use not the intercession of those who dwell in palaces and wear jewels in their turbans but seek the cell of thy brother at the great city which is seringapatam and the poor fakir in his torn cloak shall better advance thy suit with the nawaub for hyder did not assume the title of sultann than they who sit upon seats of honour in the divan  with these and sundry other expressions of regard he exhorted hartley to come into the mysore and look upon the face of the great prince whose glance inspired wisdom and whose nod conferred wealth so that folly or poverty could not appear before him he offered at the same time to requite the kindness which hartley had evinced to him by showing him whatever was worthy the attention of a sage in the land of mysore  hartley was not reluctant to promise to undertake the proposed journey if the continuance of good understanding betwixt their governments should render it practicable and in reality looked forward to the possibility of such an event with a good deal of interest the friends parted with mutual good wishes after exchanging in the oriental fashion such gifts as became sages to whom knowledge was to be supposed dearer than wealth barak el hadgi presented hartley with a small quantity of the balsam of mecca very hard to be procured in an unadulterated form and gave him at the same time a passport in a peculiar character which he assured him would be respected by every officer of the nawaub should his friend be disposed to accomplish his visit to the mysore the head of him who should disrespect this safeconduct he said shall not be more safe than that of the barleystalk which the reaper has grasped in his hand  hartley requited these civilities by the present of a few medicines little used in the east but such as he thought might with suitable directions be safely intrusted to a man so intelligent as his moslem friend  it was several months after barak had returned to the interior of india that hartley was astonished by an unexpected rencounter  the ships from europe had but lately arrived and had brought over their usual cargo of boys longing to be commanders and young women without any purpose of being married but whom a pious duty to some brother some uncle or other male relative brought to india to keep his house until they should find themselves unexpectedly in one of their own dr hartley happened to attend a public breakfast given on this occasion by a gentleman high in the service the roof of his friend had been recently enriched by a consignment of three nieces whom the old gentleman justly attached to his quiet hookah and it was said to a pretty girl of colour desired to offer to the public that he might have the fairest chance to get rid of his new guests as soon as possible hartley who was thought a fish worth casting a fly for was contemplating this fair investment with very little interest when he heard one of the company say to another in a low voice  angels and ministers there is our old acquaintance the queen of sheba returned upon our hands like unsaleable goods  hartley looked in the same direction with the two who were speaking and his eye was caught by a semiramislooking person of unusual stature and amplitude arrayed in a sort of ridinghabit but so formed and so looped and gallooned with lace as made it resemble the upper tunic of a native chief her robe was composed of crimson silk rich with flowers of gold she wore wide trowsers of light blue silk a fine scarlet shawl around her waist in which was stuck a creeze with a richly ornamented handle her throat and arms were loaded with chains and bracelets and her turban formed of a shawl similar to that worn around her waist was decorated by a magnificent aigrette from which a blue ostrich plume flowed in one direction and a red one in another the brow of european complexion on which this tiara rested was too lofty for beauty but seemed made for command the aquiline nose retained its form but the cheeks were a little sunken and the complexion so very brilliant as to give strong evidence that the whole countenance had undergone a thorough repair since the lady had left her couch a black female slave richly dressed stood behind her with a chowry or cows tail having a silver handle which she used to keep off the flies from the mode in which she was addressed by those who spoke to her this lady appeared a person of too much importance to be affronted or neglected and yet one with whom none desired further communication than the occasion seemed in propriety to demand  she did not however stand in need of attention the wellknown captain of an east indian vessel lately arrived from britain was sedulously polite to her and two or three gentlemen whom hartley knew to be engaged in trade tended upon her as they would have done upon the safety of a rich argosy  for heavens sake what is that for a zenobia said hartley to the gentleman whose whisper had first attracted his attention to this lofty dame  is it possible you do not know the queen of sheba said the person of whom he enquired no way both to communicate the information demanded you must know then that she is the daughter of a scotch emigrant who lived and died at pondicherry a sergeant in lallys regiment she managed to marry a partisan officer named montreville a swiss or frenchman i cannot tell which after the surrender of pondicherry this hero and heroinebut heywhat the devil are you thinking ofif you stare at her that way you will make a scene for she will think nothing of scolding you across the table  but without attending to his friends remonstrances hartley bolted from the table at which he sat and made his way with something less than the decorum which the rules of society enjoin towards the place where the lady in question was seated  the doctor is surely mad this morningsaid his friend major mercer to old quartermaster calder  indeed hartley was not perhaps strictly in his senses for looking at the queen of sheba as he listened to major mercer his eye fell on a light female form beside her so placed as if she desired to be eclipsed by the bulky form and flowing robes we have described and to his extreme astonishment he recognised the friend of his childhood the love of his youthmenie gray herself  to see her in india was in itself astonishing to see her apparently under such strange patronage greatly increased his surprise to make his way to her and address her seemed the natural and direct mode of satisfying the feelings which her appearance excited  his impetuosity was however checked when advancing close upon miss gray and her companion he observed that the former though she looked at him exhibited not the slightest token of recognition unless he could interpret as such that she slightly touched her upper lip with her forefinger which if it happened otherwise than by mere accident might be construed to mean do not speak to me just now hartley adopting such an interpretation stood stock still blushing deeply for he was aware that he made for the moment but a silly figure  he was the rather convinced of this when with a voice which in the force of its accents corresponded with her commanding air mrs montreville addressed him in english which savoured slightly of a swiss patoisyou have come to us very fast sir to say nothing at all are you sure you did not get your tongue stolen by de way  i thought i had seen an old friend in that lady madam stammered hartley but it seems i am mistaken  the good people do tell me that you are one doctors hartley sir now my friend and i do not know doctors hartley at all  i have not the presumption to pretend to your acquaintance madam but him  here menie repeated the sign in such a manner that though it was only momentary hartley could not misunderstand its purpose he therefore changed the end of his sentence and added but i have only to make my bow and ask pardon for my mistake  he retired back accordingly among the company unable to quit the room and enquiring at those whom he considered as the best newsmongers for such information aswho is that statelylooking woman mr butler  oh the queen of sheba to be sure  and who is that pretty girl who sits beside her  or rather behind her answered butler a military chaplain faith i cannot saypretty did you call her turning his operaglass that wayyes faith she is prettyvery prettygad she shoots her glances as smartly from behind the old pile yonder as teucer from behind ajax telamons shield  but who is she can you tell me  some fairskinned speculation of old montrevilles i suppose that she has got either to toady herself or take in some of her black friends withis it possible you have never heard of old mother montreville  you know i have been so long absent from madras  well continued butler this lady is the widow of a swiss officer in the french service who after the surrender of pondicherry went off into the interior and commenced soldier on his own account he got possession of a fort under pretence of keeping it for some simple rajah or other assembled around him a parcel of desperate vagabonds of every colour in the rainbow occupied a considerable territory of which he raised the duties in his own name and declared for independence but hyder naig understood no such interloping proceedings and down he came besieged the fort and took it though some pretend it was betrayed to him by this very woman be that as it may the poor swiss was found dead on the ramparts certain it is she received large sums of money under pretence of paying off her troops surrendering of hillforts and heaven knows what besides she was permitted also to retain some insignia of royalty and as she was wont to talk of hyder as the eastern solomon she generally became known by the title of queen of sheba she leaves her court when she pleases and has been as far as fort st george before now in a word she does pretty much as she likes the great folks here are civil to her though they look on her as little better than a spy as to hyder it is supposed he has ensured her fidelity by borrowing the greater part of her treasures which prevents her from daring to break with himbesides other causes that smack of scandal of another sort  a singular story replied hartley to his companion while his heart dwelt on the question how it was possible that the gentle and simple menie gray should be in the train of such a character as this adventuress  but butler has not told you the best of it said major mercer who by this time came round to finish his own story your old acquaintance mr tresham or mr middlemas or whatever else he chooses to be called has been complimented by a report that he stood very high in the good graces of this same boadicea he certainly commanded some troops which she stills keeps on foot and acted at their head in the nawaubs service who craftily employed him in whatever could render him odious to his countrymen the british prisoners were intrusted to his charge and to judge by what i felt myself the devil might take a lesson from him in severity  and was he attached to or connected with this woman  so mrs rumour told us in our dungeon poor jack ward had the bastinado for celebrating their merits in a parody on the playhouse song    sure such a pair were never seen     so aptly formed to meet by nature  hartley could listen no longer the fate of menie gray connected with such a man and such a woman rushed on his fancy in the most horrid colours and he was struggling through the throng to get to some place where he might collect his ideas and consider what could be done for her protection when a black attendant touched his arm and at the same time slipped a card into his hand it bore miss gray mrs montrevilles at the house of ram sing cottah in the black town on the reverse was written with a pencil eight in the morning  this intimation of her residence implied of course a permission nay an invitation to wait upon her at the hour specified hartleys heart beat at the idea of seeing her once more and still more highly at the thought of being able to serve her at least he thought if there is danger near her as is much to be suspected she shall not want a counsellor or if necessary a protector yet at the same time he felt the necessity of making himself better acquainted with the circumstances of her case and the persons with whom she seemed connected butler and mercer had both spoke to their disparagement but butler was a little of a coxcomb and mercer a great deal of a gossip while he was considering what credit was due to their testimony he was unexpectedly encountered by a gentleman of his own profession a military surgeon who had had the misfortune to have been in hyders prison till set at freedom by the late pacification mr esdale for so he was called was generally esteemed a rising man calm steady and deliberate in forming his opinions hartley found it easy to turn the subject on the queen of sheba by asking whether her majesty was not somewhat of an adventuress  on my word i cannot say answered esdale smiling we are all upon the adventure in india more or less but i do not see that the begum montreville is more so than the rest  why that amazonian dress and manner said hartley savour a little of the picaresca  you must not said esdale expect a woman who has commanded soldiers and may again to dress and look entirely like an ordinary person but i assure you that even at this time of day if she wished to marry she might easily find a respectable match  why i heard that she had betrayed her husbands fort to hyder  ay that is a specimen of madras gossip the fact is that she defended the place long after her husband fell and afterwards surrendered it by capitulation hyder who piques himself on observing the rules of justice would not otherwise have admitted her to such intimacy  yes i have heard replied hartley that their intimacy was rather of the closest  another calumny if you mean any scandal answered esdale hyder is too zealous a mahomedan to entertain a christian mistress and besides to enjoy the sort of rank which is yielded to a woman in her condition she must refrain in appearance at least from all correspondence in the way of gallantry just so they said that the poor woman had a connexion with poor middlemas of the  regiment  and was that also a false report said hartley in breathless anxiety  on my soul i believe it was answered mr esdale they were friends europeans in an indian court and therefore intimate but i believe nothing more by the by though i believe there was some quarrel between middlemas poor fellow and you yet i am sure that you will be glad to hear there is a chance of his affair being made up  indeed was again the only word which hartley could utter  ay indeed answered esdale the duel is an old story now and it must be allowed that poor middlemas though he was rash in that business had provocation  but his desertionhis accepting of command under hyderhis treatment of our prisonershow can all these be passed over replied hartley  why it is possiblei speak to you as a cautious man and in confidencethat he may do us better service in hyders capital or tippoos camp than he could have done if serving with his own regiment and then for his treatment of prisoners i am sure i can speak nothing but good of him in that particular he was obliged to take the office because those that serve hyder naig must do or die but he told me himselfand i believe himthat he accepted the office chiefly because while he made a great bullying at us before the black fellows he could privately be of assistance to us some fools could not understand this and answered him with abuse and lampoons and he was obliged to punish them to avoid suspicion yes yes i and others can prove he was willing to be kind if men would give him leave i hope to thank him at madras one day soonall this in confidencegoodmorrow to you  distracted by the contradictory intelligence he had received hartley went next to question old captain capstern the captain of the indiaman whom he had observed in attendance upon the begum montreville on enquiring after that commanders female passengers he heard a pretty long catalogue of names in which that he was so much interested in did not occur on closer enquiry capstern recollected that menie gray a young scotchwoman had come out under charge of mrs duffer the masters wife a good decent girl capstern said and kept the mates and guineapigs at a respectable distance she came out he believed to be a sort of female companion or upper servant in madame montrevilles family snug berth enough he concluded if she can find the length of the old girls foot  this was all that could be made of capstern so hartley was compelled to remain in a state of uncertainty until the next morning when an explanation might be expected with menie gray in person     chapter the eleventh   the exact hour assigned found hartley at the door of the rich native merchant who having some reasons for wishing to oblige the begum mon treville had relinquished for her accommodation and that of her numerous retinue almost the whole of his large and sumptuous residence in the black town of madras as that district of the city is called which the natives occupy  a domestic at the first summons ushered the visitor into an apartment where he expected to be joined by miss gray the room opened on one side into a small garden or parterre filled with the brilliantcoloured flowers of eastern climates in the midst of which the waters of a fountain rose upwards in a sparkling jet and fell back again into a white marble cistern  a thousand dizzy recollections thronged on the mind of hartley whose early feelings towards the companion of his youth if they had slumbered during distance and the various casualties of a busy life were revived when he found himself placed so near her and in circumstances which interested from their unexpected occurrence and mysterious character a step was heardthe door openeda female appearedbut it was the portly form of madame de montreville  what do you please to want sir said the lady that is if you have found your tongue this morning which you had lost yesterday  i proposed myself the honour of waiting upon the young person whom i saw in your excellencys company yesterday morning answered hartley with assumed respect i have had long the honour of being known to her in europe and i desire to offer my services to her in india  much obligedmuch obliged but miss gray is gone out and does not return for one or two days you may leave your commands with me  pardon me madam replied hartley but i have some reason to hope you may be mistaken in this matterand here comes the lady herself  how is this my dear said mrs montreville with unruffled front to menie as she entered are you not gone out for two or three days as i tell this gentlemanmais cest egalit is all one thing you will say how dye do and goodbye to monsieur who is so polite as to come to ask after our healths and as he sees us both very well he will go away home again  i believe madam said miss gray with appearance of effort that i must speak with this gentleman for a few minutes in private if you will permit me  that is to say get you gone but i do not allow thati do not like private conversation between young man and pretty young woman cela nest pas honnete it cannot be in my house  it may be out of it then madam answered miss gray not pettishly nor pertly but with the utmost simplicitymr hartley will you step into that gardenand you madam may observe us from the window if it be the fashion of the country to watch so closely  as she spoke this she stepped through a latticedoor into the garden and with an air so simple that she seemed as if she wished to comply with her patronesss ideas of decorum though they appeared strange to her the queen of sheba notwithstanding her natural assurance was disconcerted by the composure of miss grays manner and left the room apparently in displeasure menie turned back to the door which opened into the garden and said in the same manner as before but with less nonchalance  i am sure i would not willingly break through the rules of a foreign country but i cannot refuse myself the pleasure of speaking to so old a friendif indeed she added pausing and looking at hartley who was much embarrassed it be as much pleasure to mr hartley as it is to me  it would have been said hartley scarce knowing what he saidit must be a pleasure to me in every circumstancebut this extraordinary meetingbut your father  menie grays handkerchief was at her eyeshe is gone mr hartley after he was left unassisted his toilsome business became too much for himhe caught a cold which hung about him as you know he was the last to attend to his own complaints till it assumed a dangerous and finally a fatal character i distress you mr hartley but it becomes you well to be affected my father loved you dearly  oh miss gray said hartley it should not have been thus with my excellent friend at the close of his useful and virtuous lifealas whereforethe question bursts from me involuntarilywherefore could you not have complied with his wisheswherefore  do not ask me said she stopping the question which was on his lips we are not the formers of our own destiny it is painful to talk on such a subject but for once and for ever let me tell you that i should have done mr hartley wrong if even to secure his assistance to my father i had accepted his hand while my wayward affections did not accompany the act  but wherefore do i see you here menieforgive me miss gray my tongue as well as my heart turns back to longforgotten scenesbut why herewhy with this woman  she is not indeed every thing that i expected answered menie but i must not be prejudiced by foreign manners after the step i have takenshe is besides attentive and generous in her way and i shall soonshe paused a moment and then added be under better protection  that of richard middlemas said hartley with a faltering voice  i ought not perhaps to answer the question said menie but i am a bad dissembler and those whom i trust i trust entirely you have guessed right mr hartley she addedcolouring a good deal i have come hither to unite my fate to that of your old comrade  it is then just as i feared exclaimed hartley  and why should mr hartley fear said menie gray i used to think you too generoussurely the quarrel which occurred long since ought not to perpetuate suspicion and resentment  at least if the feeling of resentment remained in my own bosom it would be the last i should intrude upon you miss gray answered hartley but it is for you and for you alone that i am watchfulthis personthis gentleman whom you mean to intrust with your happinessdo you know where he isand in what service  i know both more distinctly perhaps than mr hartley can do mr middlemas has erred greatly and has been severely punished but it was not in the time of his exile and sorrow that she who has plighted her faith to him should with the flattering world turn her back upon him besides you have doubtless not heard of his hopes of being restored to his country and his rank  i have answered hartley thrown off his guard but i see not how he can deserve it otherwise than by becoming a traitor to his new master and thus rendering himself even more unworthy of confidence than i hold him to be at this moment  it is well that he hears you not answered menie gray resenting with natural feeling the imputation on her lover then instantly softening her tone she added my voice ought not to aggravate but to soothe your quarrel mr hartley i plight my word to you that you do richard wrong  she said these words with affected calmness suppressing all appearance of that displeasure of which she was evidently sensible upon this depreciation of a beloved object  hartley compelled himself to answer in the same strain  miss gray he said your actions and motives will always be those of an angel but let me entreat you to view this most important matter with the eyes of worldly wisdom and prudence have you well weighed the risks attending the course which you are taking in favour of a man whonay i will not again offend youwho may i hope deserve your favour  when i wished to see you in this manner mr hartley and declined a communication in public where we could have had less freedom of conversation it was with the view of telling you every thing some pain i thought old recollections might give but i trusted it would be momentary and as i desire to retain your friendship it is proper i should show that i still deserve it i must then first tell you my situation after my fathers death in the worlds opinion we were always poor you know but in the proper sense i had not known what real poverty was until i was placed in dependence upon a distant relation of my poor father who made our relationship a reason for casting upon me all the drudgery of her household while she would not allow that it gave me a claim to countenance kindness or anything but the relief of my most pressing wants in these circumstances i received from mr middlemas a letter in which he related his fatal duel and its consequences he had not dared to write to me to share his miserynow when he was in a lucrative situation under the patronage of a powerful prince whose wisdom knew how to prize and protect such europeans as entered his servicenow when he had every prospect of rendering our government such essential service by his interest with hyder ali and might eventually nourish hopes of being permitted to return and stand his trial for the death of his commanding officernow he pressed me to come to india and share his reviving fortunes by accomplishing the engagement into which we had long ago entered a considerable sum of money accompanied this letter mrs duffer was pointed out as a respectable woman who would protect me during the passage mrs montreville a lady of rank having large possessions and high interest in the mysore would receive me on my arrival at fort st george and conduct me safely to the dominions of hyder it was farther recommended that considering the peculiar situation of mr middlemas his name should be concealed in the transaction and that the ostensible cause of my voyage should be to fill an office in that ladys familywhat was i to domy duty to my poor father was ended and my other friends considered the proposal as too advantageous to be rejected the references given the sum of money lodged were considered as putting all scruples out of the question and my immediate protectress and kinswoman was so earnest that i should accept of the offer made me as to intimate that she would not encourage me to stand in my own light by continuing to give me shelter and food she gave me little more if i was foolish enough to refuse compliance  sordid wretch said hartley how little did she deserve such a charge  let me speak a proud word mr hartley and then you will not perhaps blame my relations so much all their persuasions and even their threats would have failed in inducing me to take a step which has an appearance at least to which i found it difficult to reconcile myself but i had loved middlemasi love him stillwhy should i deny itand i have not hesitated to trust him had it not been for the small still voice which reminded me of my engagements i had maintained more stubbornly the pride of womanhood and as you would perhaps have recommended i might have expected at least that my lover should have come to britain in person and might have had the vanity to think she added smiling faintly that if i were worth having i was worth fetching  yet noweven now answered hartley be just to yourself while you are generous to your lovernay do not look angrily but hear me i doubt the propriety of your being under the charge of this unsexed woman who can no longer be termed a european i have interest enough with females of the highest rank in the settlementthis climate is that of generosity and hospitalitythere is not one of them who knowing your character and history will not desire to have you in her society and under her protection until your lover shall be able to vindicate his title to your hand in the face of the worldi myself will be no cause of suspicion to him or of inconvenience to you menie let me but have your consent to the arrangement i propose and the same moment that sees you under honourable and unsuspected protection i will leave madras not to return till your destiny is in one way or other permanently fixed  no hartley said miss gray it may it must be friendly in you thus to advise me but it would be most base in me to advance my own affairs at the expense of your prospects besides what would this be but taking the chance of contingencies with the view of sharing poor middlemass fortunes should they prove prosperous and casting him off should they be otherwise tell me only do you of your own positive knowledge aver that you consider this woman as an unworthy and unfit protectress for so young a person as i am  of my own knowledge i can say nothing nay i must own that reports differ even concerning mrs montrevilles character but surely the mere suspicion  the mere suspicion mr hartley can have no weight with me considering that i can oppose to it the testimony of the man with whom i am willing to share my future fortunes you acknowledge the question is but doubtful and should not the assertion of him of whom i think so highly decide my belief in a doubtful matter what indeed must he be should this madame montreville be other than he represented her  what must he be indeed thought hartley internally but his lips uttered not the words he looked down in a deep reverie and at length started from it at the words of miss gray  it is time to remind you mr hartley that we must needs part god bless and preserve you  and you dearest menie exclaimed hartley as he sunk on one knee and pressed to his lips the hand which she held out to him god bless youyou must deserve blessing god protect youyou must need protectionoh should things prove different from what you hope send for me instantly and if man can aid you adam hartley will  he placed in her hand a card containing his address he then rushed from the apartment in the hall he met the lady of the mansion who made him a haughty reverence in token of adieu while a native servant of the upper class by whom she was attended made a low and reverential salam  hartley hastened from the black town more satisfied than before that some deceit was about to be practised towards menie graymore determined than ever to exert himself for her preservation yet more completely perplexed when he began to consider the doubtful character of the danger to which she might be exposed and the scanty means of protection which she had to oppose to it     chapter the twelfth   as hartley left the apartment in the house of ram sing cottah by one mode of exit miss gray retired by another to an apartment destined for her private use she too had reason for secret and anxious reflection since all her love for middlemas and her full confidence in his honour could not entirely conquer her doubts concerning the character of the person whom he had chosen for her temporary protectress and yet she could not rest these doubts upon any thing distinctly conclusive it was rather a dislike of her patronesss general manners and a disgust at her masculine notions and expressions that displeased her than any thing else  meantime madame montreville followed by her black domestic entered the apartment where hartley and menie had just parted it appeared from the conversation which follows that they had from some place of concealment overheard the dialogue we have narrated in the former chapter  it is good luck sadoc said the lady that there is in this world the great fool  and the great villain answered sadoc in good english but in a most sullen tone  this woman now continued the lady is what in frangistan you call an angel  ay and i have seen those in hindostan you may well call devil  i am sure that thishow you call himhartley is a meddling devil for what has he to do she will not have any of him what is his business who has her i wish we were well up the ghauts again my dear sadoc  for my part answered the slave i am half determined never to ascend the ghauts more hark you adela i begin to sicken of the plan we have laid this creatures confiding puritycall her angel or woman as you willmakes my practices appear too vile even in my own eyes i feel myself unfit to be your companion farther in the daring paths which you pursue let us part and part friends  amen coward but the woman remains with me answered the queen of sheba footnote in order to maintain uninjured the tone of passion throughout this dialogue it has been judged expedient to discard in the language of the begum the patois of madame munreville  with thee replied the seeming blacknever no adela she is under the shadow of the british flag and she shall experience its protection  yesand what protection will it afford to you yourself retorted the amazon what if i should clap my hands and command a score of my black servants to bind you like a sheep and then send word to the governor of the presidency that one richard middlemas who had been guilty of mutiny murder desertion and serving of the enemy against his countrymen is here at ram sing cottahs house in the disguise of a black servant middlemas covered his face with his hands while madame montreville proceeded to load him with reproachesyes she said slave and son of a slave since you wear the dress of my household you shall obey me as fully as the rest of them otherwisewhips fetters the scaffold renegadethe gallows murderer dost thou dare to reflect on the abyss of misery from which i raised thee to share my wealth and my affections dost thou not remember that the picture of this pale cold unimpassioned girl was then so indifferent to thee that thou didst sacrifice it as a tribute due to the benevolence of her who relieved thee to the affection of her who wretch as thou art condescended to love thee  yes fell woman answered middlemas but was it i who encouraged the young tyrants outrageous passion for a portrait or who formed the abominable plan of placing the original within his power  nofor to do so required brain and wit but it was thine flimsy villain to execute the device which a bolder genius planned it was thine to entice the woman to this foreign shore under pretence of a love which on thy part coldblooded miscreant never had existed  peace screechowl answered middlemas nor drive me to such madness as may lead me to forget thou art a woman  a woman dastard is this thy pretext for sparing mewhat then art thou who tremblest at a womans looks a womans wordsi am a woman renegade but one who wears a dagger and despises alike thy strength and thy courage i am a woman who has looked on more dying men than thou hast killed deer and antelopes thou must traffic for greatnessthou hast thrust thyself like a fiveyears child into the rough sports of men and wilt only be borne down and crushed for thy pains thou wilt be a double traitor forsoothbetray thy betrothed to the prince in order to obtain the means of betraying the prince to the english and thus gain thy pardon from thy countrymen but me thou shalt not betray i will not be made the tool of thy ambitioni will not give thee the aid of my treasures and my soldiers to be sacrificed at last to this northern icicle no i will watch thee as the fiend watches the wizard show but a symptom of betraying me while we are here and i denounce thee to the english who might pardon the successful villain but not him who can only offer prayers for his life in place of useful services let me see thee flinch when we are beyond the ghauts and the nawaub shall know thy intrigues with the nizam and the mahrattas and thy resolution to deliver up bangalore to the english when the imprudence of tippoo shall have made thee killedar go where thou wilt slave thou shalt find me thy mistress  and a fair though an unkind one said the counterfeit sadoc suddenly changing his tone to an affectation of tenderness it is true i pity this unhappy woman true i would save her if i couldbut most unjust to suppose i would in any circumstances prefer her to my nourjehan my light of the world my mootee mahul my pearl of the palace  all false coin and empty compliment said the begum let me hear in two brief words that you leave this woman to my disposal  but not to be interred alive under your seat like the circassian of whom you were jealous said middlemas shuddering  no fool her lot shall not be worse than that of being the favourite of a prince hast thou fugitive and criminal as thou art a better fate to offer her  but replied middlemas blushing even through his base disguise at the consciousness of his abject conduct i will have no force on her inclinations  such truce she shall have as the laws of the zenana allow replied the female tyrant a week is long enough for her to determine whether she will be the willing mistress of a princely and generous lover  ay said richard and before that week expireshe stopped short  what will happen before the week expires said the begum montreville  no matternothing of consequence i leave the womans fate with you  tis wellwe march tonight on our return so soon as the moon rises give orders to our retinue  to hear is to obey replied the seeming slave and left the apartment  the eyes of the begum remained fixed on the door through which he had passed villaindoubledyed villain she said i see thy drift thou wouldst betray tippoo in policy alike and in love but me thou canst betrayho there who waits let a trusty messenger be ready to set off instantly with letters which i will presently make ready his departure must be a secret to every oneand now shall this pale phantom soon know her destiny and learn what it is to have rivalled adela montreville  while the amazonian princess meditated plans of vengeance against her innocent rival and the guilty lover the latter plotted as deeply for his own purposes he had waited until such brief twilight as india enjoys rendered his disguise complete then set out in haste for the part of madras inhabited by the europeans or as it is termed fort st george  i will save her yet he said ere tippoo can seize his prize we will raise around his ears a storm which would drive the god of war from the arms of the goddess of beauty the trap shall close its fangs upon this indian tiger ere he has time to devour the bait which enticed him into the snare  while middlemas cherished these hopes he approached the residency the sentinel on duty stopped him as of course but he was in possession of the countersign and entered without opposition he rounded the building in which the president of the council resided an able and active but unconscientious man who neither in his own affairs nor in those of the company was supposed to embarrass himself much about the means which he used to attain his object a tap at a small postern gate was answered by a black slave who admitted middlemas to that necessary appurtenance of every government a back stair which in its turn conducted him to the office of the bramin paupiah the dubash or steward of the great man and by whose means chiefly he communicated with the native courts and carried on many mysterious intrigues which he did not communicate to his brethren at the councilboard  it is perhaps justice to the guilty and unhappy middlemas to suppose that if the agency of a british officer had been employed he might have been induced to throw himself on his mercy might have explained the whole of his nefarious bargain with tippoo and renouncing his guilty projects of ambition might have turned his whole thoughts upon saving menie gray ere she was transported beyond the reach of british protection but the thin dusky form which stood before him wrapped in robes of muslin embroidered with gold was that of paupiah known as a mastercounsellor of dark projects an oriental machiavel whose premature wrinkles were the result of many an intrigue in which the existence of the poor the happiness of the rich the honour of men and the chastity of women had been sacrificed without scruple to attain some private or political advantage he did not even enquire by what means the renegade briton proposed to acquire that influence with tippoo which might enable him to betray himhe only desired to be assured that the fact was real  you speak at the risk of your head if you deceive paupiah or make paupiah the means of deceiving his master i know so does all madras that the nawaub has placed his young son tippoo as viceregent of his newlyconquered territory of bangalore which hyder hath lately added to his dominions but that tippoo should bestow the government of that important place on an apostate feringi seems more doubtful  tippoo is young answered middlemas and to youth the temptation of the passions is what a lily on the surface of the lake is to childhood they will risk life to reach it though when obtained it is of little value tippoo has the cunning of his father and his military talents but he lacks his cautious wisdom  thou speakest truthbut when thou art governor of bangalore hast thou forces to hold the place till thou art relieved by the mahrattas or by the british  doubt it notthe soldiers of the begum mootee mahul whom the europeans call montreville are less hers than mine i am myself her bukshee general and her sirdars are at my devotion with these i could keep bangalore for two months and the british army may be before it in a week what do you risk by advancing general smiths army nearer to the frontier  we risk a settled peace with hyder answered paupiah for which he has made advantageous offers yet i say not but thy plan may be most advantageous thou sayest tippoos treasures are in the fort  his treasures and his zenana i may even be able to secure his person  that were a goodly pledge answered the hindoo minister  and you consent that the treasures shall be divided to the last rupee as in the scroll  the share of paupiahs master is too small said the bramin and the name of paupiah is unnoticed  the share of the begum may be divided between paupiah and his master answered middlemas  but the begum will expect her proportion replied paupiah  let me alone to deal with her said middlemas before the blow is struck she shall not know of our private treaty and afterwards her disappointment will be of little consequence and now remember my stipulationsmy rank to be restoredmy full pardon to be granted  ay replied paupiah cautiously should you succeed but were you to betray what has here passed i will find the dagger of a lootie which shall reach thee wert thou sheltered under the folds of the nawaubs garment in the meantime take this missive and when you are in possession of bangalore despatch it to general smith whose division shall have orders to approach as near the frontiers of mysore as may be without causing suspicion  thus parted this worthy pair paupiah to report to his principal the progress of these dark machinations middlemas to join the begum on her return to the mysore the gold and diamonds of tippoo the importance which he was about to acquire the ridding himself at once of the capricious authority of the irritable tippoo and the troublesome claims of the begum were such agreeable subjects of contemplation that he scarcely thought of the fate of his european victimunless to salve his conscience with the hope that the sole injury she could sustain might be the alarm of a few days during the course of which he would acquire the means of delivering her from the tyrant in whose zenana she was to remain a temporary prisoner he resolved at the same time to abstain from seeing her till the moment he could afford her protection justly considering the danger which his whole plan might incur if he again awakened the jealousy of the begum this he trusted was now asleep and in the course of their return to tippoos camp near bangalore it was his study to soothe this ambitious and crafty female by blandishments intermingled with the more splendid prospects of wealth and power to be opened to them both as he pretended by the success of his present enterprise footnote it is scarce necessary to say that such things could only be acted in the earlier period of our indian settlements when the check of the directors was imperfect and that of the crown did not exist my friend mr fairscribe is of opinion that there is an anachronism in the introduction of paupiah the bramin dubash of the english governorc c     chapter the thirteenth   it appears that the jealous and tyrannical begum did not long suspend her purpose of agonizing her rival by acquainting her with her intended fate by prayers or rewards menie gray prevailed on a servant of ram sing cottah to deliver to hartley the following distracted note  all is true your fears foretoldhe has delivered me up to a cruel woman who threatens to sell me to the tyrant tippoo save me if you canif you have not pity or cannot give me aid there is none left upon earthm g  the haste with which dr hartley sped to the fort and demanded an audience of the governor was defeated by the delays interposed by paupiah  it did not suit the plans of this artful hindoo that any interruption should be opposed to the departure of the begum and her favourite considering how much the plans of the last corresponded with his own he affected incredulity on the charge when hartley complained of an englishwoman being detained in the train of the begum against her consent treated the complaint of miss gray as the result of some female quarrel unworthy of particular attention and when at length he took some steps for examining further into the matter he contrived they should be so tardy that the begum and her retinue were far beyond the reach of interruption  hartley let his indignation betray him into reproaches against paupiah in which his principal was not spared this only served to give the impassable bramin a pretext for excluding him from the residency with a hint that if his language continued to be of such an imprudent character he might expect to be removed from madras and stationed at some hillfort or village among the mountains where his medical knowledge would find full exercise in protecting himself and others from the unhealthiness of the climate  as he retired bursting with ineffectual indignation esdale was the first person whom hartley chanced to meet with and to him stung with impatience he communicated what he termed the infamous conduct of the governors dubash connived at as he had but too much reason to suppose by the governor himself exclaiming against the want of spirit which they betrayed in abandoning a british subject to the fraud of renegades and the force of a tyrant  esdale listened with that sort of anxiety which prudent men betray when they feel themselves like to be drawn into trouble by the discourse of an imprudent friend  if you desire to be personally righted in this matter said he at length you must apply to leadenhall street where i suspectbetwixt ourselvescomplaints are accumulating fast both against paupiah and his master  i care for neither of them said hartley i need no personal redressi desire nonei only want succour for menie gray  in that case said esdale you have only one resourceyou must apply to hyder himself  to hyderto the usurperthe tyrant  yes to this usurper and tyrant answered esdale you must be contented to apply his pride is to be thought a strict administrator of justice and perhaps he may on this as on other occasions choose to display himself in the light of an impartial magistrate  then i go to demand justice at his footstool said hartley  not so fast my dear hartley answered his friend first consider the risk hyder is just by reflection and perhaps from political considerations but by temperament his blood is as unruly as ever beat under a black skin and if you do not find him in the vein of judging he is likely enough to be in that of killing stakes and bowstrings are as frequently in his head as the adjustment of the scales of justice  no matteri will instantly present myself at his durbar the governor cannot for very shame refuse me letters of credence  never think of asking them said his more experienced friend it would cost paupiah little to have them so worded as to induce hyder to rid our sable dubash at once and for ever of the sturdy freespoken dr adam hartley a vakeel or messenger of government sets out tomorrow for seringapatam contrive to join him on the road his passport will protect you both do you know none of the chiefs about hyders person  none excepting his late emissary to this place barak el hadgi answered hartley  his support said esdale although only a fakir may be as effectual as that of persons of more essential consequence and to say the truth where the caprice of a despot is the question in debate there is no knowing upon what it is best to reckontake my advice my dear hartley leave this poor girl to her fate after all by placing yourself in an attitude of endeavouring to save her it is a hundred to one that you only ensure your own destruction  hartley shook his head and bade esdale hastily farewell leaving him in the happy and selfapplauding state of mind proper to one who has given the best advice possible to a friend and may conscientiously wash his hands of all consequences  having furnished himself with money and with the attendance of three trusty native servants mounted like himself on arab horses and carrying with them no tent and very little baggage the anxious hartley lost not a moment in taking the road to mysore endeavouring in the meantime by recollecting every story he had ever heard of hyders justice and forbearance to assure himself that he should find the nawaub disposed to protect a helpless female even against the future heir of his empire  before he crossed the madras territory he overtook the vakeel or messenger of the british government of whom esdale had spoken this man accustomed for a sum of money to permit adventurous european traders who desired to visit hyders capital to share his protection passport and escort was not disposed to refuse the same good office to a gentleman of credit at madras and propitiated by an additional gratuity undertook to travel as speedily as possible it was a journey which was not prosecuted without much fatigue and considerable danger as they had to traverse a country frequently exposed to all the evils of war more especially when they approached the ghauts those tremendous mountainpasses which descend from the tableland of mysore and through which the mighty streams that arise in the centre of the indian peninsula find their way to the ocean  the sun had set ere the party reached the foot of one of these perilous passes up which lay the road to seringapatam a narrow path which in summer resembled an empty watercourse winding upwards among immense rocks and precipices was at one time completely overshadowed by dark groves of teaktrees and at another found its way beside impenetrable jungles the habitation of jackals and tigers  by means of this unsocial path the travellers threaded their way in silencehartley whose impatience kept him before the vakeel eagerly enquiring when the moon would enlighten the darkness which after the suns disappearance closed fast around them he was answered by the natives according to their usual mode of expression that the moon was in her dark side and that he was not to hope to behold her bursting through a cloud to illuminate the thickets and strata of black and slaty rocks amongst which they were winding hartley had therefore no resource save to keep his eye steadily fixed on the lighted match of the sowar or horseman who rode before him which for sufficient reasons was always kept in readiness to be applied to the priming of the matchlock the vidette on his part kept a watchful eye on the dowrah a guide supplied at the last village who having got more than halfway from his own house was much to be suspected of meditating how to escape the trouble of going further footnote in every village the dowrah or guide is an official person upon the public establishment and receives a portion of the harvest or other revenue along with the smith the sweeper and the barber as he gets nothing from the travellers whom it is his office to conduct he never scruples to shorten his own journey and prolong theirs by taking them to the nearest village without reference to the most direct line of route and sometimes deserts them entirely if the regular dowrah is sick or absent no wealth can procure a substitute  the dowrah on the other hand conscious of the lighted match and loaded gun behind him hollowed from time to time to show that he was on his duty and to accelerate the march of the travellers his cries were answered by an occasional ejaculation of ulla from the black soldiers who closed the rear and who were meditating on former adventures the plundering of a kaffila party of travelling merchants or some such exploit or perhaps reflecting that a tiger in the neighboring jungle might be watching patiently for the last of the party in order to spring upon him according to his usual practice  the sun which appeared almost as suddenly as it had left them served to light the travellers in the remainder of the ascent and called forth from the mahomedans belonging to the party the morning prayer of alla akber which resounded in long notes among the rocks and ravines and they continued with better advantage their forced march until the pass opened upon a boundless extent of jungle with a single high mud fort rising through the midst of it upon this plain rapine and war had suspended the labours of industry and the rich vegetation of the soil had in a few years converted a fertile champaign country into an almost impenetrable thicket accordingly the banks of a small nullah or brook were covered with the footmarks of tigers and other animals of prey  here the travellers stopped to drink and to refresh themselves and their horses and it was near this spot that hartley saw a sight which forced him to compare the subject which engrossed his own thoughts with the distress that had afflicted another  at a spot not far distant from the brook the guide called their attention to a most wretched looking man overgrown with hair who was seated on the skin of a tiger his body was covered with mud and ashes his skin sunburnt his dress a few wretched tatters he appeared not to observe the approach of the strangers neither moving nor speaking a word but remaining with his eyes fixed on a small and rude tomb formed of the black slate stones which lay around and exhibiting a small recess for a lamp as they approached the man and placed before him a rupee or two and some rice they observed that a tigers skull and bones lay beside him with a sabre almost consumed by rust  while they gazed on this miserable object the guide acquainted them with his tragical history sadhu sing had been a sipahee or soldier and freebooter of course the native and the pride of a halfruined village which they had passed on the preceding day he was betrothed to the daughter of a sipahee who served in the mud fort which they saw at a distance rising above the jungle in due time sadhu with his friends came for the purpose of the marriage and to bring home the bride she was mounted on a tatoo a small horse belonging to the country and sadhu and his friends preceded her on foot in all their joy and pride as they approached the nullah near which the travellers were resting there was heard a dreadful roar accompanied by a shriek of agony sadhu sing who instantly turned saw no trace of his bride save that her horse ran wild in one direction whilst in the other the long grass and reeds of the jungle were moving like the ripple of the ocean when distorted by the course of a shark holding its way near the surface sadhu drew his sabre and rushed forward in that direction the rest of the party remained motionless until roused by a short roar of agony they then plunged into the jungle with their drawn weapons where they speedily found sadhu sing holding in his arms the lifeless corpse of his bride where a little farther lay the body of the tiger slain by such a blow over the neck as desperation itself could alone have dischargedthe brideless bridegroom would permit none to interfere with his sorrow he dug a grave for his mora and erected over it the rude tomb they saw and never afterwards left the spot the beasts of prey themselves seemed to respect or dread the extremity of his sorrow his friends brought him food and water from the nullah but he neither smiled nor showed any mark of acknowledgment unless when they brought him flowers to deck the grave of mora four or five years according to the guide had passed away and there sadhu sing still remained among the trophies of his grief and his vengeance exhibiting all the symptoms of advanced age though still in the prime of youth the tale hastened the travellers from their restingplace the vakeel because it reminded him of the dangers of the jungle and hartley because it coincided too well with the probable fate of his beloved almost within the grasp of a more formidable tiger than that whose skeleton lay beside sadhu sing  it was at the mud fort already mentioned that the travellers received the first accounts of the progress of the begum and her party by a peon or footsoldier who had been in their company but was now on his return to the coast they had travelled he said with great speed until they ascended the ghauts where they were joined by a party of the begums own forces and he and others who had been brought from madras as a temporary escort were paid and dismissed to their homes after this he understood it was the purpose of the begum mootee mahul to proceed by slow marches and frequent halts to bangalore the vicinity of which place she did not desire to reach until prince tippoo with whom she desired an interview should have returned from an expedition towards vandicotta in which he had lately been engaged  from the result of his anxious enquiries hartley had reason to hope that though seringapatam was seventyfive miles more to the eastward than bangalore yet by using diligence he might have time to throw himself at the feet of hyder and beseech his interposition before the meeting betwixt tippoo and the begum should decide the fate of menie gray on the other hand he trembled as the peon told him that the begums bukshee or general who had travelled to madras with her in disguise had now assumed the dress and character belonging to his rank and it was expected he was to be honoured by the mahomedan prince with some high office of dignity with still deeper anxiety he learned that a palanquin watched with sedulous care by the slaves of oriental jealousy contained it was whispered a feringi or frankish woman beautiful as a houri who had been brought from england by the begum as a present to tippoo the deed of villany was therefore in full train to be accomplished it remained to see whether by diligence on hartleys side its course could be interrupted  when this eager vindicator of betrayed innocence arrived in the capital of hyder it may be believed that he consumed no time in viewing the temple of the celebrated vishnoo or in surveying the splendid gardens called lollbang which were the monument of hyders magnificence and now hold his mortal remains on the contrary he was no sooner arrived in the city than he hastened to the principal mosque having no doubt that he was there most likely to learn some tidings of barak el hadgi he approached accordingly the sacred spot and as to enter it would have cost a feringi his life he employed the agency of a devout mussulman to obtain information concerning the person whom he sought he was not long in learning that the fakir barak was within the mosque as he had anticipated busied with his holy office of reading passages from the koran and its most approved commentators to interrupt him in his devout task was impossible and it was only by a high bribe that he could prevail on the same moslem whom he had before employed to slip into the sleeve of the holy mans robe a paper containing his name and that of the khan in which the vakeel had taken up his residence the agent brought back for answer that the fakir immersed as was to be expected in the holy service which he was in the act of discharging had paid no visible attention to the symbol of intimation which the feringi sahib european gentleman had sent to him distracted with the loss of time of which each moment was precious hartley next endeavoured to prevail on the mussulman to interrupt the fakirs devotions with a verbal message but the man was indignant at the very proposal  dog of a christian he said what art thou and thy whole generation that barak el hadgi should lose a divine thought for the sake of an infidel like thee  exasperated beyond selfpossession the unfortunate hartley was now about to intrude upon the precincts of the mosque in person in hopes of interrupting the formal prolonged recitation which issued from its recesses when an old man laid his hand on his shoulder and prevented him from a rashness which might have cost him his life saying at the same time you are a sahib angrezie english gentleman i have been a telinga a private soldier in the companys service and have eaten their salt i will do your errand for you to the fakir barak el hadgi  so saying he entered the mosque and presently returned with the fakirs answer in these enigmatical wordshe who would see the sun rise must watch till the dawn  with this poor subject of consolation hartley retired to his inn to meditate on the futility of the professions of the natives and to devise some other mode of finding access to hyder than that which he had hitherto trusted to on this point however he lost all hope being informed by his late fellowtraveller whom he found at the khan that the nawaub was absent from the city on a secret expedition which might detain him for two or three days this was the answer which the vakeel himself had received from the dewan with a farther intimation that he must hold himself ready when he was required to deliver his credentials to prince tippoo instead of the nawaub his business being referred to the former in a way not very promising for the success of his mission  hartley was now nearly thrown into despair he applied to more than one officer supposed to have credit with the nawaub but the slightest hint of the nature of his business seemed to strike all with terror not one of the persons he applied to would engage in the affair or even consent to give it a hearing and the dewan plainly told him that to engage in opposition to prince tippoos wishes was the ready way to destruction and exhorted him to return to the coast driven almost to distraction by his various failures hartley betook himself in the evening to the khan the call of the muezzins thundering from the minarets had invited the faithful to prayers when a black servant about fifteen years old stood before hartley and pronounced these words deliberately and twice overthus says barak el hadgi the watcher in the mosque he that would see the sun rise let him turn towards the east he then left the caravanserai and it may be well supposed that hartley starting from the carpet on which he had lain down to repose himself followed his youthful guide with renewed vigour and palpitating hope     chapter the fourteenth     twas the hour when rites unholy     calld each paynim voice to prayer   and the star that faded slowly     left to dews the freshened air    day his sultry fires had wasted     calm and cool the moonbeams shone   to the viziers lofty palace     one bold christian came alone      thomas campbell quoted from memory  the twilight darkened into night so fast that it was only by his white dress that hartley could discern his guide as he tripped along the splendid bazaar of the city but the obscurity was so far favourable that it prevented the inconvenient attention which the natives might otherwise have bestowed upon the european in his native dress a sight at that time very rare in seringapatam  the various turnings and windings through which he was conducted ended at a small door in a wall which from the branches that hung over it seemed to surround a garden or grove  the postern opened on a tap from his guide and the slave having entered hartley prepared to follow but stepped back as a gigantic african brandished at his head a scimetar three fingers broad the young slave touched his countryman with a rod which he held in his hand and it seemed as if the touch disabled the giant whose arm and weapon sunk instantly hartley entered without farther opposition and was now in a grove of mangotrees through which an infant moon was twinkling faintly amid the murmur of waters the sweet song of the nightingale and the odours of the rose yellow jasmine orange and citron flowers and persian narcissus huge domes and arches which were seen imperfectly in the quivering light seemed to intimate the neighbourhood of some sacred edifice where the fakir had doubtless taken up his residence  hartley pressed on with as much haste as he could and entered a sidedoor and narrow vaulted passage at the end of which was another door here his guide stopped but pointed and made indications that the european should enter hartley did so and found himself in a small cell such as we have formerly described wherein sate barak el hadgi with another fakir who to judge from the extreme dignity of a white beard which ascended up to his eyes on each side must be a man of great sanctity as well as importance  hartley pronounced the usual salutation of salam alaikum in the most modest and deferential tone but his former friend was so far from responding in their former strain of intimacy that having consulted the eye of his older companion he barely pointed to a third carpet upon which the stranger seated himself crosslegged after the country fashion and a profound silence prevailed for the space of several minutes hartley knew the oriental customs too well to endanger the success of his suit by precipitation he waited an intimation to speak at length it came and from barak  when the pilgrim barak he said dwelt at madras he had eyes and a tongue but now he is guided by those of his father the holy scheik hali ben khaledoun the superior of his convent  this extreme humility hartley thought inconsistent with the affectation of possessing superior influence which barak had shown while at the presidency but exaggeration of their own consequence is a foible common to all who find themselves in a land of strangers addressing the senior fakir therefore he told him in as few words as possible the villanous plot which was laid to betray menie gray into the hands of the prince tippoo he made his suit for the reverend fathers intercession with the prince himself and with his father the nawaub in the most persuasive terms the fakir listened to him with an inflexible and immovable aspect similar to that with which a wooden saint regards his eager supplicants there was a second pause when after resuming his pleading more than once hartley was at length compelled to end it for want of matter  the silence was broken by the elder fakir who after shooting a glance at his younger companion by a turn of the eye without the least alteration of the position of the head and body said the unbeliever has spoken like a poet but does he think that the nawaub khan hyder ali behauder will contest with his son tippoo the victorious the possession of an infidel slave  hartley received at the same time a side glance from barak as if encouraging him to plead his own cause he suffered a minute to elapse and then replied  the nawaub is in the place of the prophet a judge over the low as well as high it is written that when the prophet decided a controversy between the two sparrows concerning a grain of rice his wife fatima said to him doth the missionary of allah well to bestow his time in distributing justice on a matter so slight and between such despicable litigantsknow woman answered the prophetthat the sparrows and the grain of rice are the creation of allah they are not worth more than thou hast spoken but justice is a treasure of inestimable price and it must be imparted by him who holdeth power to all who require it at his hand the prince doth the will of allah who gives it alike in small matters as in great and to the poor as well as the powerful to the hungry bird a grain of rice is as a chaplet of pearls to a sovereigni have spoken  bismallahpraised be god he hath spoken like a moullah said the elder fakir with a little more emotion and some inclination of his head towards barak for on hartley he scarcely deigned even to look  the lips have spoken it which cannot lie replied barak and there was again a pause  it was once more broken by scheick hali who addressing himself directly to hartley demanded of him hast thou heard feringi of aught of treason meditated by this kafr infidel against the nawaub behander  out of a traitor cometh treason said hartley but to speak after my knowledge i am not conscious of such design  there is truth in the words of him said the fakir who accuseth not his enemy save on his knowledge the things thou hast spoken shall be laid before the nawaub and as allah and he will so shall the issue be meantime return to thy khan and prepare to attend the vakeel of thy government who is to travel with dawn to bangalore the strong the happy the holy city peace be with theeis it not so my son  barak to whom this appeal was made replied even as my father hath spoken  hartley had no alternative but to arise and take his leave with the usual phrase salamgods peace be with you  his youthful guide who waited his return without conducted him once more to his khan through bypaths which he could not have found out without pilotage his thoughts were in the mean time strongly engaged on his late interview he knew the moslem men of religion were not implicitly to be trusted the whole scene might be a scheme of barak to get rid of the trouble of patronizing a european in a delicate affair and he determined to be guided by what should seem to confirm or discredit the intimation which he had received  on his arrival at the khan he found the vakeel of the british government in a great bustle preparing to obey directions transmitted to him by the nawaubs dewan or treasurer directing him to depart the next morning with break of day for bangalore  he expressed great discontent at the order and when hartley intimated his purpose of accompanying him seemed to think him a fool for his pains hinting the probability that hyder meant to get rid of them both by means of the freebooters through whose countries they were to pass with such a feeble escort this fear gave way to another when the time of departure came at which moment there rode up about two hundred of the nawaubs native cavalry the sirdar who commanded these troops behaved with civility and stated that he was directed to attend upon the travellers and to provide for their safety and convenience on the journey but his manner was reserved and distant and the vakeel insisted that the force was intended to prevent their escape rather than for their protection under such unpleasant auspices the journey between seringapatam and bangalore was accomplished in two days and part of a third the distance being nearly eighty miles  on arriving in view of this fine and populous city they found an encampment already established within a mile of its walls it occupied a tope or knoll covered with trees and looked full on the gardens which tippoo had created in one quarter of the city the rich pavilions of the principal persons flamed with silk and gold and spears with gilded points or poles supporting gold knobs displayed numerous little banners inscribed with the name of the prophet this was the camp of the begum mootee mahul who with a small body of her troops about two hundred men was waiting the return of tippoo under the walls of bangalore their private motives for desiring a meeting the reader is acquainted with to the public the visit of the begum had only the appearance of an act of deference frequently paid by inferior and subordinate princes to the patrons whom they depend upon  these facts ascertained the sirdar of the nawaub took up his own encampment within sight of that of the begum but at about half a miles distance despatching to the city a messenger to announce to the prince tippoo as soon as he should arrive that he had come hither with the english vakeel  the bustle of pitching a few tents was soon over and hartley solitary and sad was left to walk under the shade of two or three mangotrees and looking to the displayed streamers of the begums encampment to reflect that amid these insignia of mahomedanism menie gray remained destined by a profligate and treacherous lover to the fate of slavery to a heathen tyrant the consciousness of being in her vicinity added to the bitter pangs with which hartley contemplated her situation and reflected how little chance there appeared of his being able to rescue her from it by the mere force of reason and justice which was all he could oppose to the selfish passions of a voluptuous tyrant a lover of romance might have meditated some means of effecting her release by force or address but hartley though a man of courage had no spirit of adventure and would have regarded as desperate any attempt of the kind  his sole gleam of comfort arose from the impression which he had apparently made upon the elder fakir which he could not help hoping might be of some avail to him but on one thing he was firmly resolved and that was not to relinquish the cause he had engaged in whilst a grain of hope remained he had seen in his own profession a quickening and a revival of life in the patients eye even when glazed apparently by the hand of death and he was taught confidence amidst moral evil by his success in relieving that which was physical only  while hartley was thus meditating he was roused to attention by a heavy firing of artillery from the high bastions of the town and turning his eyes in that direction he could see advancing on the northern side of bangalore a tide of cavalry riding tumultuously forward brandishing their spears in all different attitudes and pressing their horses to a gallop the clouds of dust which attended this vanguard for such it was combined with the smoke of the guns did not permit hartley to see distinctly the main body which followed but the appearance of howdahed elephants and royal banners dimly seen through the haze plainly intimated the return of tippoo to bangalore while shouts and irregular discharges of musketry announced the real or pretended rejoicing of the inhabitants the city gates received the living torrent which rolled towards them the clouds of smoke and dust were soon dispersed and the horizon was restored to serenity and silence  the meeting between persons of importance more especially of royal rank is a matter of very great consequence in india and generally much address is employed to induce the person receiving the visit to come as far as possible to meet the visitor from merely rising up or going to the edge of the carpet to advancing to the gate of the palace to that of the city or finally to a mile or two on the road is all subject to negotiation but tippoos impatience to possess the fair european induced him to grant on this occasion a much greater degree of courtesy than the begum had dared to expect and he appointed his garden adjacent to the city walls and indeed included within the precincts of the fortifications as the place of their meeting the hour noon on the day succeeding his arrival for the natives seldom move early in the morning or before having broken their fast this was intimated to the begums messenger by the prince in person as kneeling before him he presented the mizzar a tribute consisting of three five or seven gold mohurs always an odd number and received in exchange a khelaut or dress of honour the messenger in return was eloquent in describing the importance of his mistress her devoted veneration for the prince the pleasure which she experienced on the prospect of their motakul or meeting and concluded with a more modest compliment to his own extraordinary talents and the confidence which the begum reposed in him he then departed and orders were given that on the next day all should be in readiness for the sowarree a grand procession when the prince was to receive the begum as his honoured guest at his pleasurehouse in the gardens  long before the appointed hour the rendezvous of fakirs beggars and idlers before the gate of the palace intimated the excited expectations of those who usually attend processions while a more urgent set of mendicants the courtiers were hastening thither on horses or elephants as their means afforded always in a hurry to show their zeal and with a speed proportioned to what they hoped or feared  at noon precisely a discharge of cannon placed in the outer courts as also of matchlocks and of small swivels carried by camels the poor animals shaking their long ears at every discharge announced that tippoo had mounted his elephant the solemn and deep sound of the naggra or state drum borne upon an elephant was then heard like the distant discharge of artillery followed by a long roll of musketry and was instantly answered by that of numerous trumpets and tomtoms or common drums making a discordant but yet a martial din the noise increased as the procession traversed the outer courts of the palace in succession and at length issued from the gates having at their head the chobdars bearing silver sticks and clubs and shouting at the pitch of their voices the titles and the virtues of tippoo the great the generous the invinciblestrong as rustan just as noushirvanwith a short prayer for his continued health  after these came a confused body of men on foot bearing spears matchlocks and banners and intermixed with horsemen some in complete shirts of mail with caps of steel under their turbans some in a sort of defensive armour consisting of rich silk dresses rendered sabre proof by being stuffed with cotton these champions preceded the prince as whose body guards they acted it was not till after this time that tippoo raised his celebrated tigerregiment disciplined and armed according to the european fashion immediately before the prince came on a small elephant a hardfaced severelooking man by office the distributor of alms which he flung in showers of small copper money among the fakirs and beggars whose scrambles to collect them seemed to augment their amount while the grimlooking agent of mahomedan charity together with his elephant which marched with half angry eyes and its trunk curled upwards seemed both alike ready to chastise those whom poverty should render too importunate  tippoo himself next appeared richly apparelled and seated on an elephant which carrying its head above all the others in the procession seemed proudly conscious of superior dignity the howdah or seat which the prince occupied was of silver embossed and gilt having behind a place for a confidential servant who waved the great chowry or cowtail to keep off the flies but who could also occasionally perform the task of spokesman being well versed in all terms of flattery and compliment the caparisons of the royal elephant were of scarlet cloth richly embroidered with gold behind tippoo came the various courtiers and officers of the household mounted chiefly on elephants all arrayed in their most splendid attire and exhibiting the greatest pomp  in this manner the procession advanced down the principal street of the town to the gate of the royal gardens the houses were ornamented by broad cloth silk shawls and embroidered carpets of the richest colours displayed from the verandahs and windows even the meanest hut was adorned with some piece of cloth so that the whole street had a singularly rich and gorgeous appearance  this splendid procession having entered the royal gardens approached through a long avenue of lofty trees a chabootra or platform of white marble canopied by arches of the same material which occupied the centre it was raised four or five feet from the ground covered with white cloth and persian carpets in the centre of the platform was the musnud or state cushion of the prince six feet square composed of crimson velvet richly embroidered by special grace a small low cushion was placed on the right of the prince for the occupation of the begum in front of this platform was a square tank or pond of marble four feet deep and filled to the brim with water as clear as crystal having a large jet or fountain in the middle which threw up a column of it to the height of twenty feet  the prince tippoo had scarcely dismounted from his elephant and occupied the musnod or throne of cushions when the stately form of the begum was seen advancing to the place of rendezvous the elephant being left at the gate of the gardens opening into the country opposite to that by which the procession of tippoo had entered she was carried in an open litter richly ornamented with silver and borne on the shoulders of six black slaves her person was as richly attired as silks and gems could accomplish  richard middlemas as the begums general or bukshee walked nearest to her litter in a dress as magnificent in itself as it was remote from all european costume being that of a banka or indian courtier his turban was of rich silk and gold twisted very hard and placed on one side of his head its ends hanging down on the shoulder his mustaches were turned and curled and his eyelids stained with antimony the vest was of gold brocade with a cummerband or sash around his waist corresponding to his turban he carried in his hand a large sword sheathed in a scabbard of crimson velvet and wore around his middle a broad embroidered swordbelt what thoughts he had under this gay attire and the bold bearing which corresponded to it it would be fearful to unfold his least detestable hopes were perhaps those which tended to save menie gray by betraying the prince who was about to confide in him and the begum at whose intercession tippoos confidence was to be reposed  the litter stopped as it approached the tank on the opposite side of which the prince was seated on his musnud middlemas assisted the begum to descend and led her deeply veiled with silver muslin towards the platform of marble the rest of the retinue of the begum followed in their richest and most gaudy attire all males however nor was there a symptom of woman being in her train except that a close litter guarded by twenty black slaves having their sabres drawn remained at some distance in a thicket of flowering shrubs  when tippoo saib through the dim haze which hung over the waterfall discerned the splendid train of the begum advancing he arose from his musnud so as to receive her near the foot of his throne and exchanged greetings with her upon the pleasure of meeting and enquiries after their mutual health he then conducted her to the cushion placed near to his own while his courtiers anxiously showed their politeness in accommodating those of the begum with places upon the carpets around where they all sat down crossleggedrichard middlemas occupying a conspicuous situation  the people of inferior note stood behind and amongst them was the sirdar of hyder ali with hartley and the madras vakeel it would be impossible to describe the feelings with which hartley recognized the apostate middlemas and the amazonian mrs montreville the sight of them worked up his resolution to make an appeal against them in full durbar to the justice which tippoo was obliged to render to all who should complain of injuries in the meanwhile the prince who had hitherto spoken in a low voice while acknowledging it is to be supposed the service and the fidelity of the begum now gave the sign to his attendant who said in an elevated tone wherefore and to requite these services the mighty prince at the request of the mighty begum mootee mahul beautiful as the moon and wise as the daughter of giamschid had decreed to take into his service the bukshee of her armies and to invest him as one worthy of all confidence with the keeping of his beloved capital of bangalore  the voice of the crier had scarce ceased when it was answered by one as loud which sounded from the crowd of bystanders cursed is he who maketh the robber leik his treasurer or trusteth the lives of moslemah to the command of an apostate  with unutterable satisfaction yet with trembling doubt and anxiety hartley traced the speech to the elder fakir the companion of barak tippoo seemed not to notice the interruption which passed for that of some mad devotee to whom the moslem princes permit great freedoms the durbar therefore recovered from their surprise and in answer to the proclamation united in the shout of applause which is expected to attend every annunciation of the royal pleasure  their acclamation had no sooner ceased than middlemas arose bent himself before the musnud and in a set speech declared his unworthiness of such high honour as had now been conferred and his zeal for the princes service something remained to be added but his speech faltered his limbs shook and his tongue seemed to refuse its office  the begum started from her seat though contrary to etiquette and said as if to supply the deficiency in the speech of her officer my slave would say that in acknowledgment of so great an honour conferred on my bukshee i am so void of means that i can only pray your highness will deign to accept a lily from frangistan to plant within the recesses of the secret garden of thy pleasures let my lords guards carry yonder litter to the zenana  a female screamwas heard as at the signal from tippoo the guards of his seraglio advanced to receive the closed litter from the attendants of the begum the voice of the old fakir was heard louder and sterner than beforecursed is the prince who barters justice for lust he shall die in the gate by the sword of the stranger  this is too insolent said tippoo drag forward that fakir and cut his robe into tatters on his back with your chabouks footnote long whips  but a scene ensued like that in the hall of seyd all who attempted to obey the command of the incensed despot fell back from the fakir as they would from the angel of death he flung his cap and fictitious beard on the ground and the incensed countenance of tippoo was subdued in an instant when he encountered the stern and awful eye of his father a sign dismissed him from the throne which hyder himself ascended while the official menials hastily disrobed him of his tattered cloak and flung on him a robe of regal splendour and placed on his head a jewelled turban the durbar rung with acclamations to hyder ali khan behauder the good the wise the discoverer of hidden things who cometh into the divan like the sun bursting from the clouds  the nawaub at length signed for silence and was promptly obeyed he looked majestically around him and at length bent his look upon tippoo whose downcast eyes as he stood before the throne with his arms folded on his bosom were strongly contrasted with the haughty air of authority which he had worn but a moment before thou hast been willing said the nawaub to barter the safety of thy capital for the possession of a white slave but the beauty of a fair woman caused solomon ben david to stumble in his path how much more then should the son of hyder naig remain firm under temptationthat men may see clearly we must remove the light which dazzles them yonder feringi woman must be placed at my disposal  to hear is to obey replied tippoo while the deep gloom on his brow showed what his forced submission cost his proud and passionate spirit in the hearts of the courtiers present reigned the most eager curiosity to see the denouement of the scene but not a trace of that wish was suffered to manifest itself on features accustomed to conceal all internal sensations the feelings of the begum were hidden under her veil while in spite of a bold attempt to conceal his alarm the perspiration stood in large drops on the brow of richard middlemas the next words of the nawaub sounded like music in the ear of hartley  carry the feringi woman to the tent of the sirdar belash cassim the chief to whom hartley had been committed let her be tended in all honour and let him prepare to escort her with the vakeel and the hakim hartley to the payeenghaut the country beneath the passes answering for their safety with his head the litter was on its road to the sirdars tents ere the nawaub had done speaking for thee tippoo continued hyder i am not come hither to deprive thee of authority or to disgrace thee before the durbar such things as thou hast promised to this feringi proceed to make them good the sun calleth not back the splendour which he lends to the moon and the father obscures not the dignity which he has conferred on the son what thou hast promised that do thou proceed to make good  the ceremony of investiture was therefore recommenced by which the prince tippoo conferred on middlemas the important government of the city of bangalore probably with the internal resolution that since he was himself deprived of the fair european he would take an early opportunity to remove the new killedar from his charge while middlemas accepted it with the throbbing hope that he might yet outwit both father and son the deed of investiture was read aloudthe robe of honour was put upon the newly created killedar and a hundred voices while they blessed the prudent choice of tippoo wished the governor good fortune and victory over his enemies  a horse was led forward as the princes gift it was a fine steed of the cuttyawar breed highcrested with broad hindquarters he was of a white colour but had the extremity of his tail and mane stained red his saddle was red velvet the bridle and crupper studdedwith gilded knobs two attendants on lesser horses led this prancing animal one holding the lance and the other the long spear of their patron the horse was shown to the applauding courtiers and withdrawn in order to be led in state through the streets while the new killedar should follow on the elephant another present usual on such an occasion which was next made to advance that the world might admire the munificence of the prince  the huge animal approached the platform shaking his large wrinkled head which he raised and sunk as if impatient and curling upwards his trunk from time to time as if to show the gulf of his tongueless mouth gracefully retiring with the deepest obeisance the killedar well pleased the audience was finished stood by the neck of the elephant expecting the conductor of the animal would make him kneel down that he might ascend the gilded howdah which awaited his occupancy  hold feringi said hyder thou hast received all that was promised thee by the bounty of tippoo accept now what is the fruit of the justice of hyder  as he spoke he signed with his finger and the driver of the elephant instantly conveyed to the animal the pleasure of the nawaub curling his long trunk around the neck of the illfated european the monster suddenly threw the wretch prostrate before him and stamping his huge shapeless foot upon his breast put an end at once to his life and to his crimes the cry which the victim uttered was mimicked by the roar of the monster and a sound like an hysterical laugh mingling with a scream which rung from under the veil of the begum the elephant once more raised his trunk aloft and gaped fearfully  the courtiers preserved a profound silence but tippoo upon whose muslin robe a part of the victims blood had spirted held it up to the nawaub exclaiming in a sorrowful yet resentful tonefatherfatherwas it thus my promise should have been kept  know foolish boy said hyder ali that the carrion which lies there was in a plot to deliver bangalore to the feringis and the mahrattas this begum she started when she heard herself named has given us warning of the plot and has so merited her pardon for having originally concurred in itwhether altogether out of love to us we will not too curiously enquirehence with that lump of bloody clay and let the hakim hartley and the english vakeel come before me  they were brought forwardwhile some of the attendants flung sand upon the bloody traces and others removed the crushed corpse  hakim said hyder thou shalt return with the feringi woman and with gold to compensate her injurieswherein the begum as is fitting shall contribute a share do thou say to thy nation hyder ali acts justly the nawaub then inclined himself graciously to hartley and then turning to the vakeel who appeared much discomposed you have brought to me he said words of peacewhile your masters meditated a treacherous war it is not upon such as you that my vengeance ought to alight but tell the kafr or infidel paupiah and his unworthy master that hyder ali sees too clearly to suffer to be lost by treason the advantages he has gained by war hitherto i have been in the carnatic as a mild princein future i will be a destroying tempest hitherto i have made inroads as a compassionate and merciful conquerorhereafter i will be the messenger whom allah sends to the kingdoms which he visits in judgment  it is well known how dreadfully the nawaub kept this promise and how he and his son afterwards sunk before the discipline and bravery of the europeans the scene of just punishment which he so faithfully exhibited might be owing to his policy his internal sense of right and to the ostentation of displaying it before an englishman of sense and intelligence or to all of these motives mingled togetherbut in what proportions it is not for us to distinguish  hartley reached the coast in safety with his precious charge rescued from a dreadful fate when she was almost beyond hope but the nerves and constitution of menie gray had received a shock from which she long suffered severely and never entirely recovered the principal ladies of the settlement moved by the singular tale of her distress received her with the utmost kindness and exercised towards her the most attentive and affectionate hospitality the nawaub faithful to his promise remitted to her a sum of no less than ten thousand gold mohurs extorted as was surmised almost entirely from the hoards of the begum mootee mahul or montreville of the fate of that adventuress nothing was known for certainty but her forts and government were taken into hyders custody and report said that her power being abolished and her consequence lost she died by poison either taken by herself or administered by some other person  it might be thought a natural conclusion of the history of menie gray that she should have married hartley to whom she stood much indebted for his heroic interference in her behalf but her feelings were too much and too painfully agitated her health too much shattered to permit her to entertain thoughts of a matrimonial connexion even with the acquaintance of her youth and the champion of her freedom time might have removed these obstacles but not two years after their adventures in mysore the gallant and disinterested hartley fell a victim to his professional courage in withstanding the progress of a contagious distemper which he at length caught and under which he sunk he left a considerable part of the moderate fortune which he had acquired to menie gray who of course did not want for many advantageous offers of a matrimonial character but she respected the memory of hartley too much to subdue in behalf of another the reasons which induced her to refuse the hand which he had so well deservednay it may be thought had so fairly won  she returned to britainwhat seldom occursunmarried though wealthy and settling in her native village appeared to find her only pleasure in acts of benevolence which seemed to exceed the extent of her fortune had not her very retired life been taken into consideration two or three persons with whom she was intimate could trace in her character that generous and disinterested simplicity and affection which were the groundwork of her character to the world at large her habits seemed those of the ancient roman matron which is recorded on her tomb in these four words    domum mansitlanam fecit     mr croftangrys conclusion     if you tell a good jest     and please all the rest   comes dingley and asks you what was it     and before she can know   away she will go     to seek an old rag in the closet                           dean swift   while i was inditing the goodly matter which my readers have just perused i might be said to go through a course of breakingin to stand criticism like a shootingpony to stand fire by some of those venial breaches of confidence which always take place on the like occasions my private flirtations with the muse of fiction became a matter whispered in miss fairscribes circle some ornaments of which were i suppose highly interested in the progress of the affair while others really thought mr chrystal croftangry might have had more wit at his time of day then came the sly intimation the oblique remark all that sugarlipped raillery which is fitted for the situation of a man about to do a foolish thing whether it be to publish or to marry and that accompanied with the discreet nods and winks of such friends as are in the secret and the obliging eagerness of others to know all about it  at length the affair became so far public that i was induced to face a teaparty with my manuscript in my pocket looking as simple and modest as any gentleman of a certain age need to do upon such an occasion when tea had been carried round handkerchiefs and smelling bottles prepared i had the honour of reading the surgeons daughter for the entertainment of the evening it went off excellently my friend mr fairscribe who had been seduced from his desk to join the literary circle only fell asleep twice and readily recovered his attention by help of his snuffbox the ladies were politely attentive and when the cat or the dog or a next neighbour tempted an individual to relax katie fairscribe was on the alert like an active whipperin with look touch or whisper to recall them to a sense of what was going on whether miss katie was thus active merely to enforce the literary discipline of her coterie or whether she was really interested by the beauties of the piece and desirous to enforce them on others i will not venture to ask in case i should end in liking the girland she is really a pretty one better than wisdom would warrant either for my sake or hers  i must own my story here and there flagged a good deal perhaps there were faults in my reading for while i should have been attending to nothing but how to give the words effect as they existed i was feeling the chilling consciousness that they might have been and ought to have been a great deal better however we kindled up at last when we got to the east indies although on the mention of tigers an old lady whose tongue had been impatient for an hour broke in with i wonder if mr croftangry ever heard the story of tiger tullideph and had nearly inserted the whole narrative as an episode in my tale she was however brought to reason and the subsequent mention of shawls diamonds turbans and cummerbands had their usual effect in awakening the imaginations of the fair auditors at the extinction of the faithless lover in a way so horribly new i had as indeed i expected the good fortune to excite that expression of painful interest which is produced by drawing in the breath through the compressed lips nay one miss of fourteen actually screamed  at length my task was ended and the fair circle rained odours upon me as they pelt beaux at the carnival with sugarplums and drench them with scented spices there was beautiful and sweetly interesting and o mr croftangry and how much obliged and what a delightful evening and o miss katie how could you keep such a secret so long while the dear souls were thus smothering me with rose leaves the merciless old lady carried them all off by a disquisition upon shawls which she had the impudence to say arose entirely out of my story miss katie endeavoured to stop the flow of her eloquence in vain she threw all other topics out of the field and from the genuine indian she made a digression to the imitation shawls now made at paisley out of real thibet wool not to be known from the actual country shawl except by some inimitable crossstitch in the border it is well said the old lady wrapping herself up in a rich kashmire that there is some way of knowing a thing that cost fifty guineas from an article that is sold for five but i venture to say there are not one out of ten thousand that would understand the difference  the politeness of some of the fair ladies would now have brought back the conversation to the forgotten subject of our meeting how could you mr croftangry collect all these hard words about indiayou were never thereno madam i have not had that advantage but like the imitative operatives of paisley i have composed my shawl by incorporating into the woof a little thibet wool which my excellent friend and neighbour colonel mackerris one of the best fellows who ever trode a highland moor or dived into an indian jungle had the goodness to supply me with  my rehearsal however though not absolutely and altogether to my taste has prepared me in some measure for the less tempered and guarded sentence of the world so a man must learn to encounter a foil before he confronts a sword and to take up my original simile a horse must be accustomed to a feu de joie before you can ride him against a volley of balls well corporal nyms philosophy is not the worst that has been preached things must be as they may if my lucubrations give pleasure i may again require the attention of the courteous reader if not here end the  chronicles of the canongate
