a beautiful valley carpeted with bunch grass which looks particularly bright and green to the venturesome traveller who has just crossed either of the two deserts lying toward the east  buffalo meadows the indians named it because of the vast herds of american bison found there before the white men hunted simply for the sport of killing but those who halt at the last watercourse prior to crossing the wide stretches of sand on the journey east speak of it as comfort hollow  to a travelstained party who halted at the waterpool nearest the desert on a certain afternoon in september two years ago this last name seemed particularly appropriate  they had come neither for gold nor the sport of hunting but were wearily retracing their steps after having wandered and suffered among the foothills of the sierras in a fruitless search for a home on which they had been lured by unscrupulous speculators  nearly two years previous richard stevensroving dick his acquaintances called himhad first crossed the vast plain of sand with his wife son and daughter  his entire worldly possessions consisted of a small assortment of household goods packed in a stout longbodied wagon covered with canvas stretched over five poles bent in a halfcircle and drawn by two decrepit horses  the journey had been a failure so far as finding a home in the wilds was concerned where the head of the family could live without much labor and now the homeless ones decidedly the worse for wear were returning to willow point on the little humboldt river  the provisions had long since been exhausted the wagon rudely repaired in many places the cooking utensils were reduced to one pot and a battered dipper the canvas covering was torn and decaying and the horses presented a skeletonlike appearance  the family had suffered outwardly quite as much as the goods young dick and his father wore clothing which had been patched and repatched with anything mrs stevens could push a needle through until it would have been impossible to say what was the original material but to a boy thirteen years of age this seemed a matter of little consequence while his father preferred such a costume rather than exert himself to tan deerhides for one more serviceable  mrs stevens and sixyearold margie were in a less forlorn condition as to garments but they also needed a new outfit sadly and nearly every day young dick told them confidentially that he would attend to the matter immediately after arriving at willow point even if it became necessary for him to sell his rifle the only article of value he owned  once across the desert mother he said as the sorrylooking team was drawn up by the side of the pool and he began to unharness the horses while his father went in search of game for supper and then we shall be well on our way to the old home we had no business to leave  it is this portion of the journey that worries me most dick you remember what a hard time we had when the animals were in good condition and now that they are hardly able to drag their own bones along the danger is great  no more than when we crossed the river and even though father did feel afraid there we got along all right was the cheerful reply there should be plenty of game here and after a square feed things wont look so bad  mrs stevens turned wearily away to make preparations for the evening meal in case the hunter should bring in a supply of meat but made no reply she understood why young dick spoke encouragingly and felt proud that the boy displayed so much tenderness for her yet the fact could not be disguised that dangers beset the little party on every hand  it required but a small amount of labor in order to make ready for the night  tired as the horses were there was no likelihood of their straying very far and dick simply removed the harness allowing the animals to roam at will the wagon served as a camp and the most arduous task was that of gathering materials with which to make a fire when nothing larger than a bush could be seen on either hand  then there was no more to be done save await the return of the hunter and it was not until the shadows began to lengthen into the gloom of night that young dick felt seriously alarmed  he knew his father would not have gone very far from the camp in search of game because he was on foot and there was no more promising place for sport than within the radius of a mile from where they had halted besides when hunting took the form of labor which must be performed richard stevens was not one who would continue it long unless he was remarkably hungry  young dicks mother gave words to her anxiety several times but the boy argued with her that no harm could have befallen the absent one in that vicinity and for a time her fears were allayed  when another hour passed however and nothing was heard from his father even dick lost courage and believed that the culminating point in their troubles had been reached  his mother and margie had entered the wagon when night was fully come knowing they must go supperless to bed unless the hunter returned and to dick the thought that these two whom he loved so dearly were hungry brought him almost as much sorrow as the unaccountable absence of his father  he believed however that it was his duty to appear unconcerned as if confident his fathers prolonged absence did not betoken danger he trudged to and fro in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle at times whistling cheerily to show there was no trouble on his mind and again when it was impossible to continue the melody because of the sorrow in his heart repeated to his mother that nothing serious could have befallen the absent one that probably he had unconsciously wandered a long distance from the camp on the trail of game  it dont stand to reason he will try to make his way now it is dark mother dear but within an hour or two after sunrise hell be here and the breakfast we shall then have will make up for the loss of supper  mrs stevens made no reply and listening a moment dick heard the sound of suppressed sobs  his mother was in distress and he could do no more toward comforting her than repeat what he did not absolutely believe  he knew full well that unless some accident had befallen him his father would have returned before dark that he would not have allowed himself to be led so far away from the campingplace that he could not readily return and the boys sorrow was all the greater because it was impossible to console his mother  clambering into the wagon he put his arms around her neck pressing his cheek close against hers and during what seemed a very long while the two remained silent not daring to give words to their fears  then dick bethought himself of a plan which offered some slight degree of hope and starting up suddenly said  i ought to have done it before an it aint too late now  done what dick dear  gone out in the direction father took and fired the rifle two or three times it may be he has lost his bearings and the report of the gun would be enough to let him know where we are  but you must not go now that it is dark my boy suppose you should lose your way then what would become of margie and me  theres no danger of that mother ive been in the woods often enough to be able to take care of myself surely  your father would have said the same thing when he set out but yet we know some accident must have befallen him  let me go only a little way mother  of what avail would that be my son if the purpose is to discharge your rifle hoping father may hear the report why not do it here  i will if you wont let me go farther  i cant dick dear i might be braver under other circumstances but now the thought of your leaving me is more than i can bear  i wont go so far but that i can see the wagon dick said kissing his mother and little margie much as though bidding them goodby and a few moments later the report of his rifle almost startled the occupants of the wagon  during the next hour dick discharged his weapon at least twelve times but there was no reply of whatsoever nature  if his father was alive and within hearing he was too badly disabled to give token of his whereabouts  the supply of cartridges was not so large that very many could be used without making a serious inroad upon the store and realizing the uselessness of further efforts in this direction dick went back to the wagon  margie had fallen asleep her head pillowed in her mothers lap and mrs stevens unwilling to disturb the child was taking such rest as was possible while she leaned against the canvas covering of the wagon  dick seated himself beside her it was not necessary he should speak of his failure for she knew that already  he had thought it his duty to join her for a few moments and then go outside again to act the part of sentinel although such labor could be of little avail but before he had been nestling by her side five minutes his eyes were closed in slumber and the mother her mind reaching out to the absent father spent the hours of the night in wakefulness watching over her children  the sun had risen before dicks eyes were opened and springing to his feet quickly ashamed of having slept while his mother kept guard he said  i didnt mean to hang on here like a baby while you were awake mother but my eyes shut before i knew it  it is well you rested my son nothing could have been done had you remained awake  perhaps not but i should have felt better because if anything has happened to father though i dont say it can be possible im the one who must take care of you and margie  mrs stevens kissed the boy not daring to trust herself to speak and he hurried out for there was before him a full days work if he would do that which he had decided upon in his mind the evening previous  there was no reasonable hope any one would come that way for many daysperhaps months  they were alone and whatever was done must be accomplished by this thirteenyearold boy  im going after something for breakfast mother and then count on trying to follow fathers trail dick said after looking around in every direction even though he knew there was no possibility of seeing any human being  there is no reason why you should spend the time in trying to get food for us dick dear margie and i can get on very well without breakfast and you will have the more time to hunt for your father but remember my boy that you are the only one we can depend upon now and without you we might remain here until we starved  ill take good care not to go so far from the wagon but that i can find my way back for surely ill be able to follow on my own trail if theres no other hadnt i better do a little hunting first  not unless you are very very hungry dick food would choke me just now and there is enough of the bread we baked yesterday morning to give you and margie an apology for a breakfast  i can get along without you shall eat my share now dont worry if im not back until near sunset the horses are close at hand and you may be certain they wont stray while the feed is plentiful stay in the wagon even though there is nothing to harm you if you walk around we must be careful that no more trouble comes upon us so keep under cover mother dear and ill be here again before night comes  dick was not as confident he could follow his fathers trail as he would have it appear to his mother but he decided upon the direction in which he would search and set bravely out heading due west knowing he could hold such a course by aid of the suns position as his father had often explained to him  dick was hungry but scorned to let his mother know it and tried to dull the edge of his appetite by chewing twigs and blades of grass  after walking rapidly ten minutes more careful as to direction than he ever had been because of the responsibility that rested upon him he stopped and shouted his fathers name then listened hoping to hear a reply  save for the hum of insect life no sound came to his anxious ears  once more he pressed forward and again shouted but without avail  he continued on until seeing the trail made by the wagon when they had come in from the stream he knew he was very near to the border of the valley  surely his father would not have gone outside because he had said before they arrived that only in the buffalo meadows were they likely to find game  then dick turned pushing on in a northerly direction at right angles with the course he had just been pursuing and halting at fiveminute intervals to shout  his anxiety and hunger increased equally as the day grew older try as he might he could not keep the tears from overrunning his eyelids  the sun was sinking toward the west before he heard aught of human voice save his own and then a cry of joy and relief burst from his lips as he heard faintly in the distance his own name spoken  im coming im coming he cried at the full strength of his lungs as he dashed forward exultant in the thought that his father was alive for he had begun to believe that he would never see him again in this world  mr stevens continued to call out now and then to guide the boy on the way and as he drew nearer dick understood from the quavering tones that his father was in agony  im coming daddy im coming he shouted yet louder as if believing it was necessary to animate the sufferer for he now knew that some painful accident had befallen his father and when he finally ended the search his heart literally ceased beating because of his terror and dismay  dick believed he had anticipated the worst but yet was unprepared for that which he saw  lying amid the bloodstained sagegrass his shirt stripped into bandages to tie up a grievously injured limb lay roving dick his face pallid his lips bloodless and his general appearance that of one whom death has nearly overtaken  daddy daddy dick cried piteously and then he understood that consciousness had deserted the wounded man  he had retained possession of his faculties until aid was near at hand and then the long strain of physical and mental agony had brought about a collapse  dick raised his fathers head tenderly imploring him to speakto tell him what should be done but the injured man remained silent as if death had interposed to give him relief  looking about scrutinizingly as those born and bred on the frontier learn to do early in life dick saw his fathers rifle twenty feet or more away and between it and him a trail of blood through the sagebrush then a sinister crimson blotch on the sand  mr stevenss right leg was the injured member and it had been wrapped so tightly with the improvised bandages that the boy could form no idea as to the extent of the wound but he knew it must indeed be serious to overcome so thoroughly one who though indolent by nature had undergone much more severe suffering than he could have known since the time of leaving the wagon to search for game  it seemed to dick as if more than ten minutes elapsed before his father spoke and then it was to ask for water  he might as well have begged for gold so far as dicks ability to gratify the desire was concerned  to get any daddy i may have to go way back to the wagon for i havent come upon a single watercourse since leaving camp this morning  your mother and margie  i left them at the camp how did you get here  it was just before nightfall i had been stalking an antelope was crawling on the ground dragging my rifle when the hammer must have caught amid the sagebrush the weapon was discharged and the bone of my leg appears to be shattered  poor poor daddy and dick kissed him on the forehead  we must be four miles from the camp mr stevens said speaking with difficulty because of his parched and swollen tongue  i should say so but i went toward the west and after travelling until noon struck across this way so have no idea of the distance  i shall die for lack of water dick even though the wound does not kill me  how shall i get it daddy the boy cried piteously i cant leave you here alone and i dont believe theres a drop nearer than where we are camped  you must leave me dick for you can do no good while staying here and the thought that help is coming even though there may be many hours to wait will give me strength can you find your way to the camp and back after nightfall  ill do it somehow daddy ill do it  then set out at once and bring one of the horses back with you i should be able to ride four miles or even twice that distance since it is to save my life  but youll keep up a brave heart daddy dear wont you dont think you are going to die but remember that mother and i and even little margie will do all we can to pull you through  i know it dick i know it you are a good ladfar better than i have been father and if it should chance that when you come back ive gone from this world remember that you are the only one to whom the mother and baby can look for protection  you know id always take care of them but i am going to save you daddy dear people have gotten over worse wounds than this and once you are at the camp we will stay in buffalo meadows till it is possible for you to ride ill look out for the whole outfit and from this on you shant have a trouble except because of the wound  give me your hand my boy and now go for strong as may be my will i cant stand the loss of much more blood god bless you dick and remember that i always loved you even though i never provided for you as a father should have done  dick hastily cleared the mist from his eyes and without speaking darted forward in the direction where he believed the wagon would be found breaking the sagebrush as he ran in order that he might make plain the trail over which he must return     chapter ii  a lonely vigil   it was not yet dark when dick arrived within sight of the wagon and shouted cheerily that those who were so anxiously awaiting his coming might know he had been fortunate in the search  as soon as his voice rang out startlingly loud because of the almost oppressive stillness mrs stevens appeared from beneath the flap of the canvas covering and an expression of most intense disappointment passed over her face as she saw that dick was alone  its all right mother he cried quickening his pace that she might the sooner be relieved from her suspense its all right  did you find your father  yes an ive come back for one of the horses hes been hurt an cant walk  thank god he is alive she cried and then for the first time since the previous evening she gave way to tears  dick did all he could toward comforting her without making any delay in setting out on the return journey  while he filled the canteen with fresh water he repeated what his father had bidden him to say and when his mother asked concerning the wound he spoke as if he did not consider it serious  of course its bad for he thinks one of the bones has been splintered but i dont see why he shouldnt come round all right after a spell weve known of people who had worse hurts and yet got well  but they were where at least something of what might be needed could be procured while we are here in the desert  not quite so bad as that mother dear we have water and i should be able to get food in plenty after ive supplied the camp im goin on foot to antelope spring where we can buy whatever daddy may need  across the desert alone  a boy like me ought to be able to do it and  your father hasnt a penny dick dear  i know that mother but ill sell my rifle before he shall suffer for anything now dont worry and keep up a good heart till i come back  cant i be of some assistance if i go too  youd better stay here with margie father and i can manage it alone i reckon  then dick set about catching one of the horses and as he rode the sorrylooking steed up to the wagon his mother gave him such articles from her scanty store as the wounded man might need  youre a good boy dick she said as he stooped over to kiss her and some day you shall have your reward  ill get it now mother if i see you looking a little more jolly and indeed things aint quite so bad as they seem for i can pull our little gang through in great shape though im afraid after its been done i shant be able to get you and margie the new outfit i promised  we should be so thankful your father is alive as not to realize that we need anything else  but you do just the same whether you realize it or not an ill attend to everything if i have time enough dont trouble yourself if were not back much before morning for i reckon daddy cant stand it to ride faster than a walk  then without daring to stop longer lest he should betray some sign of weakness dick rode away waving his hand to margie who was looking out of the rear end of the wagon but giving vent to a sigh which was almost a sob when they could no longer see him  young though he was dick understood full well all the dangers which menaced although he had spoken so confidently of being able to pull the gang through he knew what perils were before them during the journey across the desert and it must be made within a reasonably short time otherwise they might be overtaken by the winter storms before arriving at their old home  the beast he rode worn by long travelling and scanty fare could not be forced to a rapid pace and when night came dick was hardly more than two miles from the wagon  he could have walked twice the distance in that time but the delay was unavoidable since only on the horses back could his father be brought into camp  when it was so dark that he could not see the broken sagebrush which marked the trail it was necessary he should dismount and proceed even at a slower pace but he continued to press forward steadily even though slowly until when it seemed to him that the night was wellnigh spent he heard a sound as of moaning a short distance in advance  ive come at last daddy its been a terrible long while i know but it was the best i could  he ceased speaking very suddenly as he stood by the side of the sufferer whom he could dimly see by the faint light of the stars  from the broken and uprooted sagebrush around him it was evident the wounded man had most likely while in a delirium of fever attempted to drag himself on in the direction of the camp and had ceased such poor efforts only when completely exhausted  he was lying on his back looking straight up at the sky as he alternately moaned and talked at random with now and then a mirthless laugh which frightened the boy  dont daddy dont he begged as he raised the sufferers head see its dick come back and now you can ride into camp  mother is dying of thirst and imsee that stream come boys well take a header into itim on firefire  frightened though he was dick knew water was the one thing his father most needed and laying the poor head gently back on the sand he took the canteen from a bag which had served instead of a saddle  drink this daddy and youll feel better he said coaxingly much as if speaking to a child  the wounded man seized the tin vessel eagerly and it required all dicks strength to prevent him from draining it at once  im afraid to give you more now my poor old man but wait like a dear and ill let you take it again when youre on the horse  not until after a violent struggle which frightened dick because it seemed almost as if he was raising his hand against his father did he regain possession of the canteen and then a full half of the contents had been consumed  when his thirst was in a measure quenched mr stevens lay quietly on the sand save now and then as he moaned in unconscious agony heeding not the boys pleading words  try to help yourself a bit daddy he urged if youll stand on one foot i can manage to lift you onto the horses back  again and again did dick try by words to persuade his father to do as he desired and then he realized how useless were his efforts  he had heard of this delirium which often follows neglect of gunshot wounds but had no idea how he should set about checking it  after understanding that words were useless and knowing full well he could not lift unaided such a weight onto the horses back he crouched by his fathers side in helpless grief  never before had he known what it was to be afraid however far he might be from others of his kind but now as he listened to the meaningless words or the piteous moans terror took possession of him and the soft sighing of the gentle wind sounded in his ears like a menace  the horse strayed here and there seeking food but he gave no heed  such garments as his mother had given him dick spread over the sufferer and that done there was nothing for him save to wait  it seemed to the anxious boy as if the night would never end now and then he rose to his feet scanning the eastern sky in the hope of seeing some signs of coming dawn but the light of the stars had not faded and he knew the morning was yet far away  finally when it seemed to him as if he could no longer remain idle listening to a strong mans childish prattle the eastern heavens were lighted by a dull glow which increased steadily until he could see the horse feeding on the dry bunchgrass an hundred yards away and his long vigil was nearly at an end  his father called for water from time to time and dick had given him to drink from the canteen till no more than a cupful remained  now he asked again but in a voice which sounded more familiar and a great hope sprang up in the boys heart as he said  theres only a little left you poor old man and we cant get more this side the camp shall i give it to you now  let me moisten my lips dick dear they are parched and my tongue is swollen until it seems ready to burst  dick handed him the canteen and his father drank sparingly in marked contrast to his greedy swallowing of a few moments previous  it tastes sweet my boy and when we are at the camp ill need only to look at the brook in order to get relief are you soon going for the horse  i went an have got back daddy dear youve been talking mighty queeron account of the wound i suppose  how long have you been with me child  i must have got here before midnight and the morning is just coming now  youre a good boy dick  thats what mother said before i left and between the two of you im afraid youll make me out way beyond what i deserve we must get back as soon as we can you poor old man for shell be crying her eyes sore with thinking weve both knocked under will we have a try at getting on horseback  yes and i reckon it can be done lead the beast up here and then help me on my feetive grown as weak as a baby dick  and i dont wonder at it according to the looks of this sagebrush you must have lost half of all the blood you had at this time yesterday  now that his father was conscious once more all dicks reasonless terror fled and again he was the manly fellow he had always shown himself to be  the horse was led to mr stevenss side and dick raised the nearly powerless body until at the expense of most severe pain but without sign of it by even so much as a groan his father stood on the uninjured limb  fortunately the horse was too weary to make much protest at what followed with a restive steed it would have been impossible for the boy to half lift half push his father up until he was seated on the bag that served as saddle  how is it now you poor old man can you hold on there a couple of hours  i must my boy and if it so be i show signs of losing my reason again you must contrive to lash me here for unless this wound is attended to in better shape than it is just now ill go under  for mothers sake you must keep a good grip on yourself itll come tough i know but once were in camp you shall live on the fat of the land  dick took up his fathers riflehis own he had left in the wagon when he went after the horseand leading the animal by the bridle marched on glancing back every few seconds to learn how the rider was faring  although he struggled to repress any evidence of pain mr stevens could not prevent the agony from being apparent on his face and dick who had neither eaten nor slept during the past twentyfour hours did all a boy could have done to cheer the sufferer without thought of his own necessities  well soon be in camp daddy when youre to have everything you need he said from time to time and then fancying this was not sufficient encouragement he finally added you know im going over to antelope spring to get some doctors stuff as soon as ive found game enough to keep the camp supplied while im away  antelope spring mr stevens cried aroused from his suffering for an instant by the bold assertion you shall never do it dick not if i had twenty wounds its as much as a mans life is worth to cross the desert on foot and these horses of ours are worse than none at all  by the time weve been in camp a couple of weeks where the feed is good theyll pick up in great shape and be fit to haul the old wagon home wont it be prime to see the town once more and therell be no more hunting round for a place where we can get a livin easy eh daddy  no dickey once were there well stay and im going to turn over a new leaf if my life is spared ill do more work and less loafing but youre not to cross the desert alone my boy  it may be travellers will come our way an i can go with them dick replied taking good care not to make any promises for he understood from what his mother had said that it would be absolutely necessary that aid should be had from the nearest settlement  fortunately as it then seemed to the boy the pain which his father was enduring prevented him from dwelling upon the subject and as dick trudged on trying to force the horse into a more rapid gait he turned over in his mind all he had heard regarding such a journey  there were many times when it seemed certain mr stevens must succumb to the suffering caused by the wound but he contrived to keep a good grip on himself as dick had suggested and after what seemed the longest and most painful journey the boy had ever experienced the two came upon landmarks which told they were nearing the encampment  his father was ghastly pale the big drops of sweat on his forehead told of intense pain and in order to revive his courage yet a little longer dick shouted loudly to warn the dear ones who were waiting  theyll soon come running to meet us and you must put on a bold front daddy else mother will think youre near dead hold hard a little while longer and then well have you in the wagon where all hands of us can doctor you in great shape  it is more than probable that had he been alone with no one to cheer him mr stevens might never have been able to endure the agony which must have been his thanks to dicks cheering words however he not only kept his seat but remained conscious until his wife and son lifted him from the horse to the bed hastily prepared in the vehicle  then nature asserted herself and he speedily sank into unconsciousness accompanied by delirium as when dick had watched by his side  he was just that way all night and it frightened me mother what can we do for him  i dont know dick dear indeed i dont unless he can have proper attention death must soon come and i am ignorant of such nursing as he needs if we were only where we could call in a doctor  wouldnt it do almost as well if we had medicine for him  perhaps so but if we could get such things it would also be possible to at least find out what we should do  the horses wouldnt pull us across the desert until after theyve rested a spell dick said half to himself  and even if they could we must have food  see here mother you fix up daddys leg the best you know how and ill look around for something thatll fill the pot there are rabbits here in plenty though its mighty hard luck when you have to waste a cartridge on each one ill have enough in the way of meat by the time youve washed the wound ive heard the poor old man himself say that plenty of cool water was needed on a bullethole  mrs stevens could not be hopeful under the circumstances for she knew better than did dick how slight was the chance that the injured man could live where it was impossible to care properly for the wound but she would not deprive the boy of hope and turned to do as he suggested  although weary and footsore dick did not spend many moments in camp  he waited only long enough to get his rifle and ammunition and then trudged off for meat must be had even at the expense of cartridges both for the wounded man and the remainder of the family  an hour later dick returned with two rabbits and when these had been made ready for cooking he clambered into the wagon to see his father  the invalid looked more comfortable even though nothing had been done for his relief save to cleanse the wound and dress it in such fashion as was possible but he was still in the delirium and after kissing the pale forehead dick went to where his mother was making ready for the longdelayed meal  i dont reckon theres a bit of anything to eat mother  i shall soon have these rabbits cooked  but i must be off after larger game and dont want to wait till dinner is ready  you need the food dickey and there is only a tiny bit of bread  give me that mother dear it will stop the hole in my stomach for a spell and when i come back therell be plenty of time to eat meat  had the circumstances been one whit less grave mrs stevens would not have consented to his setting out before having eaten a hearty meal but she knew that more meat would soon be needed since they had no other food and two rabbits would hardly provide the famishing ones with enough to stay their hunger for the time being  the piece of bread baked the day previous from the last of their store of flour was brought out and munching it slowly that it might seem to be more dick started off again  not until nearly nightfall did he return but he had with him such portion of a deers carcass as he could drag and all fear of starvation was banished from camp  the wounded man was resting more comfortably if such term can be applied properly when one is suffering severest pain and after hanging the meat beneath the wagon dick questioned his mother as to what might be done if they were within reach of a physician  if we could see one dickey your fathers life might be saved for such a wound should not be exceedingly dangerous if i knew how to treat it and had the proper washes we ought to nurse him back to life but as it is i havent even that which would check the fever  if you could talk to a doctor would it be all right  i believe so dickey  would the medecine you want cost very much  it is the same to us whether the price be much or little since we havent the opportunity to get what is needed nor the money with which to pay for it if a shop were near at hand  dick ceased his questioning and set about performing such work around the camp as might well have been left undone until the next day  a generous supply of broiled venison was made ready and the boy ate heartily after which he went into the wagon telling his mother he would play the part of nurse until dark when she could take his place  once in the vehicle partially screened from view dick after much search for the bit of a leadpencil his father owned wrote on a piece of brown paper that had contained the last ten pounds of flour mr stevens had purchased the following words       dear motheri know you wont let me go to antelope spring if i      tell you about what im minded to do so i shall slip off the      first thing in the morning ill take my rifle with me and by      selling it get what stuff daddy needs i can talk with a doctor      too and when i come back well fix the poor old man up in great      shape       dont worry about me for i can get across without any bother      im going to take the canteen and some slices of meat so i      shant be hungry or thirsty i count on being back in three      days but if im gone five you mustnt think anything has gone      wrong for it may be a longer trip than im reckonin on       i love you and daddy and margie mighty well and this footing      it across the desert aint half as dangerous as you think for                                          your son                                               dickey  when this had been done he kissed his father twice smoothed the hair back from the pale damp forehead and whispered  im going sos youll get well my poor old man and you mustnt make any kick cause its got to be done  then he came out as if tired of playing the nurse and proposed that he sleep under the wagon that night  with all hands inside daddy would be crowded and im as well off outofdoors kiss me mother for im mighty tired     chapter iii  a sandstorm   in this proposal to retire thus early mrs stevens saw nothing to excite her suspicions regarding dicks real intentions  he had worked for thirtysix hours almost incessantly and it would not be strange if this unusual exertion together with the weariness caused by excitement had brought him to the verge of exhaustion  his mother would have insisted upon bringing out one of the wellworn blankets but that dick was decidedly opposed to taking anything from the wagon which might in the slightest degree contribute to his fathers comfort  im very well off on the bare ground and with the wagon to shelter me from the dew i couldnt be better fixed our poor old man needs all weve got mother and you may be sure i wont lay awake thinking of the featherbeds we had at willow point cause its about as much as i can do to keep my eyes open  you are a dear good boy and god will reward you in addition to saving your fathers life for that is what youve done this day you have lightened my burden until it would be wicked to repine  ill risk your ever doing anything very wicked mother and if the time comes when it seems to you as though i dont do exactly as you want me to just remember all youve said about my being a good boy an let it be a standoff will you  i am certain you will never do anything to cause me sorrow dickey dear dont get up until you have been thoroughly rested for now that we have food in camp i can do all that will be necessary  then dicks mother kissed him again not leaving him until he had stretched out at full length under the wagon and so tired was the boy that mrs stevens had hardly got back to take up her duties as nurse when his loud breathing told that he was asleep  when dick awakened it was still dark but he believed because he no longer felt extremely weary that the night was nearly spent and for the success of his plan it was of the utmost importance he should set out before his mother was astir  it was his purpose to travel on foot to antelope spring a distance in an airline of about fortyfive miles fifteen of which would be across the upper portion of smoke creek desert  in this waste of sand lay all the danger of the undertaking the number of miles to be travelled troubled him but little for more than once had he walked nearly as far in a single day while hunting and he proposed to spend thirtysix hours on each stage of the journey  creeping cautiously out from under the wagon he fastened his letter to the flap of the canvas covering in such a manner that his mother could not fail to see it when she first came out and then he wrapped in leaves several slices of broiled venison after which he stowed them in his pocket  the canteen was filled at a spring nearby  he saw to it that his ammunition belt contained no more than half a dozen cartridges and then took up his rifle handling it almost lovingly for this his only valuable possession he intended to part with in order to secure what might be necessary for his fathers relief and comfort  the weapon was slung over his back where it would not impede his movements and with a single glance backward he set out with a long swinging stride such as he knew by experience he could maintain for many hours  it was still dark when he had crossed the fertile meadows and arrived at the border of an apparently limitless expanse of yellow sand  here it would not be possible to maintain the pace at which he had started because of the loose sand in which his feet sank to the depth of an inch at each step  having set out at such an early hour this boy who was perilling his life in the hope of aiding his father believed the more dangerous portion of the journey might be accomplished before the heat of the day should be the most severe  when the sun rose dick had travelled as nearly as he could estimate over three miles of desert and his courage increased with the knowledge that onefifth of the distance across the sands had already been traversed  at the end of the next hour he said to himself that he must be nearly midway on the road of sand and although the labor of walking was most severe his heart was very light  once across ill push on as fast as any fellow can walk he said aloud as if the sound of his own voice gave him cheer by making an extra effort i ought to be in antelope spring before midnight and have plenty of time to sleep between now and morning half a day there to sell the rifle an buy what is needed an by sunset i should be at the edge of the desert again ready to make this part of the tramp after dark  he walked quickly and like one who intends to go but a short distance  the fortyfivemile tramp seemed to him but a trifle as compared with what was to be gained by the making of it  he thought of his mother as she read the note he had left on the flap of the wagoncovering and wondered if she looked upon his departure as an act of disobedience which in fact it was since both his parents had insisted he should not attempt it  then his thoughts went out to his father and he told over in his mind all the questions he would ask of the doctor at antelope spring for he had no doubt but that he should find one of that profession there  he took little heed to the monotonous view around him until suddenly he saw in the distance what appeared to be a lowhanging cloud then he said to himself that if a shower should spring up the suns face would be covered and the heat which was now very great must be lessened  as this cloud advanced descending to the sands while it rose toward the heavens it grew more black and on either side were long columns of seeming vapor rising and as rapidly disappearing  then across the darkness on that portion of the horizon something bright moved swiftly as if a flash of lightning had passed over the face of the cloud and in an instant the sun and the sky were shut out from view  now the clouds took on the appearance of a dense black fog coming up from the southward over the desert until dick was seemingly looking at a gigantic wall over the face of which shone now and then bright flashes of light  there was a shrieking and moaning in the air so it seemed to the startled boy and he failed to understand the meaning of this strange scene until the impenetrable wall having come so near he could see that what appeared like flashes of light were gigantic columns of sand springing high in the air with fantastic shapes and glinted by the sun from above the apparent vapor until they were swallowed up in the enormous bank of cloud behind them  then it was dick knew the meaning of this terrible danger which threatened him  it was a storm of sand dancing giants some have termed it and others speak of it as the hot blizzard  as if in an instant the dancing swirling columns and the rushing cloud of sand which swayed to and fro in fantastic movements surrounded him  he was in the centre of a cyclone freighted with particles of sand  the wind roared until one might have believed he heard the crash of thunder  dick halted terrified bewildered and as he came to a standstill it seemed to him that the clouds on every hand lowered until he could see the blue sky above then with a shriek from the wind the very sand beneath his feet rose and fell like billows of the sea  the tempest was upon him  he shielded his eyes with his arm but the stinging heated particles sought out every inch of his body and his clothing afforded but little protection  the sand penetrated his ears and nostrils and burned his lips until they bled  he had heard it said that to remain motionless in such a tempest means death for wherever the wind meets with an obstruction there it piles the sand in huge mounds and his father had told of more than one hunter who had thus been buried alive  it was death to remain motionless and yet to move seemed impossible  whether he turned to the right or the left the whirlwind struck him with a fury which it was difficult to withstand it was as if the wind swept in upon him from every point of the compassas if he was the centre of this whirling dancing blinding murderous onrush of sand  the boys throat was dry he was burning with thirst  the dustladen air seemed to have literally filled his lungs and it was with difficulty he could breathe  despite the protection he sought to give his eyes were inflamed and the lids cruelly swollen  he sank ankledeep at every step and above him and around him the wild blasts shrieked until there were times when he feared lest he should be thrown from his feet  pulling his hat down over his aching eyes the bewildered terrified boy tried to gain some relief from the thirst which assailed him  he understood that the contents of his canteen must be guarded jealously for if he lived there were still several miles of the desert journey to be traversed and the walking would be even more difficult than before the storm set in because of the shifting sand  his distress rendered him reckless and regardless of the future he drank fully half the water in the canteen bathing his eyes with a small quantity poured in the hollow of his hand  it would have been better if he had not tried to find relief by this last method for the flying particles of sand adhered to such portions of his face as were wet forming a coating over the skin almost instantly  he attempted to brush it off and the gritty substance cut into his flesh as if he had rubbed it with emerypaper  then came into dicks mind the thought that he should never more see his parents on this earth and for the instant his courage so far deserted him that he was on the point of flinging himself face downward upon the sand  fortunately there appeared before his mental vision a picture of his father lying in the wagon with the certainty that death would come unless his son could bring relief and this nerved the boy to yet greater exertion  with his arms over his face he pushed forward once more not knowing whether he might be retracing his steps or proceeding in the proper direction  every inch of advance was made against the fierce wind and drifting sand which nearly overthrew him  every breath he drew was choked with dust  how long he thus literally fought against the elements it was impossible for him so much as to conjecture  he knew his strength was spending rapidly and when it seemed as if he could not take another step he stumbled and fell against a mound of sand  it had been built by the dancing giants when some obstruction had been found in the path of the storm and as dick fell prostrate at the foot of this slight elevation there instantly came a sense of deepest relief  the sand was no longer thrown against him by the blast the wind had ceased to buffet him he was in comparative quiet and for an instant he failed to understand the reason  then he realized that this mound which had thrown him from his feet was affording a shelter against the tempest which was now coming from one direction instead of in a circle as heretofore and a fervent prayer of thanksgiving went up from his heart for he believed his life had been saved that he might aid his father  after recovering in a measure from the exhaustion consequent upon his battle with the elements he proceeded with infinite care to brush the particles of sand from his face and this done his relief was yet greater  overhead the air was full of darkness the wind still screamed as it whirled aloft the spiral columns of dust the wavelike drift of the sand surged on either side but for the moment he was safe  he had been told that such tempests were of but short duration and yet it seemed to him as if already half a day had been spent in this fight for life  then he said to himself that he could remain where he was in safety until the wind had subsided but even as the words were formed in his mind he was conscious of a weight upon his limbs as if something was bearing him down and for the first time he realized that he was being rapidly buried alive  to remain where he was ten minutes longer must be fatal and perhaps even that length of time would not be allowed him for if the wind so shifted as to cut off the top of the mound then he would be overwhelmed as if in a landslide  there was nothing for it but to go into the conflict once more and in this second effort the odds would be still greater against him because his courage was lessened  he knew the danger which menaced and the suffering he would have to endure the instant he rose from behind the poor shelter yet it was necessary and the boy staggered to his feet  there was nothing to guide him in the right direction for all around was blackness and flying grit yet he believed his way lay directly in the teeth of the storm and because of such belief pressed onward resolving that he would continue as long as was possible  as he said to himself so he did staggering this way and that but ever pressing forward on the course which he believed to be the true one blinded choking bewildered by the swirling particles until he was dimly conscious of falling and then he knew no more  at the moment dick fell vanquished hardly more than a quarter of a mile distant were two men mounted on indian ponies and leading three burros laden with a miners outfit for prospecting  to them the sandstorms of the desert were not strange and with the knowledge born of experience they made preparations for riding out the gale when the low dark cloud first appeared in the eastern horizon  the animals were fastened with their heads together the riders bending forward in the saddles and as well as it could be accomplished throwing over all the heads a number of blankets  the two horsemen had taken the precaution while assuming this position to present their backs to the wind and each had tied one end of his blanket around his waist in such manner that it could not be stripped off by the tempest  two or three blankets were fastened to the heads of the animals and thus the faces of all were protected  when the sand had whirled around them until the animals were buried nearly to their bellies the riders forced the bunch onward ten or fifteen paces continuing to make this change of location at least every five minutes during the entire time the tempest raged and thus it was they escaped being buried in the downpour of sand  from the time the first blast struck dick until the dancing giants whirled away to the westward leaving the sky unclouded and the yellow sands shimmering in the sunlight no more than thirty minutes had passed yet in that short interval one human life on which others depended would have been sacrificed unless these two travellers who were uninjured should chance to reach that exact spot where lay the boy partially covered by the deserts windingsheet  you can talk of a gale at sea where the sailors are half drowned all the time but it aint a marker alongside of these ere redhot blizzards eh parsons one of the horsemen said as he threw off the blanket from his head with a longdrawn sigh of relief  drownin must be mighty pleasant kind of fun alongside of chokin to death on account of bein filled plum full with dry sand parsons replied i allow there aint no call for us to stay here braggin about our nevada hurricanes tom robinson more especially since well make less headway now the sand has been stirred up a bit  theres nothin to hold me here robinson replied with a laugh  straightway the two men turned their ponies heads toward the west and as they advanced the patient burros laden with a miscellaneous assortment of goods until little else than their heads and tails could be seen followed steadily in the rear  five minutes after they had resumed their journey parsons cried as he raised himself in the stirrups shading his eyes with his hands as he peered ahead  whats that ere bit of blue out there part of somebodys outfit or was there a shipwreck close at hand  its a manmost likely a tenderfoot if he tried to walk across this ere desert  the two halted and dick stevenss life was saved  had the storm lasted two or three minutes longer or these prospectors gone in any other direction he must have died where he had fallen  now he was dragged out from beneath the weight of sand and laid upon a blanket while the men knowing by experience what should be done in such cases set about restoring the boy to consciousness  thanks to the timely attention dick soon opened his eyes stared around him for an instant in bewilderment and then exclaimed as he made a vain attempt to rise  i come pretty near knockin under didnt i the last i remember was of fallin  i allow it was the closest shave youll ever have agin parsons replied grimly an im free to say that them as are sich fools as to cross this ere sandbarren afoot oughter stay on it like as you were in a fair way of doin before we come along  an thats what daddy would say i spose if hed known what i was goin to do there would have been a stop put to it even though it was to save his life i came  how can you save anybodys life by comin out in sich a tomfool way as this less than a quart of water and not so much as a blanket with which to protect yourself  i can do it by goin to antelope spring an findin a doctor dick replied you see daddy shot himself in the legstove a bone all to pieces and mother dont know what to do so i slid off this mornin without tellin anybody  countin on footin it to antelope spring parsons asked as if in surprise  yes it aint moren fortyfive miles the way weve reckoned it  where did you start from  buffalo meadows  and when did you count on makin that fortyfive miles  i allowed to get there before midnight  wheres your camp  well we havent got anything you can rightly call a camp but were located in a prairie schooner near by the spring in the valley  how many in the party  daddy mother an margie  the two men looked at dick an instant and then glanced at each other after which parsons said emphatically  the boy has got grit but the old man must have been way off to come through this section of the country in a wagon  dick explained how it was they chanced to be travelling and then eager to gain all the information possible asked  do you know anything about antelope spring  nothin good theres a settlement by that name but its a noaccount place  i spose ill find a doctor  i reckon theyve got somethin of the kind hangin round but are you countin on draggin one down to buffalo meadows  i dont expect to be so lucky but mother seemed to have the idea that if somebody who knew all about it would tell her how to take care of daddys wound shed get along with such stuff as i could fetch to help him out in the fever say i dont reckon either of you wants to buy a good rifle there aint a better one on humboldt river and as he spoke dick unslung the weapon which hung at his back  whats your idea in sellin the gun it strikes me if youre countin on pullin through from buffalo meadows to willow point youll need it  of course i shall but its got to go you see daddys dead broke an i must have money to pay for the doctors stuff i dont spose you want it but if you did heres a good chance if you dont buy i reckon therell be some one up to antelope spring wholl take it off my hands  havent you got anything else you can put up instead of lettin the rifle go in this section of the country a tool like that will stand a man good agin starvation  its all i own thats worth anything an ill be mighty sorry to lose it but shes got to go  again the men looked at the boy then at each other and parsons motioned for his companion to follow him a short distance away where to dicks great surprise they began an animated conversation     chapter iv  at antelope spring   dick was perplexed by the behavior of these two strangers he failed utterly to understand why they should have anything of such a private nature to discuss that it was necessary to move aside from him for in a few moments they would be alone on the desert after he had gone his way  the discussion or conversation whichever it may have been did not occupy many moments but brief as was the time dick had turned to continue his journey at the instant when the men rejoined him  what do you allow you ought to get for that rifle parsons asked abruptly  thats what i dont know you see i didnt buy it new but traded for her before we left home it seems to me she ought to be a bargain atatten dollars  an if you get the cash youre goin to blow it right in for what the doctor can tell you an sich stuff as he thinks your old man ought to have eh  thats what ill do if it costs as much  sposen it dont allow that youve got five dollars left what then  ill buy flour an bacon an somethin for mother an margie with the balance  do you mean to tell me your father was sich a tenderfoot as to come down through this way without any outfit robinson asked sternly  he had plenty at the time we started but you see we struck bad luck all the way along and when we pulled into buffalo meadows we had cooked the last pound of flour there wasnt even a bit of meat in the camp when he got shot i knocked over a deer last night an that will keep em goin till i get back  an a kid like you is supportin a family eh parsons asked in a kindly tone  i dont know what kind of a fist im goin to make of it but thats what ill try to do till daddy gets on his feet again say how long do you spose itll take a man to get well when one leg is knocked endways with a bullet plum through the bone of it  itll be quite a bit im thinkintoo long for you to stay in buffalo meadows at this time of the year two months ought to do it eh parsons  well yes he wont get round any quicker than that  i dont know as it makes much difference if he cant walk a great deal cause after the horses have had plenty of grass for a couple of weeks well pull across this place an once on the other side i shant worry but what i can take em through all right  look here my son robinson said as he laid his hand on the lads shoulder youve got plenty of sand thats a fact i allow there aint a kid within a thousand miles of here that would tackle the contract youve taken this mornin if we wasnt bound to the winnemucca range an it wasnt quite so late in the season wed help you out by goin down to camp an straightenin things a bit but it cant be done now well buy your rifle though an thats what weve agreed on ten dollars aint sich a big pile for the gun but yet its plenty enoughleastways its all we can afford to put out just now  ill be mighty glad to sell it for that if you need a rifle an itll be better to make the trade now than wait till i get into antelope spring cause theres no dead certainty ill find anybody there wholl buy it  parsons took from a buckskin bag a small roll of bills and when he had counted out ten dollars there was but little of the original amount remaining  he handed the money to dick and the latter after the briefest hesitation held the rifle toward him  sorry to give it up eh robinson asked  well i aint when it comes to gettin the money for daddy if it wasnt for that id be you see its the first one i ever owned an the way things look now itll be a good while before i get another  ill tell you how well fix it son my partner an i aint needin an extra rifle just now an more than as likely as notin fact i may say its certainwell be up round your way before the winter fairly sets in now if you could keep it for us till then it would be the biggest kind of a favor cause you see were prospecting an have got about all the load the burros can tackle  youreyouresure you want to buy this gun eh  well if we wasnt there wouldnt have been much sense in makin the talk  but if youre prospectors there isnt any show of your gettin round to willow point  oh we drift up an down here an there just as the case may be there aint any question about our trailin all over the state in time and you shall keep the rifle in good shape till we call for it so long my son its time for you to be hoofin it if you count on gettin to antelope spring this side of tomorrow mornin  as he spoke parsons mounted his pony robinson following the example and in another moment the two were on their way once more leaving dick in a painful state of uncertainty regarding their purpose in purchasing the gun  during two or three minutes the boy stood where they had left him and then cried  hello there hold on a minute will you  whats the matter now and parsons looked over his shoulder but neither he nor his partner reined in their steeds  are you buyin this rifle or are you makin believe sos to give me the ten dollars  sposen we was makin believe  why then i wouldnt take the money cause i aint out begging  dont fret yourself my son weve bought the gun all right an the next time we meet you can hand it over i wish our pile had been bigger sos we could have given twenty cause a kid like you deserves it  the horsemen continued on and by this time were so far away that dick would have been unwise had he attempted to overtake them  he stood irresolutely an instant as if doubtful of the genuineness of this alleged business transaction  it was as if the men feared he might attempt to overtake them for despite the heavy loads on the burros they urged the beasts forward at their best pace and dick was still revolving the matter in his mind when they were a mile or more away  well its no use for me to stand here tryin to figure out whether theyve given me this money or really mean to buy the rifle for ive got to strike antelope spring between this time an midnight now that there are ten dollars in my pocket ill be a pretty poor stick if i dont do it but the sandstorm came mighty near windin me up it was the toughest thing i ever saw  then dick set forward once more toiling over the loose surface into which his feet sank three or four inches at every step and when he finally stood on the firm soil east of this waste of shifting sand it was two hours past noon  as he had reckoned there were more than thirty miles yet to be traversed but the distance troubled him little  he had in his possession that which would buy such knowledge and such drugs as his father might need and he believed it would be almost a sin to rebel even in his thoughts against the labor which must be performed  now he advanced whistling cheerily with a long stride and a swinging gait that should have carried him over the trail at the rate of four miles an hour and not until late in the afternoon did he permit himself to halt and partake of the broiled venison  then he ate every morsel and the meal finished said aloud with a low laugh of perfect content  its lucky i didnt bring any more for i should eat it to a dead certainty an then i wouldnt be in as good trim for walkin daddy always says that the less a fellow has in his stomach the easier he can get over the ground and the poor old man never struck it truer  after this halt of fifteen minutes dick pressed forward without more delay until he came upon the settlement at what time he knew not but to the best of his belief it was hardly more than an hour past midnight  there was no thought in his mind of spending any portion of the money for a bed  the earth offered such a restingplace as satisfied him and since the day his father departed from willow point in the hope of finding a location where he could earn a livelihood with but little labor dick had more often slept upon the ground than elsewhere  now he threw himself down by the side of a storehouse or shed where he would be protected from the night wind and there was hardly more than time to compose himself for rest before his eyes were closed in slumber  no person in antelope spring was awake at an earlier hour next morning than dick stevens for the sun had not yet shown himself when the boy arose to his feet and looked around as if to say that he was in fine condition  a tramp of fortyfive miles aint to be sneezed at an when you throw in fifteen miles of desert an a sandstorm to boot its what i call a pretty good days work yet im feelin fine as a fiddle he said in a tone of satisfaction after which he made an apology for a toilet at the stream nearby  dick had no idea in which direction a physician might be found therefore he halted in front of the first store he saw to wait until the proprietor came half an hour later to attend to customers  it was such a shop as one would naturally expect to find in a settlement among the mountains of nevada  from molasses to perfumery and from ploughs to fishhooks the assortment ran until one would say all his wants might be supplied from the stock  cheese was what dick had decided upon for his morning meal and after purchasing two pounds together with such an amount of crackers as he thought would be necessary he set about eating breakfast at the same time that he gained the desired information  ive come from the other side of smoke creek desert he began speaking indistinctly because of the fulness of his mouth an want to find a doctor  aint sick are yer the shopkeeper asked with mild curiosity  daddy shot himself in the leg an mother dont know what to do for him so ive come up to hire a doctor to tell me an buy whatever he says is needed  a kid like you come across the desert wheres your pony  i havent got any daddys horses are so nearly played out that theyve got to be left to grass two or three weeks if we count on doin anything with em  did you walk across the shopkeeper asked incredulously  thats what i did and dick told of his sufferings during the sandstorm not in a boastful way but as if it were his purpose to give the prospectors the praise they deserved  when he had concluded the proprietor plunged his hands deep in his pockets surveyed the boy from head to foot much as parsons and robinson had saying not a word until dicks face reddened under the close scrutiny when he exclaimed  well ill be jiggered a kid of your sizesay how old are you bub  thirteen  well a baby of thirteen lightin out across smoke creek desert an all for the sake of helpin your dad eh do you reckon you can bite out of dr manters ear all you want to know an then go back an run the business  it seems as if he ought to tell me what mother needs to do an i can remember every word then she said there would have to be some medicine to stop the fever an thats what im countin on buyin if he gives me the name of it  when are you goin back  im in hopes to get away this noon an then ill be in camp by tomorrow mornin  say sonny do you want to stuff me with the yarn that youve travelled fortyfive miles in lessn thirtysix hours an count on doin the same thing right over agin which is ninety miles in lessn three days  ive done the first half of the journey an it couldnt have been moren two hours past midnight when i got here with such a layout as this for breakfast ill be in good shape for goin back an it would be a mighty poor boy who couldnt get there between this noon an tomorrow mornin cause ill go across the desert after dark an it aint likely therell be another sandstorm  well look here sonny stand right there for a minute will you while i go out i wont be gone a great while an you can finish up your breakfast  but i want to see the doctor as soon as i can you know  thatll be all right ill make it in my way to help you along so you shant be kept in this town a single hour moren s necessary  having said this and without waiting to learn whether his young and early customer was willing to do as he had requested the proprietor of the store hurriedly left the building and dick had finished his meal before he returned  the boy was stowing the remainder of the cheese and crackers into his pockets when the shopkeeper accompanied by two men who looked as if they might have been hunters or miners entered  is this the kid one of the strangers asked looking as curiously at the boy as had the proprietor  thats the one an the yarn he tells must be pretty nigh true cause he met parsons an robinson an accordin to his story they bought his rifle leavin it with him till such time as they want to claim it  the newcomers questioned dick so closely regarding the journey and its purpose that he began to fear something was wrong and asked nervously  whats the reason i shouldnt have come up here when a fellers father is goin to die if he cant get a doctor afoul of him its a case of hustlin right sharp  an accordin to the account youve given thats about what youve been doin one of the strangers said with an approving nod which reassured the boy to such an extent that he answered without hesitation the further questions which were asked  when the curiosity of the men had been satisfied one of those whom the landlord had brought in and who was addressed by his companions as bob mason said to dick as he laid his hand on the boys shoulder  well take care of you my bold kid an see that you get all your father needs if it wasnt that the doctor in this ere town is worked mighty hard id make it my business to send him right down to your camp but i reckon if its nothin moren a bullet through your dads leg hell pull round all right with sich things as you can carry from here now come on an well find out what the pillmaster thinks of the case  dick was thoroughly surprised that so much interest in his affairs should be manifested by strangers and it pleased him that he was to have assistance in this search for medical knowledge  he followed this new friend readily and in a few moments was standing before the doctor listening to mr masons highly colored version of the journey  when he would have corrected the gentleman as to some of the points which had been exaggerated he was kindly bade to hold his tongue  ive heard all your yarn my boy an can imagine a good many things you didnt tell theres precious few of us in this section of the country that was ever overtook while on foot by the dancin giants an lived to tell the story  i wouldnt be alive if it hadnt been for mr parsons an mr robinson  what they did dont cut any figger its what you went through with that im talkin about an the doctor is bound to hear the whole story before he gives up what he knows  not until mr mason had concluded the recital after his own fashion did he give the professional gentleman an opportunity to impart the information which dick had worked so hard to obtain and then the physician after telling him in a general way how the patient should be treated wrote out in detail instructions for mrs stevens to follow  then from his store of drugs pills and nauseous potions he selected such as might be needed in the case writing on each package full directions at the expense of at least an hours time and when he had finished dick believed that his father would suffer for nothing in the way of medicine  there lad dr manter said as he concluded his labors and tied in the smallest possible compass the articles he had set out i allow your mother should be able to do all that is necessary and unless the bone is so shattered that the leg must be amputated it is possible you will get along as well without a physician as with one  do you mean theres a chance my poor old man might have to let his leg be cut off  if you have described the wound correctly i should say there was every danger i have written however to your mother so that she may be able to decide if anything of the kind is probable and then you may be obliged to make another journey up here at all events if your fathers life should be in danger you may depend upon it i will come to the camp although i am free to admit that a ride across smoke creek desert isnt one that i hanker for although you seem to have made the journey on foot and thought little of it  thats cause i was doin it on daddys account how much is your price for this stuff  mr mason instantly plunged his hand in his pocket and before he could withdraw it the physician replied  you have earned all ive given you lad and id be ashamed to take even a dollar from a plucky little shaver like you  but ive got ten dollars an can pay my way if id thought the prospectors meant to give me the money instead of buyin the rifle id got along without it but they said twice over that they wanted the gun an i believed em  no one can accuse you of being a beggar but if its the same to you id rather let this go on account and some day perhaps when youve struck it rich come around and well have a settlement  doctor youre a man every inch of you mr mason said in a loud tone as he slapped the physician on the shoulder with a force that caused him to wince with absolute pain youre a man an if the people in this town dont know it already they shall find it out from yours truly i reckon we can ante up a little something in this ere matter so the kid wont go home emptyhanded for i tell you theres nothin in antelope spring too good for him  again dick looked about him in surprise that such praise should be bestowed for what seemed to him a very simple act the kindly manner in which the physician bade him goodby with the assurance that he would himself go to buffalo meadows if it should become necessary served to increase the boys astonishment and instead of thanking the gentleman he could only say because of his bewilderment  i did it for daddy sir an it would be a mean kind of fellow who wouldnt do as much  then mr mason hurried him away and despite dicks protests insisted on leading him from one place to another until it was as if he had been introduced to every citizen in the settlement  he was not called upon to tell his story again because his conductor did that for him and the details of the narrative were magnified with each repetition until dick believed it absolutely necessary he should contradict certain portions wherein he was depicted as a hero of the first class  when mr mason had shown the boy fully around the town he said by way of parting  now you go down to mansfields an wait there till i come  wheres mansfields  thats the store where i found you  but i cant wait a great while mr mason you know ive got to be back by tomorrow mornin an i ought to be leavin now cause its pretty near noon  dont worry your head about that my son you shall get to camp before sunrise tomorrow mornin an without so very much work on your part either now go down to mansfields an wait there till i come mind you dont leave this town till im back there  mr mason hurried away as he ceased speaking and dick walked slowly down the street debating in his mind whether he must obey this order     chapter v  dick pulls through   when dick had retraced his steps to mansfields he found no less than ten of the citizens there several of whom he had already met and all were evidently eager to talk with the boy who had walked across smoke creek desert  there were but few in that section of the country who would have dared to make the venture although it was by no means a dangerous or difficult journey for a horseman and dicks bravery in connection with all the circumstances pleased the citizens of antelope spring wonderfully well  the package dick carried told that he had been successful in finding a physician and mr mansfield was curious to learn how much the medical gentleman had charged for his services  he wouldnt take a cent dick said in reply to the question it seems to me the folks in this town are mighty good  i dont reckon well ever be hung for our goodness the proprietor of the shop said with a grin but it is considerable of a treat to see a kid with so much sand as youve shown dr manter knew which side his bread was buttered on when he wouldnt take your money an if your father dont get better with what youre takin to him you can count on manter seein the thing through youve got quite a load my son  yes an im countin on carryin more if youll take money for what i buy i dont want to set myself up for a beggar cause ive got the stuff to pay for everything  what do you want  about ten pounds of flour and the same weight in bacon or salt pork with a little pepper and salt will be as much as i can carry  its a good deal moren id want to tote fortyfive miles twixt now and sunset one of the visitors remarked and dick replied cheerily  it wouldnt seem very heavy if you was carryin it to your folks whod had nothin but fresh meat to eat for the last month mother and margie will be wild when i bring in that much  ill put up twentyfive pounds in all for i reckon there are other things that would come handy mr mansfield said as he began to weigh out the articles and dick asked quickly  youre to let me pay for em  sure the proprietor replied as he winked at the loungers you shall give all the stuff is worth  i didnt want to hang round here very long but mr mason said i was to wait for him  if bob mason give sich orders itll be worth your while to stop a spell for hes as crossgrained as a broncho when matters dont go to his likin an might make trouble for you  dick was considerably disturbed by this remark which had much the sound of a threat and looked out of the door uneasily  the citizens had been exceedingly kind to him but he had had no little experience with inhabitants of frontier towns and knew that friendship might be changed to enmity very suddenly  the shopkeeper had not finished filling the small order when bob mason rode up on a wirylooking broncho and after tying the beast to a hitchingpost entered the store  i had an idea that was what you were up to one of the loungers said and mason replied with a laugh  when we have sich a visitor as this ere kid i reckon were called on to make things pleasant for him then turning to dick he added if it so be your daddy pulls through all right for the next week or ten days he should be in condition to ride this far  after the horses have rested a little i counted on starting for willow point  it strikes me that would be too rough a journey for the old man at this time of the year were needin kids like you in this town an i allow youll find a shelter here till spring then if the settlement dont suit you itll be only a case of goin on when the travellin is easier  do you mean that wed better live here dick asked in surprise  thats the way some of us have figgered it  can i find work enough to pay our way you see daddy wont be in shape to do anything for quite a spell  ill give you a job on my ranch an pay fair wages  then well be glad to stop  all right my son you shall take your own time about comin and ill hold the job open till you get here now im allowin to lend you that broncho so you can get back in case the old man grows worse hes a tricky beast but i reckon youll handle him without any too much trouble the only drawback is that i cant furnish a saddle  if you can spare the pony ill get along without the fixings dick replied his eyes gleaming with delight for with such a steed he would be able to visit the town at short notice if it should become necessary  im allowin that ive got a saddle he can have for a spell mr mansfield replied thoughtfully and although dick insisted that there was really no need of one it was brought out  the loungers took it upon themselves to see that the broncho was properly harnessed and now that it was no longer necessary to limit the weight of the supplies the shopkeeper suggested that the amount of flour and bacon be doubled  will ten dollars be enough to pay for it dick asked  well make a charge of it seeins youre goin to work for bob mason you can give me an order on him after youve been here a spell an itll be the same thing as cash  now youre doin the square thing mansfield mason said approvingly and despite dicks protests that he preferred to pay his way so long as he had the money the matter was thus arranged  you are sure i can earn enough to pay for what well need to eat between now and spring the boy asked doubtfully  im allowing from what ive seen that youll earn a mans wages an thatll be thirty dollars a month if your father is anything like you ill guarantee he can find work enough to support the family an antelope spring is needin settlers mighty bad  the supply of provisions and the medicines were packed in a bag divided into two portions of equal weight that they might be carried over the saddle and then dick was ready to mount  he realized fully how kind the people of the town had been to him and was eager to say that which should give token of the gratitude in his heart but the words refused to come at his bidding  he stammered in the attempt to speak cleared his throat nervously and tried again  youve been mighty good all hands an im thinkin itll help daddy pull through i wishi wish  thats all right my son bob mason interrupted weve got a good idea of what you want to say an you can let it go at that as a general thing we dont get stuck on kids but when one flashes up in the style you have we cotton to him mightily you can push that ere broncho right along for fortyfive miles aint any terrible big job for him an canter into camp this side of midnight with considerable time to spare  i thank you all an so will mother an daddy when they get here he said in a husky tone as he mounted and then waving his cap by way of adieu he rode away the happiest boy to be found on either side of the rocky mountains  night had not fully come when he halted at the eastern edge of the desert to give the broncho water and grass and here he remained an hour the crackers and cheese left from breakfast affording an appetizing supper to a lad who had known but little variation in his bill of fare from fresh meat broiled or stewed more often without salt or pepper  the stars guided him on the course across the waste of sand and the pony made his way over the yielding surface at a pace which surprised the rider  he can walk four miles an hour according to this showing and i should be in camp before ten oclock  in this he was not mistaken the broncho pushed ahead rapidly proving that he had traversed deserts before and was eager to complete the journey and when dick came within sight of the wagon his mother was standing in front of the campfire so intent on broiling a slice of venison that she was ignorant of his coming until he shouted cheerily  here i am mother dear coming along with a good bit of style and so many fine things that youll open your eyes mighty wide when this bag is emptied how is my poor old man  he had dismounted as he ceased speaking and was instantly clasped in his mothers arms  o dick dick how sore my heart has been your father said you could not get across the desert on foot and i have pictured you lying on the sands dying  youve made your pictures all wrong dearie for here i am in prime condition and loaded down with good things the people up at antelope spring have shown themselves to be mighty generous how is daddy  he is resting comfortably just now although he has suffered considerable pain did you see a doctor  yes an am loaded way up to the muzzle with directions as to what must be done lets go in and see the poor old man an then ill tell you both the story  mr stevenss voice was heard from the inside of the wagon as he spoke dicks name margie clambered out her big brown eyes heavy with slumber to greet her brother and the boy was forced to receive her caresses before it was possible to care for the broncho  then as soon as might be dick entered the wagon and the handclasp from his father was sufficient reward for all his sufferings in the desert  it was midnight before he finished telling of his journey and reception by the men of antelope spring  he would have kept secret the peril which came to him with the sandstorm but his father questioned him so closely that it became necessary to go into all the details and more than once before the tale was concluded did his mother press him lovingly to her as she wiped the tears from her eyes  you mustnt cry now it is all over he said with a smile as he returned the warm pressure of her hand im none the worse for havin been half buried an were rich im countin on pullin out of here as soon as the horses are in condition an well stay at the town till springperhaps longer  although he claimed that he was not hungry his mother insisted on preparing supper from the seemingly ample store of provisions and when the meal had been eaten it was so nearly morning that dick would have dispensed with the formality of going to bed but that his mother declared it was necessary he should gain some rest  his heart was filled with thankfulness when he lay down under the wagon again covered with a blanket and perhaps for the first time in his life dick did more than repeat the prayer his mother taught him for he whispered very softly  youve been mighty good to me god an i hope youre goin to let my poor old man have another whack at livin  dick had repeated to his mother all the instructions given him by the physician and before he was awake next morning mrs stevens set about dressing the wound in a more thorough manner than had ever been possible before  she was yet engaged in this task when the boy opened his eyes and learning to his surprise that the day was at least an hour old sprang to his feet like one who has been guilty of an indiscretion  what up already he cried in surprise as looking through the flap of the wagoncovering he saw what his mother was doing  yes dick dear and i have good news for you both your father and i now think he was mistaken in believing the bone was shattered by the bullet perhaps it is splintered some but nothing more serious  then you wont be obliged to have it cut off daddy an should be able to get round right soon  theres this much certain dick whether the bone is injured or not my life has been saved through your efforts for i know enough about gunshot wounds to understand that i couldnt have pulled through without something more than we were able to get here  yet you would have prevented me from leaving if i had told you what was in my mind  i should for a fact because if one of us two must go under it would be best for mother an margie that i was that one  why daddy you have no right to talk like that  its true dick ive been a sort of neerdowell otherwise i wouldnt have been called roving dick while you are really the head of the house  i wont listen to such talk daddy for it sounds as if you were out of your head again as when we were alone that night youll perk up after were at antelope spring an show the people there what you can do  i shall be obliged to work very hard in order to make a good showing by the side of you  dick hurried away for it pained him to hear his father talk in such fashion yet at the same time he hoped most fervently that there would be no more roaming in search of a place where the least possible amount of labor was necessary and it really seemed as if roving dick had made up his mind to lead a different life  there was little opportunity for the boy to remain idle  the supplies he had brought from mr mansfields shop would not suffice to provide the family with food many days unless it was reenforced by fresh meat and as soon as dick had seen to it that the horses and the broncho were safe he made preparations for a huntingtrip  when breakfast had been eaten and how delicious was the taste of bacon and flourbread to this little party which had been deprived of such food so long he started off returning at nightfall with a small deer and half a dozen rabbits  the greater portion of the venison he cut up ready for smoking and when his mother asked why he was planning so much labor for himself he replied cheerily  were likely to lay here ten days at the very least for the horses wont be in condition to travel in much less time and now is my chance to put in a stock of provisions for the winter it neverll do to spend all my wages for food because you and margie are to be fitted out in proper shape and now i havent even the rifle to sell for that belongs to the prospectors  not an idle hour did dick stevens spend during the time they remained encamped at buffalo meadows and when the time came that his father believed they might safely begin the journey to antelope spring he had such a supply of smoked meat as would keep the family in food many days  mr stevenss wound had healed with reasonable rapidity thanks to the materials for its dressing which dick had risked his life to procure and on the morning they decided to cross the desert the invalid was able to take his place on the front seat of the wagon to play the part of driver  dick rode the broncho as a matter of course and to him this journey was most enjoyable  not until the second day did the family arrive at their destination and dick received such a reception as caused his cheeks to redden with joy  bob mason chanced to be in front of mansfields store when the party rode up and insisted on their remaining there until he could summon the inhabitants of the settlement to give them welcome  were glad youve come mr mason said when he believed the time had come for him to make a speech weve seen the kid an know how much sand hes got so if the rest of the family are anything like him and i reckon they must be were gettin the kind of citizens we hanker after ive preempted the boy an allow hell look out for things on the ranch as well as any man i could hire an a good deal bettern the average run weve got a house here for the rest of you an stevens will find plenty of work if hes handy with tools now then kid well get the old folks settled an after that ill yank you off with me  mason led the way to a rude shanty of boards which was neither the best nor the worst dwelling in the town and to mrs stevens and margie it seemed much like a palace for it was a place they could call home a pleasure they had not enjoyed since leaving willow point two years ago  dick observed with satisfaction that there was a sufficient amount of furniture in the shanty to serve his parents until money could be earned with which to purchase more and then he rode away with bob mason leading the teamhorses to that gentlemans corral  he had brought his family to a home and had before him a good prospect of supplying them with food even though his father should not be able to do any work until the coming spring therefore dick stevens was a very happy boy  here we will leave him for he is yet in masons employ and it is said in antelope spring today or was a few months ago that when bob mason hired that kid to oversee his ranch he knew what he was about  it is hard to believe that a boy only fifteen years of age for dick has now been an overseer or boss puncher as it is termed in nevada nearly two years could care for a ranch of six hundred acres yet he has done it as more than one can testify and in such a satisfactory manner that next year he is to have an interest in the herds and flocks on the mason place  mr stevens recovered from the wound in due time and early in the spring after his arrival at the settlement he joined messrs parsons  robinson in prospecting among the ranges  his good fortune was even greater than dicks for before the winter came again the firm had struck a rich lead of silver which has been worked with such profit that roving dicks home is one of the best and the cosiest to be found in the state  mr stevens would have been glad had young dick decided to give up his work on the ranch but the latter has declared again and again that he will leave mining strictly alone because cattle are good enough for him  the end
