28636232	night watches  by ww jacobs     stepping backwards  wonderful improvement said mr jack mills  show em to me again  mr simpson took his pipe from his mouth and parting his lips revealed his new teeth  and you talk better said mr mills taking his glass from the counter and emptying it you aint got that silly lisp you used to have  what does your missis think of em  she hasnt seen em yet said the other  i had em put in at dinner time  i ate my dinner with em  mr mills expressed his admiration  if it wasnt for your white hair and whiskers youd look thirty again he said slowly  how old are you  fiftythree said his friend  if it wasnt for being laughed at ive often thought of having my whiskers shaved off and my hair dyed black people think im sixty  or seventy continued mr mills  what does it matter people laughing  youve got a splendid head of air and it would dye beautiful  mr simpson shook his head and ordering a couple of glasses of bitter attacked his in silence  it might be done gradual he said after a long interval  it dont do anybody good at the warehouse to look old  make a clean job of it counselled mr mills who was very fond of a little cheap excitement  get it over and done with  youve got good features and youd look splendid cleanshaved  mr simpson smiled faintly  only on wednesday the barmaid here was asking after you pursued mr mills  mr simpson smiled again  she says to me wheres granpa she says and when i says haughty like who do you mean she says father christmas  if you was to tell her that you are only fiftythree shed laugh in your face  let her laugh said the other sourly  come out and get it off said mr mills earnestly  theres a barbers in bird street you could go in the little back room where he charges a penny more and get it done without anybody being a bit the wiser  he put his hand on mr simpsons shoulder and that gentleman with a glare in the direction of the fair but unconscious offender rose in a hypnotized fashion and followed him out  twice on the way to bird street mr simpson paused and said he had altered his mind and twice did the propulsion of mr millss right hand and his flattering argument make him alter it again  it was a matter of relief to mr simpson that the barber took his instructions without any show of surprise  it appeared indeed that an elderly man of seventyeight had enlisted his services for a similar purpose not two months before and had got married six weeks afterwards age of the bride given as twentyfour but said to have looked older  a snip of the scissors and six inches of white beard fell to the floor for the first time in thirty years mr simpson felt a razor on his face then his hair was cut and shampooed and an hour later he sat gazing at a darkhaired cleanshaven man in the glass who gazed back at him with wondering eyesa leanjawed goodlooking man who in a favourable light might pass for forty  he turned and met the admiring eyes of mr mills  what did i tell you  inquired the latter  you look young enough to be your own son  or grandson said the barber with professional pride  mr simpson got up slowly from the chair and accompanied by the admiring mr mills passed out into the street  the evening was young and at his friends suggestion they returned to the plume of feathers  you give the order said mr mills and see whether she recognizes you  mr simpson obeyed  dont you know him  inquired mr mills as the barmaid turned away  i dont think i have that pleasure said the girl simpering  granpas eldest boy said mr mills  oh  said the girl  well i hope hes a better man than his father then  what do you mean by that  demanded mr simpson painfully conscious of his friends regards  nothing said the girl nothing  only we can all be better cant we hes a nice old gentleman so simple  dont know you from adam said mr mills as she turned away  now if you ask me i dont believe as your own missis will recognize you  rubbish said mr simpson  my wife would know me anywhere  weve been married over thirty years  thirty years of sunshine and shadow together  youre a single man and dont understand these things  praps youre right said his friend  but itll be a bit of a shock to her anyway  what do you say to me stepping round and breaking the news to her  its a bit sudden you know  shes expecting a white haired old gentleman not a blackhaired boy  mr simpson looked a bit uneasy  praps i ought to have told her first he murmured craning his neck to look in the glass at the back of the bar  ill go and put it right for you said his friend  you stay here and smoke your pipe  he stepped out briskly but his pace slackened as he drew near the house  iicameto see you about your husband he faltered as mrs simpson opened the door and stood regarding him  whats the matter  she exclaimed with a faint cry  whats happened to him  nothing said mr mills hastily  nothing serious that is  i just came round to warn you so that you will be able to know its him  mrs simpson let off a shriek that set his ears tingling  then steadying herself by the wall she tottered into the front room followed by the discomfited mr mills and sank into a chair  hes dead  she sobbed  hes dead  he is not said mr mills  is he much hurt  is he dying  gasped mrs simpson  only his hair said mr mills clutching at the opening  he is not hurt at all  mrs simpson dabbed at her eyesand sat regarding him in bewilderment her twin chins were still quivering with emotion but her eyes were beginning to harden  what are you talking about  she inquired in a raspy voice  hes been to a hairdressers said mr mills  hes ad all his white whiskers cut off and his hair cut short and dyed black  and what with that and his new teeth i thoughthe thoughtpraps you mightnt know him when he came home  dyed  cried mrs simpson starting to her feet  mr mills nodded  he looks twenty years younger he said with a smile  hed pass for his own son anywhere  mrs simpsons eyes snapped  perhaps hed pass for my son she remarked  yes easy said the tactful mr mills  you cant think what a difference its made to him  thats why i came to see youso you shouldnt be startled  thank you said mrs simpson  im much obliged  but you might have spared yourself the trouble  i should know my husband anywhere  ah thats what you think retorted mr mills with a smile but the barmaid at the plume didnt  thats what made me come to you  mrs simpson gazed at him  i says to myself continued mr mills if she dont know him im certain his missis wont and id better  youd better go interrupted his hostess  mr mills started and then with much dignity stalked after her to the door  as to your story i dont believe a word of it said mrs simpson whatever else my husband is he isnt a fool and hed no more think of cutting off his whiskers and dyeing his hair than you would of telling the truth  seeing is believing said the offended mr mills darkly  ill wait till i do see and then i shant believe was the reply it is a putup job between you and some other precious idiot i expect but you cant deceive me  if your blackhaired friend comes here hell get it i can tell you  she slammed the door on his protests and returning to the parlour gazed fiercely into the glass on the mantelpiece  it reflected sixteen stone of honest english womanhood a thin wisp of yellowishgrey hair and a pair of faded eyes peering through clumsy spectacles  son indeed  she said her lips quivering  you wait till you come home my lord  mr simpson with some forebodings returned home an hour later  to a man who loved peace and quietness the report of the indignant mr mills was not of a reassuring nature  he hesitated on the doorstep for a few seconds while he fumbled for his key and then humming unconcernedly hung his hat in the passage and walked into the parlour  the astonished scream of his wife warned him that mr mills had by no means exaggerated  she rose from her seat and crouching by the fireplace regarded him with a mixture of anger and dismay  itits all right milly said mr simpson with a smile that revealed a dazzling set of teeth  who are you  demanded mrs simpson  how dare you call me by my christian name  its a good job for you my husband is not here  he wouldnt hurt me said mr simpson with an attempt at facetiousness  hes the best friend i ever had  why we slept in the same cradle  i dont want any of your nonsense said mrs simpson  you get out of my house before i send for the police  how dare you come into a respectable womans house in this fashion  be off with you  now look here milly began mr simpson  his wife drew herself up to her full height of four feet eleven  ive had a haircut and a shave pursued her husband also ive had my hair restored to its natural colour  but im the same man and you know it  i know nothing of the kind said his wife doggedly  i dont know you from adam  ive never seen you before and i dont want to see you again  you go away  im your husband and my place is at home replied mr simpson  a man can have a shave if he likes cant he  wheres my supper  go on said his wife  keep it up  but be careful my husband dont come in and catch you thats all  mr simpson gazed at her fixedly and then with an impatient exclamation walked into the small kitchen and began to set the supper a joint of cold beef a jar of pickles bread butter and cheese made an appetizing display  then he took a jug from the dresser and descended to the cellar  a musical trickling fell on the ear of mrs simpson as she stood at the parlour door and drew her stealthily to the cellar  the key was in the lock and with a sudden movement she closed the door and locked it  a sharp cry from mr simpson testified to his discomfiture  now im off for the police cried his wife  dont be a fool shouted mr simpson tugging wildly at the door handle  open the door  mrs simpson remained silent and her husband resumed his efforts until the doorknob unused to such treatment came off in his hand  a sudden scrambling noise on the cellar stairs satisfied the listener that he had not pulled it off intentionally  she stood for a few moments considering  it was a stout door and opened inwards  she took her bonnet from its nail in the kitchen and walking softly to the streetdoor set off to lay the case before a brother who lived a few doors away  poor old bill said mr cooper when she had finished  still it might be worse hes got the barrel o beer with him  its not bill said mrs simpson  mr cooper scratched his whiskers and looked at his wife  she ought to know said the latter  well come and have a look at him said mr cooper  mrs simpson pondered and eyed him dubiously  come in and have a bit of supper she said at last  theres a nice piece of beef and pickles  and billi mean the strangersitting on the beerbarrel said mr cooper gloomily  you can bring your beer with you said his sister sharply  come along  mr cooper grinned and placing a couple of bottles in his coat pockets followed the two ladies to the house  seated at the kitchen table he grinned again as a persistent drumming took place on the cellar door his wife smiled and a faint sour attempt in the same direction appeared on the face of mrs simpson  open the door  bellowed an indignant voice  open the door  mrs simpson commanding silence with an uplifted finger proceeded to carve the beef  a rattle of knives and forks succeeded  openthedoor  said the voice again  not so much noise commanded mr cooper  i cant hear myself eat  bob  said the voice in relieved accents bob  come and let me out  mr cooper putting a huge hand over his mouth struggled nobly with his feelings  who are you calling bob  he demanded in an unsteady voice  you keep yourself to yourself  ive heard all about you  youve got to stay there till my brotherinlaw comes home  its me bob said mr simpsonbill  yes i dare say said mr cooper but if youre bill why havent you got bills voice  let me out and look at me said mr simpson  there was a faint scream from both ladies followed by protests  dont be alarmed said mr cooper reassuringly  i wasnt born yesterday  i dont want to get a crack over the head  its all a mistake bob said the prisoner appealingly  i just had a shave and a haircut andand a little hairdye  if you open the door youll know me at once  how would it be said mr cooper turning to his sister and speaking with unusual distinctnesshow would it be if you opened the door and just as he put his head out i hit it a crack with the poker  you try it on said the voice behind the door hotly  you know who i am well enough bob cooper  i dont want any more of your nonsense milly has put you up to this  if your wife dont know you how do you think i can  said mr cooper now look here you keep quiet till my brotherinlaw comes home  if he dont come home perhaps we shall be more likely to think youre him if hes not home by tomorrow morning wehsh  hsh  dont you know theres ladies present  that settles it said mrs cooper speaking for the first time  my brotherinlaw would never talk like that  i should never forgive him if he did said her husband piously  he poured himself out another glass of beer and resumed his supper with relish  conversation turned on the weather and from that to the price of potatoes  frantic efforts on the part of the prisoner to join in the conversation and give it a more personal turn were disregarded  finally he began to kick with monotonous persistency on the door  stop it  shouted mr cooper  i wont said mr simpson  the noise became unendurable  mr cooper who had just lit his pipe laid it on the table and looked round at his companions  hell have the door down soon he said rising  halloa there  halloa  said the other  you say youre bill simpson said mr cooper holding up a forefinger at mrs simpson who was about to interrupt  if you are tell us something you know that only you could know something we know so as to identify you  things about your past  a strange noise sounded behind the door  sounds as though he is smacking his lips said mrs cooper to her sisterinlaw who was eyeing mr cooper restlessly  very good said mr simpson i agree  who is there  me and my wife and mrs simpson said mr cooper  he is smacking his lips whispered mrs cooper  having a go at the beer perhaps  lets go back fifteen years said mr simpson in meditative tones do you remember that girl with coppercoloured hair that used to live in john street  no  said mr cooper loudly and suddenly  do you remember coming to me one daytwo days after valentine day it waswhite as chalk and shaking like a leaf and  no roared mr cooper  very well i must try something else then said mr simpson philosophically  carry your mind back ten years bob cooper  look here  said mr cooper turning round with a ghastly smile wed better get off home mary  i dont like interfering in other peoples concerns  never did  you stay where you are said his wife  ten years repeated the voice behind the door  there was a new barmaid at the crown and one night you  if i listen to any more of this nonsense i shall burst remarked mr cooper plaintively  go on prompted mrs cooper grimly  one night  never mind said mr simpson  it doesnt matter  but does he identify me  because if not ive got a lot more things i can try  the harassed mr cooper looked around appealingly  how do you expect me to recognize you he began and stopped suddenly  go back to your courting days then said mr simpson when mrs cooper wasnt mrs cooper but only wanted to be  mrs cooper shivered so did mr cooper  and you came round to me for advice pursued mr simpson in reminiscent accents because there was another girl you wasnt sure of and you didnt want to lose them both  do you remember sitting with the two photographsone on each kneeand trying to make up your mind  wonderful imagination said mr cooper smiling in a ghastly fashion at his wife  hark at him  i am harking said mrs cooper  am i bill simpson or am i not demanded mr simpson  bill was always fond of his joke said mr cooper with a glance at the company that would have moved an oyster  he was always fond of making up things  youre like him in that  what do you think milly  its not my husband said mrs simpson  tell us something about her said mr cooper hastily  i darent said mr simpson  doesnt that prove im her husband but ill tell you things about your wife if you like  you dare  said mrs cooper turning crimson as she realized what confidences might have passed between husband and wife  if you say a word of your lies about me i dont know what i wont do to you  very well i must go on about bob thentill he recognizes me said mr simpson patiently  carry your mind  open the door and let him out shouted mr cooper turning to his sister  how can i recognize a man through a deal door  mrs simpson after a little hesitation handed him the key and the next moment her husband stepped out and stood blinking in the gaslight  do you recognize me he asked turning to mr cooper  i do said that gentleman with a ferocious growl  id know you anywhere said mrs cooper with emphasis  and you said mr simpson turning to his wife  youre not my husband she said obstinately  are you sure inquired mr cooper  certain  very good then said her brother  if hes not your husband im going to knock his head off for telling them lies about me  he sprang forward and catching mr simpson by the collar shook him violently until his head banged against the dresser  the next moment the hands of mrs simpson were in the hair of mr cooper  how dare you knock my husband about she screamed as mr cooper let go and caught her fingers  youve hurt him  concussion i think said mr simpson with great presence of mind  his wife helped him to a chair and wetting her handkerchief at the tap tenderly bathed the dyed head  mr cooper breathing hard stood by watching until his wife touched him on the arm  you come off home she said in a hard voice  you aint wanted  are you going to stay here all night  i should like to said mr cooper wistfully
