56657989	the lady of the barge  and other stories  by w w jacobs     an adulteration act   dr frank carson had been dreaming tantalizing dreams of cooling effervescent beverages  over and over again in his dreams he had risen from his bed and tripping lightly down to the surgery in his pajamas mixed himself something long and cool and fizzy without being able to bring the dream to a satisfactory termination  with a sudden start he awoke  the thirst was still upon him the materials for quenching it just down one flight of stairs  he would have smacked his lips at the prospect if they had been moist enough to smack as it was he pushed down the bedclothes and throwing one leg out of bedbecame firmly convinced that he was still dreaming  for the atmosphere was stifling and odorous and the ceiling descended in an odd bulging curve to within a couple of feet of his head  still half asleep he raised his fist and prodded at it in astonishmenta feeling which gave way to one of stupefaction as the ceiling took another shape and swore distinctly  i must be dreaming mused the doctor even the ceiling seems alive  he prodded it againregarding it closely this time  the ceiling at once rose to greater altitudes and at the same moment an old face with bushy whiskers crawled under the edge of it and asked him profanely what he meant by it  it also asked him whether he wanted something for himself because if so he was going the right way to work  where am i demanded the bewildered doctor  mary mary  he started up in bed and brought his head in sudden violent contact with the ceiling  then before the indignant ceiling could carry out its threat of a moment before he slipped out of bed and stood on a floor which was in its place one moment and somewhere else the next  in the smell of bilgewater tar and the foetid atmosphere generally his clouded brain awoke to the fact that he was on board ship but resolutely declined to inform him how he got there  he looked down in disgust at the ragged clothes which he had on in lieu of the usual pajamas and then as events slowly pieced themselves together in his mind remembered as the last thing that he could remember that he had warned his friend harry thomson solicitor that if he had any more to drink it would not be good for him  he wondered dimly as he stood whether thomson was there too and walking unsteadily round the forecastle roused the sleepers one by one and asked them whether they were harry thomson all answering with much fluency in the negative until he came to one man who for some time made no answer at all  the doctor shook him first and then punched him  then he shook him again and gave him little scientific slaps until at length harry thomson in a faraway voice said that he was all right  well im glad im not alone said the doctor selfishly harry harry  wake up  all ri said the sleeper im all ri  the doctor shook him again and then rolled him backward and forward in his bunk  under this gentle treatment the solicitors faculties were somewhat brightened and half opening his eyes he punched viciously at the disturber of his peace until threatening voices from the gloom promised to murder both of them  where are we  demanded the doctor of a deep voice from the other side of the forecastle which had been particularly threatening  barque stella o course was the reply  whered you think you was  the doctor gripped the edge of his friends bunk and tried to think then a feeling of nausea overcoming all others he clambered hurriedly up the forecastle ladder and lurched to the side of the vessel  he leaned there for some time without moving a light breeze cooling his fevered brow and a small schooner some little distance from them playing seesaw as he closed his eyes to the heaving blue sea  land was conspicuous by its absence and with a groan he turned and looked about himat the white scrubbed deck the snowy canvas towering aloft on lazily creaking spars and the steersman leaning against the wheel regarding the officer who stood near by  dr carson feeling a little better walked sternly aft the officer turning round and glancing in surprise at his rags as he approached  i beg your pardon began the doctor in superior tones  and what the devil do you want  demanded the second officer who told you to come along here  i want to know what this means said the doctor fiercely  how dare you kidnap us on your beastly bilgetank  mans mad murmured the astonished second officer  insufferable outrage  continued the doctor  take us back to melbourne at once  you get forard said the other sharply get forard and dont let me have any more of your lip  i want to see the captain of this ship cried the doctor go and fetch him at once  the second officer gazed at him limp with astonishment and then turned to the steersman as though unable to believe his ears  the steersman pointed in front of him and the other gave a cry of surprise and rage as he saw another tatterdemalion coming with uncertain steps toward him  carson said the new arrival feebly and coming closer to his friend clung to him miserably  im just having it out with em thomson said the doctor energetically  my friend here is a solicitor  tell him what ll happen if they dont take us back harry  you seem to be unaware my good fellow said the solicitor covering a large hole in the leg of his trousers with his hand of the very dangerous situation in which you have placed yourselves  we have no desire to be harsh with you  not at all acquiesced the doctor nodding at the second officer  at the same time continued mr thomsonat the  he let go his friends arm and staggered away the doctor gazed after him sympathetically  illustration he saw another tatterdemalion coming towards him  his digestion is not all it should be he said to the second officer confidentially  if you dont get forard in two twos said that gentleman explosively ill knock your heads off  the doctor gazed at him in haughty disdain and taking the limp thomson by the arm led him slowly away  how did we get here  asked mr harry thomson feebly  the doctor shook his head  how did we get these disgusting clothes on continued his friend  the doctor shook his head again  the last thing i can remember harry he said slowly was imploring you not to drink any more  i didnt hear you said the solicitor crustily your speech was very indistinct last night  seemed so to you i dare say said the other  mr thomson shook his arm off and clinging to the mainmast leaned his cheek against it and closed his eyes  he opened them again at the sound of voices and drew himself up as he saw the second officer coming along with a sternvisaged man of about fifty  are you the master of this vessel  inquired the doctor stepping to his friends side  what the blazes has that got to do with you  demanded the skipper look here my lads dont you play any of your little games on me because they wont do  youre both of you as drunk as owls  defamation of character said the solicitor feebly to his friend  allow me said the doctor with his best manner to inquire what all this means  i am dr frank carson of melbourne this gentleman is my friend mr thomson of the same place solicitor  what roared the skipper the veins in his forehead standing out doctor  solicitor  why you damned rascals you shipped with me as cook and a b  theres some mistake said the doctor  im afraid i shall have to ask you to take us back  i hope you havent come far  take those scarecrows away cried the skipper hoarsely take them away before i do them a mischief  ill have the law of somebody for shipping two useless lubbers as seamen  look to me like pickpockets  you shall answer for this said carson foaming were professional men and were not going to be abused by a bargee  let him talk said mr thomson hurriedly drawing his friend away from the irate skipper  let him talk  ill put you both in quod when we get to hongkong said the skipper meantime no work no food dye hear  start and cook the breakfast mr doctor and you  mr lawyer turn to and ask the boy to teach you an a bs duties  he walked back to the cabin and the new cook was slowly pushed toward the galley by the second officer the new a b under the same gentle guidance being conducted back to the forecastle  fortunately for the new seamen the weather continued fine but the heat of the galley was declared by the new cook to be insupportable  from the other hands they learned that they had been shipped with several others by a resourceful boardinghouse master  the other hands being men of plain speech also said that they were brought aboard in a state of beastly and enviable intoxication and chaffed crudely when the doctor attributed their apparent state of intoxication to drugs  you say youre a doctor  said the oldest seaman  i am said carson fiercely  wot sort of a doctor are you if you dont know when your lickers been played with then asked the old man as a grin passed slowly from mouth to mouth  i suppose it is because i drink so seldom said the doctor loftily i hardly know the taste of liquor myself while as for my friend mr thomson you might almost call him a teetotaler  next door to one said the solicitor who was sewing a patch on his trousers as he looked up approvingly  you might call im a sailor if you liked said another seaman but that wouldnt make him one  all i can say is i never ad enough time or money to get in the state you was both in when you come aboard  if the forecastle was incredulous the cabin was worse  the officers at first took but little notice of them but feeling their torn and tattered appearance was against them they put on so many airs and graces to counteract this that flesh and blood could not endure it quietly  the cook would allude to his friend as mr thomson while the a b  would persist in referring with a most affected utterance to dr carson  cook bawled the skipper one day when they were about a week out  dr carson who was peeling potatoes stepped slowly out of the galley and went toward him  you say sir when youre spoken to said the skipper fiercely  the doctor sneered  my  if you sneer at me ill knock your head off  said the other with a wicked look  when you get back to melbourne said the doctor quietly youll hear more of this  youre a couple of pickpockets aping the gentleman said the skipper and he turned to the mate  mr mackenzie what do these two ragamuffins look like  pickpockets said the mate dutifully  its a very handy thing said the old man jeeringly to have a doctor aboard  first time ive carried a surgeon  mr mackenzie guffawed loudly  and a solicitor said the skipper gazing darkly at the hapless harry thomson who was cleaning brasswork  handy in case of disputes  hes a real sea lawyer cook  sir  said the doctor quietly  go down and tidy my cabin and see you do it well  the doctor went below without a word and worked like a housemaid  when he came on deck again his face wore a smile almost of happiness and his hand caressed one trousers pocket as though it concealed a hidden weapon  for the following three or four days the two unfortunates were worked unceasingly  mr thomson complained bitterly but the cook wore a sphinxlike smile and tried to comfort him  it wont be for long harry he said consolingly  the solicitor sniffed  i could write tract after tract on temperance he said bitterly  i wonder what our poor wives are thinking  i expect they have put us down as dead  crying their eyes out said the doctor wistfully but theyll dry them precious quick when we get back and ask all sorts of questions what are you going to say harry  the truth said the solicitor virtuously  so am i said his friend but mind we must both tell the same tale whatever it is  halloa whats the matter  its the skipper said the boy who had just run up he wants to see you at once  hes dying  he caught hold of the doctor by the sleeve but carson in his most professional manner declined to be hurried  he went leisurely down the companionladder and met with a careless glance the concerned faces of the mate and second officer  come to the skipper at once said the mate  does he want to see me  said the doctor languidly as he entered the cabin  the skipper was lying doubled up in his bunk his face twisted with pain doctor he panted give me something quick  theres the medicine chest  do you want some food sir  inquired the other respectfully  food be damned said the sufferer  i want physic  theres the medicinechest  the doctor took it up and held it out to him  i dont want the lot moaned the skipper  i want you to give me something for redhot corkscrews in the inside  i beg your pardon said the doctor humbly im only the cook  if youdontprescribe for me at once said the skipper ill put you in irons  the doctor shook his head  i shipped as cook he said slowly  give me something for heavens sake said the skipper humbly  im dying  the doctor pondered  if you dinna treat him at once ill break your skull said the mate persuasively  the doctor regarded him scornfully and turned to the writhing skipper  my fee is half a guinea a visit he said softly five shillings if you come to me  ill have half a guineas worth said the agonized skipper  the doctor took his wrist and calmly drew the second officers watch from its owners pocket  then he inspected the sick mans tongue and shaking his head selected a powder from the chest  you mustnt mind its being nasty he said  wheres a spoon  he looked round for one but the skipper took the powder from his hand and licked it from the paper as though it had been sherbet  for mercys sake dont say its cholera he gasped  i wont say anything said the doctor  where did you say the money was  the skipper pointed to his trousers and mr mackenzie his national spirit rising in hot rage took out the agreed amount and handed it to the physician  am i in danger  said the skipper  theres always danger said the doctor in his best bedside manner have you made your will  the other turning pale shook his head  perhaps youd like to see a solicitor said carson in winning tones  im not bad enough for that said the skipper stoutly  you must stay here and nurse the skipper mr mackenzie said carson turning to the mate and be good enough not to make that snuffling noise its worrying to an invalid  snuffling noise  repeated the horrorstruck mate  yes youve got an unpleasant habit of snuffling said the doctor it sometimes  i  worries me meant to speak to you about it before  you mustnt do it here  if you want to snuffle go and snuffle on deck  the frenzied outburst of the mate was interrupted by the skipper  dont make that noise in my cabin mr mackenzie he said severely  both mates withdrew in dudgeon and carson after arranging the sufferers bedclothes quitted the cabin and sought his friend  mr thomson was at first incredulous but his eyes glistened brightly at the sight of the halfsovereign  better hide it he said apprehensively the skipper ll have it back when he gets well its the only coin weve got  he wont get well said dr carson easily not till we get to hong kong that is  whats the matter with him  whispered the solicitor  the doctor evading his eye pulled a long face and shook his head  it may be the cooking he said slowly  im not a good cook i admit  it might be something got into the food from the medicinechest  i shouldnt be at all surprised if the mates are taken bad too  and indeed at that very moment the boy came rushing to the galley again bawling out that mr mackenzie was lying flat on his stomach in his bunk punching the air with his fists and rending it with his language  the second officer appeared on deck as he finished his tale and glancing forward called out loudly for the cook  youre wanted frank said the solicitor  when he calls me doctor ill go said the other stiffly  cook bawled the second officer  cook  cook  he came running forward his face red and angry and his fist doubled didnt you hear me calling you  he demanded fiercely  ive been promoted said carson sweetly  im ships surgeon now  come down below at once or ill take you there by the scruff of your neck vociferated the other  youre not big enough little man said the doctor still smiling well well lead the way and well see what we can do  he followed the speechless second officer below and found the boys description of the first officers state as moonlight unto sunlight as water unto wine  even the second officer was appalled at the spectacle and ventured a protest  gie me something at once yelled mr mackenzie  do you wish me to undertake your case  inquired the doctor suavely  mr mackenzie said that he did in seven long abusive and wicked sentences  my fee is half a guinea said the doctor softly poor people who cannot afford more mates and the like i sometimes treat for less  ill die first howled the mate you wont get any money out of me  very good said the doctor and rose to depart  bring him back rogers yelled the mate dont let him go  but the second officer with a strange awesome look in his eyes was leaning back in his seat tightly gripping the edge of the table in both hands  come come said the doctor cheerilywhats this  you mustnt be ill rogers  i want you to nurse these other two  the other rose slowly to his feet and eyed him with lacklustre eyes tell the third officer to take charge he said slowly and if hes to he nurse as well hes got his hands full  the doctor sent the boy to apprise the third officer of his responsibilities and then stood watching the extraordinary and snakelike convolutions of mr mackenzie  how muchdidye say  hissed the latter  poor people repeated the doctor with relish five shillings a visit very poor people half a crown  ill have half a crowns worth moaned the miserable mate  mr mackenzie said a faint voice from the skippers cabin  sir  yelled the mate who was in torment  dont answer me like that sir said the skipper sharply  will you please to remember that im ill and cant bear that horrible noise youre making  imilltoo gasped the mate  ill  nonsense  said the skipper severely  we cant both be ill how about the ship  there was no reply but from another cabin the voice of mr rogers was heard calling wildly for medical aid and offering impossible sums in exchange for it  the doctor went from cabin to cabin and first collecting his fees administered sundry potions to the sufferers and then in his capacity of cook went forward and made an unsavory mess he called gruel which he insisted upon their eating  thanks to his skill the invalids were freed from the more violent of their pains but this freedom was followed by a weakness so alarming that they could hardly raise their heads from their pillowsa state of things which excited the intense envy of the third officer who owing to his responsibilities might just as well have been without one  in this state of weakness and with the fear of impending dissolution before his eyes the skipper sent for mr harry thomson and after some comparisons between lawyers and sharks in which stress was laid upon certain redeeming features of the latter paid a guinea and made his will  his example save in the amount of the fee was followed by the mate but mr rogers being approached tentatively by the doctor in his friends behalf shook his head and thanked his stars he had nothing to leave  he had enjoyed his money he said  they mended slowly as they approached hongkong though a fit of temper on mr mackenzies part during which he threw out ominous hints about having his money back led to a regrettable relapse in his case  he was still in bed when they came to anchor in the harbour but the skipper and his second officer were able to go above and exchange congratulations from adjoining deckchairs  you are sure it wasnt cholera asked the harbourmasters deputy who had boarded them in his launch after he had heard the story  positive said carson  very fortunate thing they had you on board said the deputyvery fortunate  the doctor bowed  seems so odd the three of them being down with it said the other looks as though its infectious doesnt it  i dont think so said the doctor accepting with alacrity an offer to go ashore in the launch and change into some decent clothes  i think i know what it was  the captain of the stella pricked up his ears and the second officer leaned forward with parted lips  carson accompanied by the deputy and the solicitor walked toward the launch  what was it  cried the skipper anxiously  illustration the second officer leaned forward  i think that you ate something that disagreed with you replied the doctor grinning meaningly  goodby captain  the master of the stella made no reply but rising feebly tottered to the side and shook his fist at the launch as it headed for the shore doctor carson who had had a pious upbringing kissed his hand in return
