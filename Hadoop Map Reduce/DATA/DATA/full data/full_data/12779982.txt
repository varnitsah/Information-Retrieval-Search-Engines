succeeded to hell row hell row was a block of thatched bulging cottages that stood by the brookside on greenhill lane there lived the colliers who worked in the little ginpits two fields away the brook ran under the alder trees scarcely soiled by these small mines whose coal was drawn to the surface by donkeys that plodded wearily in a circle round a gin and all over the countryside were these same pits some of which had been worked in the time of charles ii the few colliers and the donkeys burrowing down like ants into the earth making queer mounds and little black places among the cornfields and the meadows and the cottages of these coalminers in blocks and pairs here and there together with odd farms and homes of the stockingers straying over the parish formed the village of bestwood  then some sixty years ago a sudden change took place ginpits were elbowed aside by the large mines of the financiers the coal and iron field of nottinghamshire and derbyshire was discovered carston waite and co appeared amid tremendous excitement lord palmerston formally opened the companys first mine at spinney park on the edge of sherwood forest  about this time the notorious hell row which through growing old had acquired an evil reputation was burned down and much dirt was cleansed away  carston waite  co found they had struck on a good thing so down the valleys of the brooks from selby and nuttall new mines were sunk until soon there were six pits working from nuttall high up on the sandstone among the woods the railway ran past the ruined priory of the carthusians and past robin hoods well down to spinney park then on to minton a large mine among cornfields from minton across the farmlands of the valleyside to bunkers hill branching off there and running north to beggarlee and selby that looks over at crich and the hills of derbyshire six mines like black studs on the countryside linked by a loop of fine chain the railway  to accommodate the regiments of miners carston waite and co built the squares great quadrangles of dwellings on the hillside of bestwood and then in the brook valley on the site of hell row they erected the bottoms  the bottoms consisted of six blocks of miners dwellings two rows of three like the dots on a blanksix domino and twelve houses in a block this double row of dwellings sat at the foot of the rather sharp slope from bestwood and looked out from the attic windows at least on the slow climb of the valley towards selby  the houses themselves were substantial and very decent one could walk all round seeing little front gardens with auriculas and saxifrage in the shadow of the bottom block sweetwilliams and pinks in the sunny top block seeing neat front windows little porches little privet hedges and dormer windows for the attics but that was outside that was the view on to the uninhabited parlours of all the colliers wives the dwellingroom the kitchen was at the back of the house facing inward between the blocks looking at a scrubby back garden and then at the ashpits and between the rows between the long lines of ashpits went the alley where the children played and the women gossiped and the men smoked so the actual conditions of living in the bottoms that was so well built and that looked so nice were quite unsavoury because people must live in the kitchen and the kitchens opened on to that nasty alley of ashpits  mrs morel was not anxious to move into the bottoms which was already twelve years old and on the downward path when she descended to it from bestwood but it was the best she could do moreover she had an end house in one of the top blocks and thus had only one neighbour on the other side an extra strip of garden and having an end house she enjoyed a kind of aristocracy among the other women of the between houses because her rent was five shillings and sixpence instead of five shillings a week but this superiority in station was not much consolation to mrs morel  she was thirtyone years old and had been married eight years a rather small woman of delicate mould but resolute bearing she shrank a little from the first contact with the bottoms women she came down in the july and in the september expected her third baby  her husband was a miner they had only been in their new home three weeks when the wakes or fair began morel she knew was sure to make a holiday of it he went off early on the monday morning the day of the fair the two children were highly excited william a boy of seven fled off immediately after breakfast to prowl round the wakes ground leaving annie who was only five to whine all morning to go also mrs morel did her work she scarcely knew her neighbours yet and knew no one with whom to trust the little girl so she promised to take her to the wakes after dinner  william appeared at halfpast twelve he was a very active lad fairhaired freckled with a touch of the dane or norwegian about him  can i have my dinner mother he cried rushing in with his cap on cause it begins at halfpast one the man says so  you can have your dinner as soon as its done replied the mother  isnt it done he cried his blue eyes staring at her in indignation then im goin beout it  youll do nothing of the sort it will be done in five minutes it is only halfpast twelve  theyll be beginnin the boy half cried half shouted  you wont die if they do said the mother besides its only halfpast twelve so youve a full hour  the lad began hastily to lay the table and directly the three sat down they were eating batterpudding and jam when the boy jumped off his chair and stood perfectly stiff some distance away could be heard the first small braying of a merrygoround and the tooting of a horn his face quivered as he looked at his mother  i told you he said running to the dresser for his cap  take your pudding in your handand its only five past one so you were wrongyou havent got your twopence cried the mother in a breath  the boy came back bitterly disappointed for his twopence then went off without a word  i want to go i want to go said annie beginning to cry  well and you shall go whining wizzening little stick said the mother and later in the afternoon she trudged up the hill under the tall hedge with her child the hay was gathered from the fields and cattle were turned on to the eddish it was warm peaceful  mrs morel did not like the wakes there were two sets of horses one going by steam one pulled round by a pony three organs were grinding and there came odd cracks of pistolshots fearful screeching of the cocoanut mans rattle shouts of the aunt sally man screeches from the peepshow lady the mother perceived her son gazing enraptured outside the lion wallace booth at the pictures of this famous lion that had killed a negro and maimed for life two white men she left him alone and went to get annie a spin of toffee presently the lad stood in front of her wildly excited  you never said you was comingisnt the a lot of thingsthat lions killed three menive spent my tuppencean look here  he pulled from his pocket two eggcups with pink mossroses on them  i got these from that stall where yave ter get them marbles in them holes an i got these two in two goesaepenny a gotheyve got mossroses on look here i wanted these  she knew he wanted them for her  hm she said pleased they are pretty  shall you carry em cause im frightened o breakin em  he was tipful of excitement now she had come led her about the ground showed her everything then at the peepshow she explained the pictures in a sort of story to which he listened as if spellbound he would not leave her all the time he stuck close to her bristling with a small boys pride of her for no other woman looked such a lady as she did in her little black bonnet and her cloak she smiled when she saw women she knew when she was tired she said to her son  well are you coming now or later  are you goin aready he cried his face full of reproach  already it is past four i know  what are you goin aready for he lamented  you neednt come if you dont want she said  and she went slowly away with her little girl whilst her son stood watching her cut to the heart to let her go and yet unable to leave the wakes as she crossed the open ground in front of the moon and stars she heard men shouting and smelled the beer and hurried a little thinking her husband was probably in the bar  at about halfpast six her son came home tired now rather pale and somewhat wretched he was miserable though he did not know it because he had let her go alone since she had gone he had not enjoyed his wakes  has my dad been he asked  no said the mother  hes helping to wait at the moon and stars i seed him through that black tin stuff wi holes in on the window wi his sleeves rolled up  ha exclaimed the mother shortly hes got no money an hell be satisfied if he gets his lowance whether they give him more or not  when the light was fading and mrs morel could see no more to sew she rose and went to the door everywhere was the sound of excitement the restlessness of the holiday that at last infected her she went out into the side garden women were coming home from the wakes the children hugging a white lamb with green legs or a wooden horse occasionally a man lurched past almost as full as he could carry sometimes a good husband came along with his family peacefully but usually the women and children were alone the stayathome mothers stood gossiping at the corners of the alley as the twilight sank folding their arms under their white aprons  mrs morel was alone but she was used to it her son and her little girl slept upstairs so it seemed her home was there behind her fixed and stable but she felt wretched with the coming child the world seemed a dreary place where nothing else would happen for herat least until william grew up but for herself nothing but this dreary endurancetill the children grew up and the children she could not afford to have this third she did not want it the father was serving beer in a public house swilling himself drunk she despised him and was tied to him this coming child was too much for her if it were not for william and annie she was sick of it the struggle with poverty and ugliness and meanness  she went into the front garden feeling too heavy to take herself out yet unable to stay indoors the heat suffocated her and looking ahead the prospect of her life made her feel as if she were buried alive  the front garden was a small square with a privet hedge there she stood trying to soothe herself with the scent of flowers and the fading beautiful evening opposite her small gate was the stile that led uphill under the tall hedge between the burning glow of the cut pastures the sky overhead throbbed and pulsed with light the glow sank quickly off the field the earth and the hedges smoked dusk as it grew dark a ruddy glare came out on the hilltop and out of the glare the diminished commotion of the fair  sometimes down the trough of darkness formed by the path under the hedges men came lurching home one young man lapsed into a run down the steep bit that ended the hill and went with a crash into the stile mrs morel shuddered he picked himself up swearing viciously rather pathetically as if he thought the stile had wanted to hurt him  she went indoors wondering if things were never going to alter she was beginning by now to realise that they would not she seemed so far away from her girlhood she wondered if it were the same person walking heavily up the back garden at the bottoms as had run so lightly up the breakwater at sheerness ten years before  what have i to do with it she said to herself what have i to do with all this even the child i am going to have it doesnt seem as if i were taken into account  sometimes life takes hold of one carries the body along accomplishes ones history and yet is not real but leaves oneself as it were slurred over  i wait mrs morel said to herselfi wait and what i wait for can never come  then she straightened the kitchen lit the lamp mended the fire looked out the washing for the next day and put it to soak after which she sat down to her sewing through the long hours her needle flashed regularly through the stuff occasionally she sighed moving to relieve herself and all the time she was thinking how to make the most of what she had for the childrens sakes  at halfpast eleven her husband came his cheeks were very red and very shiny above his black moustache his head nodded slightly he was pleased with himself  oh oh waitin for me lass ive bin elpin anthony an whats think hes gen me nowt br a lousy haefcrown an thats ivry penny  he thinks youve made the rest up in beer she said shortly  an i aventthat i avent you blieve me ive ad very little this day i have an all his voice went tender here an i browt thee a bit o brandysnap an a cocoanut for th children he laid the gingerbread and the cocoanut a hairy object on the table nay tha niver said thankyer for nowt i thy life did ter  as a compromise she picked up the cocoanut and shook it to see if it had any milk  its a good un you may back yer life o that i got it fra bill hodgkisson bill i says tha non wants them three nuts does ter arena ter for giein me one for my bit of a lad an wench i ham walter my lad e says tae which on em ters a mind an so i

will part with anything so long as hes drunk and youre drunk along with him said mrs morel  eh tha mucky little ussy whos drunk i shd like ter know said morel he was extraordinarily pleased with himself because of his days helping to wait in the moon and stars he chattered on  mrs morel very tired and sick of his babble went to bed as quickly as possible while he raked the fire  mrs morel came of a good old burgher family famous independents who had fought with colonel hutchinson and who remained stout congregationalists her grandfather had gone bankrupt in the lacemarket at a time when so many lacemanufacturers were ruined in nottingham her father george coppard was an engineera large handsome haughty man proud of his fair skin and blue eyes but more proud still of his integrity gertrude resembled her mother in her small build but her temper proud and unyielding she had from the coppards  george coppard was bitterly galled by his own poverty he became foreman of the engineers in the dockyard at sheerness mrs morelgertrudewas the second daughter she favoured her mother loved her mother best of all but she had the coppards clear defiant blue eyes and their broad brow she remembered to have hated her fathers overbearing manner towards her gentle humorous kindlysouled mother she remembered running over the breakwater at sheerness and finding the boat she remembered to have been petted and flattered by all the men when she had gone to the dockyard for she was a delicate rather proud child she remembered the funny old mistress whose assistant she had become whom she had loved to help in the private school and she still had the bible that john field had given her she used to walk home from chapel with john field when she was nineteen he was the son of a welltodo tradesman had been to college in london and was to devote himself to business  she could always recall in detail a september sunday afternoon when they had sat under the vine at the back of her fathers house the sun came through the chinks of the vineleaves and made beautiful patterns like a lace scarf falling on her and on him some of the leaves were clean yellow like yellow flat flowers  now sit still he had cried now your hair i dont know what it is like its as bright as copper and gold as red as burnt copper and it has gold threads where the sun shines on it fancy their saying its brown your mother calls it mousecolour  she had met his brilliant eyes but her clear face scarcely showed the elation which rose within her  but you say you dont like business she pursued  i dont i hate it he cried hotly  and you would like to go into the ministry she half implored  i should i should love it if i thought i could make a firstrate preacher  then why dont youwhy dont you her voice rang with defiance if i were a man nothing would stop me  she held her head erect he was rather timid before her  but my fathers so stiffnecked he means to put me into the business and i know hell do it  but if youre a man she had cried  being a man isnt everything he replied frowning with puzzled helplessness  now as she moved about her work at the bottoms with some experience of what being a man meant she knew that it was not everything  at twenty owing to her health she had left sheerness her father had retired home to nottingham john fields father had been ruined the son had gone as a teacher in norwood she did not hear of him until two years later she made determined inquiry he had married his landlady a woman of forty a widow with property  and still mrs morel preserved john fields bible she did not now believe him to bewell she understood pretty well what he might or might not have been so she preserved his bible and kept his memory intact in her heart for her own sake to her dying day for thirtyfive years she did not speak of him  when she was twentythree years old she met at a christmas party a young man from the erewash valley morel was then twentyseven years old he was well setup erect and very smart he had wavy black hair that shone again and a vigorous black beard that had never been shaved his cheeks were ruddy and his red moist mouth was noticeable because he laughed so often and so heartily he had that rare thing a rich ringing laugh gertrude coppard had watched him fascinated he was so full of colour and animation his voice ran so easily into comic grotesque he was so ready and so pleasant with everybody her own father had a rich fund of humour but it was satiric this mans was different soft nonintellectual warm a kind of gambolling  she herself was opposite she had a curious receptive mind which found much pleasure and amusement in listening to other folk she was clever in leading folk to talk she loved ideas and was considered very intellectual what she liked most of all was an argument on religion or philosophy or politics with some educated man this she did not often enjoy so she always had people tell her about themselves finding her pleasure so  in her person she was rather small and delicate with a large brow and dropping bunches of brown silk curls her blue eyes were very straight honest and searching she had the beautiful hands of the coppards her dress was always subdued she wore dark blue silk with a peculiar silver chain of silver scallops this and a heavy brooch of twisted gold was her only ornament she was still perfectly intact deeply religious and full of beautiful candour  walter morel seemed melted away before her she was to the miner that thing of mystery and fascination a lady when she spoke to him it was with a southern pronunciation and a purity of english which thrilled him to hear she watched him he danced well as if it were natural and joyous in him to dance his grandfather was a french refugee who had married an english barmaidif it had been a marriage gertrude coppard watched the young miner as he danced a certain subtle exultation like glamour in his movement and his face the flower of his body ruddy with tumbled black hair and laughing alike whatever partner he bowed above she thought him rather wonderful never having met anyone like him her father was to her the type of all men and george coppard proud in his bearing handsome and rather bitter who preferred theology in reading and who drew near in sympathy only to one man the apostle paul who was harsh in government and in familiarity ironic who ignored all sensuous pleasurehe was very different from the miner gertrude herself was rather contemptuous of dancing she had not the slightest inclination towards that accomplishment and had never learned even a roger de coverley she was puritan like her father highminded and really stern therefore the dusky golden softness of this mans sensuous flame of life that flowed off his flesh like the flame from a candle not baffled and gripped into incandescence by thought and spirit as her life was seemed to her something wonderful beyond her  he came and bowed above her a warmth radiated through her as if she had drunk wine  now do come and have this one wi me he said caressively its easy you know im pining to see you dance  she had told him before she could not dance she glanced at his humility and smiled her smile was very beautiful it moved the man so that he forgot everything  no i wont dance she said softly her words came clean and ringing  not knowing what he was doinghe often did the right thing by instincthe sat beside her inclining reverentially  but you mustnt miss your dance she reproved   nay i dont want to dance thatits not one as i care about  yet you invited me to it  he laughed very heartily at this  i never thought o that thart not long in taking the curl out of me  it was her turn to laugh quickly  you dont look as if youd come much uncurled she said  im like a pigs tail i curl because i canna help it he laughed rather boisterously  and you are a miner she exclaimed in surprise  yes i went down when i was ten  she looked at him in wondering dismay  when you were ten and wasnt it very hard she asked  you soon get used to it you live like th mice an you pop out at night to see whats going on  it makes me feel blind she frowned  like a moudiwarp he laughed yi an theres some chaps as does go round like moudiwarps he thrust his face forward in the blind snoutlike way of a mole seeming to sniff and peer for direction they dun though he protested naively tha niver seed such a way they get in but tha mun let me tae thee down some time an tha can see for thysen  she looked at him startled this was a new tract of life suddenly opened before her she realised the life of the miners hundreds of them toiling below earth and coming up at evening he seemed to her noble he risked his life daily and with gaiety she looked at him with a touch of appeal in her pure humility  shouldnt ter like it he asked tenderly appen not it ud dirty thee  she had never been theed and thoud before  the next christmas they were married and for three months she was perfectly happy for six months she was very happy  he had signed the pledge and wore the blue ribbon of a teetotaller he was nothing if not showy they lived she thought in his own house it was small but convenient enough and quite nicely furnished with solid worthy stuff that suited her honest soul the women her neighbours were rather foreign to her and morels mother and sisters were apt to sneer at her ladylike ways but she could perfectly well live by herself so long as she had her husband close  sometimes when she herself wearied of lovetalk she tried to open her heart seriously to him she saw him listen deferentially but without understanding this killed her efforts at a finer intimacy and she had flashes of fear sometimes he was restless of an evening it was not enough for him just to be near her she realised she was glad when he set himself to little jobs  he was a remarkably handy mancould make or mend anything so she would say  i do like that coalrake of your mothersit is small and natty  does ter my wench well i made that so i can make thee one  what why its a steel one  an what if it is tha slt hae one very similar if not exactly same  she did not mind the mess nor the hammering and noise he was busy and happy  but in the seventh month when she was brushing his sunday coat she felt papers in the breast pocket and seized with a sudden curiosity took them out to read he very rarely wore the frockcoat he was married in and it had not occurred to her before to feel curious concerning the papers they were the bills of the household furniture still unpaid  look here she said at night after he was washed and had had his dinner i found these in the pocket of your weddingcoat havent you settled the bills yet  no i havent had a chance  but you told me all was paid i had better go into nottingham on saturday and settle them i dont like sitting on another mans chairs and eating from an unpaid table  he did not answer  i can have your bankbook cant i  tha can hae it for what good itll be to thee  i thought she began he had told her he had a good bit of money left over but she realised it was no use asking questions she sat rigid with bitterness and indignation  the next day she went down to see his mother  didnt you buy the furniture for walter she asked  yes i did tartly retorted the elder woman  and how much did he give you to pay for it  the elder woman was stung with fine indignation  eighty pound if youre so keen on knowin she replied  eighty pounds but there are fortytwo pounds still owing  i cant help that  but where has it all gone  youll find all the papers i think if you lookbeside ten pound as he owed me an six pound as the wedding cost down here  six pounds echoed gertrude morel it seemed to her monstrous that after her own father had paid so heavily for her wedding six pounds more should have been squandered in eating and drinking at walters parents house at his expense  and how much has he sunk in his houses she asked  his houseswhich houses  gertrude morel went white to the lips he had told her the house he lived in and the next one was his own  i thought the house we live in she began  theyre my houses those two said the motherinlaw and not clear either its as much as i can do to keep the mortgage interest paid  gertrude sat white and silent she was her father now  then we ought to be paying you rent she said coldly  walter is paying me rent replied the mother  and what rent asked gertrude  six and six a week retorted the mother  it was more than the house was worth gertrude held her head erect looked straight before her  it is lucky to be you said the elder woman bitingly to have a husband as takes all the worry of the money and leaves you a free hand  the young wife was silent  she said very little to her husband but her manner had changed towards him something in her proud honourable soul had crystallised out hard as rock  when october came in she thought only of christmas two years ago at christmas she had met him last christmas she had married him this christmas she would bear him a child  you dont dance yourself do you missis asked her nearest neighbour in october when there was great talk of opening a dancingclass over the brick and tile inn at bestwood  noi never had the least inclination to mrs morel replied  fancy an how funny as you should ha married your mester you know hes quite a famous one for dancing  i didnt know he was famous laughed mrs morel  yea he is though why he ran that dancingclass in the miners arms clubroom for over five year  did he  yes he did the other woman was defiant an it was thronged every tuesday and thursday an satdayan there was carryinson accordin to all accounts  this kind of thing was gall and bitterness to mrs morel and she had a fair share of it the women did not spare her at first for she was superior though she could not help it  he began to be rather late in coming home  theyre working very late now arent they she said to her washerwoman  no later than they allers do i dont think but they stop to have their pint at ellens an they get talkin an there you are dinner stone coldan it serves em right  but mr morel does not take any drink  the woman dropped the clothes looked at mrs morel then went on with her work saying nothing  gertrude morel was very ill when the boy was born morel was good to her as good as gold but she felt very lonely miles away from her own people she felt lonely with him now and his presence only made it more intense  the boy was small and frail at first but he came on quickly he was a beautiful child with dark gold ringlets and darkblue eyes which changed gradually to a clear grey his mother loved him passionately he came just when her own bitterness of disillusion was hardest to bear when her faith in life was shaken and her soul felt dreary and lonely she made much of the child and the father was jealous  at last mrs morel despised her husband she turned to the child she turned from the father he had begun to neglect her the novelty of his own home was gone he had no grit she said bitterly to herself what he felt just at the minute that was all to him he could not abide by anything there was nothing at the back of all his show  there began a battle between the husband and wifea fearful bloody battle that ended only with the death of one she fought to make him undertake his own responsibilities to make him fulfill his obligations but he was too different from her his nature was purely sensuous and she strove to make him moral religious she tried to force him to face things he could not endure itit drove him out of his mind  while the baby was still tiny the fathers temper had become so irritable that it was not to be trusted the child had only to give a little trouble when the man began to bully a little more and the hard hands of the collier hit the baby then mrs morel loathed her husband loathed him for days and he went out and drank and she cared very little what he did only on his return she scathed him with her satire  the estrangement between them caused him knowingly or unknowingly grossly to offend her where he would not have done  william was only one year old and his mother was proud of him he was so pretty she was not well off now but her sisters kept the boy in clothes then with his little white hat curled with an ostrich feather and his white coat he was a joy to her the twining wisps of hair clustering round his head mrs morel lay listening one sunday morning to the chatter of the father and child downstairs then she dozed off when she came downstairs a great fire glowed in the grate the room was hot the breakfast was roughly laid and seated in his armchair against the chimneypiece sat morel rather timid and standing between his legs the childcropped like a sheep with such an odd round polllooking wondering at her and on a newspaper spread out upon the hearthrug a myriad of crescentshaped curls like the petals of a marigold scattered in the reddening firelight  mrs morel stood still it was her first baby she went very white and was unable to speak  what dost think o im morel laughed uneasily  she gripped her two fists lifted them and came forward morel shrank back  i could kill you i could she said she choked with rage her two fists uplifted  yer non want ter make a wench on im morel said in a frightened tone bending his head to shield his eyes from hers his attempt at laughter had vanished  the mother looked down at the jagged closeclipped head of her child she put her hands on his hair and stroked and fondled his head  ohmy boy she faltered her lip trembled her face broke and snatching up the child she buried her face in his shoulder and cried painfully she was one of those women who cannot cry whom it hurts as it hurts a man it was like ripping something out of her her sobbing  morel sat with his elbows on his knees his hands gripped together till the knuckles were white he gazed in the fire feeling almost stunned as if he could not breathe  presently she came to an end soothed the child and cleared away the breakfasttable she left the newspaper littered with curls spread upon the hearthrug at last her husband gathered it up and put it at the back of the fire she went about her work with closed mouth and very quiet morel was subdued he crept about wretchedly and his meals were a misery that day she spoke to him civilly and never alluded to what he had done but he felt something final had happened  afterwards she said she had been silly that the boys hair would have had to be cut sooner or later in the end she even brought herself to say to her husband it was just as well he had played barber when he did but she knew and morel knew that that act had caused something momentous to take place in her soul she remembered the scene all her life as one in which she had suffered the most intensely  this act of masculine clumsiness was the spear through the side of her love for morel before while she had striven against him bitterly she had fretted after him as if he had gone astray from her now she ceased to fret for his love he was an outsider to her this made life much more bearable  nevertheless she still continued to strive with him she still had her high moral sense inherited from generations of puritans it was now a religious instinct and she was almost a fanatic with him because she loved him or had loved him if he sinned she tortured him if he drank and lied was often a poltroon sometimes a knave she wielded the lash unmercifully  the pity was she was too much his opposite she could not be content with the little he might be she would have him the much that he ought to be so in seeking to make him nobler than he could be she destroyed him she injured and hurt and scarred herself but she lost none of her worth she also had the children  he drank rather heavily though not more than many miners and always beer so that whilst his health was affected it was never injured the weekend was his chief carouse he sat in the miners arms until turningout time every friday every saturday and every sunday evening on monday and tuesday he had to get up and reluctantly leave towards ten oclock sometimes he stayed at home on wednesday and thursday evenings or was only out for an hour he practically never had to miss work owing to his drinking  but although he was very steady at work his wages fell off he was blabmouthed a tonguewagger authority was hateful to him therefore he could only abuse the pitmanagers he would say in the palmerston  th gaffer come down to our stall this morning an e says you know walter this erell not do what about these props an i says to him why what art talkin about what dst mean about th props itll never do this ere e says youll be havin th roof in one o these days an i says thad better stan on a bit o clunch then an hold it up wi thy ead so e wor that mad e cossed an e swore an tother chaps they did laugh morel was a good mimic he imitated the managers fat squeaky voice with its attempt at good english  i shant have it walter who knows more about it me or you so i says ive niver fun out how much tha knows alfred itll appen carry thee ter bed an back  so morel would go on to the amusement of his boon companions and some of this would be true the pitmanager was not an educated man he had been a boy along with morel so that while the two disliked each other they more or less took each other for granted but alfred charlesworth did not forgive the butty these publichouse sayings consequently although morel was a good miner sometimes earning as much as five pounds a week when he married he came gradually to have worse and worse stalls where the coal was thin and hard to get and unprofitable  also in summer the pits are slack often on bright sunny mornings the men are seen trooping home again at ten eleven or twelve oclock no empty trucks stand at the pitmouth the women on the hillside look across as they shake the hearthrug against the fence and count the wagons the engine is taking along the line up the valley and the children as they come from school at dinnertime looking down the fields and seeing the wheels on the headstocks standing say  mintons knocked off my dadll be at home  and there is a sort of shadow over all women and children and men because money will be short at the end of the week  morel was supposed to give his wife thirty shillings a week to provide everythingrent food clothes clubs insurance doctors occasionally if he were flush he gave her thirtyfive but these occasions by no means balanced those when he gave her twentyfive in winter with a decent stall the miner might earn fifty or fiftyfive shillings a week then he was happy on friday night saturday and sunday he spent royally getting rid of his sovereign or thereabouts and out of so much he scarcely spared the children an extra penny or bought them a pound of apples it all went in drink in the bad times matters were more worrying but he was not so often drunk so that mrs morel used to say  im not sure i wouldnt rather be short for when hes flush there isnt a minute of peace  if he earned forty shillings he kept ten from thirtyfive he kept five from thirtytwo he kept four from twentyeight he kept three from twentyfour he kept two from twenty he kept oneandsix from eighteen he kept a shilling from sixteen he kept sixpence he never saved a penny and he gave his wife no opportunity of saving instead she had occasionally to pay his debts not publichouse debts for those never were passed on to the women but debts when he had bought a canary or a fancy walkingstick  at the wakes time morel was working badly and mrs morel was trying to save against her confinement so it galled her bitterly to think he should be out taking his pleasure and spending money whilst she remained at home harassed there were two days holiday on the tuesday morning morel rose early he was in good spirits quite early before six oclock she heard him whistling away to himself downstairs he had a pleasant way of whistling lively and musical he nearly always whistled hymns he had been a choirboy with a beautiful voice and had taken solos in southwell cathedral his morning whistling alone betrayed it  his wife lay listening to him tinkering away in the garden his whistling ringing out as he sawed and hammered away it always gave her a sense of warmth and peace to hear him thus as she lay in bed the children not yet awake in the bright early morning happy in his mans fashion  at nine oclock while the children with bare legs and feet were sitting playing on the sofa and the mother was washing up he came in from his carpentry his sleeves rolled up his waistcoat hanging open he was still a goodlooking man with black wavy hair and a large black moustache his face was perhaps too much inflamed and there was about him a look almost of peevishness but now he was jolly he went straight to the sink where his wife was washing up  what are thee there he said boisterously sluthe off an let me wesh mysen  you may wait till ive finished said his wife  oh mun i an what if i shonna  this goodhumoured threat amused mrs morel  then you can go and wash yourself in the softwater tub  ha i can an a tha mucky little ussy  with which he stood watching her a moment then went away to wait for her  when he chose he could still make himself again a real gallant usually he preferred to go out with a scarf round his neck now however he made a toilet there seemed so much gusto in the way he puffed and swilled as he washed himself so much alacrity with which he hurried to the mirror in the kitchen and bending because it was too low for him scrupulously parted his wet black hair that it irritated mrs morel he put on a turndown collar a black bow and wore his sunday tailcoat as such he looked spruce and what his clothes would not do his instinct for making the most of his good looks would  at halfpast nine jerry purdy came to call for his pal jerry was morels bosom friend and mrs morel disliked him he was a tall thin man with a rather foxy face the kind of face that seems to lack eyelashes he walked with a stiff brittle dignity as if his head were on a wooden spring his nature was cold and shrewd generous where he intended to be generous he seemed to be very fond of morel and more or less to take charge of him  mrs morel hated him she had known his wife who had died of consumption and who had at the end conceived such a violent dislike of her husband that if he came into her room it caused her haemorrhage none of which jerry had seemed to mind and now his eldest daughter a girl of fifteen kept a poor house for him and looked after the two younger children  a mean wizzenhearted stick mrs morel said of him  ive never known jerry mean in my life protested morel a openerhanded and more freer chap you couldnt find anywhere accordin to my knowledge  openhanded to you retorted mrs morel but his fist is shut tight enough to his children poor things  poor things and what for are they poor things i should like to know  but mrs morel would not be appeased on jerrys score  the subject of argument was seen craning his thin neck over the scullery curtain he caught mrs morels eye  mornin missis mester in  yeshe is  jerry entered unasked and stood by the kitchen doorway he was not invited to sit down but stood there coolly asserting the rights of men and husbands  a nice day he said to mrs morel  yes  grand out this morninggrand for a walk  do you mean youre going for a walk she asked  yes we mean walkin to nottingham he replied  hm  the two men greeted each other both glad jerry however full of assurance morel rather subdued afraid to seem too jubilant in presence of his wife but he laced his boots quickly with spirit they were going for a tenmile walk across the fields to nottingham climbing the hillside from the bottoms they mounted gaily into the morning at the moon and stars they had their first drink then on to the old spot then a long five miles of drought to carry them into bulwell to a glorious pint of bitter but they stayed in a field with some haymakers whose gallon bottle was full so that when they came in sight of the city morel was sleepy the town spread upwards before them smoking vaguely in the midday glare fridging the crest away to the south with spires and factory bulks and chimneys in the last field morel lay down under an oak tree and slept soundly for over an hour when he rose to go forward he felt queer  the two had dinner in the meadows with jerrys sister then repaired to the punch bowl where they mixed in the excitement of pigeonracing morel never in his life played cards considering them as having some occult malevolent powerthe devils pictures he called them but he was a master of skittles and of dominoes he took a challenge from a newark man on skittles all the men in the old long bar took sides betting either one way or the other morel took off his coat jerry held the hat containing the money the men at the tables watched some stood with their mugs in their hands morel felt his big wooden ball carefully then launched it he played havoc among the ninepins and won half a crown which restored him to solvency  by seven oclock the two were in good condition they caught the 730 train home  in the afternoon the bottoms was intolerable every inhabitant remaining was out of doors the women in twos and threes bareheaded and in white aprons gossiped in the alley between the blocks men having a rest between drinks sat on their heels and talked the place smelled stale the slate roofs glistered in the arid heat  mrs morel took the little girl down to the brook in the meadows which were not more than two hundred yards away the water ran quickly over stones and broken pots mother and child leaned on the rail of the old sheepbridge watching up at the dippinghole at the other end of the meadow mrs morel could see the naked forms of boys flashing round the deep yellow water or an occasional bright figure dart glittering over the blackish stagnant meadow she knew william was at the dippinghole and it was the dread of her life lest he should get drowned annie played under the tall old hedge picking up alder cones that she called currants the child required much attention and the flies were teasing  the children were put to bed at seven oclock then she worked awhile  when walter morel and jerry arrived at bestwood they felt a load off their minds a railway journey no longer impended so they could put the finishing touches to a glorious day they entered the nelson with the satisfaction of returned travellers  the next day was a workday and the thought of it put a damper on the mens spirits most of them moreover had spent their money some were already rolling dismally home to sleep in preparation for the morrow mrs morel listening to their mournful singing went indoors nine oclock passed and ten and still the pair had not returned on a doorstep somewhere a man was singing loudly in a drawl lead kindly light mrs morel was always indignant with the drunken men that they must sing that hymn when they got maudlin  as if genevieve werent good enough she said  the kitchen was full of the scent of boiled herbs and hops on the hob a large black saucepan steamed slowly mrs morel took a panchion a great bowl of thick red earth streamed a heap of white sugar into the bottom and then straining herself to the weight was pouring in the liquor  just then morel came in he had been very jolly in the nelson but coming home had grown irritable he had not quite got over the feeling of irritability and pain after having slept on the ground when he was so hot and a bad conscience afflicted him as he neared the house he did not know he was angry but when the garden gate resisted his attempts to open it he kicked it and broke the latch he entered just as mrs morel was pouring the infusion of herbs out of the saucepan swaying slightly he lurched against the table the boiling liquor pitched mrs morel started back  good gracious she cried coming home in his drunkenness  comin home in his what he snarled his hat over his eye  suddenly her blood rose in a jet  say youre not drunk she flashed  she had put down her saucepan and was stirring the sugar into the beer he dropped his two hands heavily on the table and thrust his face forwards at her  say youre not drunk he repeated why nobody but a nasty little bitch like you ud ave such a thought  he thrust his face forward at her  theres money to bezzle with if theres money for nothing else  ive not spent a twoshillin bit this day he said  you dont get as drunk as a lord on nothing she replied and she cried flashing into sudden fury if youve been sponging on your beloved jerry why let him look after his children for they need it  its a lie its a lie shut your face woman  they were now at battlepitch each forgot everything save the hatred of the other and the battle between them she was fiery and furious as he they went on till he called her a liar  no she cried starting up scarce able to breathe dont call me thatyou the most despicable liar that ever walked in shoeleather she forced the last words out of suffocated lungs  youre a liar he yelled banging the table with his fist youre a liar youre a liar  she stiffened herself with clenched fists  the house is filthy with you she cried  then get out on itits mine get out on it he shouted its me as brings th money whoam not thee its my house not thine then ger out ontger out ont  and i would she cried suddenly shaken into tears of impotence ah wouldnt i wouldnt i have gone long ago but for those children ay havent i repented not going years ago when id only the onesuddenly drying into rage do you think its for you i stopdo you think id stop one minute for you  go then he shouted beside himself go  no she faced round no she cried loudly you shant have it all your own way you shant do all you like ive got those children to see to my word she laughed i should look well to leave them to you  go he cried thickly lifting his fist he was afraid of her go  i should be only too glad i should laugh laugh my lord if i could get away from you she replied  he came up to her his red face with its bloodshot eyes thrust forward and gripped her arms she cried in fear of him struggled to be free coming slightly to himself panting he pushed her roughly to the outer door and thrust her forth slotting the bolt behind her with a bang then he went back into the kitchen dropped into his armchair his head bursting full of blood sinking between his knees thus he dipped gradually into a stupor from exhaustion and intoxication  the moon was high and magnificent in the august night mrs morel seared with passion shivered to find herself out there in a great white light that fell cold on her and gave a shock to her inflamed soul she stood for a few moments helplessly staring at the glistening great rhubarb leaves near the door then she got the air into her breast she walked down the garden path trembling in every limb while the child boiled within her for a while she could not control her consciousness mechanically she went over the last scene then over it again certain phrases certain moments coming each time like a brand redhot down on her soul and each time she enacted again the past hour each time the brand came down at the same points till the mark was burnt in and the pain burnt out and at last she came to herself she must have been half an hour in this delirious condition then the presence of the night came again to her she glanced round in fear she had wandered to the side garden where she was walking up and down the path beside the currant bushes under the long wall the garden was a narrow strip bounded from the road that cut transversely between the blocks by a thick thorn hedge  she hurried out of the side garden to the front where she could stand as if in an immense gulf of white light the moon streaming high in face of her the moonlight standing up from the hills in front and filling the valley where the bottoms crouched almost blindingly there panting and half weeping in reaction from the stress she murmured to herself over and over again the nuisance the nuisance  she became aware of something about her with an effort she roused herself to see what it was that penetrated her consciousness the tall white lilies were reeling in the moonlight and the air was charged with their perfume as with a presence mrs morel gasped slightly in fear she touched the big pallid flowers on their petals then shivered they seemed to be stretching in the moonlight she put her hand into one white bin the gold scarcely showed on her fingers by moonlight she bent down to look at the binful of yellow pollen but it only appeared dusky then she drank a deep draught of the scent it almost made her dizzy  mrs morel leaned on the garden gate looking out and she lost herself awhile she did not know what she thought except for a slight feeling of sickness and her consciousness in the child herself melted out like scent into the shiny pale air after a time the child too melted with her in the mixingpot of moonlight and she rested with the hills and lilies and houses all swum together in a kind of swoon  when she came to herself she was tired for sleep languidly she looked about her the clumps of white phlox seemed like bushes spread with linen a moth ricochetted over them and right across the garden following it with her eye roused her a few whiffs of the raw strong scent of phlox invigorated her she passed along the path hesitating at the white rosebush it smelled sweet and simple she touched the white ruffles of the roses their fresh scent and cool soft leaves reminded her of the morningtime and sunshine she was very fond of them but she was tired and wanted to sleep in the mysterious outofdoors she felt forlorn  there was no noise anywhere evidently the children had not been wakened or had gone to sleep again a train three miles away roared across the valley the night was very large and very strange stretching its hoary distances infinitely and out of the silvergrey fog of darkness came sounds vague and hoarse a corncrake not far off sound of a train like a sigh and distant shouts of men  her quietened heart beginning to beat quickly again she hurried down the side garden to the back of the house softly she lifted the latch the door was still bolted and hard against her she rapped gently waited then rapped again she must not rouse the children nor the neighbours he must be asleep and he would not wake easily her heart began to burn to be indoors she clung to the doorhandle now it was cold she would take a chill and in her present condition  putting her apron over her head and her arms she hurried again to the side garden to the window of the kitchen leaning on the sill she could just see under the blind her husbands arms spread out on the table and his black head on the board he was sleeping with his face lying on the table something in his attitude made her feel tired of things the lamp was burning smokily she could tell by the copper colour of the light she tapped at the window more and more noisily almost it seemed as if the glass would break still he did not wake up  after vain efforts she began to shiver partly from contact with the stone and from exhaustion fearful always for the unborn child she wondered what she could do for warmth she went down to the coalhouse where there was an old hearthrug she had carried out for the ragman the day before this she wrapped over her shoulders it was warm if grimy then she walked up and down the garden path peeping every now and then under the blind knocking and telling herself that in the end the very strain of his position must wake him  at last after about an hour she rapped long and low at the window gradually the sound penetrated to him when in despair she had ceased to tap she saw him stir then lift his face blindly the labouring of his heart hurt him into consciousness she rapped imperatively at the window he started awake instantly she saw his fists set and his eyes glare he had not a grain of physical fear if it had been twenty burglars he would have gone blindly for them he glared round bewildered but prepared to fight  open the door walter she said coldly  his hands relaxed it dawned on him what he had done his head dropped sullen and dogged she saw him hurry to the door heard the bolt chock he tried the latch it openedand there stood the silvergrey night fearful to him after the tawny light of the lamp he hurried back  when mrs morel entered she saw him almost running through the door to the stairs he had ripped his collar off his neck in his haste to be gone ere she came in and there it lay with bursten buttonholes it made her angry  she warmed and soothed herself in her weariness forgetting everything she moved about at the little tasks that remained to be done set his breakfast rinsed his pitbottle put his pitclothes on the hearth to warm set his pitboots beside them put him out a clean scarf and snapbag and two apples raked the fire and went to bed he was already dead asleep his narrow black eyebrows were drawn up in a sort of peevish misery into his forehead while his cheeks downstrokes and his sulky mouth seemed to be saying i dont care who you are nor what you are i shall have my own way  mrs morel knew him too well to look at him as she unfastened her brooch at the mirror she smiled faintly to see her face all smeared with the yellow dust of lilies she brushed it off and at last lay down for some time her mind continued snapping and jetting sparks but she was asleep before her husband awoke from the first sleep of his drunkenness    chapter ii  the birth of paul and another battle  after such a scene as the last walter morel was for some days abashed and ashamed but he soon regained his old bullying indifference yet there was a slight shrinking a diminishing in his assurance physically even he shrank and his fine full presence waned he never grew in the least stout so that as he sank from his erect assertive bearing his physique seemed to contract along with his pride and moral strength  but now he realised how hard it was for his wife to drag about at her work and his sympathy quickened by penitence hastened forward with his help he came straight home from the pit and stayed in at evening till friday and then he could not remain at home but he was back again by ten oclock almost quite sober  he always made his own breakfast being a man who rose early and had plenty of time he did not as some miners do drag his wife out of bed at six oclock at five sometimes earlier he woke got straight out of bed and went downstairs when she could not sleep his wife lay waiting for this time as for a period of peace the only real rest seemed to be when he was out of the house  he went downstairs in his shirt and then struggled into his pittrousers which were left on the hearth to warm all night there was always a fire because mrs morel raked and the first sound in the house was the bang bang of the poker against the raker as morel smashed the remainder of the coal to make the kettle which was filled and left on the hob finally boil his cup and knife and fork all he wanted except just the food was laid ready on the table on a newspaper then he got his breakfast made the tea packed the bottom of the doors with rugs to shut out the draught piled a big fire and sat down to an hour of joy he toasted his bacon on a fork and caught the drops of fat on his bread then he put the rasher on his thick slice of bread and cut off chunks with a claspknife poured his tea into his saucer and was happy with his family about meals were never so pleasant he loathed a fork it is a modern introduction which has still scarcely reached common people what morel preferred was a claspknife then in solitude he ate and drank often sitting in cold weather on a little stool with his back to the warm chimneypiece his food on the fender his cup on the hearth and then he read the last nights newspaperwhat of it he couldspelling it over laboriously he preferred to keep the blinds down and the candle lit even when it was daylight it was the habit of the mine  at a quarter to six he rose cut two thick slices of bread and butter and put them in the white calico snapbag he filled his tin bottle with tea cold tea without milk or sugar was the drink he preferred for the pit then he pulled off his shirt and put on his pitsinglet a vest of thick flannel cut low round the neck and with short sleeves like a chemise  then he went upstairs to his wife with a cup of tea because she was ill and because it occurred to him  ive brought thee a cup o tea lass he said  well you neednt for you know i dont like it she replied  drink it up itll pop thee off to sleep again  she accepted the tea it pleased him to see her take it and sip it  ill back my life theres no sugar in she said  yitheres one big un he replied injured  its a wonder she said sipping again  she had a winsome face when her hair was loose he loved her to grumble at him in this manner he looked at her again and went without any sort of leavetaking he never took more than two slices of bread and butter to eat in the pit so an apple or an orange was a treat to him he always liked it when she put one out for him he tied a scarf round his neck put on his great heavy boots his coat with the big pocket that carried his snapbag and his bottle of tea and went forth into the fresh morning air closing without locking the door behind him he loved the early morning and the walk across the fields so he appeared at the pittop often with a stalk from the hedge between his teeth which he chewed all day to keep his mouth moist down the mine feeling quite as happy as when he was in the field  later when the time for the baby grew nearer he would bustle round in his slovenly fashion poking out the ashes rubbing the fireplace sweeping the house before he went to work then feeling very selfrighteous he went upstairs  now im cleaned up for thee thas no casions ter stir a peg all day but sit and read thy books  which made her laugh in spite of her indignation  and the dinner cooks itself she answered  eh i know nowt about th dinner  youd know if there werent any  ay appen so he answered departing  when she got downstairs she would find the house tidy but dirty she could not rest until she had thoroughly cleaned so she went down to the ashpit with her dustpan mrs kirk spying her would contrive to have to go to her own coalplace at that minute then across the wooden fence she would call  so you keep wagging on then  ay answered mrs morel deprecatingly theres nothing else for it  have you seen hose called a very small woman from across the road it was mrs anthony a blackhaired strange little body who always wore a brown velvet dress tight fitting  i havent said mrs morel  eh i wish hed come ive got a copperful of clothes an im sure i heered his bell  hark hes at the end  the two women looked down the alley at the end of the bottoms a man stood in a sort of oldfashioned trap bending over bundles of creamcoloured stuff while a cluster of women held up their arms to him some with bundles mrs anthony herself had a heap of creamy undyed stockings hanging over her arm  ive done ten dozen this week she said proudly to mrs morel  ttt went the other i dont know how you can find time  eh said mrs anthony you can find time if you make time  i dont know how you do it said mrs morel and how much shall you get for those many  tuppencehapenny a dozen replied the other  well said mrs morel id starve before id sit down and seam twentyfour stockings for twopence hapenny  oh i dont know said mrs anthony you can rip along with em  hose was coming along ringing his bell women were waiting at the yardends with their seamed stockings hanging over their arms the man a common fellow made jokes with them tried to swindle them and bullied them mrs morel went up her yard disdainfully  it was an understood thing that if one woman wanted her neighbour she should put the poker in the fire and bang at the back of the fireplace which as the fires were back to back would make a great noise in the adjoining house one morning mrs kirk mixing a pudding nearly started out of her skin as she heard the thud thud in her grate with her hands all floury she rushed to the fence  did you knock mrs morel  if you wouldnt mind mrs kirk  mrs kirk climbed on to her copper got over the wall on to mrs morels copper and ran in to her neighbour  eh dear how are you feeling she cried in concern  you might fetch mrs bower said mrs morel  mrs kirk went into the yard lifted up her strong shrill voice and called  aggieaggie  the sound was heard from one end of the bottoms to the other at last aggie came running up and was sent for mrs bower whilst mrs kirk left her pudding and stayed with her neighbour  mrs morel went to bed mrs kirk had annie and william for dinner mrs bower fat and waddling bossed the house  hash some cold meat up for the masters dinner and make him an applecharlotte pudding said mrs morel  he may go without pudding this day said mrs bower  morel was not as a rule one of the first to appear at the bottom of the pit ready to come up some men were there before four oclock when the whistle blew looseall but morel whose stall a poor one was at this time about a mile and a half away from the bottom worked usually till the first mate stopped then he finished also this day however the miner was sick of the work at two oclock he looked at his watch by the light of the green candlehe was in a safe workingand again at halfpast two he was hewing at a piece of rock that was in the way for the next days work as he sat on his heels or kneeled giving hard blows with his pick uszzauszza he went  shall ter finish sorry cried barker his fellow butty  finish niver while the world stands growled morel  and he went on striking he was tired  its a heartbreaking job said barker  but morel was too exasperated at the end of his tether to answer still he struck and hacked with all his might  tha might as well leave it walter said barker itll do tomorrow without thee hackin thy guts out  ill lay no b finger on this tomorrow isrel cried morel  oh well if tha wunna somebody elsell hae to said israel  then morel continued to strike  heyup thereloosea cried the men leaving the next stall  morel continued to strike  thall happen catch me up said barker departing  when he had gone morel left alone felt savage he had not finished his job he had overworked himself into a frenzy rising wet with sweat he threw his tool down pulled on his coat blew out his candle took his lamp and went down the main road the lights of the other men went swinging there was a hollow sound of many voices it was a long heavy tramp underground  he sat at the bottom of the pit where the great drops of water fell plash many colliers were waiting their turns to go up talking noisily morel gave his answers short and disagreeable  its rainin sorry said old giles who had had the news from the top  morel found one comfort he had his old umbrella which he loved in the lamp cabin at last he took his stand on the chair and was at the top in a moment then he handed in his lamp and got his umbrella which he had bought at an auction for oneandsix he stood on the edge of the pitbank for a moment looking out over the fields grey rain was falling the trucks stood full of wet bright coal water ran down the sides of the waggons over the white cw and co colliers walking indifferent to the rain were streaming down the line and up the field a grey dismal host morel put up his umbrella and took pleasure from the peppering of the drops thereon  all along the road to bestwood the miners tramped wet and grey and dirty but their red mouths talking with animation morel also walked with a gang but he said nothing he frowned peevishly as he went many men passed into the prince of wales or into ellens morel feeling sufficiently disagreeable to resist temptation trudged along under the dripping trees that overhung the park wall and down the mud of greenhill lane  mrs morel lay in bed listening to the rain and the feet of the colliers from minton their voices and the bang bang of the gates as they went through the stile up the field  theres some herb beer behind the pantry door she said th masterll want a drink if he doesnt stop  but he was late so she concluded he had called for a drink since it was raining what did he care about the child or her  she was very ill when her children were born  what is it she asked feeling sick to death  a boy  and she took consolation in that the thought of being the mother of men was warming to her heart she looked at the child it had blue eyes and a lot of fair hair and was bonny her love came up hot in spite of everything she had it in bed with her  morel thinking nothing dragged his way up the garden path wearily and angrily he closed his umbrella and stood it in the sink then he sluthered his heavy boots into the kitchen mrs bower appeared in the inner doorway  well she said shes about as bad as she can be its a boy childt  the miner grunted put his empty snapbag and his tin bottle on the dresser went back into the scullery and hung up his coat then came and dropped into his chair  han yer got a drink he asked  the woman went into the pantry there was heard the pop of a cork she set the mug with a little disgusted rap on the table before morel he drank gasped wiped his big moustache on the end of his scarf drank gasped and lay back in his chair the woman would not speak to him again she set his dinner before him and went upstairs  was that the master asked mrs morel  ive gave him his dinner replied mrs bower  after he had sat with his arms on the tablehe resented the fact that mrs bower put no cloth on for him and gave him a little plate instead of a fullsized dinnerplatehe began to eat the fact that his wife was ill that he had another boy was nothing to him at that moment he was too tired he wanted his dinner he wanted to sit with his arms lying on the board he did not like having mrs bower about the fire was too small to please him  after he had finished his meal he sat for twenty minutes then he stoked up a big fire then in his stockinged feet he went reluctantly upstairs it was a struggle to face his wife at this moment and he was tired his face was black and smeared with sweat his singlet had dried again soaking the dirt in he had a dirty woollen scarf round his throat so he stood at the foot of the bed  well how are ter then he asked  i sll be all right she answered  hm  he stood at a loss what to say next he was tired and this bother was rather a nuisance to him and he didnt quite know where he was  a lad tha says he stammered  she turned down the sheet and showed the child  bless him he murmured which made her laugh because he blessed by rotepretending paternal emotion which he did not feel just then  go now she said  i will my lass he answered turning away  dismissed he wanted to kiss her but he dared not she half wanted him to kiss her but could not bring herself to give any sign she only breathed freely when he was gone out of the room again leaving behind him a faint smell of pitdirt  mrs morel had a visit every day from the congregational clergyman mr heaton was young and very poor his wife had died at the birth of his first baby so he remained alone in the manse he was a bachelor of arts of cambridge very shy and no preacher mrs morel was fond of him and he depended on her for hours he talked to her when she was well he became the godparent of the child  occasionally the minister stayed to tea with mrs morel then she laid the cloth early got out her best cups with a little green rim and hoped morel would not come too soon indeed if he stayed for a pint she would not mind this day she had always two dinners to cook because she believed children should have their chief meal at midday whereas morel needed his at five oclock so mr heaton would hold the baby whilst mrs morel beat up a batterpudding or peeled the potatoes and he watching her all the time would discuss his next sermon his ideas were quaint and fantastic she brought him judiciously to earth it was a discussion of the wedding at cana  when he changed the water into wine at cana he said that is a symbol that the ordinary life even the blood of the married husband and wife which had before been uninspired like water became filled with the spirit and was as wine because when love enters the whole spiritual constitution of a man changes is filled with the holy ghost and almost his form is altered  mrs morel thought to herself  yes poor fellow his young wife is dead that is why he makes his love into the holy ghost  they were halfway down their first cup of tea when they heard the sluther of pitboots  good gracious exclaimed mrs morel in spite of herself  the minister looked rather scared morel entered he was feeling rather savage he nodded a how dyer do to the clergyman who rose to shake hands with him  nay said morel showing his hand look thee at it tha niver wants ter shake hands wi a hand like that does ter theres too much pickhaft and shoveldirt on it  the minister flushed with confusion and sat down again mrs morel rose carried out the steaming saucepan morel took off his coat dragged his armchair to table and sat down heavily  are you tired asked the clergyman  tired i ham that replied morel you dont know what it is to be tired as im tired  no replied the clergyman  why look yer ere said the miner showing the shoulders of his singlet its a bit dry now but its wet as a clout with sweat even yet feel it  goodness cried mrs morel mr heaton doesnt want to feel your nasty singlet  the clergyman put out his hand gingerly  no perhaps he doesnt said morel but its all come out of me whether or not an ivry day alike my singlets wringin wet avent you got a drink missis for a man when he comes home barkled up from the pit  you know you drank all the beer said mrs morel pouring out his tea  an was there no more to be got turning to the clergymana man gets that caked up wi th dust you knowthat clogged up down a coalmine he needs a drink when he comes home  i am sure he does said the clergyman  but its ten to one if theres owt for him  theres waterand theres tea said mrs morel  water its not water asll clear his throat  he poured out a saucerful of tea blew it and sucked it up through his great black moustache sighing afterwards then he poured out another saucerful and stood his cup on the table  my cloth said mrs morel putting it on a plate  a man as comes home as i do s too tired to care about cloths said morel  pity exclaimed his wife sarcastically  the room was full of the smell of meat and vegetables and pitclothes  he leaned over to the minister his great moustache thrust forward his mouth very red in his black face  mr heaton he said a man as has been down the black hole all day dingin away at a coalface yi a sight harder than that wall  neednt make a moan of it put in mrs morel  she hated her husband because whenever he had an audience he whined and played for sympathy william sitting nursing the baby hated him with a boys hatred for false sentiment and for the stupid treatment of his mother annie had never liked him she merely avoided him  when the minister had gone mrs morel looked at her cloth  a fine mess she said  dost think im goin to sit wi my arms danglin cos thas got a parson for tea wi thee he bawled  they were both angry but she said nothing the baby began to cry and mrs morel picking up a saucepan from the hearth accidentally knocked annie on the head whereupon the girl began to whine and morel to shout at her in the midst of this pandemonium william looked up at the big glazed text over the mantelpiece and read distinctly  god bless our home  whereupon mrs morel trying to soothe the baby jumped up rushed at him boxed his ears saying  what are you putting in for  and then she sat down and laughed till tears ran over her cheeks while william kicked the stool he had been sitting on and morel growled  i canna see what there is so much to laugh at  one evening directly after the parsons visit feeling unable to bear herself after another display from her husband she took annie and the baby and went out morel had kicked william and the mother would never forgive him  she went over the sheepbridge and across a corner of the meadow to the cricketground the meadows seemed one space of ripe evening light whispering with the distant millrace she sat on a seat under the alders in the cricketground and fronted the evening before her level and solid spread the big green cricketfield like the bed of a sea of light children played in the bluish shadow of the pavilion many rooks high up came cawing home across the softlywoven sky they stooped in a long curve down into the golden glow concentrating cawing wheeling like black flakes on a slow vortex over a tree clump that made a dark boss among the pasture  a few gentlemen were practising and mrs morel could hear the chock of the ball and the voices of men suddenly roused could see the white forms of men shifting silently over the green upon which already the under shadows were smouldering away at the grange one side of the haystacks was lit up the other sides bluegrey a waggon of sheaves rocked small across the melting yellow light  the sun was going down every open evening the hills of derbyshire were blazed over with red sunset mrs morel watched the sun sink from the glistening sky leaving a soft flowerblue overhead while the western space went red as if all the fire had swum down there leaving the bell cast flawless blue the mountainash berries across the field stood fierily out from the dark leaves for a moment a few shocks of corn in a corner of the fallow stood up as if alive she imagined them bowing perhaps her son would be a joseph in the east a mirrored sunset floated pink opposite the wests scarlet the big haystacks on the hillside that butted into the glare went cold  with mrs morel it was one of those still moments when the small frets vanish and the beauty of things stands out and she had the peace and the strength to see herself now and again a swallow cut close to her now and again annie came up with a handful of aldercurrants the baby was restless on his mothers knee clambering with his hands at the light  mrs morel looked down at him she had dreaded this baby like a catastrophe because of her feeling for her husband and now she felt strangely towards the infant her heart was heavy because of the child almost as if it were unhealthy or malformed yet it seemed quite well but she noticed the peculiar knitting of the babys brows and the peculiar heaviness of its eyes as if it were trying to understand something that was pain she felt when she looked at her childs dark brooding pupils as if a burden were on her heart  he looks as if he was thinking about somethingquite sorrowful said mrs kirk  suddenly looking at him the heavy feeling at the mothers heart melted into passionate grief she bowed over him and a few tears shook swiftly out of her very heart the baby lifted his fingers  my lamb she cried softly  and at that moment she felt in some far inner place of her soul that she and her husband were guilty  the baby was looking up at her it had blue eyes like her own but its look was heavy steady as if it had realised something that had stunned some point of its soul  in her arms lay the delicate baby its deep blue eyes always looking up at her unblinking seemed to draw her innermost thoughts out of her she no longer loved her husband she had not wanted this child to come and there it lay in her arms and pulled at her heart she felt as if the navel string that had connected its frail little body with hers had not been broken a wave of hot love went over her to the infant she held it close to her face and breast with all her force with all her soul she would make up to it for having brought it into the world unloved she would love it all the more now it was here carry it in her love its clear knowing eyes gave her pain and fear did it know all about her when it lay under her heart had it been listening then was there a reproach in the look she felt the marrow melt in her bones with fear and pain  once more she was aware of the sun lying red on the rim of the hill opposite she suddenly held up the child in her hands  look she said look my pretty  she thrust the infant forward to the crimson throbbing sun almost with relief she saw him lift his little fist then she put him to her bosom again ashamed almost of her impulse to give him back again whence he came  if he lives she thought to herself what will become of himwhat will he be  her heart was anxious  i will call him paul she said suddenly she knew not why  after a while she went home a fine shadow was flung over the deep green meadow darkening all  as she expected she found the house empty but morel was home by ten oclock and that day at least ended peacefully  walter morel was at this time exceedingly irritable his work seemed to exhaust him when he came home he did not speak civilly to anybody if the fire were rather low he bullied about that he grumbled about his dinner if the children made a chatter he shouted at them in a way that made their mothers blood boil and made them hate him  on the friday he was not home by eleven oclock the baby was unwell and was restless crying if he were put down mrs morel tired to death and still weak was scarcely under control  i wish the nuisance would come she said wearily to herself  the child at last sank down to sleep in her arms she was too tired to carry him to the cradle  but ill say nothing whatever time he comes she said it only works me up i wont say anything but i know if he does anything itll make my blood boil she added to herself  she sighed hearing him coming as if it were something she could not bear he taking his revenge was nearly drunk she kept her head bent over the child as he entered not wishing to see him but it went through her like a flash of hot fire when in passing he lurched against the dresser setting the tins rattling and clutched at the white pot knobs for support he hung up his hat and coat then returned stood glowering from a distance at her as she sat bowed over the child  is there nothing to eat in the house he asked insolently as if to a servant in certain stages of his intoxication he affected the clipped mincing speech of the towns mrs morel hated him most in this condition  you know what there is in the house she said so coldly it sounded impersonal  he stood and glared at her without moving a muscle  i asked a civil question and i expect a civil answer he said affectedly  and you got it she said still ignoring him  he glowered again then he came unsteadily forward he leaned on the table with one hand and with the other jerked at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread the drawer stuck because he pulled sideways in a temper he dragged it so that it flew out bodily and spoons forks knives a hundred metallic things splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor the baby gave a little convulsed start  what are you doing clumsy drunken fool the mother cried  then tha should get the flamin thing thysen tha should get up like other women have to an wait on a man  wait on youwait on you she cried yes i see myself  yis an ill learn thee thas got to wait on me yes tha shlt wait on me  never milord id wait on a dog at the door first  whatwhat  he was trying to fit in the drawer at her last speech he turned round his face was crimson his eyes bloodshot he stared at her one silent second in threat  ph she went quickly in contempt  he jerked at the drawer in his excitement it fell cut sharply on his shin and on the reflex he flung it at her  one of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer crashed into the fireplace she swayed almost fell stunned from her chair to her very soul she was sick she clasped the child tightly to her bosom a few moments elapsed then with an effort she brought herself to the baby was crying plaintively her left brow was bleeding rather profusely as she glanced down at the child her brain reeling some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl but the baby was at least not hurt she balanced her head to keep equilibrium so that the blood ran into her eye  walter morel remained as he had stood leaning on the table with one hand looking blank when he was sufficiently sure of his balance he went across to her swayed caught hold of the back of her rockingchair almost tipping her out then leaning forward over her and swaying as he spoke he said in a tone of wondering concern  did it catch thee  he swayed again as if he would pitch on to the child with the catastrophe he had lost all balance  go away she said struggling to keep her presence of mind  he hiccoughed letslets look at it he said hiccoughing again  go away she cried  lemmelemme look at it lass  she smelled him of drink felt the unequal pull of his swaying grasp on the back of her rockingchair  go away she said and weakly she pushed him off  he stood uncertain in balance gazing upon her summoning all her strength she rose the baby on one arm by a cruel effort of will moving as if in sleep she went across to the scullery where she bathed her eye for a minute in cold water but she was too dizzy afraid lest she should swoon she returned to her rockingchair trembling in every fibre by instinct she kept the baby clasped  morel bothered had succeeded in pushing the drawer back into its cavity and was on his knees groping with numb paws for the scattered spoons  her brow was still bleeding presently morel got up and came craning his neck towards her  what has it done to thee lass he asked in a very wretched humble tone  you can see what its done she answered  he stood bending forward supported on his hands which grasped his legs just above the knee he peered to look at the wound she drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache averting her own face as much as possible as he looked at her who was cold and impassive as stone with mouth shut tight he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit he was turning drearily away when he saw a drop of blood fall from the averted wound into the babys fragile glistening hair fascinated he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud and pull down the gossamer another drop fell it would soak through to the babys scalp he watched fascinated feeling it soak in then finally his manhood broke  what of this child was all his wife said to him but her low intense tones brought his head lower she softened get me some wadding out of the middle drawer she said  he stumbled away very obediently presently returning with a pad which she singed before the fire then put on her forehead as she sat with the baby on her lap  now that clean pitscarf  again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer returning presently with a red narrow scarf she took it and with trembling fingers proceeded to bind it round her head  let me tie it for thee he said humbly  i can do it myself she replied when it was done she went upstairs telling him to rake the fire and lock the door  in the morning mrs morel said  i knocked against the latch of the coalplace when i was getting a raker in the dark because the candle blew out her two small children looked up at her with wide dismayed eyes they said nothing but their parted lips seemed to express the unconscious tragedy they felt  walter morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinnertime he did not think of the previous evenings work he scarcely thought of anything but he would not think of that he lay and suffered like a sulking dog he had hurt himself most and he was the more damaged because he would never say a word to her or express his sorrow he tried to wriggle out of it it was her own fault he said to himself nothing however could prevent his inner consciousness inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust and which he could only alleviate by drinking  he felt as if he had not the initiative to get up or to say a word or to move but could only lie like a log moreover he had himself violent pains in the head it was saturday towards noon he rose cut himself food in the pantry ate it with his head dropped then pulled on his boots and went out to return at three oclock slightly tipsy and relieved then once more straight to bed he rose again at six in the evening had tea and went straight out  sunday was the same bed till noon the palmerston arms till 230 dinner and bed scarcely a word spoken when mrs morel went upstairs towards four oclock to put on her sunday dress he was fast asleep she would have felt sorry for him if he had once said wife im sorry but no he insisted to himself it was her fault and so he broke himself so she merely left him alone there was this deadlock of passion between them and she was stronger  the family began tea sunday was the only day when all sat down to meals together  isnt my father going to get up asked william  let him lie the mother replied  there was a feeling of misery over all the house the children breathed the air that was poisoned and they felt dreary they were rather disconsolate did not know what to do what to play at  immediately morel woke he got straight out of bed that was characteristic of him all his life he was all for activity the prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him  it was near six oclock when he got down this time he entered without hesitation his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again he did not care any longer what the family thought or felt  the teathings were on the table william was reading aloud from the childs own annie listening and asking eternally why both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching thud of their fathers stockinged feet and shrank as he entered yet he was usually indulgent to them  morel made the meal alone brutally he ate and drank more noisily than he had need no one spoke to him the family life withdrew shrank away and became hushed as he entered but he cared no longer about his alienation  immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out it was this alacrity this haste to be gone which so sickened mrs morel as she heard him sousing heartily in cold water heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl as he wetted his hair she closed her eyes in disgust as he bent over lacing his boots there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement that divided him from the reserved watchful rest of the family he always ran away from the battle with himself even in his own hearts privacy he excused himself saying if she hadnt said soandso it would never have happened she asked for what shes got the children waited in restraint during his preparations when he had gone they sighed with relief  he closed the door behind him and was glad it was a rainy evening the palmerston would be the cosier he hastened forward in anticipation all the slate roofs of the bottoms shone black with wet the roads always dark with coaldust were full of blackish mud he hastened along the palmerston windows were steamed over the passage was paddled with wet feet but the air was warm if foul and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer and smoke  what shollt hae walter cried a voice as soon as morel appeared in the doorway  oh jim my lad wheriver has thee sprung frae  the men made a seat for him and took him in warmly he was glad in a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him all shame all trouble and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night  on the wednesday following morel was penniless he dreaded his wife having hurt her he hated her he did not know what to do with himself that evening having not even twopence with which to go to the palmerston and being already rather deeply in debt so while his wife was down the garden with the child he hunted in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse found it and looked inside it contained a halfcrown two halfpennies and a sixpence so he took the sixpence put the purse carefully back and went out  the next day when she wanted to pay the greengrocer she looked in the purse for her sixpence and her heart sank to her shoes then she sat down and thought was there a sixpence i hadnt spent it had i and i hadnt left it anywhere else  she was much put about she hunted round everywhere for it and as she sought the conviction came into her heart that her husband had taken it what she had in her purse was all the money she possessed but that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable he had done so twice before the first time she had not accused him and at the weekend he had put the shilling again into her purse so that was how she had known he had taken it the second time he had not paid back  this time she felt it was too much when he had had his dinnerhe came home early that dayshe said to him coldly  did you take sixpence out of my purse last night  me he said looking up in an offended way no i didna i niver clapped eyes on your purse  but she could detect the lie  why you know you did she said quietly  i tell you i didna he shouted yer at me again are yer ive had about enough ont  so you filch sixpence out of my purse while im taking the clothes in  ill may yer pay for this he said pushing back his chair in desperation he bustled and got washed then went determinedly upstairs presently he came down dressed and with a big bundle in a bluechecked enormous handkerchief  and now he said youll see me again when you do  itll be before i want to she replied and at that he marched out of the house with his bundle she sat trembling slightly but her heart brimming with contempt what would she do if he went to some other pit obtained work and got in with another woman but she knew him too wellhe couldnt she was dead sure of him nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her  wheres my dad said william coming in from school  he says hes run away replied the mother  where to  eh i dont know hes taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief and says hes not coming back  what shall we do cried the boy  eh never trouble he wont go far  but if he doesnt come back wailed annie  and she and william retired to the sofa and wept mrs morel sat and laughed  you pair of gabeys she exclaimed youll see him before the nights out  but the children were not to be consoled twilight came on mrs morel grew anxious from very weariness one part of her said it would be a relief to see the last of him another part fretted because of keeping the children and inside her as yet she could not quite let him go at the bottom she knew very well he could not go  when she went down to the coalplace at the end of the garden however she felt something behind the door so she looked and there in the dark lay the big blue bundle she sat on a piece of coal and laughed every time she saw it so fat and yet so ignominious slunk into its corner in the dark with its ends flopping like dejected ears from the knots she laughed again she was relieved  mrs morel sat waiting he had not any money she knew so if he stopped he was running up a bill she was very tired of himtired to death he had not even the courage to carry his bundle beyond the yardend  as she meditated at about nine oclock he opened the door and came in slinking and yet sulky she said not a word he took off his coat and slunk to his armchair where he began to take off his boots  youd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off she said quietly  you may thank your stars ive come back tonight he said looking up from under his dropped head sulkily trying to be impressive  why where should you have gone you darent even get your parcel through the yardend she said  he looked such a fool she was not even angry with him he continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed  i dont know whats in your blue handkerchief she said but if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning  whereupon he got up and went out of the house returning presently and crossing the kitchen with averted face hurrying upstairs as mrs morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway holding his bundle she laughed to herself but her heart was bitter because she had loved him    chapter iii  the casting off of morelthe taking on of william  during the next week morels temper was almost unbearable like all miners he was a great lover of medicines which strangely enough he would often pay for himself  you mun get me a drop o laxy vitral he said its a winder as we canna hae a sup i th ouse  so mrs morel bought him elixir of vitriol his favourite first medicine and he made himself a jug of wormwood tea he had hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs wormwood rue horehound elder flowers parsleypurt marshmallow hyssop dandelion and centaury usually there was a jug of one or other decoction standing on the hob from which he drank largely  grand he said smacking his lips after wormwood grand and he exhorted the children to try  its better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews he vowed but they were not to be tempted  this time however neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs would shift the nasty peens in his head he was sickening for an attack of an inflammation of the brain he had never been well since his sleeping on the ground when he went with jerry to nottingham since then he had drunk and stormed now he fell seriously ill and mrs morel had him to nurse he was one of the worst patients imaginable but in spite of all and putting aside the fact that he was breadwinner she never quite wanted him to die still there was one part of her wanted him for herself  the neighbours were very good to her occasionally some had the children in to meals occasionally some would do the downstairs work for her one would mind the baby for a day but it was a great drag nevertheless it was not every day the neighbours helped then she had nursing of baby and husband cleaning and cooking everything to do she was quite worn out but she did what was wanted of her  and the money was just sufficient she had seventeen shillings a week from clubs and every friday barker and the other butty put by a portion of the stalls profits for morels wife and the neighbours made broths and gave eggs and such invalids trifles if they had not helped her so generously in those times mrs morel would never have pulled through without incurring debts that would have dragged her down  the weeks passed morel almost against hope grew better he had a fine constitution so that once on the mend he went straight forward to recovery soon he was pottering about downstairs during his illness his wife had spoilt him a little now he wanted her to continue he often put his band to his head pulled down the comers of his mouth and shammed pains he did not feel but there was no deceiving her at first she merely smiled to herself then she scolded him sharply  goodness man dont be so lachrymose  that wounded him slightly but still he continued to feign sickness  i wouldnt be such a mardy baby said the wife shortly  then he was indignant and cursed under his breath like a boy he was forced to resume a normal tone and to cease to whine  nevertheless there was a state of peace in the house for some time mrs morel was more tolerant of him and he depending on her almost like a child was rather happy neither knew that she was more tolerant because she loved him less up till this time in spite of all he had been her husband and her man she had felt that more or less what he did to himself he did to her her living depended on him there were many many stages in the ebbing of her love for him but it was always ebbing  now with the birth of this third baby her self no longer set towards him helplessly but was like a tide that scarcely rose standing off from him after this she scarcely desired him and standing more aloof from him not feeling him so much part of herself but merely part of her circumstances she did not mind so much what he did could leave him alone  there was the halt the wistfulness about the ensuing year which is like autumn in a mans life his wife was casting him off half regretfully but relentlessly casting him off and turning now for love and life to the children henceforward he was more or less a husk and he himself acquiesced as so many men do yielding their place to their children  during his recuperation when it was really over between them both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship of the first months of their marriage he sat at home and when the children were in bed and she was sewingshe did all her sewing by hand made all shirts and childrens clothinghe would read to her from the newspaper slowly pronouncing and delivering the words like a man pitching quoits often she hurried him on giving him a phrase in anticipation and then he took her words humbly  the silences between them were peculiar there would be the swift slight cluck of her needle the sharp pop of his lips as he let out the smoke the warmth the sizzle on the bars as he spat in the fire then her thoughts turned to william already he was getting a big boy already he was top of the class and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school she saw him a man young full of vigour making the world glow again for her  and morel sitting there quite alone and having nothing to think about would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable his soul would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone he felt a sort of emptiness almost like a vacuum in his soul he was unsettled and restless soon he could not live in that atmosphere and he affected his wife both felt an oppression on their breathing when they were left together for some time then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone working thinking living  meanwhile another infant was coming fruit of this little peace and tenderness between the separating parents paul was seventeen months old when the new baby was born he was then a plump pale child quiet with heavy blue eyes and still the peculiar slight knitting of the brows the last child was also a boy fair and bonny mrs morel was sorry when she knew she was with child both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband but not for the sake of the infant  they called the baby arthur he was very pretty with a mop of gold curls and he loved his father from the first mrs morel was glad this child loved the father hearing the miners footsteps the baby would put up his arms and crow and if morel were in a good temper he called back immediately in his hearty mellow voice  what then my beauty i shll come to thee in a minute  and as soon as he had taken off his pitcoat mrs morel would put an apron round the child and give him to his father  what a sight the lad looks she would exclaim sometimes taking back the baby that was smutted on the face from his fathers kisses and play then morel laughed joyfully  hes a little collier bless his bit o mutton he exclaimed  and these were the happy moments of her life now when the children included the father in her heart  meanwhile william grew bigger and stronger and more active while paul always rather delicate and quiet got slimmer and trotted after his mother like her shadow he was usually active and interested but sometimes he would have fits of depression then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on the sofa  whats the matter she asked and got no answer  whats the matter she insisted getting cross  i dont know sobbed the child  so she tried to reason him out of it or to amuse him but without effect it made her feel beside herself then the father always impatient would jump from his chair and shout  if he doesnt stop ill smack him till he does  youll do nothing of the sort said the mother coldly and then she carried the child into the yard plumped him into his little chair and said now cry there misery  and then a butterfly on the rhubarbleaves perhaps caught his eye or at last he cried himself to sleep these fits were not often but they caused a shadow in mrs morels heart and her treatment of paul was different from that of the other children  suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley of the bottoms for the barmman she heard a voice calling her it was the thin little mrs anthony in brown velvet  here mrs morel i want to tell you about your willie  oh do you replied mrs morel why whats the matter  a lad as gets old of another an rips his clothes offn is back mrs anthony said wants showing something  your alfreds as old as my william said mrs morel  appen

of the tale  theyd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding retorted mrs anthony when it comes ter rippin a lads clean collar offn is back apurpose  im sure he didnt do it on purpose said mrs morel  make me a liar shouted mrs anthony  mrs morel moved away and closed her gate her hand trembled as she held her mug of barm  but i sll let your mester know mrs anthony cried after her  at dinnertime when william had finished his meal and wanted to be off againhe was then eleven years oldhis mother said to him  what did you tear alfred anthonys collar for  when did i tear his collar  i

cobbler had cobbledhit and smashedseventeen other cobblers on similar strings so the boy was proud of his veteran  well said mrs morel you know youve got no right to rip his collar  well our mother he answered i never meant tra done itan it was ony an old indirrubber collar as was torn aready  next time said his mother you be more careful i shouldnt like it if you came home with your collar torn off  i dont care our mother i never did it apurpose  the boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded  nowell you be more careful  william fled away glad to be exonerated and mrs morel who hated any bother with the neighbours thought she would explain to mrs anthony and the business would be over  but that evening morel came in from the pit looking very sour he stood in the kitchen and glared round but did not speak for some minutes then  wheers that willy he asked  what do you want him for asked mrs morel who had guessed  ill let im know when i get him said morel banging his pitbottle on to the dresser  i suppose mrs anthonys got hold of you and been yarning to you about alfys collar said mrs morel rather sneering  niver mind whos got hold of me said morel when i get hold of im ill

accidentally got hold of his collar because the other dodgedas an anthony would  i know shouted morel threateningly  you would before youre told replied his wife bitingly  niver you mind stormed morel i know my business  thats more than doubtful said mrs morel supposing some loudmouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children  i know repeated morel  and he said no more but sat and nursed his bad temper suddenly william ran in saying  can i have my tea mother  tha can hae more than that shouted morel  hold your noise man said mrs morel and dont look so ridiculous  hell look ridiculous before ive done wi him shouted morel rising from his chair and glaring at his son  william who was a tall lad for his years but very sensitive had gone pale and was looking in a sort of horror at his father  go out mrs morel commanded her son  william had not the wit to move suddenly morel clenched his fist and crouched  ill gie him go out he shouted like an insane thing  what cried mrs morel panting with rage you shall not touch him for her telling you shall not  shonna i shouted morel shonna i  and glaring at the boy he ran forward mrs morel sprang in between them with her fist lifted  dont you dare she cried  what he shouted baffled for the moment what  she spun round to her son  go out of the house she commanded him in fury  the boy as if hypnotised by her turned suddenly and was gone morel rushed to the door but was too late he returned pale under his pitdirt with fury but now his wife was fully roused  only dare she said in a loud ringing voice only dare milord to lay a finger on that child youll regret it for ever  he was afraid of her in a towering rage he sat down  when the children were old enough to be left mrs morel joined the womens guild it was a little club of women attached to the cooperative wholesale society which met on monday night in the long room over the grocery shop of the bestwood coop the women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from cooperation and other social questions sometimes mrs morel read a paper it seemed queer to the children to see their mother who was always busy about the house sitting writing in her rapid fashion thinking referring to books and writing again they felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect  but they loved the guild it was the only thing to which they did not grudge their motherand that partly because she enjoyed it partly because of the treats they derived from it the guild was called by some hostile husbands who found their wives getting too independent the clatfart shopthat is the gossipshop it is true from off the basis of the guild the women could look at their homes at the conditions of their own lives and find fault so the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own rather disconcerting and also mrs morel always had a lot of news on monday nights so that the children liked william to be in when their mother came home because she told him things  then when the lad was thirteen she got him a job in the coop office he was a very clever boy frank with rather rough features and real viking blue eyes  what dost want ter mae a stoolharsed jack on im for said morel all hell do is to wear his britches behind out an earn nowt whats e startin wi  it doesnt matter what hes starting with said mrs morel  it wouldna put im i th pit we me an

 whenever it was said mrs morel  she was very proud of her son he went to the night school and learned shorthand so that by the time he was sixteen he was the best shorthand clerk and bookkeeper on the place except one then he taught in the night schools but he was so fiery that only his goodnature and his size protected him  all the things that men dothe decent thingswilliam did he could run like the wind when he was twelve he won a first prize in a race an inkstand of glass shaped like an anvil it stood proudly on the dresser and gave mrs morel a keen pleasure the boy only ran for her he flew home with his anvil breathless with a look mother that was the first real tribute to herself she took it like a queen  how pretty she exclaimed  then he began to get ambitious he gave all his money to his mother when he earned fourteen shillings a week she gave him back two for himself and as he never drank he felt himself rich he went about with the bourgeois of bestwood the townlet contained nothing higher than the clergyman then came the bank manager then the doctors then the tradespeople and after that the hosts of colliers willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist the schoolmaster and the tradesmen he played billiards in the mechanics hall also he dancedthis in spite of his mother all the life that bestwood offered he enjoyed from the sixpennyhops down church street to sports and billiards  paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of flowerlike ladies most of whom lived like cut blooms in williams heart for a brief fortnight  occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant swain mrs morel would find a strange girl at the door and immediately she sniffed the air  is mr morel in the damsel would ask appealingly  my husband is at home mrs morel replied  ii mean young mr morel repeated the maiden painfully  which one there are several  whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one  ii met mr morelat ripley she explained  ohat a dance  yes  i dont approve of the girls my son meets at dances and he is not at home  then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the girl away so rudely he was a careless yet eagerlooking fellow who walked with long strides sometimes frowning often with his cap pushed jollily to the back of his head now he came in frowning he threw his cap on to the sofa and took his strong jaw in his hand and glared down at his mother she was small with her hair taken straight back from her forehead she had a quiet air of authority and yet of rare warmth knowing her son was angry she trembled inwardly  did a lady call for me yesterday mother he asked  i dont know about a lady there was a girl came  and why didnt you tell me  because i forgot simply  he fumed a little  a goodlooking girlseemed a lady  i didnt look at her  big brown eyes  i did not look and tell your girls my son that when theyre running after you theyre not to come and ask your mother for you tell them thatbrazen baggages you meet at dancingclasses  im sure she was a nice girl  and im sure she wasnt  there ended the altercation over the dancing there was a great strife between the mother and the son the grievance reached its height when william said he was going to hucknall torkardconsidered a low townto a fancydress ball he was to be a highlander there was a dress he could hire which one of his friends had had and which fitted him perfectly the highland suit came home mrs morel received it coldly and would not unpack it  my suit come cried william  theres a parcel in the front room  he rushed in and cut the string  how do you fancy your son in this he said enraptured showing her the suit  you know i dont want to fancy you in it  on the evening of the dance when he had come home to dress mrs morel put on her coat and bonnet  arent you going to stop and see me mother he asked  no i dont want to see you she replied  she was rather pale and her face was closed and hard she was afraid of her sons going the same way as his father he hesitated a moment and his heart stood still with anxiety then he caught sight of the highland bonnet with its ribbons he picked it up gleefully forgetting her she went out  when he was nineteen he suddenly left the coop office and got a situation in nottingham in his new place he had thirty shillings a week instead of eighteen this was indeed a rise his mother and his father were brimmed up with pride everybody praised william it seemed he was going to get on rapidly mrs morel hoped with his aid to help her younger sons annie was now studying to be a teacher paul also very clever was getting on well having lessons in french and german from his godfather the clergyman who was still a friend to mrs morel arthur a spoilt and very goodlooking boy was at the board school but there was talk of his trying to get a scholarship for the high school in nottingham  william remained a year at his new post in nottingham he was studying hard and growing serious something seemed to be fretting him still he went out to the dances and the river parties he did not drink the children were all rabid teetotallers he came home very late at night and sat yet longer studying his mother implored him to take more care to do one thing or another  dance if you want to dance my son but dont think you can work in the office and then amuse yourself and then study on top of all you cant the human frame wont stand it do one thing or the otheramuse yourself or learn latin but dont try to do both  then he got a place in london at a hundred and twenty a year this seemed a fabulous sum his mother doubted almost whether to rejoice or to grieve  they want me in lime street on monday week mother he cried his eyes blazing as he read the letter mrs morel felt everything go silent inside her he read the letter and will you reply by thursday whether you accept yours faithfully they want me mother at a hundred and twenty a year and dont even ask to see me didnt i tell you i could do it think of me in london and i can give you twenty pounds a year mater we sll all be rolling in money  we shall my son she answered sadly  it never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going away than glad of his success indeed as the days drew near for his departure her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair she loved him so much more than that she hoped in him so much almost she lived by him she liked to do things for him she liked to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars of which he was so proud it was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars there was no laundry so she used to rub away at them with her little convex iron to polish them till they shone from the sheer pressure of her arm now she would not do it for him now he was going away she felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart he did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself that was the grief and the pain to her he took nearly all himself away  a few days before his departurehe was just twentyhe burned his loveletters they had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard from some of them he had read extracts to his mother some of them she had taken the trouble to read herself but most were too trivial  now on the saturday morning he said  come on postle lets go through my letters and you can have the birds and flowers  mrs morel had done her saturdays work on the friday because he was having a last days holiday she was making him a rice cake which he loved to take with him he was scarcely conscious that she was so miserable  he took the first letter off the file it was mauvetinted and had purple and green thistles william sniffed the page  nice scent smell  and he thrust the sheet under pauls nose  um said paul breathing in what dyou call it smell mother  his mother ducked her small fine nose down to the paper  i dont want to smell their rubbish she said sniffing  this girls father said william is as rich as croesus he owns property without end she calls me lafayette because i know french you will see ive forgiven youi like her forgiving me i told mother about you this morning and she will have much pleasure if you come to tea on sunday but she will have to get fathers consent also i sincerely hope he will agree i will let you know how it transpires if however you  let you know how it what interrupted mrs morel  transpiresoh yes  transpires repeated mrs morel mockingly i thought she was so well educated  william felt slightly uncomfortable and abandoned this maiden giving paul the corner with the thistles he continued to read extracts from his letters some of which amused his mother some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him  my lad she said theyre very wise they know theyve only got to flatter your vanity and you press up to them like a dog that has its head scratched  well they cant go on scratching for ever he replied and when theyve done i trot away  but one day youll find a string round your neck that you cant pull off she answered  not me im equal to any of em mater they neednt flatter themselves  you flatter yourself she said quietly  soon there was a heap of twisted black pages all that remained of the file of scented letters except that paul had thirty or forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaperswallows and forgetmenots and ivy sprays and william went to london to start a new life    chapter iv  the young life of paul  paul would be built like his mother slightly and rather small his fair hair went reddish and then dark brown his eyes were grey he was a pale quiet child with eyes that seemed to listen and with a full dropping underlip  as a rule he seemed old for his years he was so conscious of what other people felt particularly his mother when she fretted he understood and could have no peace his soul seemed always attentive to her  as he grew older he became stronger william was too far removed from him to accept him as a companion so the smaller boy belonged at first almost entirely to annie she was a tomboy and a flybieskybie as her mother called her but she was intensely fond of her second brother so paul was towed round at the heels of annie sharing her game she raced wildly at lerky with the other young wildcats of the bottoms and always paul flew beside her living her share of the game having as yet no part of his own he was quiet and not noticeable but his sister adored him he always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to  she had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud though not so fond so she laid the doll on the sofa and covered it with an antimacassar to sleep then she forgot it meantime paul must practise jumping off the sofa arm so he jumped crash into the face of the hidden doll annie rushed up uttered a loud wail and sat down to weep a dirge paul remained quite still  you couldnt tell it was there mother you couldnt tell it was there he repeated over and over so long as annie wept for the doll he sat helpless with misery her grief wore itself out she forgave her brotherhe was so much upset but a day or two afterwards she was shocked  lets make a sacrifice of arabella he said lets burn her  she was horrified yet rather fascinated she wanted to see what the boy would do he made an altar of bricks pulled some of the shavings out of arabellas body put the waxen fragments into the hollow face poured on a little paraffin and set the whole thing alight he watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off the broken forehead of arabella and drop like sweat into the flame so long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence at the end be poked among the embers with a stick fished out the arms and legs all blackened and smashed them under stones  thats the sacrifice of missis arabella he said an im glad theres nothing left of her  which disturbed annie inwardly although she could say nothing he seemed to hate the doll so intensely because he had broken it  all the children but particularly paul were peculiarly against their father along with their mother morel continued to bully and to drink he had periods months at a time when he made the whole life of the family a misery paul never forgot coming home from the band of hope one monday evening and finding his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured his father standing on the hearthrug feet astride his head down and william just home from work glaring at his father there was a silence as the young children entered but none of the elders looked round  william was white to the lips and his fists were clenched he waited until the children were silent watching with childrens rage and hate then he said  you coward you darent do it when i was in  but morels blood was up he swung round on his son william was bigger but morel was hardmuscled and mad with fury  dossnt i he shouted dossnt i hae much more o thy chelp my young jockey an ill rattle my fist about thee ay an i sholl that dost see  morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly almost beastlike fashion william was white with rage  will yer he said quiet and intense it ud be the last time though  morel danced a little nearer crouching drawing back his fist to strike william put his fists ready a light came into his blue eyes almost like a laugh he watched his father another word and the men would have begun to fight paul hoped they would the three children sat pale on the sofa  stop it both of you cried mrs morel in a hard voice weve had enough for one night and you she said turning on to her husband look at your children  morel glanced at the sofa  look at the children you nasty little bitch he sneered why what have i done to the children i should like to know but theyre like yourself youve put em up to your own tricks and nasty waysyouve learned em in it you ave  she refused to answer him no one spoke after a while he threw his boots under the table and went to bed  why didnt you let me have a go at him said william when his father was upstairs i could easily have beaten him  a nice thingyour own father she replied  father repeated william call him my father  well he isand so  but why dont you let me settle him i could do easily  the idea she cried it hasnt come to that yet  no he said its come to worse look at yourself why didnt you let me give it him  because i couldnt bear it so never think of it she cried quickly  and the children went to bed miserably  when william was growing up the family moved from the bottoms to a house on the brow of the hill commanding a view of the valley which spread out like a convex cockleshell or a clampshell before it in front of the house was a huge old ashtree the west wind sweeping from derbyshire caught the houses with full force and the tree shrieked again morel liked it  its music he said it sends me to sleep  but paul and arthur and annie hated it to paul it became almost a demoniacal noise the winter of their first year in the new house their father was very bad the children played in the street on the brim of the wide dark valley until eight oclock then they went to bed their mother sat sewing below having such a great space in front of the house gave the children a feeling of night of vastness and of terror this terror came in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord often paul would wake up after he had been asleep a long time aware of thuds downstairs instantly he was wide awake then he heard the booming shouts of his father come home nearly drunk then the sharp replies of his mother then the bang bang of his fathers fist on the table and the nasty snarling shout as the mans voice got higher and then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks and cries from the great windswept ashtree the children lay silent in suspense waiting for a lull in the wind to hear what their father was doing he might hit their mother again there was a feeling of horror a kind of bristling in the darkness and a sense of blood they lay with their hearts in the grip of an intense anguish the wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer all the chords of the great harp hummed whistled and shrieked and then came the horror of the sudden silence silence everywhere outside and downstairs what was it was it a silence of blood what had he done  the children lay and breathed the darkness and then at last they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs in his stockinged feet still they listened then at last if the wind allowed they heard the water of the tap drumming into the kettle which their mother was filling for morning and they could go to sleep in peace  so they were happy in the morninghappy very happy playing dancing at night round the lonely lamppost in the midst of the darkness but they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts one darkness in their eyes which showed all their lives  paul hated his father as a boy he had a fervent private religion  make him stop drinking he prayed every night lord let my father die he prayed very often let him not be killed at pit he prayed when after tea the father did not come home from work  that was another time when the family suffered intensely the children came from school and had their teas on the hob the big black saucepan was simmering the stewjar was in the oven ready for morels dinner he was expected at five oclock but for months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work  in the winter nights when it was cold and grew dark early mrs morel would put a brass candlestick on the table light a tallow candle to save the gas the children finished their breadandbutter or dripping and were ready to go out to play but if morel had not come they faltered the sense of his sitting in all his pitdirt drinking after a long days work not coming home and eating and washing but sitting getting drunk on an empty stomach made mrs morel unable to bear herself from her the feeling was transmitted to the other children she never suffered alone any more the children suffered with her  paul went out to play with the rest down in the great trough of twilight tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were a few last colliers straggled up the dim field path the lamplighter came along no more colliers came darkness shut down over the valley work was done it was night  then paul ran anxiously into the kitchen the one candle still burned on the table the big fire glowed red mrs morel sat alone on the hob the saucepan steamed the dinnerplate lay waiting on the table all the room was full of the sense of waiting waiting for the man who was sitting in his pitdirt dinnerless some mile away from home across the darkness drinking himself drunk paul stood in the doorway  has my dad come he asked  you can see he hasnt said mrs morel cross with the futility of the question  then the boy dawdled about near his mother they shared the same anxiety presently mrs morel went out and strained the potatoes  theyre ruined and black she said but what do i care  not many words were spoken paul almost hated his mother for suffering because his father did not come home from work  what do you bother yourself for he said if he wants to stop and get drunk why dont you let him  let him flashed mrs morel you may well say let him  she knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a quick way to ruining himself and his home the children were yet young and depended on the breadwinner william gave her the sense of relief providing her at last with someone to turn to if morel failed but the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same  the minutes ticked away at six oclock still the cloth lay on the table still the dinner stood waiting still the same sense of anxiety and expectation in the room the boy could not stand it any longer he could not go out and play so he ran in to mrs inger next door but one for her to talk to him she had no children her husband was good to her but was in a shop and came home late so when she saw the lad at the door she called  come in paul  the two sat talking for some time when suddenly the boy rose saying  well ill be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing  he pretended to be perfectly cheerful and did not tell his friend what ailed him then he ran indoors  morel at these times came in churlish and hateful  this is a nice time to come home said mrs morel  whas it matter to yo what time i come whoam he shouted  and everybody in the house was still because he was dangerous he ate his food in the most brutal manner possible and when he had done pushed all the pots in a heap away from him to lay his arms on the table then he went to sleep  paul hated his father so the colliers small mean head with its black hair slightly soiled with grey lay on the bare arms and the face dirty and inflamed with a fleshy nose and thin paltry brows was turned sideways asleep with beer and weariness and nasty temper if anyone entered suddenly or a noise were made the man looked up and shouted  ill lay my fist about thy yead im tellin thee if tha doesna stop that clatter dost hear  and the two last words shouted in a bullying fashion usually at annie made the family writhe with hate of the man  he was shut out from all family affairs no one told him anything the children alone with their mother told her all about the days happenings everything nothing had really taken place in them until it was told to their mother but as soon as the father came in everything stopped he was like the scotch in the smooth happy machinery of the home and he was always aware of this fall of silence on his entry the shutting off of life the unwelcome but now it was gone too far to alter  he would dearly have liked the children to talk to him but they could not sometimes mrs morel would say  you ought to tell your father  paul won a prize in a competition in a childs paper everybody was highly jubilant  now youd better tell your father when he comes in said mrs morel you know how be carries on and says hes never told anything  all right said paul but he would almost rather have forfeited the prize than have to tell his father  ive won a prize in a competition dad he said morel turned round to him  have you my boy what sort of a competition  oh nothingabout famous women  and how much is the prize then as youve got  its a book  oh indeed  about birds  hmhm  and that was all conversation was impossible between the father and any other member of the family he was an outsider he had denied the god in him  the only times when he entered again into the life of his own people was when he worked and was happy at work sometimes in the evening he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pitbottle then he always wanted several attendants and the children enjoyed it they united with him in the work in the actual doing of something when he was his real self again  he was a good workman dexterous and one who when he was in a good humour always sang he had whole periods months almost years of friction and nasty temper then sometimes he was jolly again it was nice to see him run with a piece of redhot iron into the scullery crying  out of my roadout of my road  then he hammered the soft redglowing stuff on his iron goose and made the shape he wanted or he sat absorbed for a moment soldering then the children watched with joy as the metal sank suddenly molten and was shoved about against the nose of the solderingiron while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin and hot tin and morel was silent and intent for a minute he always sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering and he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his moleskin pit trousers which he would often do considering them too dirty and the stuff too hard for his wife to mend  but the best time for the young children was when he made fuses morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheatstraws from the attic these he cleaned with his hand till each one gleamed like a stalk of gold after which he cut the straws into lengths of about six inches leaving if he could a notch at the bottom of each piece he always had a beautifully sharp knife that could cut a straw clean without hurting it then he set in the middle of the table a heap of gunpowder a little pile of black grains upon the whitescrubbed board he made and trimmed the straws while paul and annie rifled and plugged them paul loved to see the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth of the straw peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soapwhich he got on his thumbnail from a pat in a saucerand the straw was finished  look dad he said  thats right my beauty replied morel who was peculiarly lavish of endearments to his second son paul popped the fuse into the powdertin ready for the morning when morel would take it to the pit and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down  meantime arthur still fond of his father would lean on the arm of morels chair and say  tell us about down pit daddy  this morel loved to do  well theres one little osswe call im taffy he would begin an hes a fawce un  morel had a warm way of telling a story he made one feel taffys cunning  hes a brown un he would answer an not very high well he comes i th stall wi a rattle an then yo ear im sneeze  ello taff you say what art sneezin for bin taein some snuff  an e sneezes again then he slives up an shoves is ead on yer that cadin  whats want taff yo say  and what does he arthur always asked  he wants a bit o bacca my duckie  this story of taffy would go on interminably and everybody loved it  or sometimes it was a new tale  an what dost think my darlin when i went to put my coat on at snaptime what should go runnin up my arm but a mouse  hey up theer i shouts  an i wor just in time ter get im by th tail  and did you kill it  i did for theyre a nuisance the place is fair snied wi em  an what do they live on  the corn as the osses dropsan theyll get in your pocket an eat your snap if youll let emno matter where yo hing your coatthe slivin nibblin little nuisances for they are  these happy evenings could not take place unless morel had some job to do and then he always went to bed very early often before the children there was nothing remaining for him to stay up for when he had finished tinkering and had skimmed the headlines of the newspaper  and the children felt secure when their father was in bed they lay and talked softly a while then they started as the lights went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside going to take the nine oclock shift they listened to the voices of the men imagined them dipping down into the dark valley sometimes they went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing tinier and tinier swaying down the fields in the darkness then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in the warmth  paul was rather a delicate boy subject to bronchitis the others were all quite strong so this was another reason for his mothers difference in feeling for him one day he came home at dinnertime feeling ill but it was not a family to make any fuss  whats the matter with you his mother asked sharply  nothing he replied  but he ate no dinner  if you eat no dinner youre not going to school she said  why he asked  thats why  so after dinner he lay down on the sofa on the warm chintz cushions the children loved then he fell into a kind of doze that afternoon mrs morel was ironing she listened to the small restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked again rose in her heart the old almost weary feeling towards him she had never expected him to live and yet he had a great vitality in his young body perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died she always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him  he in his semiconscious sleep was vaguely aware of the clatter of the iron on the ironstand of the faint thud thud on the ironingboard once roused he opened his eyes to see his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near her cheek listening as it were to the heat her still face with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and selfdenial and her nose the smallest bit on one side and her blue eyes so young quick and warm made his heart contract with love when she was quiet so she looked brave and rich with life but as if she had been done out of her rights it hurt the boy keenly this feeling about her that she had never had her lifes fulfilment and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of impotence yet made him patiently dogged inside it was his childish aim  she spat on the iron and a little ball of spit bounded raced off the dark glossy surface then kneeling she rubbed the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously she was warm in the ruddy firelight paul loved the way she crouched and put her head on one side her movements were light and quick it was always a pleasure to watch her nothing she ever did no movement she ever made could have been found fault with by her children the room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her  paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis he did not mind much what happened happened and it was no good kicking against the pricks he loved the evenings after eight oclock when the light was put out and he could watch the fireflames spring over the darkness of the walls and ceiling could watch huge shadows waving and tossing till the room seemed full of men who battled silently  on retiring to bed the father would come into the sickroom he was always very gentle if anyone were ill but he disturbed the atmosphere for the boy  are ter asleep my darlin morel asked softly  no is my mother comin  shes just finishin foldin the clothes do you want anything morel rarely theed his son  i dont want nothing but how long will she be  not long my duckie  the father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment or two he felt his son did not want him then he went to the top of the stairs and said to his wife  this childts axin for thee how long art goin to be  until ive finished good gracious tell him to go to sleep  she says youre to go to sleep the father repeated gently to paul  well i want her to come insisted the boy  he says he cant go off till you come morel called downstairs  eh dear i shant be long and do stop shouting downstairs theres the other children  then morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire he loved a fire dearly  she says she wont be long he said  he loitered about indefinitely the boy began to get feverish with irritation his fathers presence seemed to aggravate all his sick impatience at last morel after having stood looking at his son awhile said softly  goodnight my darling  goodnight paul replied turning round in relief to be alone  paul loved to sleep with his mother sleep is still most perfect in spite of hygienists when it is shared with a beloved the warmth the security and peace of soul the utter comfort from the touch of the other knits the sleep so that it takes the body and soul completely in its healing paul lay against her and slept and got better whilst she always a bad sleeper fell later on into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith  in convalescence he would sit up in bed see the fluffy horses feeding at the troughs in the field scattering their hay on the trodden yellow snow watch the miners troop homesmall black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow  in convalescence everything was wonderful the snowflakes suddenly arriving on the windowpane clung there a moment like swallows then were gone and a drop of water was crawling down the glass the snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house like pigeons dashing by away across the valley the little black train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness  while they were so poor the children were delighted if they could do anything to help economically annie and paul and arthur went out early in the morning in summer looking for mushrooms hunting through the wet grass from which the larks were rising for the whiteskinned wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in the green and if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy there was the joy of finding something the joy of accepting something straight from the hand of nature and the joy of contributing to the family exchequer  but the most important harvest after gleaning for frumenty was the blackberries mrs morel must buy fruit for puddings on the saturdays also she liked blackberries so paul and arthur scoured the coppices and woods and old quarries so long as a blackberry was to be found every weekend going on their search in that region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity but paul hunted far and wide he loved being out in the country among the bushes but he also could not bear to go home to his mother empty that he felt would disappoint her and he would have died rather  good gracious she would exclaim as the lads came in late and tired to death and hungry wherever have you been  well replied paul there wasnt any so we went over misk hills and look here our mother  she peeped into the basket  now those are fine ones she exclaimed  and theres over two poundsisnt there over two pounds  she tried the basket  yes she answered doubtfully  then paul fished out a little spray he always brought her one spray the best he could find  pretty she said in a curious tone of a woman accepting a lovetoken  the boy walked all day went miles and miles rather than own himself beaten and come home to her emptyhanded she never realised this whilst he was young she was a woman who waited for her children to grow up and william occupied her chiefly  but when william went to nottingham and was not so much at home the mother made a companion of paul the latter was unconsciously jealous of his brother and william was jealous of him at the same time they were good friends  mrs morels intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest it was the rule that paul should fetch the money on friday afternoons the colliers of the five pits were paid on fridays but not individually all the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty as contractor and he divided the wages again either in the publichouse or in his own home so that the children could fetch the money school closed early on friday afternoons each of the morel childrenwilliam then annie then paulhad fetched the money on friday afternoons until they went themselves to work paul used to set off at halfpast three with a little calico bag in his pocket down all the paths women girls children and men were seen trooping to the offices  these offices were quite handsome a new redbrick building almost like a mansion standing in its own grounds at the end of greenhill lane the waitingroom was the hall a long bare room paved with blue brick and having a seat all round against the wall here sat the colliers in their pitdirt they had come up early the women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths paul always examined the grass border and the big grass bank because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forgetmenots there was a sound of many voices the women had on their sunday hats the girls chattered loudly little dogs ran here and there the green shrubs were silent all around  then from inside came the cry spinney parkspinney park all the folk for spinney park trooped inside when it was time for bretty to be paid paul went in among the crowd the payroom was quite small a counter went across dividing it into half behind the counter stood two menmr braithwaite and his clerk mr winterbottom mr braithwaite was large somewhat of the stern patriarch in appearance having a rather thin white beard he was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief and right up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate no window was open sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats of the people coming in from the freshness mr winterbottom was rather small and fat and very bald he made remarks that were not witty whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions against the colliers  the room was crowded with miners in their pitdirt men who had been home and changed and women and one or two children and usually a dog paul was quite small so it was often his fate to be jammed behind the legs of the men near the fire which scorched him he knew the order of the namesthey went according to stall number  holliday came the ringing voice of mr braithwaite then mrs holliday stepped silently forward was paid drew aside  bowerjohn bower  a boy stepped to the counter mr braithwaite large and irascible glowered at him over his spectacles  john bower he repeated  its me said the boy  why you used to ave a different nose than that said glossy mr winterbottom peering over the counter the people tittered thinking of john bower senior  how is it your fathers not come said mr braithwaite in a large and magisterial voice  hes badly piped the boy  you should tell him to keep off the drink pronounced the great cashier  an niver mind if he puts his foot through yer said a mocking voice from behind  all the men laughed the large and important cashier looked down at his next sheet  fred pilkington he called quite indifferent  mr braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm  paul knew his turn was next but one and his heart began to beat he was pushed against the chimneypiece his calves were burning but he did not hope to get through the wall of men  walter morel came the ringing voice  here piped paul small and inadequate  morelwalter morel the cashier repeated his finger and thumb on the invoice ready to pass on  paul was suffering convulsions of selfconsciousness and could not or would not shout the backs of the men obliterated him then mr winterbottom came to the rescue  hes here where is he morels lad  the fat red bald little man peered round with keen eyes he pointed at the fireplace the colliers looked round moved aside and disclosed the boy  here he is said mr winterbottom  paul went to the counter  seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence why dont you shout up when youre called said mr braithwaite he banged on to the invoice a fivepound bag of silver then in a delicate and pretty movement picked up a little tenpound column of gold and plumped it beside the silver the gold slid in a bright stream over the paper the cashier finished counting off the money the boy dragged the whole down the counter to mr winterbottom to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid here he suffered again  sixteen an six said mr winterbottom  the lad was too much upset to count he pushed forward some loose silver and half a sovereign  how much do you think youve given me asked mr winterbottom  the boy looked at him but said nothing he had not the faintest notion  havent you got a tongue in your head  paul bit his lip and pushed forward some more silver  dont they teach you to count at the boardschool he asked  nowt but algibbra an french said a collier  an cheek an impidence said another  paul was keeping someone waiting with trembling fingers he got his money into the bag and slid out he suffered the tortures of the damned on these occasions  his relief when he got outside and was walking along the mansfield road was infinite on the park wall the mosses were green there were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple trees of an orchard the colliers were walking home in a stream the boy went near the wall selfconsciously he knew many of the men but could not recognise them in their dirt and this was a new torture to him  when he got down to the new inn at bretty his father was not yet come mrs wharmby the landlady knew him his grandmother morels mother had been mrs wharmbys friend  your fathers not come yet said the landlady in the peculiar halfscornful halfpatronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly to grown men sit you down  paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar some colliers were reckoningsharing out their moneyin a corner others came in they all glanced at the boy without speaking at last morel came brisk and with something of an air even in his blackness  hello he said rather tenderly to his son have you bested me shall you have a drink of something  paul and all the children were bred up fierce antialcoholists and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all the men than in having a tooth drawn  the landlady looked at him de haut en bas rather pitying and at the same time resenting his clear fierce morality paul went home glowering he entered the house silently friday was baking day and there was usually a hot bun his mother put it before him  suddenly he turned on her in a fury his eyes flashing  im not going to the office any more he said  why whats the matter his mother asked in surprise his sudden rages rather amused her  im not going any more he declared  oh very well tell your father so  he chewed his bun as if he hated it  im notim not going to fetch the money  then one of carlins children can go theyd be glad enough of the sixpence said mrs morel  this sixpence was pauls only income it mostly went in buying birthday presents but it was an income and he treasured it but  they can have it then he said i dont want it  oh very well said his mother but you neednt bully me about it  theyre hateful and common and hateful they are and im not going any more mr braithwaite drops his hs an mr winterbottom says you was  and is that why you wont go any more smiled mrs morel  the boy was silent for some time his face was pale his eyes dark and furious his mother moved about at her work taking no notice of him  they always stan in front of me sos i cant get out he said  well my lad youve only to ask them she replied  an then alfred winterbottom says what do they teach you at the boardschool  they never taught him much said mrs morel that is a factneither manners nor witand his cunning he was born with  so in her own way she soothed him his ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her heart ache and sometimes the fury in his eyes roused her made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment surprised  what was the cheque she asked  seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence and sixteen and six stoppages replied the boy its a good week and only five shillings stoppages for my father  so she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned and could call him to account if he gave her short money morel always kept to himself the secret of the weeks amount  friday was the baking night and market night it was the rule that paul should stay at home and bake he loved to stop in and draw or read he was very fond of drawing annie always gallivanted on friday nights arthur was enjoying himself as usual so the boy remained alone  mrs morel loved her marketing in the tiny marketplace on the top of the hill where four roads from nottingham and derby ilkeston and mansfield meet many stalls were erected brakes ran in from surrounding villages the marketplace was full of women the streets packed with men it was amazing to see so many men everywhere in the streets mrs morel usually quarrelled with her lace woman sympathised with her fruit manwho was a gabey but his wife was a bad unlaughed with the fish manwho was a scamp but so drollput the linoleum man in his place was cold with the oddwares man and only went to the crockery man when she was drivenor drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish then she was coldly polite  i wondered how much that little dish was she said  sevenpence to you  thank you  she put the dish down and walked away but she could not leave the marketplace without it again she went by where the pots lay coldly on the floor and she glanced at the dish furtively pretending not to  she was a little woman in a bonnet and a black costume her bonnet was in its third year it was a great grievance to annie  mother the girl implored dont wear that nubbly little bonnet  then what else shall i wear replied the mother tartly and im sure its right enough  it had started with a tip then had had flowers now was reduced to black lace and a bit of jet  it looks rather come down said paul couldnt you give it a pickmeup  ill jowl your head for impudence said mrs morel and she tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin  she glanced at the dish again both she and her enemy the pot man had an uncomfortable feeling as if there were something between them suddenly he shouted  do you want it for fivepence  she started her heart hardened but then she stooped and took up her dish  ill have it she said  yerll do me the favour like he said yerd better spit in it like yer do when yave something give yer  mrs morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner  i dont see you give it me she said you wouldnt let me have it for fivepence if you didnt want to  in this flamin scrattlin place you may count yerself lucky if you can give your things away he growled  yes there are bad times and good said mrs morel  but she had forgiven the pot man they were friends she dare now finger his pots so she was happy  paul was waiting for her he loved her homecoming she was always her best sotriumphant tired laden with parcels feeling rich in spirit he heard her quick light step in the entry and looked up from his drawing  oh she sighed smiling at him from the doorway  my word you are loaded he exclaimed putting down his brush  i am she gasped that brazen annie said shed meet me such a weight  she dropped her string bag and her packages on the table  is the bread done she asked going to the oven  the last one is soaking he replied you neednt look ive not forgotten it  oh that pot man she said closing the oven door you know what a wretch ive said he was well i dont think hes quite so bad  dont you  the boy was attentive to her she took off her little black bonnet  no i think he cant make any moneywell its everybodys cry alike nowadaysand it makes him disagreeable  it would me said paul  well one cant wonder at it and he let me havehow much do you think he let me have this for  she took the dish out of its rag of newspaper and stood looking on it with joy  show me said paul  the two stood together gloating over the dish  i love cornflowers on things said paul  yes and i thought of the teapot you bought me  one and three said paul  fivepence  its not enough mother  no do you know i fairly sneaked off with it but id been extravagant i couldnt afford any more and he neednt have let me have it if he hadnt wanted to  no he neednt need he said paul and the two comforted each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man  we cn have stewed fruit in it said paul  or custard or a jelly said his mother  or radishes and lettuce said he  dont forget that bread she said her voice bright with glee  paul looked in the oven tapped the loaf on the base  its done he said giving it to her  she tapped it also  yes she replied going to unpack her bag oh and im a wicked extravagant woman i know i sll come to want  he hopped to her side eagerly to see her latest extravagance she unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of pansies and of crimson daisies  four pennorth she moaned  how cheap he cried  yes but i couldnt afford it this week of all weeks  but lovely he cried  arent they she exclaimed giving way to pure joy paul look at this yellow one isnt itand a face just like an old man  just cried paul stooping to sniff and smells that nice but hes a bit splashed  he ran in the scullery came back with the flannel and carefully washed the pansy  now look at him now hes wet he said  yes she exclaimed brimful of satisfaction  the children of scargill street felt quite select at the end where the morels lived there were not many young things so the few were more united boys and girls played together the girls joining in the fights and the rough games the boys taking part in the dancing games and rings and makebelief of the girls  annie and paul and arthur loved the winter evenings when it was not wet they stayed indoors till the colliers were all gone home till it was thick dark and the street would be deserted then they tied their scarves round their necks for they scorned overcoats as all the colliers children did and went out the entry was very dark and at the end the whole great night opened out in a hollow with a little tangle of lights below where minton pit lay and another far away opposite for selby the farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever the children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamppost which stood at the end of the field path if the little luminous space were deserted the two boys felt genuine desolation they stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp turning their backs on the night quite miserable watching the dark houses suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen and a longlegged girl came flying up  wheres billy pillins an your annie an eddie dakin  i dont know  but it did not matter so muchthere were three now they set up a game round the lamppost till the others rushed up yelling then the play went fast and furious  there was only this one lamppost behind was the great scoop of darkness as if all the night were there in front another wide dark way opened over the hill brow occasionally somebody came out of this way and went into the field down the path in a dozen yards the night had swallowed them the children played on  they were brought exceedingly close together owing to their isolation if a quarrel took place the whole play was spoilt arthur was very touchy and billy pillinsreally philipswas worse then paul had to side with arthur and on pauls side went alice while billy pillins always had emmie limb and eddie dakin to back him up then the six would fight hate with a fury of hatred and flee home in terror paul never forgot after one of these fierce internecine fights seeing a big red moon lift itself up slowly between the waste road over the hilltop steadily like a great bird and he thought of the bible that the moon should be turned to blood and the next day he made haste to be friends with billy pillins and then the wild intense games went on again under the lamppost surrounded by so much darkness mrs morel going into her parlour would hear the children singing away       my shoes are made of spanish leather      my socks are made of silk      i wear a ring on every finger      i wash myself in milk  they sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came out of the night that they had the feel of wild creatures singing it stirred the mother and she understood when they came in at eight oclock ruddy with brilliant eyes and quick passionate speech  they all loved the scargill street house for its openness for the great scallop of the world it had in view on summer evenings the women would stand against the field fence gossiping facing the west watching the sunsets flare quickly out till the derbyshire hills ridged across the crimson far away like the black crest of a newt  in this summer season the pits never turned full time particularly the soft coal mrs dakin who lived next door to mrs morel going to the field fence to shake her hearthrug would spy men coming slowly up the hill she saw at once they were colliers then she waited a tall thin shrewfaced woman standing on the hill brow almost like a menace to the poor colliers who were toiling up it was only eleven oclock from the faroff wooded hills the haze that hangs like fine black crape at the back of a summer morning had not yet dissipated the first man came to the stile chockchock went the gate under his thrust  what han yer knocked off cried mrs dakin  we han missis  its a pity as they letn yer goo she said sarcastically  it is that replied the man  nay you know youre flig to come up again she said  and the man went on mrs dakin going up her yard spied mrs morel taking the ashes to the ashpit  i reckon mintons knocked off missis she cried  isnt it sickenin exclaimed mrs morel in wrath  ha but in just seed jont hutchby  they might as well have saved their shoeleather said mrs morel and both women went indoors disgusted  the colliers their faces scarcely blackened were trooping home again morel hated to go back he loved the sunny morning but he had gone to pit to work and to be sent home again spoilt his temper  good gracious at this time exclaimed his wife as he entered  can i help it woman he shouted  and ive not done half enough dinner  then ill eat my bit o snap as i took with me he bawled pathetically he felt ignominious and sore  and the children coming home from school would wonder to see their father eating with his dinner the two thick slices of rather dry and dirty breadandbutter that had been to pit and back  whats my dad eating his snap for now asked arthur  i should hae it holled at me if i didna snorted morel  what a story exclaimed his wife  an is it goin to be wasted said morel im not such a extravagant mortal as you lot with your waste if i drop a bit of bread at pit in all the dust an dirt i pick it up an eat it  the mice would eat it said paul it wouldnt be wasted  good breadanbutters not for mice either said morel dirty or not dirty id eat it rather than it should be wasted  you might leave it for the mice and pay for it out of your next pint said mrs morel  oh might i he exclaimed  they were very poor that autumn william had just gone away to london and his mother missed his money he sent ten shillings once or twice but he had many things to pay for at first his letters came regularly once a week he wrote a good deal to his mother telling her all his life how he made friends and was exchanging lessons with a frenchman how he enjoyed london his mother felt again he was remaining to her just as when he was at home she wrote to him every week her direct rather witty letters all day long as she cleaned the house she thought of him he was in london he would do well almost he was like her knight who wore her favour in the battle  he was coming at christmas for five days there had never been such preparations paul and arthur scoured the land for holly and evergreens annie made the pretty paper hoops in the oldfashioned way and there was unheardof extravagance in the larder mrs morel made a big and magnificent cake then feeling queenly she showed paul how to blanch almonds he skinned the long nuts reverently counting them all to see not one was lost it was said that eggs whisked better in a cold place so the boy stood in the scullery where the temperature was nearly at freezingpoint and whisked and whisked and flew in excitement to his mother as the white of egg grew stiffer and more snowy  just look mother isnt it lovely  and he balanced a bit on his nose then blew it in the air  now dont waste it said the mother  everybody was mad with excitement william was coming on christmas eve mrs morel surveyed her pantry there was a big plum cake and a rice cake jam tarts lemon tarts and mincepiestwo enormous dishes she was finishing cookingspanish tarts and cheesecakes everywhere was decorated the kissing bunch of berried holly hung with bright and glittering things spun slowly over mrs morels head as she trimmed her little tarts in the kitchen a great fire roared there was a scent of cooked pastry he was due at seven oclock but he would be late the three children had gone to meet him she was alone but at a quarter to seven morel came in again neither wife nor husband spoke he sat in his armchair quite awkward with excitement and she quietly went on with her baking only by the careful way in which she did things could it be told how much moved she was the clock ticked on  what time dost say hes coming morel asked for the fifth time  the train gets in at halfpast six she replied emphatically  then hell be here at ten past seven  eh bless you itll be hours late on the midland she said indifferently but she hoped by expecting him late to bring him early morel went down the entry to look for him then he came back  goodness man she said youre like an illsitting hen  hadna you better be gettin him summat t eat ready asked the father  theres plenty of time she answered  theres not so much as i can see on he answered turning crossly in his chair she began to clear her table the kettle was singing they waited and waited  meantime the three children were on the platform at sethley bridge on the midland main line two miles from home they waited one hour a train camehe was not there down the line the red and green lights shone it was very dark and very cold  ask him if the london trains come said paul to annie when they saw a man in a tip cap  im not said annie you be quiethe might send us off  but paul was dying for the man to know they were expecting someone by the london train it sounded so grand yet he was much too much scared of broaching any man let alone one in a peaked cap to dare to ask the three children could scarcely go into the waitingroom for fear of being sent away and for fear something should happen whilst they were off the platform still they waited in the dark and cold  its an hour an a half late said arthur pathetically  well said annie its christmas eve  they all grew silent he wasnt coming they looked down the darkness of the railway there was london it seemed the uttermost of distance they thought anything might happen if one came from london they were all too troubled to talk cold and unhappy and silent they huddled together on the platform  at last after more than two hours they saw the lights of an engine peering round away down the darkness a porter ran out the children drew back with beating hearts a great train bound for manchester drew up two doors opened and from one of them william they flew to him he handed parcels to them cheerily and immediately began to explain that this great train had stopped for his sake at such a small station as sethley bridge it was not booked to stop  meanwhile the parents were getting anxious the table was set the chop was cooked everything was ready mrs morel put on her black apron she was wearing her best dress then she sat pretending to read the minutes were a torture to her  hm said morel its an hour an a haef  and those children waiting she said  th train canna ha come in yet he said  i tell you on christmas eve theyre hours wrong  they were both a bit cross with each other so gnawed with anxiety the ash tree moaned outside in a cold raw wind and all that space of night from london home mrs morel suffered the slight click of the works inside the clock irritated her it was getting so late it was getting unbearable  at last there was a sound of voices and a footstep in the entry  has here cried morel jumping up  then he stood back the mother ran a few steps towards the door and waited there was a rush and a patter of feet the door burst open william was there he dropped his gladstone bag and took his mother in his arms  mater he said  my boy she cried  and for two seconds no longer she clasped him and kissed him then she withdrew and said trying to be quite normal  but how late you are  arent i he cried turning to his father well dad  the two men shook hands  well my lad  morels eyes were wet  we thought thad niver be commin he said  oh id come exclaimed william  then the son turned round to his mother  but you look well she said proudly laughing  well he exclaimed i should think socoming home  he was a fine fellow big straight and fearlesslooking he looked round at the evergreens and the kissing bunch and the little tarts that lay in their tins on the hearth  by jove mother its not different he said as if in relief  everybody was still for a second then he suddenly sprang forward picked a tart from the hearth and pushed it whole into his mouth  well did iver you see such a parish oven the father exclaimed  he had brought them endless presents every penny he had he had spent on them there was a sense of luxury overflowing in the house for his mother there was an umbrella with gold on the pale handle she kept it to her dying day and would have lost anything rather than that everybody had something gorgeous and besides there were pounds of unknown sweets turkish delight crystallised pineapple and suchlike things which the children thought only the splendour of london could provide and paul boasted of these sweets among his friends  real pineapple cut off in slices and then turned into crystalfair grand  everybody was mad with happiness in the family home was home and they loved it with a passion of love whatever the suffering had been there were parties there were rejoicings people came in to see william to see what difference london had made to him and they all found him such a gentleman and such a fine fellow my word  when he went away again the children retired to various places to weep alone morel went to bed in misery and mrs morel felt as if she were numbed by some drug as if her feelings were paralysed she loved him passionately  he was in the office of a lawyer connected with a large shipping firm and at the midsummer his chief offered him a trip in the mediterranean on one of the boats for quite a small cost mrs morel wrote go go my boy you may never have a chance again and i should love to think of you cruising there in the mediterranean almost better than to have you at home but william came home for his fortnights holiday not even the mediterranean which pulled at all his young mans desire to travel and at his poor mans wonder at the glamorous south could take him away when he might come home that compensated his mother for much    chapter v  paul launches into life  morel was rather a heedless man careless of danger so he had endless accidents now when mrs morel heard the rattle of an empty coalcart cease at her entryend she ran into the parlour to look expecting almost to see her husband seated in the waggon his face grey under his dirt his body limp and sick with some hurt or other if it were he she would run out to help  about a year after william went to london and just after paul had left school before he got work mrs morel was upstairs and her son was painting in the kitchenhe was very clever with his brushwhen there came a knock at the door crossly he put down his brush to go at the same moment his mother opened a window upstairs and looked down  a pitlad in his dirt stood on the threshold  is this walter morels he asked  yes said mrs morel what is it  but she had guessed already  your mesters got hurt he said  eh dear me she exclaimed its a wonder if he hadnt lad and whats he done this time  i dont know for sure but its is leg somewhere they taein im ter th ospital  good gracious me she exclaimed eh dear what a one he is theres not five minutes of peace ill be hanged if there is his thumbs nearly better and nowdid you see him  i seed him at th bottom an i seed em bring im up in a tub an e wor in a dead faint but he shouted like anythink when doctor fraser examined him i th lamp cabinan cossed an swore an said as e wor goin to be taen whoame wornt goin ter th ospital  the boy faltered to an end  he would want to come home so that i can have all the bother thank you my lad eh dear if im not sicksick and surfeited i am  she came downstairs paul had mechanically resumed his painting  and it must be pretty bad if theyve taken him to the hospital she went on but what a careless creature he is other men dont have all these accidents yes he would want to put all the burden on me eh dear just as we were getting easy a bit at last put those things away theres no time to be painting now what time is there a train i know i sll have to go trailing to keston i sll have to leave that bedroom  i can finish it said paul  you neednt i shall catch the seven oclock back i should think oh my blessed heart the fuss and commotion hell make and those granite setts at tinder hillhe might well call them kidney pebblestheyll jolt him almost to bits i wonder why they cant mend them the state theyre in an all the men as go across in that ambulance youd think theyd have a hospital here the men bought the ground and my sirs thered be accidents enough to keep it going but no they must trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to nottingham its a crying shame oh and the fuss hell make i know he will i wonder whos with him barker i sd think poor beggar hell wish himself anywhere rather but hell look after him i know now theres no telling how long hell be stuck in that hospitaland wont he hate it but if its only his leg its not so bad  all the time she was getting ready hurriedly taking off her bodice she crouched at the boiler while the water ran slowly into her ladingcan  i wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea she exclaimed wriggling the handle impatiently she had very handsome strong arms rather surprising on a smallish woman  paul cleared away put on the kettle and set the table  there isnt a train till fourtwenty he said youve time enough  oh no i havent she cried blinking at him over the towel as she wiped her face  yes you have you must drink a cup of tea at any rate should i come with you to keston  come with me what for i should like to know now what have i to take him eh dear his clean shirtand its a blessing it is clean but it had better be aired and stockingshe wont want themand a towel i suppose and handkerchiefs now what else  a comb a knife and fork and spoon said paul his father had been in the hospital before  goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in continued mrs morel as she combed her long brown hair that was fine as silk and was touched now with grey hes very particular to wash himself to the waist but below he thinks doesnt matter but there i suppose they see plenty like it  paul had laid the table he cut his mother one or two pieces of very thin bread and butter  here you are he said putting her cup of tea in her place  i cant be bothered she exclaimed crossly  well youve got to so there now its put out ready he insisted  so she sat down and sipped her tea and ate a little in silence she was thinking  in a few minutes she was gone to walk the two and a half miles to keston station all the things she was taking him she had in her bulging string bag paul watched her go up the road between the hedgesa little quickstepping figure and his heart ached for her that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble and she tripping so quickly in her anxiety felt at the back of her her sons heart waiting on her felt him bearing what part of the burden he could even supporting her and when she was at the hospital she thought it will upset that lad when i tell him how bad it is id better be careful and when she was trudging home again she felt he was coming to share her burden  is it bad asked paul as soon as she entered the house  its bad enough she replied  what  she sighed and sat down undoing her bonnetstrings her son watched her face as it was lifted and her small workhardened hands fingering at the bow under her chin  well she answered its not really dangerous but the nurse says its a dreadful smash you see a great piece of rock fell on his leghereand its a compound fracture there are pieces of bone sticking through  ughhow horrid exclaimed the children  and she continued of course he says hes going to dieit wouldnt be him if he didnt im done for my lass he said looking at me dont be so silly i said to him youre not going to die of a broken leg however badly its smashed i sll niver come out of ere but in a wooden box he groaned well i said if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box when youre better ive no doubt they will if we think its good for him said the sister shes an awfully nice sister but rather strict  mrs morel took off her bonnet the children waited in silence  of course he is bad she continued and he will be its a great shock and hes lost a lot of blood and of course it is a very dangerous smash its not at all sure that it will mend so easily and then theres the fever and the mortificationif it took bad ways hed quickly be gone but there hes a cleanblooded man with wonderful healing flesh and so i see no reason why it should take bad ways of course theres a wound  she was pale now with emotion and anxiety the three children realised that it was very bad for their father and the house was silent anxious  but he always gets better said paul after a while  thats what i tell him said the mother  everybody moved about in silence  and he really looked nearly done for she said but the sister says that is the pain  annie took away her mothers coat and bonnet  and he looked at me when i came away i said i sll have to go now walter because of the trainand the children and he looked at me it seems hard  paul took up his brush again and went on painting arthur went outside for some coal annie sat looking dismal and mrs morel in her little rockingchair that her husband had made for her when the first baby was coming remained motionless brooding she was grieved and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much but still in her heart of hearts where the love should have burned there was a blank now when all her womans pity was roused to its full extent when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse him and to save him when she would have taken the pain herself if she could somewhere far away inside her she felt indifferent to him and to his suffering it hurt her most of all this failure to love him even when he roused her strong emotions she brooded a while  and there she said suddenly when id got halfway to keston i found id come out in my working bootsand look at them they were an old pair of pauls brown and rubbed through at the toes i didnt know what to do with myself for shame she added  in the morning when annie and arthur were at school mrs morel talked again to her son who was helping her with her housework  i found barker at the hospital he did look bad poor little fellow well i said to him what sort of a journey did you have with him dunna ax me missis he said ay i said i know what hed be but it wor bad for him mrs morel it wor that he said i know i said at ivry jolt i thought my eart would ha flown clean out o my mouth he said an the scream e gives sometimes missis not for a fortune would i go through wi it again i can quite understand it i said its a nasty job though he said an one asll be a long while afore its right again im afraid it will i said i like mr barkeri do like him theres something so manly about him  paul resumed his task silently  and of course mrs morel continued for a man like your father the hospital is hard he cant understand rules and regulations and he wont let anybody else touch him not if he can help it when he smashed the muscles of his thigh and it had to be dressed four times a day would he let anybody but me or his mother do it he wouldnt so of course hell suffer in there with the nurses and i didnt like leaving him im sure when i kissed him an came away it seemed a shame  so she talked to her son almost as if she were thinking aloud to him and he took it in as best he could by sharing her trouble to lighten it and in the end she shared almost everything with him without knowing  morel had a very bad time for a week he was in a critical condition then he began to mend and then knowing he was going to get better the whole family sighed with relief and proceeded to live happily  they were not badly off whilst morel was in the hospital there were fourteen shillings a week from the pit ten shillings from the sick club and five shillings from the disability fund and then every week the butties had something for mrs morelfive or seven shillingsso that she was quite well to do and whilst morel was progressing favourably in the hospital the family was extraordinarily happy and peaceful on saturdays and wednesdays mrs morel went to nottingham to see her husband then she always brought back some little thing a small tube of paints for paul or some thick paper a couple of postcards for annie that the whole family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send them away or a fretsaw for arthur or a bit of pretty wood she described her adventures into the big shops with joy soon the folk in the pictureshop knew her and knew about paul the girl in the bookshop took a keen interest in her mrs morel was full of information when she got home from nottingham the three sat round till bedtime listening putting in arguing then paul often raked the fire  im the man in the house now he used to say to his mother with joy they learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be and they almost regrettedthough none of them would have owned to such callousnessthat their father was soon coming back  paul was now fourteen and was looking for work he was a rather small and rather finelymade boy with dark brown hair and light blue eyes his face had already lost its youthful chubbiness and was becoming somewhat like williamsroughfeatured almost ruggedand it was extraordinarily mobile usually he looked as if he saw things was full of life and warm then his smile like his mothers came suddenly and was very lovable and then when there was any clog in his souls quick running his face went stupid and ugly he was the sort of boy that becomes a clown and a lout as soon as he is not understood or feels himself held cheap and again is adorable at the first touch of warmth  he suffered very much from the first contact with anything when he was seven the starting school had been a nightmare and a torture to him but afterwards he liked it and now that he felt he had to go out into life he went through agonies of shrinking selfconsciousness he was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years and he knew some french and german and mathematics that mr heaton had taught him but nothing he had was of any commercial value he was not strong enough for heavy manual work his mother said he did not care for making things with his hands preferred racing about or making excursions into the country or reading or painting  what do you want to be his mother asked  anything  that is no answer said mrs morel  but it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give his ambition as far as this worlds gear went was quietly to earn his thirty or thirtyfive shillings a week somewhere near home and then when his father died have a cottage with his mother paint and go out as he liked and live happy ever after that was his programme as far as doing things went but he was proud within himself measuring people against himself and placing them inexorably and he thought that perhaps he might also make a painter the real thing but that he left alone  then said his mother you must look in the paper for the advertisements  he looked at her it seemed to him a bitter humiliation and an anguish to go through but he said nothing when he got up in the morning his whole being was knotted up over this one thought  ive got to go and look for advertisements for a job  it stood in front of the morning that thought killing all joy and even life for him his heart felt like a tight knot  and then at ten oclock he set off he was supposed to be a queer quiet child going up the sunny street of the little town he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves hes going to the coop readingroom to look in the papers for a place he cant get a job i suppose hes living on his mother then he crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the coop and peeped in the readingroom usually one or two men were there either old useless fellows or colliers on the club so he entered full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up seated himself at the table and pretended to scan the news he knew they would think what does a lad of thirteen want in a readingroom with a newspaper and he suffered  then he looked wistfully out of the window already he was a prisoner of industrialism large sunflowers stared over the old red wall of the garden opposite looking in their jolly way down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner the valley was full of corn brightening in the sun two collieries among the fields waved their small white plumes of steam far off on the hills were the woods of annesley dark and fascinating already his heart went down he was being taken into bondage his freedom in the beloved home valley was going now  the brewers waggons came rolling up from keston with enormous barrels four a side like beans in a burst beanpod the waggoner throned aloft rolling massively in his seat was not so much below pauls eye the mans hair on his small bullet head was bleached almost white by the sun and on his thick red arms rocking idly on his sack apron the white hairs glistened his red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine the horses handsome and brown went on by themselves looking by far the masters of the show  paul wished he were stupid i wish he thought to himself i was fat like him and like a dog in the sun i wish i was a pig and a brewers waggoner  then the room being at last empty he would hastily copy an advertisement on a scrap of paper then another and slip out in immense relief his mother would scan over his copies  yes she said you may try  william had written out a letter of application couched in admirable business language which paul copied with variations the boys handwriting was execrable so that william who did all things well got into a fever of impatience  the elder brother was becoming quite swanky in london he found that he could associate with men far above his bestwood friends in station some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship william always made friends among men wherever he went he was so jolly therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who in bestwood would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager and would merely have called indifferently on the rector so he began to fancy himself as a great gun he was indeed rather surprised at the ease with which he became a gentleman  his mother was glad he seemed so pleased and his lodging in walthamstow was so dreary but now there seemed to come a kind of fever into the young mans letters he was unsettled by all the change he did not stand firm on his own feet but seemed to spin rather giddily on the quick current of the new life his mother was anxious for him she could feel him losing himself he had danced and gone to the theatre boated on the river been out with friends and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away at latin because he intended to get on in his office and in the law as much as he could he never sent his mother any money now it was all taken the little he had for his own life and she did not want any except sometimes when she was in a tight corner and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry she still dreamed of william and of what he would do with herself behind him never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious her heart was because of him  also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance a handsome brunette quite young and a lady after whom the men were running thick and fast  i wonder if you would run my boy his mother wrote to him unless you saw all the other men chasing her too you feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd but take care and see how you feel when you find yourself alone and in triumph william resented these things and continued the chase he had taken the girl on the river if you saw her mother you would know how i feel tall and elegant with the clearest of clear transparent olive complexions hair as black as jet and such grey eyesbright mocking like lights on water at night it is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her and she dresses as well as any woman in london i tell you your son doesnt half put his head up when she goes walking down piccadilly with him  mrs morel wondered in her heart if her son did not go walking down piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes rather than with a woman who was near to him but she congratulated him in her doubtful fashion and as she stood over the washingtub the mother brooded over her son she saw him saddled with an elegant and expensive wife earning little money dragging along and getting draggled in some small ugly house in a suburb but there she told herself i am very likely a sillymeeting trouble halfway nevertheless the load of anxiety scarcely ever left her heart lest william should do the wrong thing by himself  presently paul was bidden call upon thomas jordan manufacturer of surgical appliances at 21 spaniel row nottingham mrs morel was all joy  there you see she cried her eyes shining youve only written four letters and the third is answered youre lucky my boy as i always said you were  paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg adorned with elastic stockings and other appliances that figured on mr jordans notepaper and he felt alarmed he had not known that elastic stockings existed and he seemed to feel the business world with its regulated system of values and its impersonality and he dreaded it it seemed monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs  mother and son set off together one tuesday morning it was august and blazing hot paul walked with something screwed up tight inside him he would have suffered much physical pain rather than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers to be accepted or rejected yet he chattered away with his mother he would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things and she only partly guessed she was gay like a sweetheart she stood in front of the ticketoffice at bestwood and paul watched her take from her purse the money for the tickets as he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting the silver out of the worn purse his heart contracted with pain of love of her  she was quite excited and quite gay he suffered because she would talk aloud in presence of the other travellers  now look at that silly cow she said careering round as if it thought it was a circus  its most likely a bottfly he said very low  a what she asked brightly and unashamed  they thought a while he was sensible all the time of having her opposite him suddenly their eyes met and she smiled to hima rare intimate smile beautiful with brightness and love then each looked out of the window  the sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed the mother and son walked down station street feeling the excitement of lovers having an adventure together in carrington street they stopped to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below  its just like venice he said seeing the sunshine on the water that lay between high factory walls  perhaps she answered smiling  they enjoyed the shops immensely  now you see that blouse she would say wouldnt that just suit our annie and for oneandeleventhree isnt that cheap  and made of needlework as well he said  yes  they had plenty of time so they did not hurry the town was strange and delightful to them but the boy was tied up inside in a knot of apprehension he dreaded the interview with thomas jordan  it was nearly eleven oclock by st peters church they turned up a narrow street that led to the castle it was gloomy and oldfashioned having low dark shops and dark green house doors with brass knockers and yellowochred doorsteps projecting on to the pavement then another old shop whose small window looked like a cunning halfshut eye mother and son went cautiously looking everywhere for thomas jordan and son it was like hunting in some wild place they were on tiptoe of excitement  suddenly they spied a big dark archway in which were names of various firms thomas jordan among them  here it is said mrs morel but now where is it  they looked round on one side was a queer dark cardboard factory on the other a commercial hotel  its up the entry said paul  and they ventured under the archway as into the jaws of the dragon they emerged into a wide yard like a well with buildings all round it was littered with straw and boxes and cardboard the sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw was streaming on to the yard like gold but elsewhere the place was like a pit there were several doors and two flights of steps straight in front on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase loomed the ominous words thomas jordan and sonsurgical appliances mrs morel went first her son followed her charles i mounted his scaffold with a lighter heart than had paul morel as he followed his mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door  she pushed open the door and stood in pleased surprise in front of her was a big warehouse with creamy paper parcels everywhere and clerks with their shirtsleeves rolled back were going about in an athome sort of way the light was subdued the glossy cream parcels seemed luminous the counters were of dark brown wood all was quiet and very homely mrs morel took two steps forward then waited paul stood behind her she had on her sunday bonnet and a black veil he wore a boys broad white collar and a norfolk suit  one of the clerks looked up he was thin and tall with a small face his way of looking was alert then he glanced round to the other end of the room where was a glass office and then he came forward he did not say anything but leaned in a gentle inquiring fashion towards mrs morel  can i see mr jordan she asked  ill fetch him answered the young man  he went down to the glass office a redfaced whitewhiskered old man looked up he reminded paul of a pomeranian dog then the same little man came up the room he had short legs was rather stout and wore an alpaca jacket so with one ear up as it were he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room  goodmorning he said hesitating before mrs morel in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not  goodmorning i came with my son paul morel you asked him to call this morning  come this way said mr jordan in a rather snappy little manner intended to be businesslike  they followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room upholstered in black american leather glossy with the rubbing of many customers on the table was a pile of trusses yellow washleather hoops tangled together they looked new and living paul sniffed the odour of new washleather he wondered what the things were by this time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things  sit down said mr jordan irritably pointing mrs morel to a horsehair chair she sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper  did you write this letter he snapped thrusting what paul recognised as his own notepaper in front of him  yes he answered  at that moment he was occupied in two ways first in feeling guilty for telling a lie since william had composed the letter second in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different in the fat red hand of the man from what it had been when it lay on the kitchen table it was like part of himself gone astray he resented the way the man held it  where did you learn to write said the old man crossly  paul merely looked at him shamedly and did not answer  he is a bad writer put in mrs morel apologetically then she pushed up her veil paul hated her for not being prouder with this common little man and he loved her face clear of the veil  and you say you know french inquired the little man still sharply  yes said paul  what school did you go to  the boardschool  and did you learn it there  noi the boy went crimson and got no farther  his godfather gave him lessons said mrs morel half pleading and rather distant  mr jordan hesitated then in his irritable mannerhe always seemed to keep his hands ready for actionhe pulled another sheet of paper from his pocket unfolded it the paper made a crackling noise he handed it to paul  read that he said  it was a note in french in thin flimsy foreign handwriting that the boy could not decipher he stared blankly at the paper  monsieur he began then he looked in great confusion at mr jordan its theits the  he wanted to say handwriting but his wits would no longer work even sufficiently to supply him with the word feeling an utter fool and hating mr jordan he turned desperately to the paper again  sirplease send meereri cant tell theertwo pairsgris fil basgrey thread stockingserersanswithouteri cant tell the wordserdoigtsfingerseri cant tell the  he wanted to say handwriting but the word still refused to come seeing him stuck mr jordan snatched the paper from him  please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings without toes  well flashed paul doigts means fingersas wellas a rule  the little man looked at him he did not know whether doigts meant fingers he knew that for all his purposes it meant toes  fingers to stockings he snapped  well it does mean fingers the boy persisted  he hated the little man who made such a clod of him mr jordan looked at the pale stupid defiant boy then at the mother who sat quiet and with that peculiar shutoff look of the poor who have to depend on the favour of others  and when could he come he asked  well said mrs morel as soon as you wish he has finished school now  he would live in bestwood  yes but he could be inat the stationat quarter to eight  hm  it ended by pauls being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight shillings a week the boy did not open his mouth to say another word after having insisted that doigts meant fingers he followed his mother down the stairs she looked at him with her bright blue eyes full of love and joy  i think youll like it she said  doigts does mean fingers mother and it was the writing i couldnt read the writing  never mind my boy im sure hell be all right and you wont see much of him wasnt that first young fellow nice im sure youll like them  but wasnt mr jordan common mother does he own it all  i suppose he was a workman who has got on she said you mustnt mind people so much theyre not being disagreeable to youits their way you always think people are meaning things for you but they dont  it was very sunny over the big desolate space of the marketplace the blue sky shimmered and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened shops down the long row were deep in obscurity and the shadow was full of colour just where the horse trams trundled across the market was a row of fruit stalls with fruit blazing in the sunapples and piles of reddish oranges small greengage plums and bananas there was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank  where should we go for dinner asked the mother  it was felt to be a reckless extravagance paul had only been in an eatinghouse once or twice in his life and then only to have a cup of tea and a bun most of the people of bestwood considered that tea and breadandbutter and perhaps potted beef was all they could afford to eat in nottingham real cooked dinner was considered great extravagance paul felt rather guilty  they found a place that looked quite cheap but when mrs morel scanned the bill of fare her heart was heavy things were so dear so she ordered kidneypies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish  we oughtnt to have come here mother said paul  never mind she said we wont come again  she insisted on his having a small currant tart because he liked sweets  i dont want it mother he pleaded  yes she insisted youll have it  and she looked round for the waitress but the waitress was busy and mrs morel did not like to bother her then so the mother and son waited for the girls pleasure whilst she flirted among the men  brazen hussy said mrs morel to paul look now shes taking that man his pudding and he came long after us  it doesnt matter mother said paul  mrs morel was angry but she was too poor and her orders were too meagre so that she had not the courage to insist on her rights just then they waited and waited  should we go mother he said  then mrs morel stood up the girl was passing near  will you bring one currant tart said mrs morel clearly  the girl looked round insolently  directly she said  we have waited quite long enough said mrs morel  in a moment the girl came back with the tart mrs morel asked coldly for the bill paul wanted to sink through the floor he marvelled at his mothers hardness he knew that only years of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights she shrank as much as he  its the last time i go there for anything she declared when they were outside the place thankful to be clear  well go she said and look at keeps and boots and one or two places shall we  they had discussions over the pictures and mrs morel wanted to buy him a little sable brush that he hankered after but this indulgence he refused he stood in front of milliners shops and drapers shops almost bored but content for her to be interested they wandered on  now just look at those black grapes she said they make your mouth water ive wanted some of those for years but i sll have to wait a bit before i get them  then she rejoiced in the florists standing in the doorway sniffing  oh oh isnt it simply lovely  paul saw in the darkness of the shop an elegant young lady in black peering over the counter curiously  theyre looking at you he said trying to draw his mother away  but what is it she exclaimed refusing to be moved  stocks he answered sniffing hastily look theres a tubful  so there isred and white but really i never knew stocks to smell like it and to his great relief she moved out of the doorway but only to stand in front of the window  paul she cried to him who was trying to get out of sight of the elegant young lady in blackthe shopgirl paul just look here  he came reluctantly back  now just look at that fuchsia she exclaimed pointing  hm he made a curious interested sound youd think every second as the flowers was going to fall off they hang so big an heavy  and such an abundance she cried  and the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots  yes she exclaimed lovely  i wonder wholl buy it he said  i wonder she answered not us  it would die in our parlour  yes beastly cold sunless hole it kills every bit of a plant you put in and the kitchen chokes them to death  they bought a few things and set off towards the station looking up the canal through the dark pass of the buildings they saw the castle on its bluff of brown greenbushed rock in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine  wont it be nice for me to come out at dinnertimes said paul i can go all round here and see everything i sll love it  you will assented his mother  he had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother they arrived home in the mellow evening happy and glowing and tired  in the morning he filled in the form for his seasonticket and took it to the station when he got back his mother was just beginning to wash the floor he sat crouched up on the sofa  he says itll be here on saturday he said  and how much will it be  about one pound eleven he said  she went on washing her floor in silence  is it a lot he asked  its no more than i thought she answered  an i sll earn eight shillings a week he said  she did not answer but went on with her work at last she said  that william promised me when he went to london as hed give me a pound a month he has given me ten shillingstwice and now i know he hasnt a farthing if i asked him not that i want it only just now youd think he might be able to help with this ticket which id never expected  he earns a lot said paul  he earns a hundred and thirty pounds but theyre all alike theyre large in promises but its precious little fulfilment you get  he spends over fifty shillings a week on himself said paul  and i keep this house on less than thirty she replied and am supposed to find money for extras but they dont care about helping you once theyve gone hed rather spend it on that dressedup creature  she should have her own money if shes so grand said paul  she should but she hasnt i asked him and i know he doesnt buy her a gold bangle for nothing i wonder whoever bought me a gold bangle  william was succeeding with his gipsy as he called her he asked the girlher name was louisa lily denys westernfor a photograph to send to his mother the photo camea handsome brunette taken in profile smirking slightlyand it might be quite naked for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen only a naked bust  yes wrote mrs morel to her son the photograph of louie is very striking and i can see she must be attractive but do you think my boy it was very good taste of a girl to give her young man that photo to send to his motherthe first certainly the shoulders are beautiful as you say but i hardly expected to see so much of them at the first view  morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in the parlour he came out with it between his thick thumb and finger  who dost reckon this is he asked of his wife  its the girl our william is going with replied mrs morel  hm ers a bright spark from th look on er an one as wunna do him owermuch good neither who is she  her name is louisa lily denys western  an come again tomorrer exclaimed the miner an is er an actress  she is not shes supposed to be a lady  ill bet he exclaimed still staring at the photo a lady is she an how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o game on  on nothing she lives with an old aunt whom she hates and takes what bit of moneys given her  hm said morel laying down the photograph then hes a fool to ha taen up wi such a one as that  dear mater william replied im sorry you didnt like the photograph it never occurred to me when i sent it that you mightnt think it decent however i told gyp that it didnt quite suit your prim and proper notions so shes going to send you another that i hope will please you better shes always being photographed in fact the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing  presently the new photograph came with a little silly note from the girl this time the young lady was seen in a black satin evening bodice cut square with little puff sleeves and black lace hanging down her beautiful arms  i wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes said mrs morel sarcastically im sure i ought to be impressed  you are disagreeable mother said paul i think the first one with bare shoulders is lovely  do you answered his mother well i dont  on the monday morning the boy got up at six to start work he had the seasonticket which had cost such bitterness in his waistcoat pocket he loved it with its bars of yellow across his mother packed his dinner in a small shutup basket and he set off at a quarter to seven to catch the 715 train mrs morel came to the entryend to see him off  it was a perfect morning from the ash tree the slender green fruits that the children call pigeons were twinkling gaily down on a little breeze into the front gardens of the houses the valley was full of a lustrous dark haze through which the ripe corn shimmered and in which the steam from minton pit melted swiftly puffs of wind came paul looked over the high woods of aldersley where the country gleamed and home had never pulled at him so powerfully  goodmorning mother he said smiling but feeling very unhappy  goodmorning she replied cheerfully and tenderly  she stood in her white apron on the open road watching him as he crossed the field he had a small compact body that looked full of life she felt as she saw him trudging over the field that where he determined to go he would get she thought of william he would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile he was away in london doing well paul would be working in nottingham now she had two sons in the world she could think of two places great centres of industry and feel that she had put a man into each of them that these men would work out what she wanted they were derived from her they were of her and their works also would be hers all the morning long she thought of paul  at eight oclock he climbed the dismal stairs of jordans surgical appliance factory and stood helplessly against the first great parcelrack waiting for somebody to pick him up the place was still not awake over the counters were great dust sheets two men only had arrived and were heard talking in a corner as they took off their coats and rolled up their shirtsleeves it was ten past eight evidently there was no rush of punctuality paul listened to the voices of the two clerks then he heard someone cough and saw in the office at the end of the room an old decaying clerk in a round smokingcap of black velvet embroidered with red and green opening letters he waited and waited one of the junior clerks went to the old man greeted him cheerily and loudly evidently the old chief was deaf then the young fellow came striding importantly down to his counter he spied paul  hello he said you the new lad  yes said paul  hm whats your name  paul morel  paul morel all right you come on round here  paul followed him round the rectangle of counters the room was second storey it had a great hole in the middle of the floor fenced as with a wall of counters and down this wide shaft the lifts went and the light for the bottom storey also there was a corresponding big oblong hole in the ceiling and one could see above over the fence of the top floor some machinery and right away overhead was the glass roof and all light for the three storeys came downwards getting dimmer so that it was always night on the ground floor and rather gloomy on the second floor the factory was the top floor the warehouse the second the storehouse the ground floor it was an insanitary ancient place  paul was led round to a very dark corner  this is the spiral corner said the clerk youre spiral with pappleworth hes your boss but hes not come yet he doesnt get here till halfpast eight so you can fetch the letters if you like from mr melling down there  the young man pointed to the old clerk in the office  all right said paul  heres a peg to hang your cap on here are your entry ledgers mr pappleworth wont be long  and the thin young man stalked away with long busy strides over the hollow wooden floor  after a minute or two paul went down and stood in the door of the glass office the old clerk in the smokingcap looked down over the rim of his spectacles  goodmorning he said kindly and impressively you want the letters for the spiral department thomas  paul resented being called thomas but he took the letters and returned to his dark place where the counter made an angle where the great parcelrack came to an end and where there were three doors in the corner he sat on a high stool and read the lettersthose whose handwriting was not too difficult they ran as follows  will you please send me at once a pair of ladys silk spiral thighhose without feet such as i had from you last year length thigh to knee etc or major chamberlain wishes to repeat his previous order for a silk nonelastic suspensory bandage  many of these letters some of them in french or norwegian were a great puzzle to the boy he sat on his stool nervously awaiting the arrival of his boss he suffered tortures of shyness when at halfpast eight the factory girls for upstairs trooped past him  mr pappleworth arrived chewing a chlorodyne gum at about twenty to nine when all the other men were at work he was a thin sallow man with a red nose quick staccato and smartly but stiffly dressed he was about thirtysix years old there was something rather doggy rather smart rather cute and shrewd and something warm and something slightly contemptible about him  you my new lad he said  paul stood up and said he was  fetched the letters  mr pappleworth gave a chew to his gum  yes  copied em  no  well come on then lets look slippy changed your coat  no  you want to bring an old coat and leave it here he pronounced the last words with the chlorodyne gum between his side teeth he vanished into the darkness behind the great parcelrack reappeared coatless turning up a smart striped shirtcuff over a thin and hairy arm then he slipped into his coat paul noticed how thin he was and that his trousers were in folds behind he seized a stool dragged it beside the boys and sat down  sit down he said  paul took a seat  mr pappleworth was very close to him the man seized the letters snatched a long entrybook out of a rack in front of him flung it open seized a pen and said  now look here you want to copy these letters in here he sniffed twice gave a quick chew at his gum stared fixedly at a letter then went very still and absorbed and wrote the entry rapidly in a beautiful flourishing hand he glanced quickly at paul  see that  yes  think you can do it all right  yes  all right then lets see you  he sprang off his stool paul took a pen mr pappleworth disappeared paul rather liked copying the letters but he wrote slowly laboriously and exceedingly badly he was doing the fourth letter and feeling quite busy and happy when mr pappleworth reappeared  now then howr yer getting on done em  he leaned over the boys shoulder chewing and smelling of chlorodyne  strike my bob lad but youre a beautiful writer he exclaimed satirically neer mind how many hyer done only three id a eaten em get on my lad an put numbers on em here look get on  paul ground away at the letters whilst mr pappleworth fussed over various jobs suddenly the boy started as a shrill whistle sounded near his ear mr pappleworth came took a plug out of a pipe and said in an amazingly cross and bossy voice  yes  paul heard a faint voice like a womans out of the mouth of the tube he gazed in wonder never having seen a speakingtube before  well said mr pappleworth disagreeably into the tube youd better get some of your back work done then  again the womans tiny voice was heard sounding pretty and cross  ive not time to stand here while you talk said mr pappleworth and he pushed the plug into the tube  come my lad he said imploringly to paul theres polly crying out for them orders cant you buck up a bit here come out  he took the book to pauls immense chagrin and began the copying himself he worked quickly and well this done he seized some strips of long yellow paper about three inches wide and made out the days orders for the workgirls  youd better watch me he said to paul working all the while rapidly paul watched the weird little drawings of legs and thighs and ankles with the strokes across and the numbers and the few brief directions which his chief made upon the yellow paper then mr pappleworth finished and jumped up  come on with me he said and the yellow papers flying in his hands he dashed through a door and down some stairs into the basement where the gas was burning they crossed the cold damp storeroom then a long dreary room with a long table on trestles into a smaller cosy apartment not very high which had been built on to the main building in this room a small woman with a red serge blouse and her black hair done on top of her head was waiting like a proud little bantam  here yare said pappleworth  i think it is here you are exclaimed polly the girls have been here nearly half an hour waiting just think of the time wasted  you think of getting your work done and not talking so much said mr pappleworth you could ha been finishing off  you know quite well we finished everything off on saturday cried pony flying at him her dark eyes flashing  tututututerterter he mocked heres your new lad dont ruin him as you did the last  as we did the last repeated polly yes we do a lot of ruining we do my word a lad would take some ruining after hed been with you  its time for work now not for talk said mr pappleworth severely and coldly  it was time for work some time back said polly marching away with her head in the air she was an erect little body of forty  in that room were two round spiral machines on the bench under the window through the inner doorway was another longer room with six more machines a little group of girls nicely dressed in white aprons stood talking together  have you nothing else to do but talk said mr pappleworth  only wait for you said one handsome girl laughing  well get on get on he said come on my lad youll know your road down here again  and paul ran upstairs after his chief he was given some checking and invoicing to do he stood at the desk labouring in his execrable handwriting presently mr jordan came strutting down from the glass office and stood behind him to the boys great discomfort suddenly a red and fat finger was thrust on the form he was filling in  mr j a bates esquire exclaimed the cross voice just behind his ear  paul looked at mr j a bates esquire in his own vile writing and wondered what was the matter now  didnt they teach you any better than that while they were at it if you put mr you dont put esquirea man cant be both at once  the boy regretted his toomuch generosity in disposing of honours hesitated and with trembling fingers scratched out the mr then all at once mr jordan snatched away the invoice  make another are you going to send that to a gentleman and he tore up the blue form irritably  paul his ears red with shame began again still mr jordan watched  i dont know what they do teach in schools youll have to write better than that lads learn nothing nowadays but how to recite poetry and play the fiddle have you seen his writing he asked of mr pappleworth  yes prime isnt it replied mr pappleworth indifferently  mr jordan gave a little grunt not unamiable paul divined that his masters bark was worse than his bite indeed the little manufacturer although he spoke bad english was quite gentleman enough to leave his men alone and to take no notice of trifles but he knew he did not look like the boss and owner of the show so he had to play his role of proprietor at first to put things on a right footing  lets see whats your name asked mr pappleworth of the boy  paul morel  it is curious that children suffer so much at having to pronounce their own names  paul morel is it all right you paulmorel through them things there and then  mr pappleworth subsided on to a stool and began writing a girl came up from out of a door just behind put some newlypressed elastic web appliances on the counter and returned mr pappleworth picked up the whiteyblue kneeband examined it and its yellow orderpaper quickly and put it on one side next was a fleshpink leg he went through the few things wrote out a couple of orders and called to paul to accompany him this time they went through the door whence the girl had emerged there paul found himself at the top of a little wooden flight of steps and below him saw a room with windows round two sides and at the farther end half a dozen girls sitting bending over the benches in the light from the window sewing they were singing together two little girls in blue hearing the door opened they all turned round to see mr pappleworth and paul looking down on them from the far end of the room they stopped singing  cant you make a bit less row said mr pappleworth folkll think we keep cats  a hunchback woman on a high stool turned her long rather heavy face towards mr pappleworth and said in a contralto voice  theyre all tomcats then  in vain mr pappleworth tried to be impressive for pauls benefit he descended the steps into the finishingoff room and went to the hunchback fanny she had such a short body on her high stool that her head with its great bands of bright brown hair seemed over large as did her pale heavy face she wore a dress of greenblack cashmere and her wrists coming out of the narrow cuffs were thin and flat as she put down her work nervously he showed her something that was wrong with a kneecap  well she said you neednt come blaming it on to me its not my fault her colour mounted to her cheek  i never said it was your fault will you do as i tell you replied mr pappleworth shortly  you dont say its my fault but youd like to make out as it was the hunchback woman cried almost in tears then she snatched the kneecap from her boss saying yes ill do it for you but you neednt be snappy  heres your new lad said mr pappleworth  fanny turned smiling very gently on paul  oh she said  yes dont make a softy of him between you  its not us as ud make a softy of him she said indignantly  come on then paul said mr pappleworth  au revoy paul said one of the girls  there was a titter of laughter paul went out blushing deeply not having spoken a word  the day was very long all morning the workpeople were coming to speak to mr pappleworth paul was writing or learning to make up parcels ready for the midday post at one oclock or rather at a quarter to one mr pappleworth disappeared to catch his train he lived in the suburbs at one oclock paul feeling very lost took his dinnerbasket down into the stockroom in the basement that had the long table on trestles and ate his meal hurriedly alone in that cellar of gloom and desolation then he went out of doors the brightness and the freedom of the streets made him feel adventurous and happy but at two oclock he was back in the corner of the big room soon the workgirls went trooping past making remarks it was the commoner girls who worked upstairs at the heavy tasks of trussmaking and the finishing of artificial limbs he waited for mr pappleworth not knowing what to do sitting scribbling on the yellow orderpaper mr pappleworth came at twenty minutes to three then he sat and gossiped with paul treating the boy entirely as an equal even in age  in the afternoon there was never very much to do unless it were near the weekend and the accounts had to be made up at five oclock all the men went down into the dungeon with the table on trestles and there they had tea eating breadandbutter on the bare dirty boards talking with the same kind of ugly haste and slovenliness with which they ate their meal and yet upstairs the atmosphere among them was always jolly and clear the cellar and the trestles affected them  after tea when all the gases were lighted work went more briskly there was the big evening post to get off the hose came up warm and newly pressed from the workrooms paul had made out the invoices now he had the packing up and addressing to do then he had to weigh his stock of parcels on the scales everywhere voices were calling weights there was the chink of metal the rapid snapping of string the hurrying to old mr melling for stamps and at last the postman came with his sack laughing and jolly then everything slacked off and paul took his dinnerbasket and ran to the station to catch the eighttwenty train the day in the factory was just twelve hours long  his mother sat waiting for him rather anxiously he had to walk from keston so was not home until about twenty past nine and he left the house before seven in the morning mrs morel was rather anxious about his health but she herself had had to put up with so much that she expected her children to take the same odds they must go through with what came and paul stayed at jordans although all the time he was there his health suffered from the darkness and lack of air and the long hours  he came in pale and tired his mother looked at him she saw he was rather pleased and her anxiety all went  well and how was it she asked  ever so funny mother he replied you dont have to work a bit hard and theyre nice with you  and did you get on all right  yes they only say my writings bad but mr pappleworthhes my mansaid to mr jordan i should be all right im spiral mother you must come and see its ever so nice  soon he liked jordans mr pappleworth who had a certain saloon bar flavour about him was always natural and treated him as if he had been a comrade sometimes the spiral boss was irritable and chewed more lozenges than ever even then however he was not offensive but one of those people who hurt themselves by their own irritability more than they hurt other people  havent you done that yet he would cry go on be a month of sundays  again and paul could understand him least then he was jocular and in high spirits  im going to bring my little yorkshire terrier bitch tomorrow he said jubilantly to paul  whats a yorkshire terrier  dont know what a yorkshire terrier is dont know a yorkshire mr pappleworth was aghast  is it a little silky onecolours of iron and rusty silver  thats it my lad shes a gem shes had five pounds worth of pups already and shes worth over seven pounds herself and she doesnt weigh twenty ounces  the next day the bitch came she was a shivering miserable morsel paul did not care for her she seemed so like a wet rag that would never dry then a man called for her and began to make coarse jokes but mr pappleworth nodded his head in the direction of the boy and the talk went on sotto voce  mr jordan only made one more excursion to watch paul and then the only fault he found was seeing the boy lay his pen on the counter  put your pen in your ear if youre going to be a clerk pen in your ear and one day he said to the lad why dont you hold your shoulders straighter come down here when he took him into the glass office and fitted him with special braces for keeping the shoulders square  but paul liked the girls best the men seemed common and rather dull he liked them all but they were uninteresting polly the little brisk overseer downstairs finding paul eating in the cellar asked him if she could cook him anything on her little stove next day his mother gave him a dish that could be heated up he took it into the pleasant clean room to polly and very soon it grew to be an established custom that he should have dinner with her when he came in at eight in the morning he took his basket to her and when he came down at one oclock she had his dinner ready  he was not very tall and pale with thick chestnut hair irregular features and a wide full mouth she was like a small bird he often called her a robinet though naturally rather quiet he would sit and chatter with her for hours telling her about his home the girls all liked to hear him talk they often gathered in a little circle while he sat on a bench and held forth to them laughing some of them regarded him as a curious little creature so serious yet so bright and jolly and always so delicate in his way with them they all liked him and he adored them polly he felt he belonged to then connie with her mane of red hair her face of appleblossom her murmuring voice such a lady in her shabby black frock appealed to his romantic side  when you sit winding he said it looks as if you were spinning at a spinningwheelit looks ever so nice you remind me of elaine in the idylls of the king id draw you if i could  and she glanced at him blushing shyly and later on he had a sketch he prized very much connie sitting on the stool before the wheel her flowing mane of red hair on her rusty black frock her red mouth shut and serious running the scarlet thread off the hank on to the reel  with louie handsome and brazen who always seemed to thrust her hip at him he usually joked  emma was rather plain rather old and condescending but to condescend to him made her happy and he did not mind  how do you put needles in he asked  go away and dont bother  but i ought to know how to put needles in  she ground at her machine all the while steadily  there are many things you ought to know she replied  tell me then how to stick needles in the machine  oh the boy what a nuisance he is why this is how you do it  he watched her attentively suddenly a whistle piped then polly appeared and said in a clear voice  mr pappleworth wants to know how much longer youre going to be down here playing with the girls paul  paul flew upstairs calling goodbye and emma drew herself up  it wasnt me who wanted him to play with the machine she said  as a rule when all the girls came back at two oclock he ran upstairs to fanny the hunchback in the finishingoff room mr pappleworth did not appear till twenty to three and he often found his boy sitting beside fanny talking or drawing or singing with the girls  often after a minutes hesitation fanny would begin to sing she had a fine contralto voice everybody joined in the chorus and it went well paul was not at all embarrassed after a while sitting in the room with the half a dozen workgirls  at the end of the song fanny would say  i know youve been laughing at me  dont be so soft fanny cried one of the girls  once there was mention of connies red hair  fannys is better to my fancy said emma  you neednt try to make a fool of me said fanny flushing deeply  no but she has paul shes got beautiful hair  its a treat of a colour said he that coldish colour like earth and yet shiny its like bogwater  goodness me exclaimed one girl laughing  how i do but get criticised said fanny  but you should see it down paul cried emma earnestly its simply beautiful put it down for him fanny if he wants something to paint  fanny would not and yet she wanted to  then ill take it down myself said the lad  well you can if you like said fanny  and he carefully took the pins out of the knot and the rush of hair of uniform dark brown slid over the humped back  what a lovely lot he exclaimed  the girls watched there was silence the youth shook the hair loose from the coil  its splendid he said smelling its perfume ill bet its worth pounds  ill leave it you when i die paul said fanny half joking  you look just like anybody else sitting drying their hair said one of the girls to the longlegged hunchback  poor fanny was morbidly sensitive always imagining insults polly was curt and businesslike the two departments were for ever at war and paul was always finding fanny in tears then he was made the recipient of all her woes and he had to plead her case with polly  so the time went along happily enough the factory had a homely feel no one was rushed or driven paul always enjoyed it when the work got faster towards posttime and all the men united in labour he liked to watch his fellowclerks at work the man was the work and the work was the man one thing for the time being it was different with the girls the real woman never seemed to be there at the task but as if left out waiting  from the train going home at night he used to watch the lights of the town sprinkled thick on the hills fusing together in a blaze in the valleys he felt rich in life and happy drawing farther off there was a patch of lights at bulwell like myriad petals shaken to the ground from the shed stars and beyond was the red glare of the furnaces playing like hot breath on the clouds  he had to walk two and more miles from keston home up two long hills down two short hills he was often tired and he counted the lamps climbing the hill above him how many more to pass and from the hilltop on pitchdark nights he looked round on the villages five or six miles away that shone like swarms of glittering living things almost a heaven against his feet marlpool and heanor scattered the faroff darkness with brilliance and occasionally the black valley space between was traced violated by a great train rushing south to london or north to scotland the trains roared by like projectiles level on the darkness fuming and burning making the valley clang with their passage they were gone and the lights of the towns and villages glittered in silence  and then he came to the corner at home which faced the other side of the night the ashtree seemed a friend now his mother rose with gladness as he entered he put his eight shillings proudly on the table  itll help mother he asked wistfully  theres precious little left she answered after your ticket and dinners and such are taken off  then he told her the budget of the day his lifestory like an arabian nights was told night after night to his mother it was almost as if it were her own life    chapter vi  death in the family  arthur morel was growing up he was a quick careless impulsive boy a good deal like his father he hated study made a great moan if he had to work and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again  in appearance he remained the flower of the family being well made graceful and full of life his dark brown hair and fresh colouring and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with long lashes together with his generous manner and fiery temper made him a favourite but as he grew older his temper became uncertain he flew into rages over nothing seemed unbearably raw and irritable  his mother whom he loved wearied of him sometimes he thought only of himself when he wanted amusement all that stood in his way he hated even if it were she when he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly  goodness boy she said when he groaned about a master who he said hated him if you dont like it alter it and if you cant alter it put up with it  and his father whom he had loved and who had worshipped him he came to detest as he grew older morel fell into a slow ruin his body which had been beautiful in movement and in being shrank did not seem to ripen with the years but to get mean and rather despicable there came over him a look of meanness and of paltriness and when the meanlooking elderly man bullied or ordered the boy about arthur was furious moreover morels manners got worse and worse his habits somewhat disgusting when the children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls his manners in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit  dirty nuisance arthur would cry jumping up and going straight out of the house when his father disgusted him and morel persisted the more because his children hated it he seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them and driving them nearly mad while they were so irritably sensitive at the age of fourteen or fifteen so that arthur who was growing up when his father was degenerate and elderly hated him worst of all  then sometimes the father would seem to feel the contemptuous hatred of his children  theres not a man tries harder for his family he would shout he does his best for them and then gets treated like a dog but im not going to stand it i tell you  but for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard as he imagined they would have felt sorry as it was the battle now went on nearly all between father and children he persisting in his dirty and disgusting ways just to assert his independence they loathed him  arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last that when he won a scholarship for the grammar school in nottingham his mother decided to let him live in town with one of her sisters and only come home at weekends  annie was still a junior teacher in the boardschool earning about four shillings a week but soon she would have fifteen shillings since she had passed her examination and there would be financial peace in the house  mrs morel clung now to paul he was quiet and not brilliant but still he stuck to his painting and still he stuck to his mother everything he did was for her she waited for his coming home in the evening and then she unburdened herself of all she had pondered or of all that had occurred to her during the day he sat and listened with his earnestness the two shared lives  william was engaged now to his brunette and had bought her an engagement ring that cost eight guineas the children gasped at such a fabulous price  eight guineas said morel more fool him if hed gen me some ont it ud ha looked better on im  given you some of it cried mrs morel why give you some of it  she remembered he had bought no engagement ring at all and she preferred william who was not mean if he were foolish but now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went with his betrothed and the different resplendent clothes she wore or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like great swells  he wanted to bring the girl home mrs morel said she should come at the christmas this time william arrived with a lady but with no presents mrs morel had prepared supper hearing footsteps she rose and went to the door william entered  hello mother he kissed her hastily then stood aside to present a tall handsome girl who was wearing a costume of fine blackandwhite check and furs  heres gyp  miss western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile  oh how do you do mrs morel she exclaimed  i am afraid you will be hungry said mrs morel  oh no we had dinner in the train have you got my gloves chubby  william morel big and rawboned looked at her quickly  how should i he said  then ive lost them dont be cross with me  a frown went over his face but he said nothing she glanced round the kitchen it was small and curious to her with its glittering kissingbunch its evergreens behind the pictures its wooden chairs and little deal table at that moment morel came in  hello dad  hello my son thas let on me  the two shook hands and william presented the lady she gave the same smile that showed her teeth  how do you do mr morel  morel bowed obsequiously  im very well and i hope so are you you must make yourself very welcome  oh thank you she replied rather amused  you will like to go upstairs said mrs morel  if you dont mind but not if it is any trouble to you  it is no trouble annie will take you walter carry up this box  and dont be an hour dressing yourself up said william to his betrothed  annie took a brass candlestick and too shy almost to speak preceded the young lady to the front bedroom which mr and mrs morel had vacated for her it too was small and cold by candlelight the colliers wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness  shall i unstrap the box asked annie  oh thank you very much  annie played the part of maid then went downstairs for hot water  i think shes rather tired mother said william its a beastly journey and we had such a rush  is there anything i can give her asked mrs morel  oh no shell be all right  but there was a chill in the atmosphere after half an hour miss western came down having put on a purplishcoloured dress very fine for the colliers kitchen  i told you youd no need to change said william to her  oh chubby then she turned with that sweetish smile to mrs morel dont you think hes always grumbling mrs morel  is he said mrs morel thats not very nice of him  it isnt really  you are cold said the mother wont you come near the fire  morel jumped out of his armchair  come and sit you here he cried come and sit you here  no dad keep your own chair sit on the sofa gyp said william  no no cried morel this cheers warmest come and sit here miss wesson  thank you so much said the girl seating herself in the colliers armchair the place of honour she shivered feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her  fetch me a hanky chubby dear she said putting up her mouth to him and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to be present the young lady evidently did not realise them as people they were creatures to her for the present william winced  in such a household in streatham miss western would have been a lady condescending to her inferiors these people were to her certainly clownishin short the working classes how was she to adjust herself  ill go said annie  miss western took no notice as if a servant had spoken but when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief she said oh thank you in a gracious way  she sat and talked about the dinner on the train which had been so poor about london about dances she was really very nervous and chattered from fear morel sat all the time smoking his thick twist tobacco watching her and listening to her glib london speech as he puffed mrs morel dressed up in her best black silk blouse answered quietly and rather briefly the three children sat round in silence and admiration miss western was the princess everything of the best was got out for her the best cups the best spoons the best table cloth the best coffeejug the children thought she must find it quite grand she felt strange not able to realise the people not knowing how to treat them william joked and was slightly uncomfortable  at about ten oclock he said to her  arent you tired gyp  rather chubby she answered at once in the intimate tones and putting her head slightly on one side  ill light her the candle mother he said  very well replied the mother  miss western stood up held out her hand to mrs morel  goodnight mrs morel she said  paul sat at the boiler letting the water run from the tap into a stone beerbottle annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel pitsinglet and kissed her mother goodnight she was to share the room with the lady because the house was full  you wait a minute said mrs morel to annie and annie sat nursing the hotwater bottle miss western shook hands all round to everybodys discomfort and took her departure preceded by william in five minutes he was downstairs again his heart was rather sore he did not know why he talked very little till everybody had gone to bed but himself and his mother then he stood with his legs apart in his old attitude on the hearthrug and said hesitatingly  well mother  well my son  she sat in the rockingchair feeling somehow hurt and humiliated for his sake  do you like her  yes came the slow answer  shes shy yet mother shes not used to it its different from her aunts house you know  of course it is my boy and she must find it difficult  she does then he frowned swiftly if only she wouldnt put on her blessed airs  its only her first awkwardness my boy shell be all right  thats it mother he replied gratefully but his brow was gloomy you know shes not like you mother shes not serious and she cant think  shes young my boy  yes and shes had no sort of show her mother died when she was a child since then shes lived with her aunt whom she cant bear and her father was a rake shes had no love  no well you must make up to her  and soyou have to forgive her a lot of things  what do you have to forgive her my boy  i dunno when she seems shallow you have to remember shes never had anybody to bring her deeper side out and shes fearfully fond of me  anybody can see that  but you know mothershesshes different from us those sort of people like those she lives amongst they dont seem to have the same principles  you mustnt judge too hastily said mrs morel  but he seemed uneasy within himself  in the morning however he was up singing and larking round the house  hello he called sitting on the stairs are you getting up  yes her voice called faintly  merry christmas he shouted to her  her laugh pretty and tinkling was heard in the bedroom she did not come down in half an hour  was she really getting up when she said she was he asked of annie  yes she was replied annie  he waited a while then went to the stairs again  happy new year he called  thank you chubby dear came the laughing voice far away  buck up he implored  it was nearly an hour and still he was waiting for her morel who always rose before six looked at the clock  well its a winder he exclaimed  the family had breakfasted all but william he went to the foot of the stairs  shall i have to send you an easter egg up there he called rather crossly she only laughed the family expected after that time of preparation something like magic at last she came looking very nice in a blouse and skirt  have you really been all this time getting ready he asked  chubby dear that question is not permitted is it mrs morel  she played the grand lady at first when she went with william to chapel he in his frockcoat and silk hat she in her furs and londonmade costume paul and arthur and annie expected everybody to bow to the ground in admiration and morel standing in his sunday suit at the end of the road watching the gallant pair go felt he was the father of princes and princesses  and yet she was not so grand for a year now she had been a sort of secretary or clerk in a london office but while she was with the morels she queened it she sat and let annie or paul wait on her as if they were her servants she treated mrs morel with a certain glibness and morel with patronage but after a day or so she began to change her tune  william always wanted paul or annie to go along with them on their walks it was so much more interesting and paul really did admire gipsy wholeheartedly in fact his mother scarcely forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl  on the second day when lily said oh annie do you know where i left my muff william replied  you know it is in your bedroom why do you ask annie  and lily went upstairs with a cross shut mouth but it angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister  on the third evening william and lily were sitting together in the parlour by the fire in the dark at a quarter to eleven mrs morel was heard raking the fire william came out to the kitchen followed by his beloved  is it as late as that mother he said she had been sitting alone  it is not late my boy but it is as late as i usually sit up  wont you go to bed then he asked  and leave you two no my boy i dont believe in it  cant you trust us mother  whether i can or not i wont do it you can stay till eleven if you like and i can read  go to bed gyp he said to his girl we wont keep mater waiting  annie has left the candle burning lily said mrs morel i think you will see  yes thank you goodnight mrs morel  william kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs and she went he returned to the kitchen  cant you trust us mother he repeated rather offended  my boy i tell you i dont believe in leaving two young things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed  and he was forced to take this answer he kissed his mother goodnight  at easter he came over alone and then he discussed his sweetheart endlessly with his mother  you know mother when im away from her i dont care for her a bit i shouldnt care if i never saw her again but then when im with her in the evenings i am awfully fond of her  its a queer sort of love to marry on said mrs morel if she holds you no more than that  it is funny he exclaimed it worried and perplexed him but yettheres so much between us now i couldnt give her up  you know best said mrs morel but if it is as you say i wouldnt call it loveat any rate it doesnt look much like it  oh i dont know mother shes an orphan and  they never came to any sort of conclusion he seemed puzzled and rather fretted she was rather reserved all his strength and money went in keeping this girl he could scarcely afford to take his mother to nottingham when he came over  pauls wages had been raised at christmas to ten shillings to his great joy he was quite happy at jordans but his health suffered from the long hours and the confinement his mother to whom he became more and more significant thought how to help  his halfday holiday was on monday afternoon on a monday morning in may as the two sat alone at breakfast she said  i think it will be a fine day  he looked up in surprise this meant something  you know mr leivers has gone to live on a new farm well he asked me last week if i wouldnt go and see mrs leivers and i promised to bring you on monday if its fine shall we go  i say little woman how lovely he cried and well go this afternoon  paul hurried off to the station jubilant down derby road was a cherrytree that glistened the old brick wall by the statutes ground burned scarlet spring was a very flame of green and the steep swoop of highroad lay in its cool morning dust splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow perfectly still the trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly and inside the warehouse all the morning the boy had a vision of spring outside  when he came home at dinnertime his mother was rather excited  are we going he asked  when im ready she replied  presently he got up  go and get dressed while i wash up he said  she did so he washed the pots straightened and then took her boots they were quite clean mrs morel was one of those naturally exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes but paul had to clean them for her they were kid boots at eight shillings a pair he however thought them the most dainty boots in the world and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they had been flowers  suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly she had got a new cotton blouse on paul jumped up and went forward  oh my stars he exclaimed what a bobbydazzler  she sniffed in a little haughty way and put her head up  its not a bobbydazzler at all she replied its very quiet  she walked forward whilst he hovered round her  well she asked quite shy but pretending to be high and mighty do you like it  awfully you are a fine little woman to go jaunting out with  he went and surveyed her from the back  well he said if i was walking down the street behind you i should say doesnt that little person fancy herself  well she doesnt replied mrs morel shes not sure it suits her  oh no she wants to be in dirty black looking as if she was wrapped in burnt paper it does suit you and i say you look nice  she sniffed in her little way pleased but pretending to know better  well she said its cost me just three shillings you couldnt have got it readymade for that price could you  i should think you couldnt he replied  and you know its good stuff  awfully pretty he said  the blouse was white with a little sprig of heliotrope and black  too young for me though im afraid she said  too young for you he exclaimed in disgust why dont you buy some false white hair and stick it on your head  i sll soon have no need she replied im going white fast enough  well youve no business to he said what do i want with a whitehaired mother  im afraid youll have to put up with one my lad she said rather strangely  they set off in great style she carrying the umbrella william had given her because of the sun paul was considerably taller than she though he was not big he fancied himself  on the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily minton pit waved its plumes of white steam coughed and rattled hoarsely  now look at that said mrs morel mother and son stood on the road to watch along the ridge of the great pithill crawled a little group in silhouette against the sky a horse a small truck and a man they climbed the incline against the heavens at the end the man tipped the wagon there was an undue rattle as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank  you sit a minute mother he said and she took a seat on a bank whilst he sketched rapidly she was silent whilst he worked looking round at the afternoon the red cottages shining among their greenness  the world is a wonderful place she said and wonderfully beautiful  and sos the pit he said look how it heaps together like something alive almosta big creature that you dont know  yes she said perhaps  and all the trucks standing waiting like a string of beasts to be fed he said  and very thankful i am they are standing she said for that means theyll turn middling time this week  but i like the feel of men on things while theyre alive theres a feel of men about trucks because theyve been handled with mens hands all of them  yes said mrs morel  they went along under the trees of the highroad he was constantly informing her but she was interested they passed the end of nethermere that was tossing its sunshine like petals lightly in its lap then they turned on a private road and in some trepidation approached a big farm a dog barked furiously a woman came out to see  is this the way to willey farm mrs morel asked  paul hung behind in terror of being sent back but the woman was amiable and directed them the mother and son went through the wheat and oats over a little bridge into a wild meadow peewits with their white breasts glistening wheeled and screamed about them the lake was still and blue high overhead a heron floated opposite the wood heaped on the hill green and still  its a wild road mother said paul just like canada  isnt it beautiful said mrs morel looking round  see that heronseesee her legs  he directed his mother what she must see and what not and she was quite content  but now she said which way he told me through the wood  the wood fenced and dark lay on their left  i can feel a bit of a path this road said paul youve got town feet somehow or other you have  they found a little gate and soon were in a broad green alley of the wood with a new thicket of fir and pine on one hand an old oak glade dipping down on the other and among the oaks the bluebells stood in pools of azure under the new green hazels upon a pale fawn floor of oakleaves he found flowers for her  heres a bit of newmown hay he said then again he brought her forgetmenots and again his heart hurt with love seeing her hand used with work holding the little bunch of flowers he gave her she was perfectly happy  but at the end of the riding was a fence to climb paul was over in a second  come he said let me help you  no go away i will do it in my own way  he stood below with his hands up ready to help her she climbed cautiously  what a way to climb he exclaimed scornfully when she was safely to earth again  hateful stiles she cried  duffer of a little woman he replied who cant get over em  in front along the edge of the wood was a cluster of low red farm buildings the two hastened forward flush with the wood was the apple orchard where blossom was falling on the grindstone the pond was deep under a hedge and overhanging oak trees some cows stood in the shade the farm and buildings three sides of a quadrangle embraced the sunshine towards the wood it was very still  mother and son went into the small railed garden where was a scent of red gillivers by the open door were some floury loaves put out to cool a hen was just coming to peck them then in the doorway suddenly appeared a girl in a dirty apron she was about fourteen years old had a rosy dark face a bunch of short black curls very fine and free and dark eyes shy questioning a little resentful of the strangers she disappeared in a minute another figure appeared a small frail woman rosy with great dark brown eyes  oh she exclaimed smiling with a little glow youve come then i am glad to see you her voice was intimate and rather sad  the two women shook hands  now are you sure were not a bother to you said mrs morel i know what a farming life is  oh no were only too thankful to see a new face its so lost up here  i suppose so said mrs morel  they were taken through into the parloura long low room with a great bunch of guelderroses in the fireplace there the women talked whilst paul went out to survey the land he was in the garden smelling the gillivers and looking at the plants when the girl came out quickly to the heap of coal which stood by the fence  i suppose these are cabbageroses he said to her pointing to the bushes along the fence  she looked at him with startled big brown eyes  i suppose they are cabbageroses when they come out he said  i dont know she faltered theyre white with pink middles  then theyre maidenblush  miriam flushed she had a beautiful warm colouring  i dont know she said  you dont have much in your garden he said  this is our first year here she answered in a distant rather superior way drawing back and going indoors he did not notice but went his round of exploration presently his mother came out and they went through the buildings paul was hugely delighted  and i suppose you have the fowls and calves and pigs to look after said mrs morel to mrs leivers  no replied the little woman i cant find time to look after cattle and im not used to it its as much as i can do to keep going in the house  well i suppose it is said mrs morel  presently the girl came out  tea is ready mother she said in a musical quiet voice  oh thank you miriam then well come replied her mother almost ingratiatingly would you care to have tea now mrs morel  of course said mrs morel whenever its ready  paul and his mother and mrs leivers had tea together then they went out into the wood that was flooded with bluebells while fumy forgetmenots were in the paths the mother and son were in ecstasy together  when they got back to the house mr leivers and edgar the eldest son were in the kitchen edgar was about eighteen then geoffrey and maurice big lads of twelve and thirteen were in from school mr leivers was a goodlooking man in the prime of life with a goldenbrown moustache and blue eyes screwed up against the weather  the boys were condescending but paul scarcely observed it they went round for eggs scrambling into all sorts of places as they were feeding the fowls miriam came out the boys took no notice of her one hen with her yellow chickens was in a coop maurice took his hand full of corn and let the hen peck from it  durst you do it he asked of paul  lets see said paul  he had a small hand warm and rather capablelooking miriam watched he held the corn to the hen the bird eyed it with her hard bright eye and suddenly made a peck into his hand he started and laughed rap rap rap went the birds beak in his palm he laughed again and the other boys joined  she knocks you and nips you but she never hurts said paul when the last corn had gone now miriam said maurice you come an ave a go  no she cried shrinking back  ha baby the mardykid said her brothers  it doesnt hurt a bit said paul it only just nips rather nicely  no she still cried shaking her black curls and shrinking  she dursnt said geoffrey she niver durst do anything except recite poitry  dursnt jump off a gate dursnt tweedle dursnt go on a slide dursnt stop a girl hittin her she can do nowt but go about thinkin herself somebody the lady of the lake yah cried maurice  miriam was crimson with shame and misery  i dare do more than you she cried youre never anything but cowards and bullies  oh cowards and bullies they repeated mincingly mocking her speech       not such a clown shall anger me      a boor is answered silently  he quoted against her shouting with laughter  she went indoors paul went with the boys into the orchard where they had rigged up a parallel bar they did feats of strength he was more agile than strong but it served he fingered a piece of appleblossom that hung low on a swinging bough  i wouldnt get the appleblossom said edgar the eldest brother therell be no apples next year  i wasnt going to get it replied paul going away  the boys felt hostile to him they were more interested in their own pursuits he wandered back to the house to look for his mother as he went round the back he saw miriam kneeling in front of the hencoop some maize in her hand biting her lip and crouching in an intense attitude the hen was eyeing her wickedly very gingerly she put forward her hand the hen bobbed for her she drew back quickly with a cry half of fear half of chagrin  it wont hurt you said paul  she flushed crimson and started up  i only wanted to try she said in a low voice  see it doesnt hurt he said and putting only two corns in his palm he let the hen peck peck peck at his bare hand it only makes you laugh he said  she put her hand forward and dragged it away tried again and started back with a cry he frowned  why id let her take corn from my face said paul only she bumps a bit shes ever so neat if she wasnt look how much ground shed peck up every day  he waited grimly and watched at last miriam let the bird peck from her hand she gave a little cryfear and pain because of fearrather pathetic but she had done it and she did it again  there you see said the boy it doesnt hurt does it  she looked at him with dilated dark eyes  no she laughed trembling  then she rose and went indoors she seemed to be in some way resentful of the boy  he thinks im only a common girl she thought and she wanted to prove she was a grand person like the lady of the lake  paul found his mother ready to go home she smiled on her son he took the great bunch of flowers mr and mrs leivers walked down the fields with them the hills were golden with evening deep in the woods showed the darkening purple of bluebells it was everywhere perfectly stiff save for the rustling of leaves and birds  but it is a beautiful place said mrs morel  yes answered mr leivers its a nice little place if only it werent for the rabbits the pastures bitten down to nothing i dunno if ever i sll get the rent off it  he clapped his hands and the field broke into motion near the woods brown rabbits hopping everywhere  would you believe it exclaimed mrs morel  she and paul went on alone together  wasnt it lovely mother he said quietly  a thin moon was coming out his heart was full of happiness till it hurt his mother had to chatter because she too wanted to cry with happiness  now wouldnt i help that man she said wouldnt i see to the fowls and the young stock and id learn to milk and id talk with him and id plan with him my word if i were his wife the farm would be run i know but there she hasnt the strengthshe simply hasnt the strength she ought never to have been burdened like it you know im sorry for her and im sorry for him too my word if id had him i shouldnt have thought him a bad husband not that she does either and shes very lovable  william came home again with his sweetheart at the whitsuntide he had one week of his holidays then it was beautiful weather as a rule william and lily and paul went out in the morning together for a walk william did not talk to his beloved much except to tell her things from his boyhood paul talked endlessly to both of them they lay down all three in a meadow by minton church on one side by the castle farm was a beautiful quivering screen of poplars hawthorn was dropping from the hedges penny daisies and ragged robin were in the field like laughter william a big fellow of twentythree thinner now and even a bit gaunt lay back in the sunshine and dreamed while she fingered with his hair paul went gathering the big daisies she had taken off her hat her hair was black as a horses mane paul came back and threaded daisies in her jetblack hairbig spangles of white and yellow and just a pink touch of ragged robin  now you look like a young witchwoman the boy said to her doesnt she william  lily laughed william opened his eyes and looked at her in his gaze was a certain baffled look of misery and fierce appreciation  has he made a sight of me she asked laughing down on her lover  that he has said william smiling  he looked at her her beauty seemed to hurt him he glanced at her flowerdecked head and frowned  you look nice enough if thats what you want to know he said  and she walked without her hat in a little while william recovered and was rather tender to her coming to a bridge he carved her initials and his in a heart  l l w  w m  she watched his strong nervous hand with its glistening hairs and freckles as he carved and she seemed fascinated by it  all the time there was a feeling of sadness and warmth and a certain tenderness in the house whilst william and lily were at home but often he got irritable she had brought for an eightdays stay five dresses and six blouses  oh would you mind she said to annie washing me these two blouses and these things  and annie stood washing when william and lily went out the next morning mrs morel was furious and sometimes the young man catching a glimpse of his sweethearts attitude towards his sister hated her  on sunday morning she looked very beautiful in a dress of foulard silky and sweeping and blue as a jaybirds feather and in a large cream hat covered with many roses mostly crimson nobody could admire her enough but in the evening when she was going out she asked again  chubby have you got my gloves  which asked william  my new black suede  no  there was a hunt she had lost them  look here mother said william thats the fourth pair shes lost since christmasat five shillings a pair  you only gave me two of them she remonstrated  and in the evening after supper he stood on the hearthrug whilst she sat on the sofa and he seemed to hate her in the afternoon he had left her whilst he went to see some old friend she had sat looking at a book after supper william wanted to write a letter  here is your book lily said mrs morel would you care to go on with it for a few minutes  no thank you said the girl i will sit still  but it is so dull  william scribbled irritably at a great rate as he sealed the envelope he said  read a book why shes never read a book in her life  oh go along said mrs morel cross with the exaggeration  its true mothershe hasnt he cried jumping up and taking his old position on the hearthrug shes never read a book in her life  ers like me chimed in morel er canna see what there is i books ter sit borin your nose in em for nor more can i  but you shouldnt say these things said mrs morel to her son  but its true mothershe cant read what did you give her  well i gave her a little thing of annie swans nobody wants to read dry stuff on sunday afternoon  well ill bet she didnt read ten lines of it  you are mistaken said his mother  all the time lily sat miserably on the sofa he turned to her swiftly  did you read any he asked  yes i did she replied  how much  i dont know how many pages  tell me one thing you read  she could not  she never got beyond the second page he read a great deal and had a quick active intelligence she could understand nothing but lovemaking and chatter he was accustomed to having all his thoughts sifted through his mothers mind so when he wanted companionship and was asked in reply to be the billing and twittering lover he hated his betrothed  you know mother he said when he was alone with her at night shes no idea of money shes so wesselbrained when shes paid shell suddenly buy such rot as marrons glaces and then i have to buy her season ticket and her extras even her underclothing and she wants to get married and i think myself we might as well get married next year but at this rate  a fine mess of a marriage it would be replied his mother i should consider it again my boy  oh well ive gone too far to break off now he said and so i shall get married as soon as i can  very well my boy if you will you will and theres no stopping you but i tell you i cant sleep when i think about it  oh shell be all right mother we shall manage  and she lets you buy her underclothing asked the mother  well he began apologetically she didnt ask me but one morningand it was coldi found her on the station shivering not able to keep still so i asked her if she was well wrapped up she said i think so so i said have you got warm underthings on and she said no they were cotton i asked her why on earth she hadnt got something thicker on in weather like that and she said because she had nothing and there she isa bronchial subject i had to take her and get some warm things well mother i shouldnt mind the money if we had any and you know she ought to keep enough to pay for her seasonticket but no she comes to me about that and i have to find the money  its a poor lookout said mrs morel bitterly  he was pale and his rugged face that used to be so perfectly careless and laughing was stamped with conflict and despair  but i cant give her up now its gone too far he said and besides for some things i couldnt do without her  my boy remember youre taking your life in your hands said mrs morel nothing is as bad as a marriage thats a hopeless failure mine was bad enough god knows and ought to teach you something but it might have been worse by a long chalk  he leaned with his back against the side of the chimneypiece his hands in his pockets he was a big rawboned man who looked as if he would go to the worlds end if he wanted to but she saw the despair on his face  i couldnt give her up now he said  well she said remember there are worse wrongs than breaking off an engagement  i cant give her up now he said  the clock ticked on mother and son remained in silence a conflict between them but he would say no more at last she said  well go to bed my son youll feel better in the morning and perhaps youll know better  he kissed her and went she raked the fire her heart was heavy now as it had never been before with her husband things had seemed to be breaking down in her but they did not destroy her power to live now her soul felt lamed in itself it was her hope that was struck  and so often william manifested the same hatred towards his betrothed on the last evening at home he was railing against her  well he said if you dont believe me what shes like would you believe she has been confirmed three times  nonsense laughed mrs morel  nonsense or not she has thats what confirmation means for hera bit of a theatrical show where she can cut a figure  i havent mrs morel cried the girli havent it is not true  what he cried flashing round on her once in bromley once in beckenham and once somewhere else  nowhere else she said in tearsnowhere else  it was and if it wasnt why were you confirmed twice  once i was only fourteen mrs morel she pleaded tears in her eyes  yes said mrs morel i can quite understand it child take no notice of him you ought to be ashamed william saying such things  but its true shes religiousshe had blue velvet prayerbooksand shes not as much religion or anything else in her than that tableleg gets confirmed three times for show to show herself off and thats how she is in everythingeverything  the girl sat on the sofa crying she was not strong  as for love he cried you might as well ask a fly to love you itll love settling on you  now say no more commanded mrs morel if you want to say these things you must find another place than this i am ashamed of you william why dont you be more manly to do nothing but find fault with a girl and then pretend youre engaged to her  mrs morel subsided in wrath and indignation  william was silent and later he repented kissed and comforted the girl yet it was true what he had said he hated her  when they were going away mrs morel accompanied them as far as nottingham it was a long way to keston station  you know mother he said to her gyps shallow nothing goes deep with her  william i wish you wouldnt say these things said mrs morel very uncomfortable for the girl who walked beside her  but it doesnt mother shes very much in love with me now but if i died shed have forgotten me in three months  mrs morel was afraid her heart beat furiously hearing the quiet bitterness of her sons last speech  how do you know she replied you dont know and therefore youve no right to say such a thing  hes always saying these things cried the girl  in three months after i was buried youd have somebody else and i should be forgotten he said and thats your love  mrs morel saw them into the train in nottingham then she returned home  theres one comfort she said to paulhell never have any money to marry on that i am sure of and so shell save him that way  so she took cheer matters were not yet very desperate she firmly believed william would never marry his gipsy she waited and she kept paul near to her  all summer long williams letters had a feverish tone he seemed unnatural and intense sometimes he was exaggeratedly jolly usually he was flat and bitter in his letter  ah his mother said im afraid hes ruining himself against that creature who isnt worthy of his loveno no more than a rag doll  he wanted to come home the midsummer holiday was gone it was a long while to christmas he wrote in wild excitement saying he could come for saturday and sunday at goose fair the first week in october  you are not well my boy said his mother when she saw him she was almost in tears at having him to herself again  no ive not been well he said ive seemed to have a dragging cold all the last month but its going i think  it was sunny october weather he seemed wild with joy like a schoolboy escaped then again he was silent and reserved he was more gaunt than ever and there was a haggard look in his eyes  you are doing too much said his mother to him  he was doing extra work trying to make some money to marry on he said he only talked to his mother once on the saturday night then he was sad and tender about his beloved  and yet you know mother for all that if i died shed be brokenhearted for two months and then shed start to forget me youd see shed never come home here to look at my grave not even once  why william said his mother youre not going to die so why talk about it  but whether or not he replied  and she cant help it she is like that and if you choose herwell you cant grumble said his mother  on the sunday morning as he was putting his collar on  look he said to his mother holding up his chin what a rash my collars made under my chin  just at the junction of chin and throat was a big red inflammation  it ought not to do that said his mother here put a bit of this soothing ointment on you should wear different collars  he went away on sunday midnight seeming better and more solid for his two days at home  on tuesday morning came a telegram from london that he was ill mrs morel got off her knees from washing the floor read the telegram called a neighbour went to her landlady and borrowed a sovereign put on her things and set off she hurried to keston caught an express for london in nottingham she had to wait in nottingham nearly an hour a small figure in her black bonnet she was anxiously asking the porters if they knew how to get to elmers end the journey was three hours she sat in her corner in a kind of stupor never moving at kings cross still no one could tell her how to get to elmers end carrying her string bag that contained her nightdress a comb and brush she went from person to person at last they sent her underground to cannon street  it was six oclock when she arrived at williams lodging the blinds were not down  how is he she asked  no better said the landlady  she followed the woman upstairs william lay on the bed with bloodshot eyes his face rather discoloured the clothes were tossed about there was no fire in the room a glass of milk stood on the stand at his bedside no one had been with him  why my son said the mother bravely  he did not answer he looked at her but did not see her then he began to say in a dull voice as if repeating a letter from dictation owing to a leakage in the hold of this vessel the sugar had set and become converted into rock it needed hacking  he was quite unconscious it had been his business to examine some such cargo of sugar in the port of london  how long has he been like this the mother asked the landlady  he got home at six oclock on monday morning and he seemed to sleep all day then in the night we heard him talking and this morning he asked for you so i wired and we fetched the doctor  will you have a fire made  mrs morel tried to soothe her son to keep him still  the doctor came it was pneumonia and he said a peculiar erysipelas which had started under the chin where the collar chafed and was spreading over the face he hoped it would not get to the brain  mrs morel settled down to nurse she prayed for william prayed that he would recognise her but the young mans face grew more discoloured in the night she struggled with him he raved and raved and would not come to consciousness at two oclock in a dreadful paroxysm he died  mrs morel sat perfectly still for an hour in the lodging bedroom then she roused the household  at six oclock with the aid of the charwoman she laid him out then she went round the dreary london village to the registrar and the doctor  at nine oclock to the cottage on scargill street came another wire  william died last night let father come bring money  annie paul and arthur were at home mr morel was gone to work the three children said not a word annie began to whimper with fear paul set off for his father  it was a beautiful day at brinsley pit the white steam melted slowly in the sunshine of a soft blue sky the wheels of the headstocks twinkled high up the screen shuffling its coal into the trucks made a busy noise  i want my father hes got to go to london said the boy to the first man he met on the bank  tha wants walter morel go in theer an tell joe ward  paul went into the little top office  i want my father hes got to go to london  thy feyther is he down whats his name  mr morel  what walter is owt amiss  hes got to go to london  the man went to the telephone and rang up the bottom office  walter morels wanted number 42 hard summats amiss theres his lad here  then he turned round to paul  hell be up in a few minutes he said  paul wandered out to the pittop he watched the chair come up with its wagon of coal the great iron cage sank back on its rest a full carfle was hauled off an empty tram run on to the chair a bell tinged somewhere the chair heaved then dropped like a stone  paul did not realise william was dead it was impossible with such a bustle going on the pulleroff swung the small truck on to the turntable another man ran with it along the bank down the curving lines  and william is dead and my mothers in london and what will she be doing the boy asked himself as if it were a conundrum  he watched chair after chair come up and still no father at last standing beside a wagon a mans form the chair sank on its rests morel stepped off he was slightly lame from an accident  is it thee paul is e worse  youve got to go to london  the two walked off the pitbank where men were watching curiously as they came out and went along the railway with the sunny autumn field on one side and a wall of trucks on the other morel said in a frightened voice  es niver gone child  yes  when wort  last night we had a telegram from my mother  morel walked on a few strides then leaned up against a truckside his hand over his eyes he was not crying paul stood looking round waiting on the weighing machine a truck trundled slowly paul saw everything except his father leaning against the truck as if he were tired  morel had only once before been to london he set off scared and peaked to help his wife that was on tuesday the children were left alone in the house paul went to work arthur went to school and annie had in a friend to be with her  on saturday night as paul was turning the corner coming home from keston he saw his mother and father who had come to sethley bridge station they were walking in silence in the dark tired straggling apart the boy waited  mother he said in the darkness  mrs morels small figure seemed not to observe he spoke again  paul she said uninterestedly  she let him kiss her but she seemed unaware of him  in the house she was the samesmall white and mute she noticed nothing she said nothing only  the coffin will be here tonight walter youd better see about some help then turning to the children were bringing him home  then she relapsed into the same mute looking into space her hands folded on her lap paul looking at her felt he could not breathe the house was dead silent  i went to work mother he said plaintively  did you she answered dully  after half an hour morel troubled and bewildered came in again  wheer sll we hae him when he does come he asked his wife  in the frontroom  then id better shift th table  yes  an hae him across th chairs  you know thereyes i suppose so  morel and paul went with a candle into the parlour there was no gas there the father unscrewed the top of the big mahogany oval table and cleared the middle of the room then he arranged six chairs opposite each other so that the coffin could stand on their beds  you niver seed such a length as he is said the miner and watching anxiously as he worked  paul went to the bay window and looked out the ashtree stood monstrous and black in front of the wide darkness it was a faintly luminous night paul went back to his mother  at ten oclock morel called  hes here  everyone started there was a noise of unbarring and unlocking the front door which opened straight from the night into the room  bring another candle called morel  annie and arthur went paul followed with his mother he stood with his arm round her waist in the inner doorway down the middle of the cleared room waited six chairs face to face in the window against the lace curtains arthur held up one candle and by the open door against the night annie stood leaning forward her brass candlestick glittering  there was the noise of wheels outside in the darkness of the street below paul could see horses and a black vehicle one lamp and a few pale faces then some men miners all in their shirtsleeves seemed to struggle in the obscurity presently two men appeared bowed beneath a great weight it was morel and his neighbour  steady called morel out of breath  he and his fellow mounted the steep garden step heaved into the candlelight with their gleaming coffinend limbs of other men were seen struggling behind morel and burns in front staggered the great dark weight swayed  steady steady cried morel as if in pain  all the six bearers were up in the small garden holding the great coffin aloft there were three more steps to the door the yellow lamp of the carriage shone alone down the black road  now then said morel  the coffin swayed the men began to mount the three steps with their load annies candle flickered and she whimpered as the first men appeared and the limbs and bowed heads of six men struggled to climb into the room bearing the coffin that rode like sorrow on their living flesh  oh my sonmy son mrs morel sang softly and each time the coffin swung to the unequal climbing of the men oh my sonmy sonmy son  mother paul whimpered his hand round her waist  she did not hear  oh my sonmy son she repeated  paul saw drops of sweat fall from his fathers brow six men were in the roomsix coatless men with yielding struggling limbs filling the room and knocking against the furniture the coffin veered and was gently lowered on to the chairs the sweat fell from morels face on its boards  my word hes a weight said a man and the five miners sighed bowed and trembling with the struggle descended the steps again closing the door behind them  the family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box william when laid out was six feet four inches long like a monument lay the bright brown ponderous coffin paul thought it would never be got out of the room again his mother was stroking the polished wood  they buried him on the monday in the little cemetery on the hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses it was sunny and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves in the warmth  mrs morel could not be persuaded after this to talk and take her old bright interest in life she remained shut off all the way home in the train she had said to herself if only it could have been me  when paul came home at night he found his mother sitting her days work done with hands folded in her lap upon her coarse apron she always used to have changed her dress and put on a black apron before now annie set his supper and his mother sat looking blankly in front of her her mouth shut tight then he beat his brains for news to tell her  mother miss jordan was down today and she said my sketch of a colliery at work was beautiful  but mrs morel took no notice night after night he forced himself to tell her things although she did not listen it drove him almost insane to have her thus at last  whats amatter mother he asked  she did not hear  whats amatter he persisted mother whats amatter  you know whats the matter she said irritably turning away  the ladhe was sixteen years oldwent to bed drearily he was cut off and wretched through october november and december his mother tried but she could not rouse herself she could only brood on her dead son he had been let to die so cruelly  at last on december 23 with his five shillings christmasbox in his pocket paul wandered blindly home his mother looked at him and her heart stood still  whats the matter she asked  im badly mother he replied mr jordan gave me five shillings for a christmasbox  he handed it to her with trembling hands she put it on the table  you arent glad he reproached her but he trembled violently  where hurts you she said unbuttoning his overcoat  it was the old question  i feel badly mother  she undressed him and put him to bed he had pneumonia dangerously the doctor said  might he never have had it if id kept him at home not let him go to nottingham was one of the first things she asked  he might not have been so bad said the doctor  mrs morel stood condemned on her own ground  i should have watched the living not the dead she told herself  paul was very ill his mother lay in bed at nights with him they could not afford a nurse he grew worse and the crisis approached one night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly sickly feeling of dissolution when all the cells in the body seem in intense irritability to be breaking down and consciousness makes a last flare of struggle like madness  i sll die mother he cried heaving for breath on the pillow  she lifted him up crying in a small voice  oh my sonmy son  that brought him to he realised her his whole will rose up and arrested him he put his head on her breast and took ease of her for love  for some things said his aunt it was a good thing paul was ill that christmas i believe it saved his mother  paul was in bed for seven weeks he got up white and fragile his father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips they used to flame in the window in the march sunshine as he sat on the sofa chattering to his mother the two knitted together in perfect intimacy mrs morels life now rooted itself in paul  william had been a prophet mrs morel had a little present and a letter from lily at christmas mrs morels sister had a letter at the new year  i was at a ball last night some delightful people were there and i enjoyed myself thoroughly said the letter i had every dancedid not sit out one  mrs morel never heard any more of her  morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time after the death of their son he would go into a kind of daze staring wideeyed and blank across the room then he got up suddenly and hurried out to the three spots returning in his normal state but never in his life would he go for a walk up shepstone past the office where his son had worked and he always avoided the cemetery    part two  chapter vii  ladandgirl love  paul had been many times up to willey farm during the autumn he was friends with the two youngest boys edgar the eldest would not condescend at first and miriam also refused to be approached she was afraid of being set at nought as by her own brothers the girl was romantic in her soul everywhere was a walter scott heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps she herself was something of a princess turned into a swinegirl in her own imagination and she was afraid lest this boy who nevertheless looked something like a walter scott hero who could paint and speak french and knew what algebra meant and who went by train to nottingham every day might consider her simply as the swinegirl unable to perceive the princess beneath so she held aloof  her great companion was her mother they were both browneyed and inclined to be mystical such women as treasure religion inside them breathe it in their nostrils and see the whole of life in a mist thereof so to miriam christ and god made one great figure which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset burned out the western sky and ediths and lucys and rowenas brian de bois guilberts rob roys and guy mannerings rustled the sunny leaves in the morning or sat in her bedroom aloft alone when it snowed that was life to her for the rest she drudged in the house which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been mucked up immediately by the trampling farmboots of her brothers she madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe him and stifle him in her love she went to church reverently with bowed head and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the other choirgirls and from the commonsounding voice of the curate she fought with her brothers whom she considered brutal louts and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart but only wanted to have as easy a time as he could and his meals when he was ready for them  she hated her position as swinegirl she wanted to be considered she wanted to learn thinking that if she could read as paul said he could read colomba or the voyage autour de ma chambre the world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect she could not be princess by wealth or standing so she was mad to have learning whereon to pride herself for she was different from other folk and must not be scooped up among the common fry learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire  her beautythat of a shy wild quiveringly sensitive thingseemed nothing to her even her soul so strong for rhapsody was not enough she must have something to reinforce her pride because she felt different from other people paul she eyed rather wistfully on the whole she scorned the male sex but here was a new specimen quick light graceful who could be gentle and who could be sad and who was clever and who knew a lot and who had a death in the family the boys poor morsel of learning exalted him almost skyhigh in her esteem yet she tried hard to scorn him because he would not see in her the princess but only the swinegirl and he scarcely observed her  then he was so ill and she felt he would be weak then she would be stronger than he then she could love him if she could be mistress of him in his weakness take care of him if he could depend on her if she could as it were have him in her arms how she would love him  as soon as the skies brightened and plumblossom was out paul drove off in the milkmans heavy float up to willey farm mr leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy then clicked to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly in the freshness of the morning white clouds went on their way crowding to the back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime the water of nethermere lay below very blue against the seared meadows and the thorntrees  it was four and a half miles drive tiny buds on the hedges vivid as coppergreen were opening into rosettes and thrushes called and blackbirds shrieked and scolded it was a new glamorous world  miriam peeping through the kitchen window saw the horse walk through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the oakwood still bare then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down he put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the goodlooking ruddy farmer handed down to him  miriam appeared in the doorway she was nearly sixteen very beautiful with her warm colouring her gravity her eyes dilating suddenly like an ecstasy  i say said paul turning shyly aside your daffodils are nearly out isnt it early but dont they look cold  cold said miriam in her musical caressing voice  the green on their buds and he faltered into silence timidly  let me take the rug said miriam overgently  i can carry it he answered rather injured but he yielded it to her  then mrs leivers appeared  im sure youre tired and cold she said let me take your coat it is heavy you mustnt walk far in it  she helped him off with his coat he was quite unused to such attention she was almost smothered under its weight  why mother laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen swinging the great milkchurns youve got almost more than you can manage there  she beat up the sofa cushions for the youth  the kitchen was very small and irregular the farm had been originally a labourers cottage and the furniture was old and battered but paul loved itloved the sackbag that formed the hearthrug and the funny little corner under the stairs and the small window deep in the corner through which bending a little he could see the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond  wont you lie down said mrs leivers  oh no im not tired he said isnt it lovely coming out dont you think i saw a sloebush in blossom and a lot of celandines im glad its sunny  can i give you anything to eat or to drink  no thank you  hows your mother  i think shes tired now i think shes had too much to do perhaps in a little while shell go to skegness with me then shell be able to rest i sll be glad if she can  yes replied mrs leivers its a wonder she isnt ill herself  miriam was moving about preparing dinner paul watched everything that happened his face was pale and thin but his eyes were quick and bright with life as ever he watched the strange almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about carrying a great stewjar to the oven or looking in the saucepan the atmosphere was different from that of his own home where everything seemed so ordinary when mr leivers called loudly outside to the horse that was reaching over to feed on the rosebushes in the garden the girl started looked round with dark eyes as if something had come breaking in on her world there was a sense of silence inside the house and out miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale a maiden in bondage her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical and her discoloured old blue frock and her broken boots seemed only like the romantic rags of king cophetuas beggarmaid  she suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her taking her all in instantly her broken boots and her frayed old frock hurt her she resented his seeing everything even he knew that her stocking was not pulled up she went into the scullery blushing deeply and afterwards her hands trembled slightly at her work she nearly dropped all she handled when her inside dream was shaken her body quivered with trepidation she resented that he saw so much  mrs leivers sat for some time talking to the boy although she was needed at her work she was too polite to leave him presently she excused herself and rose after a while she looked into the tin saucepan  oh dear miriam she cried these potatoes have boiled dry  miriam started as if she had been stung  have they mother she cried  i shouldnt care miriam said the mother if i hadnt trusted them to you she peered into the pan  the girl stiffened as if from a blow her dark eyes dilated she remained standing in the same spot  well she answered gripped tight in selfconscious shame im sure i looked at them five minutes since  yes said the mother i know its easily done  theyre not much burned said paul it doesnt matter does it  mrs leivers looked at the youth with her brown hurt eyes  it wouldnt matter but for the boys she said to him only miriam knows what a trouble they make if the potatoes are caught  then thought paul to himself you shouldnt let them make a trouble  after a while edgar came in he wore leggings and his boots were covered with earth he was rather small rather formal for a farmer he glanced at paul nodded to him distantly and said  dinner ready  nearly edgar replied the mother apologetically  im ready for mine said the young man taking up the newspaper and reading presently the rest of the family trooped in dinner was served the meal went rather brutally the overgentleness and apologetic tone of the mother brought out all the brutality of manners in the sons edgar tasted the potatoes moved his mouth quickly like a rabbit looked indignantly at his mother and said  these potatoes are burnt mother  yes edgar i forgot them for a minute perhaps youll have bread if you cant eat them  edgar looked in anger across at miriam  what was miriam doing that she couldnt attend to them he said  miriam looked up her mouth opened her dark eyes blazed and winced but she said nothing she swallowed her anger and her shame bowing her dark head  im sure she was trying hard said the mother  she hasnt got sense even to boil the potatoes said edgar what is she kept at home for  ony for eating everything thats left in th pantry said maurice  they dont forget that potatopie against our miriam laughed the father  she was utterly humiliated the mother sat in silence suffering like some saint out of place at the brutal board  it puzzled paul he wondered vaguely why all this intense feeling went running because of a few burnt potatoes the mother exalted everythingeven a bit of houseworkto the plane of a religious trust the sons resented this they felt themselves cut away underneath and they answered with brutality and also with a sneering superciliousness  paul was just opening out from childhood into manhood this atmosphere where everything took a religious value came with a subtle fascination to him there was something in the air his own mother was logical here there was something different something he loved something that at times he hated  miriam quarrelled with her brothers fiercely later in the afternoon when they had gone away again her mother said  you disappointed me at dinnertime miriam  the girl dropped her head  they are such brutes she suddenly cried looking up with flashing eyes  but hadnt you promised not to answer them said the mother and i believed in you i cant stand it when you wrangle  but theyre so hateful cried miriam andand low  yes dear but how often have i asked you not to answer edgar back cant you let him say what he likes  but why should he say what he likes  arent you strong enough to bear it miriam if even for my sake are you so weak that you must wrangle with them  mrs leivers stuck unflinchingly to this doctrine of the other cheek she could not instil it at all into the boys with the girls she succeeded better and miriam was the child of her heart the boys loathed the other cheek when it was presented to them miriam was often sufficiently lofty to turn it then they spat on her and hated her but she walked in her proud humility living within herself  there was always this feeling of jangle and discord in the leivers family although the boys resented so bitterly this eternal appeal to their deeper feelings of resignation and proud humility yet it had its effect on them they could not establish between themselves and an outsider just the ordinary human feeling and unexaggerated friendship they were always restless for the something deeper ordinary folk seemed shallow to them trivial and inconsiderable and so they were unaccustomed painfully uncouth in the simplest social intercourse suffering and yet insolent in their superiority then beneath was the yearning for the soulintimacy to which they could not attain because they were too dumb and every approach to close connection was blocked by their clumsy contempt of other people they wanted genuine intimacy but they could not get even normally near to anyone because they scorned to take the first steps they scorned the triviality which forms common human intercourse  paul fell under mrs leiverss spell everything had a religious and intensified meaning when he was with her his soul hurt highly developed sought her as if for nourishment together they seemed to sift the vital fact from an experience  miriam was her mothers daughter in the sunshine of the afternoon mother and daughter went down the fields with him they looked for nests there was a jenny wrens in the hedge by the orchard  i do want you to see this said mrs leivers  he crouched down and carefully put his finger through the thorns into the round door of the nest  its almost as if you were feeling inside the live body of the bird he said its so warm they say a bird makes its nest round like a cup with pressing its breast on it then how did it make the ceiling round i wonder  the nest seemed to start into life for the two women after that miriam came to see it every day it seemed so close to her again going down the hedgeside with the girl he noticed the celandines scalloped splashes of gold on the side of the ditch  i like them he said when their petals go flat back with the sunshine they seemed to be pressing themselves at the sun  and then the celandines ever after drew her with a little spell anthropomorphic as she was she stimulated him into appreciating things thus and then they lived for her she seemed to need things kindling in her imagination or in her soul before she felt she had them and she was cut off from ordinary life by her religious intensity which made the world for her either a nunnery garden or a paradise where sin and knowledge were not or else an ugly cruel thing  so it was in this atmosphere of subtle intimacy this meeting in their common feeling for something in nature that their love started  personally he was a long time before he realized her for ten months he had to stay at home after his illness for a while he went to skegness with his mother and was perfectly happy but even from the seaside he wrote long letters to mrs leivers about the shore and the sea and he brought back his beloved sketches of the flat lincoln coast anxious for them to see almost they would interest the leivers more than they interested his mother it was not his art mrs morel cared about it was himself and his achievement but mrs leivers and her children were almost his disciples they kindled him and made him glow to his work whereas his mothers influence was to make him quietly determined patient dogged unwearied  he soon was friends with the boys whose rudeness was only superficial they had all when they could trust themselves a strange gentleness and lovableness  will you come with me on to the fallow asked edgar rather hesitatingly  paul went joyfully and spent the afternoon helping to hoe or to single turnips with his friend he used to lie with the three brothers in the hay piled up in the barn and tell them about nottingham and about jordans in return they taught him to milk and let him do little jobschopping hay or pulping turnipsjust as much as he liked at midsummer he worked all through hayharvest with them and then he loved them the family was so cut off from the world actually they seemed somehow like les derniers fils dune race epuisee though the lads were strong and healthy yet they had all that oversensitiveness and hangingback which made them so lonely yet also such close delicate friends once their intimacy was won paul loved them dearly and they him  miriam came later but he had come into her life before she made any mark on his one dull afternoon when the men were on the land and the rest at school only miriam and her mother at home the girl said to him after having hesitated for some time  have you seen the swing  no he answered where  in the cowshed she replied  she always hesitated to offer or to show him anything men have such different standards of worth from women and her dear thingsthe valuable things to herher brothers had so often mocked or flouted  come on then he replied jumping up  there were two cowsheds one on either side of the barn in the lower darker shed there was standing for four cows hens flew scolding over the mangerwall as the youth and girl went forward for the great thick rope which hung from the beam in the darkness overhead and was pushed back over a peg in the wall  its something like a rope he exclaimed appreciatively and he sat down on it anxious to try it then immediately he rose  come on then and have first go he said to the girl  see she answered going into the barn we put some bags on the seat and she made the swing comfortable for him that gave her pleasure he held the rope  come on then he said to her  no i wont go first she answered  she stood aside in her still aloof fashion  why  you go she pleaded  almost for the first time in her life she had the pleasure of giving up to a man of spoiling him paul looked at her  all right he said sitting down mind out  he set off with a spring and in a moment was flying through the air almost out of the door of the shed the upper half of which was open showing outside the drizzling rain the filthy yard the cattle standing disconsolate against the black cartshed and at the back of all the greygreen wall of the wood she stood below in her crimson tamoshanter and watched he looked down at her and she saw his blue eyes sparkling  its a treat of a swing he said  yes  he was swinging through the air every bit of him swinging like a bird that swoops for joy of movement and he looked down at her her crimson cap hung over her dark curls her beautiful warm face so still in a kind of brooding was lifted towards him it was dark and rather cold in the shed suddenly a swallow came down from the high roof and darted out of the door  i didnt know a bird was watching he called  he swung negligently she could feel him falling and lifting through the air as if he were lying on some force  now ill die he said in a detached dreamy voice as though he were the dying motion of the swing she watched him fascinated suddenly he put on the brake and jumped out  ive had a long turn he said but its a treat of a swingits a real treat of a swing  miriam was amused that he took a swing so seriously and felt so warmly over it  no you go on she said  why dont you want one he asked astonished  well not much ill have just a little  she sat down whilst he kept the bags in place for her  its so ripping he said setting her in motion keep your heels up or theyll bang the manger wall  she felt the accuracy with which he caught her exactly at the right moment and the exactly proportionate strength of his thrust and she was afraid down to her bowels went the hot wave of fear she was in his hands again firm and inevitable came the thrust at the right moment she gripped the rope almost swooning  ha she laughed in fear no higher  but youre not a bit high he remonstrated  but no higher  he heard the fear in her voice and desisted her heart melted in hot pain when the moment came for him to thrust her forward again but he left her alone she began to breathe  wont you really go any farther he asked should i keep you there  no let me go by myself she answered  he moved aside and watched her  why youre scarcely moving he said  she laughed slightly with shame and in a moment got down  they say if you can swing you wont be seasick he said as he mounted again i dont believe i should ever be seasick  away he went there was something fascinating to her in him for the moment he was nothing but a piece of swinging stuff not a particle of him that did not swing she could never lose herself so nor could her brothers it roused a warmth in her it was almost as if he were a flame that had lit a warmth in her whilst he swung in the middle air  and gradually the intimacy with the family concentrated for paul on three personsthe mother edgar and miriam to the mother he went for that sympathy and that appeal which seemed to draw him out edgar was his very close friend and to miriam he more or less condescended because she seemed so humble  but the girl gradually sought him out if he brought up his sketchbook it was she who pondered longest over the last picture then she would look up at him suddenly her dark eyes alight like water that shakes with a stream of gold in the dark she would ask  why do i like this so  always something in his breast shrank from these close intimate dazzled looks of hers  why do you he asked  i dont know it seems so true  its becauseits because there is scarcely any shadow in it its more shimmery as if id painted the shimmering protoplasm in the leaves and everywhere and not the stiffness of the shape that seems dead to me only this shimmeriness is the real living the shape is a dead crust the shimmer is inside really  and she with her little finger in her mouth would ponder these sayings they gave her a feeling of life again and vivified things which had meant nothing to her she managed to find some meaning in his struggling abstract speeches and they were the medium through which she came distinctly at her beloved objects  another day she sat at sunset whilst he was painting some pinetrees which caught the red glare from the west he had been quiet  there you are he said suddenly i wanted that now look at them and tell me are they pine trunks or are they red coals standingup pieces of fire in that darkness theres gods burning bush for you that burned not away  miriam looked and was frightened but the pine trunks were wonderful to her and distinct he packed his box and rose suddenly he looked at her  why are you always sad he asked her  sad she exclaimed looking up at him with startled wonderful brown eyes  yes he replied you are always sad  i am notoh not a bit she cried  but even your joy is like a flame coming off of sadness he persisted youre never jolly or even just all right  no she pondered i wonderwhy  because youre not because youre different inside like a pinetree and then you flare up but youre not just like an ordinary tree with fidgety leaves and jolly  he got tangled up in his own speech but she brooded on it and he had a strange roused sensation as if his feelings were new she got so near him it was a strange stimulant  then sometimes he hated her her youngest brother was only five he was a frail lad with immense brown eyes in his quaint fragile faceone of reynoldss choir of angels with a touch of elf often miriam kneeled to the child and drew him to her  eh my hubert she sang in a voice heavy and surcharged with love eh my hubert  and folding him in her arms she swayed slightly from side to side with love her face half lifted her eyes half closed her voice drenched with love  dont said the child uneasydont miriam  yes you love me dont you she murmured deep in her throat almost as if she were in a trance and swaying also as if she were swooned in an ecstasy of love  dont repeated the child a frown on his clear brow  you love me dont you she murmured  what do you make such a fuss for cried paul all in suffering because of her extreme emotion why cant you be ordinary with him  she let the child go and rose and said nothing her intensity which would leave no emotion on a normal plane irritated the youth into a frenzy and this fearful naked contact of her on small occasions shocked him he was used to his mothers reserve and on such occasions he was thankful in his heart and soul that he had his mother so sane and wholesome  all the life of miriams body was in her eyes which were usually dark as a dark church but could flame with light like a conflagration her face scarcely ever altered from its look of brooding she might have been one of the women who went with mary when jesus was dead her body was not flexible and living she walked with a swing rather heavily her head bowed forward pondering she was not clumsy and yet none of her movements seemed quite the movement often when wiping the dishes she would stand in bewilderment and chagrin because she had pulled in two halves a cup or a tumbler it was as if in her fear and selfmistrust she put too much strength into the effort there was no looseness or abandon about her everything was gripped stiff with intensity and her effort overcharged closed in on itself  she rarely varied from her swinging forward intense walk occasionally she ran with paul down the fields then her eyes blazed naked in a kind of ecstasy that frightened him but she was physically afraid if she were getting over a stile she gripped his hands in a little hard anguish and began to lose her presence of mind and he could not persuade her to jump from even a small height her eyes dilated became exposed and palpitating  no she cried half laughing in terrorno  you shall he cried once and jerking her forward he brought her falling from the fence but her wild ah of pain as if she were losing consciousness cut him she landed on her feet safely and afterwards had courage in this respect  she was very much dissatisfied with her lot  dont you like being at home paul asked her surprised  who would she answered low and intense what is it im all day cleaning what the boys make just as bad in five minutes i dont want to be at home  what do you want then  i want to do something i want a chance like anybody else why should i because im a girl be kept at home and not allowed to be anything what chance have i  chance of what  of knowing anythingof learning of doing anything its not fair because im a woman  she seemed very bitter paul wondered in his own home annie was almost glad to be a girl she had not so much responsibility things were lighter for her she never wanted to be other than a girl but miriam almost fiercely wished she were a man and yet she hated men at the same time  but its as well to be a woman as a man he said frowning  ha is it men have everything  i should think women ought to be as glad to be women as men are to be men he answered  noshe shook her headno everything the men have  but what do you want he asked  i want to learn why should it be that i know nothing  what such as mathematics and french  why shouldnt i know mathematics yes she cried her eye expanding in a kind of defiance  well you can learn as much as i know he said ill teach you if you like  her eyes dilated she mistrusted him as teacher  would you he asked  her head had dropped and she was sucking her finger broodingly  yes she said hesitatingly  he used to tell his mother all these things  im going to teach miriam algebra he said  well replied mrs morel i hope shell get fat on it  when he went up to the farm on the monday evening it was drawing twilight miriam was just sweeping up the kitchen and was kneeling at the hearth when he entered everyone was out but her she looked round at him flushed her dark eyes shining her fine hair falling about her face  hello she said soft and musical i knew it was you  how  i knew your step nobody treads so quick and firm  he sat down sighing  ready to do some algebra he asked drawing a little book from his pocket  but  he could feel her backing away  you said you wanted he insisted  tonight though she faltered  but i came on purpose and if you want to learn it you must begin  she took up her ashes in the dustpan and looked at him half tremulously laughing  yes but tonight you see i havent thought of it  well my goodness take the ashes and come  he went and sat on the stone bench in the backyard where the big milkcans were standing tipped up to air the men were in the cowsheds he could hear the little singsong of the milk spurting into the pails presently she came bringing some big greenish apples  you know you like them she said  he took a bite  sit down he said with his mouth full  she was shortsighted and peered over his shoulder it irritated him he gave her the book quickly  here he said its only letters for figures you put down a instead of 2 or 6  they worked he talking she with her head down on the book he was quick and hasty she never answered occasionally when he demanded of her do you see she looked up at him her eyes wide with the halflaugh that comes of fear dont you he cried  he had been too fast but she said nothing he questioned her more then got hot it made his blood rouse to see her there as it were at his mercy her mouth open her eyes dilated with laughter that was afraid apologetic ashamed then edgar came along with two buckets of milk  hello he said what are you doing  algebra replied paul  algebra repeated edgar curiously then he passed on with a laugh paul took a bite at his forgotten apple looked at the miserable cabbages in the garden pecked into lace by the fowls and he wanted to pull them up then he glanced at miriam she was poring over the book seemed absorbed in it yet trembling lest she could not get at it it made him cross she was ruddy and beautiful yet her soul seemed to be intensely supplicating the algebrabook she closed shrinking knowing he was angered and at the same instant he grew gentle seeing her hurt because she did not understand  but things came slowly to her and when she held herself in a grip seemed so utterly humble before the lesson it made his blood rouse he stormed at her got ashamed continued the lesson and grew furious again abusing her she listened in silence occasionally very rarely she defended herself her liquid dark eyes blazed at him  you dont give me time to learn it she said  all right he answered throwing the book on the table and lighting a cigarette then after a while he went back to her repentant so the lessons went he was always either in a rage or very gentle  what do you tremble your soul before it for he cried you dont learn algebra with your blessed soul cant you look at it with your clear simple wits  often when he went again into the kitchen mrs leivers would look at him reproachfully saying  paul dont be so hard on miriam she may not be quick but im sure she tries  i cant help it he said rather pitiably i go off like it  you dont mind me miriam do you he asked of the girl later  no she reassured him in her beautiful deep tonesno i dont mind  dont mind me its my fault  but in spite of himself his blood began to boil with her it was strange that no one else made him in such fury he flared against her once he threw the pencil in her face there was a silence she turned her face slightly aside  i didnt he began but got no farther feeling weak in all his bones she never reproached him or was angry with him he was often cruelly ashamed but still again his anger burst like a bubble surcharged and still when he saw her eager silent as it were blind face he felt he wanted to throw the pencil in it and still when he saw her hand trembling and her mouth parted with suffering his heart was scalded with pain for her and because of the intensity to which she roused him he sought her  then he often avoided her and went with edgar miriam and her brother were naturally antagonistic edgar was a rationalist who was curious and had a sort of scientific interest in life it was a great bitterness to miriam to see herself deserted by paul for edgar who seemed so much lower but the youth was very happy with her elder brother the two men spent afternoons together on the land or in the loft doing carpentry when it rained and they talked together or paul taught edgar the songs he himself had learned from annie at the piano and often all the men mr leivers as well had bitter debates on the nationalizing of the land and similar problems paul had already heard his mothers views and as these were as yet his own he argued for her miriam attended and took part but was all the time waiting until it should be over and a personal communication might begin  after all she said within herself if the land were nationalized edgar and paul and i would be just the same so she waited for the youth to come back to her  he was studying for his painting he loved to sit at home alone with his mother at night working and working she sewed or read then looking up from his task he would rest his eyes for a moment on her face that was bright with living warmth and he returned gladly to his work  i can do my best things when you sit there in your rockingchair mother he said  im sure she exclaimed sniffing with mock scepticism but she felt it was so and her heart quivered with brightness for many hours she sat still slightly conscious of him labouring away whilst she worked or read her book and he with all his souls intensity directing his pencil could feel her warmth inside him like strength they were both very happy so and both unconscious of it these times that meant so much and which were real living they almost ignored  he was conscious only when stimulated a sketch finished he always wanted to take it to miriam then he was stimulated into knowledge of the work he had produced unconsciously in contact with miriam he gained insight his vision went deeper from his mother he drew the lifewarmth the strength to produce miriam urged this warmth into intensity like a white light  when he returned to the factory the conditions of work were better he had wednesday afternoon off to go to the art schoolmiss jordans provisionreturning in the evening then the factory closed at six instead of eight on thursday and friday evenings  one evening in the summer miriam and he went over the fields by herods farm on their way from the library home so it was only three miles to willey farm there was a yellow glow over the mowinggrass and the sorrelheads burned crimson gradually as they walked along the high land the gold in the west sank down to red the red to crimson and then the chill blue crept up against the glow  they came out upon the high road to alfreton which ran white between the darkening fields there paul hesitated it was two miles home for him one mile forward for miriam they both looked up the road that ran in shadow right under the glow of the northwest sky on the crest of the hill selby with its stark houses and the uppricked headstocks of the pit stood in black silhouette small against the sky  he looked at his watch  nine oclock he said  the pair stood loth to part hugging their books  the wood is so lovely now she said i wanted you to see it  he followed her slowly across the road to the white gate  they grumble so if im late he said  but youre not doing anything wrong she answered impatiently  he followed her across the nibbled pasture in the dusk there was a coolness in the wood a scent of leaves of honeysuckle and a twilight the two walked in silence night came wonderfully there among the throng of dark treetrunks he looked round expectant  she wanted to show him a certain wildrose bush she had discovered she knew it was wonderful and yet till he had seen it she felt it had not come into her soul only he could make it her own immortal she was dissatisfied  dew was already on the paths in the old oakwood a mist was rising and he hesitated wondering whether one whiteness were a strand of fog or only campionflowers pallid in a cloud  by the time they came to the pinetrees miriam was getting very eager and very tense her bush might be gone she might not be able to find it and she wanted it so much almost passionately she wanted to be with him when he stood before the flowers they were going to have a communion togethersomething that thrilled her something holy he was walking beside her in silence they were very near to each other she trembled and he listened vaguely anxious  coming to the edge of the wood they saw the sky in front like motherofpearl and the earth growing dark somewhere on the outermost branches of the pinewood the honeysuckle was streaming scent  where he asked  down the middle path she murmured quivering  when they turned the corner of the path she stood still in the wide walk between the pines gazing rather frightened she could distinguish nothing for some moments the greying light robbed things of their colour then she saw her bush  ah she cried hastening forward  it was very still the tree was tall and straggling it had thrown its briers over a hawthornbush and its long streamers trailed thick right down to the grass splashing the darkness everywhere with great spilt stars pure white in bosses of ivory and in large splashed stars the roses gleamed on the darkness of foliage and stems and grass paul and miriam stood close together silent and watched point after point the steady roses shone out to them seeming to kindle something in their souls the dusk came like smoke around and still did not put out the roses  paul looked into miriams eyes she was pale and expectant with wonder her lips were parted and her dark eyes lay open to him his look seemed to travel down into her her soul quivered it was the communion she wanted he turned aside as if pained he turned to the bush  they seem as if they walk like butterflies and shake themselves he said  she looked at her roses they were white some incurved and holy others expanded in an ecstasy the tree was dark as a shadow she lifted her hand impulsively to the flowers she went forward and touched them in worship  let us go he said  there was a cool scent of ivory rosesa white virgin scent something made him feel anxious and imprisoned the two walked in silence  till sunday he said quietly and left her and she walked home slowly feeling her soul satisfied with the holiness of the night he stumbled down the path and as soon as he was out of the wood in the free open meadow where he could breathe he started to run as fast as he could it was like a delicious delirium in his veins  always when he went with miriam and it grew rather late he knew his mother was fretting and getting angry about himwhy he could not understand as he went into the house flinging down his cap his mother looked up at the clock she had been sitting thinking because a chill to her eyes prevented her reading she could feel paul being drawn away by this girl and she did not care for miriam she is one of those who will want to suck a mans soul out till he has none of his own left she said to herself and he is just such a gaby as to let himself be absorbed she will never let him become a man she never will so while he was away with miriam mrs morel grew more and more worked up  she glanced at the clock and said coldly and rather tired  you have been far enough tonight  his soul warm and exposed from contact with the girl shrank  you must have been right home with her his mother continued  he would not answer mrs morel looking at him quickly saw his hair was damp on his forehead with haste saw him frowning in his heavy fashion resentfully  she must be wonderfully fascinating that you cant get away from her but must go trailing eight miles at this time of night  he was hurt between the past glamour with miriam and the knowledge that his mother fretted he had meant not to say anything to refuse to answer but he could not harden his heart to ignore his mother  i do like to talk to her he answered irritably  is there nobody else to talk to  you wouldnt say anything if i went with edgar  you know i should you know whoever you went with i should say it was too far for you to go trailing late at night when youve been to nottingham besidesher voice suddenly flashed into anger and contemptit is disgustingbits of lads and girls courting  it is not courting he cried  i dont know what else you call it  its not do you think we spoon and do we only talk  till goodness knows what time and distance was the sarcastic rejoinder  paul snapped at the laces of his boots angrily  what are you so mad about he asked because you dont like her  i dont say i dont like her but i dont hold with children keeping company and never did  but you dont mind our annie going out with jim inger  theyve more sense than you two  why  our annies not one of the deep sort  he failed to see the meaning of this remark but his mother looked tired she was never so strong after williams death and her eyes hurt her  well he said its so pretty in the country mr sleath asked about you he said hed missed you are you a bit better  i ought to have been in bed a long time ago she replied  why mother you know you wouldnt have gone before quarterpast ten  oh yes i should  oh little woman youd say anything now youre disagreeable with me wouldnt you  he kissed her forehead that he knew so well the deep marks between the brows the rising of the fine hair greying now and the proud setting of the temples his hand lingered on her shoulder after his kiss then he went slowly to bed he had forgotten miriam he only saw how his mothers hair was lifted back from her warm broad brow and somehow she was hurt  then the next time he saw miriam he said to her  dont let me be late tonightnot later than ten oclock my mother gets so upset  miriam dropped her bead brooding  why does she get upset she asked  because she says i oughtnt to be out late when i have to get up early  very well said miriam rather quietly with just a touch of a sneer  he resented that and he was usually late again  that there was any love growing between him and miriam neither of them would have acknowledged he thought he was too sane for such sentimentality and she thought herself too lofty they both were late in coming to maturity and psychical ripeness was much behind even the physical miriam was exceedingly sensitive as her mother had always been the slightest grossness made her recoil almost in anguish her brothers were brutal but never coarse in speech the men did all the discussing of farm matters outside but perhaps because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes on upon every farm miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest suggestion of such intercourse paul took his pitch from her and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion it could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal  when he was nineteen he was earning only twenty shillings a week but he was happy his painting went well and life went well enough on the good friday he organised a walk to the hemlock stone there were three lads of his own age then annie and arthur miriam and geoffrey arthur apprenticed as an electrician in nottingham was home for the holiday morel as usual was up early whistling and sawing in the yard at seven oclock the family heard him buy threepennyworth of hotcross buns he talked with gusto to the little girl who brought them calling her my darling he turned away several boys who came with more buns telling them they had been kested by a little lass then mrs morel got up and the family straggled down it was an immense luxury to everybody this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday and paul and arthur read before breakfast and had the meal unwashed sitting in their shirtsleeves this was another holiday luxury the room was warm everything felt free of care and anxiety there was a sense of plenty in the house  while the boys were reading mrs morel went into the garden they were now in another house an old one near the scargill street home which had been left soon after william had died directly came an excited cry from the garden  paul paul come and look  it was his mothers voice he threw down his book and went out there was a long garden that ran to a field it was a grey cold day with a sharp wind blowing out of derbyshire two fields away bestwood began with a jumble of roofs and red houseends out of which rose the church tower and the spire of the congregational chapel and beyond went woods and hills right away to the pale grey heights of the pennine chain  paul looked down the garden for his mother her head appeared among the young currantbushes  come here she cried  what for he answered  come and see  she had been looking at the buds on the currant trees paul went up  to think she said that here i might never have seen them  her son went to her side under the fence in a little bed was a ravel of poor grassy leaves such as come from very immature bulbs and three scyllas in bloom mrs morel pointed to the deep blue flowers   now just see those she exclaimed i was looking at the currant bushes when thinks i to myself theres something very blue is it a bit of sugarbag and there behold you sugarbag three glories of the snow and such beauties but where on earth did they come from  i dont know said paul  well thats a marvel now i thought i knew every weed and blade in this garden but havent they done well you see that gooseberrybush just shelters them not nipped not touched  he crouched down and turned up the bells of the little blue flowers  theyre a glorious colour he said  arent they she cried i guess they come from switzerland where they say they have such lovely things fancy them against the snow but where have they come from they cant have blown here can they  then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash of bulbs to mature  and you never told me she said  no i thought id leave it till they might flower  and now you see i might have missed them and ive never had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life  she was full of excitement and elation the garden was an endless joy to her paul was thankful for her sake at last to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering about in it and it was true she knew every weed and blade  everybody turned up for the walk food was packed and they set off a merry delighted party they hung over the wall of the millrace dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel and watched it shoot out on the other they stood on the footbridge over boathouse station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly  you should see the flying scotsman come through at halfpast six said leonard whose father was a signalman lad but she doesnt half buzz and the little party looked up the lines one way to london and the other way to scotland and they felt the touch of these two magical places  in ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the publichouses to open it was a town of idleness and lounging at stanton gate the iron foundry blazed over everything there were great discussions at trowell they crossed again from derbyshire into nottinghamshire they came to the hemlock stone at dinnertime its field was crowded with folk from nottingham and ilkeston  they had expected a venerable and dignified monument they found a little gnarled twisted stump of rock something like a decayed mushroom standing out pathetically on the side of a field leonard and dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials l w and r p in the old red sandstone but paul desisted because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about initialcarvers who could find no other road to immortality then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round  everywhere in the field below factory girls and lads were eating lunch or sporting about beyond was the garden of an old manor it had yewhedges and thick clumps and borders of yellow crocuses round the lawn  see said paul to miriam what a quiet garden  she saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses then she looked gratefully he had not seemed to belong to her among all these others he was different thennot her paul who understood the slightest quiver of her innermost soul but something else speaking another language than hers how it hurt her and deadened her very perceptions only when he came right back to her leaving his other his lesser self as she thought would she feel alive again and now he asked her to look at this garden wanting the contact with her again impatient of the set in the field she turned to the quiet lawn surrounded by sheaves of shutup crocuses a feeling of stillness almost of ecstasy came over her it felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden  then he left her again and joined the others soon they started home miriam loitered behind alone she did not fit in with the others she could very rarely get into human relations with anyone so her friend her companion her lover was nature she saw the sun declining wanly in the dusky cold hedgerows were some red leaves she lingered to gather them tenderly passionately the love in her fingertips caressed the leaves the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves  suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road and she hurried forward turning a corner in the lane she came upon paul who stood bent over something his mind fixed on it working away steadily patiently a little hopelessly she hesitated in her approach to watch  he remained concentrated in the middle of the road beyond one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make him stand out in dark relief she saw him slender and firm as if the setting sun had given him to her a deep pain took hold of her and she knew she must love him and she had discovered him discovered in him a rare potentiality discovered his loneliness quivering as at some annunciation she went slowly forward  at last he looked up  why he exclaimed gratefully have you waited for me  she saw a deep shadow in his eyes  what is it she asked  the spring broken here and he showed her where his umbrella was injured  instantly with some shame she knew he had not done the damage himself but that geoffrey was responsible  it is only an old umbrella isnt it she asked  she wondered why he who did not usually trouble over trifles made such a mountain of this molehill  but it was williams an my mother cant help but know he said quietly still patiently working at the umbrella  the words went through miriam like a blade this then was the confirmation of her vision of him she looked at him but there was about him a certain reserve and she dared not comfort him not even speak softly to him  come on he said i cant do it and they went in silence along the road  that same evening they were walking along under the trees by nether green he was talking to her fretfully seemed to be struggling to convince himself  you know he said with an effort if one person loves the other does  ah she answered like mother said to me when i was little love begets love  yes something like that i think it must be  i hope so because if it were not love might be a very terrible thing she said  yes but it isat least with most people he answered  and miriam thinking he had assured himself felt strong in herself she always regarded that sudden coming upon him in the lane as a revelation and this conversation remained graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law  now she stood with him and for him when about this time he outraged the family feeling at willey farm by some overbearing insult she stuck to him and believed he was right and at this time she dreamed dreams of him vivid unforgettable these dreams came again later on developed to a more subtle psychological stage  on the easter monday the same party took an excursion to wingfield manor it was great excitement to miriam to catch a train at sethley bridge amid all the bustle of the bank holiday crowd they left the train at alfreton paul was interested in the street and in the colliers with their dogs here was a new race of miners miriam did not live till they came to the church they were all rather timid of entering with their bags of food for fear of being turned out leonard a comic thin fellow went first paul who would have died rather than be sent back went last the place was decorated for easter in the font hundreds of white narcissi seemed to be growing the air was dim and coloured from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies and narcissi in that atmosphere miriams soul came into a glow paul was afraid of the things he mustnt do and he was sensitive to the feel of the place miriam turned to him he answered they were together he would not go beyond the communionrail she loved him for that her soul expanded into prayer beside him he felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places all his latent mysticism quivered into life she was drawn to him he was a prayer along with her  miriam very rarely talked to the other lads they at once became awkward in conversation with her so usually she was silent  it was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor all things shone softly in the sun which was wonderfully warm and enlivening celandines and violets were out everybody was tiptop full with happiness the glitter of the ivy the soft atmospheric grey of the castle walls the gentleness of everything near the ruin was perfect  the manor is of hard pale grey stone and the other walls are blank and calm the young folk were in raptures they went in trepidation almost afraid that the delight of exploring this ruin might be denied them in the first courtyard within the high broken walls were farmcarts with their shafts lying idle on the ground the tyres of the wheels brilliant with goldred rust it was very still  all eagerly paid their sixpences and went timidly through the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard they were shy here on the pavement where the hall had been an old thorn tree was budding all kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were in the shadow around them  after lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin this time the girls went with the boys who could act as guides and expositors there was one tall tower in a corner rather tottering where they say mary queen of scots was imprisoned  think of the queen going up here said miriam in a low voice as she climbed the hollow stairs  if she could get up said paul for she had rheumatism like anything i reckon they treated her rottenly  you dont think she deserved it asked miriam  no i dont she was only lively  they continued to mount the winding staircase a high wind blowing through the loopholes went rushing up the shaft and filled the girls skirts like a balloon so that she was ashamed until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her he did it perfectly simply as he would have picked up her glove she remembered this always  round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out old and handsome also there were a few chill gillivers in pale cold bud miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy but he would not let her instead she had to wait behind him and take from him each spray as he gathered it and held it to her each one separately in the purest manner of chivalry the tower seemed to rock in the wind they looked over miles and miles of wooded country and country with gleams of pasture  the crypt underneath the manor was beautiful and in perfect preservation paul made a drawing miriam stayed with him she was thinking of mary queen of scots looking with her strained hopeless eyes that could not understand misery over the hills whence no help came or sitting in this crypt being told of a god as cold as the place she sat in  they set off again gaily looking round on their beloved manor that stood so clean and big on its hill  supposing you could have that farm said paul to miriam  yes  wouldnt it be lovely to come and see you  they were now in the bare country of stone walls which he loved and which though only ten miles from home seemed so foreign to miriam the party was straggling as they were crossing a large meadow that sloped away from the sun along a path embedded with innumerable tiny glittering points paul walking alongside laced his fingers in the strings of the bag miriam was carrying and instantly she felt annie behind watchful and jealous but the meadow was bathed in a glory of sunshine and the path was jewelled and it was seldom that he gave her any sign she held her fingers very still among the strings of the bag his fingers touching and the place was golden as a vision  at last they came into the straggling grey village of crich that lies high beyond the village was the famous crich stand that paul could see from the garden at home the party pushed on great expanse of country spread around and below the lads were eager to get to the top of the hill it was capped by a round knoll half of which was by now cut away and on the top of which stood an ancient monument sturdy and squat for signalling in old days far down into the level lands of nottinghamshire and leicestershire  it was blowing so hard high up there in the exposed place that the only way to be safe was to stand nailed by the wind to the wan of the tower at their feet fell the precipice where the limestone was quarried away below was a jumble of hills and tiny villagesmattock ambergate stoney middleton the lads were eager to spy out the church of bestwood far away among the rather crowded country on the left they were disgusted that it seemed to stand on a plain they saw the hills of derbyshire fall into the monotony of the midlands that swept away south  miriam was somewhat scared by the wind but the lads enjoyed it they went on miles and miles to whatstandwell all the food was eaten everybody was hungry and there was very little money to get home with but they managed to procure a loaf and a currantloaf which they hacked to pieces with shutknives and ate sitting on the wall near the bridge watching the bright derwent rushing by and the brakes from matlock pulling up at the inn  paul was now pale with weariness he had been responsible for the party all day and now he was done miriam understood and kept close to him and he left himself in her hands  they had an hour to wait at ambergate station trains came crowded with excursionists returning to manchester birmingham and london  we might be going therefolk easily might think were going that far said paul  they got back rather late miriam walking home with geoffrey watched the moon rise big and red and misty she felt something was fulfilled in her  she had an elder sister agatha who was a schoolteacher between the two girls was a feud miriam considered agatha worldly and she wanted herself to be a schoolteacher  one saturday afternoon agatha and miriam were upstairs dressing their bedroom was over the stable it was a low room not very large and bare miriam had nailed on the wall a reproduction of veroneses st catherine she loved the woman who sat in the window dreaming her own windows were too small to sit in but the front one was dripped over with honeysuckle and virginia creeper and looked upon the treetops of the oakwood across the yard while the little back window no bigger than a handkerchief was a loophole to the east to the dawn beating up against the beloved round hills  the two sisters did not talk much to each other agatha who was fair and small and determined had rebelled against the home atmosphere against the doctrine of the other cheek she was out in the world now in a fair way to be independent and she insisted on worldly values on appearance on manners on position which miriam would fain have ignored  both girls liked to be upstairs out of the way when paul came they preferred to come running down open the stairfoot door and see him watching expectant of them miriam stood painfully pulling over her head a rosary he had given her it caught in the fine mesh of her hair but at last she had it on and the redbrown wooden beads looked well against her cool brown neck she was a welldeveloped girl and very handsome but in the little lookingglass nailed against the whitewashed wall she could only see a fragment of herself at a time agatha had bought a little mirror of her own which she propped up to suit herself miriam was near the window suddenly she heard the wellknown click of the chain and she saw paul fling open the gate push his bicycle into the yard she saw him look at the house and she shrank away he walked in a nonchalant fashion and his bicycle went with him as if it were a live thing  pauls come she exclaimed  arent you glad said agatha cuttingly  miriam stood still in amazement and bewilderment  well arent you she asked  yes but im not going to let him see it and think i wanted him  miriam was startled she heard him putting his bicycle in the stable underneath and talking to jimmy who had been a pithorse and who was seedy  well jimmy my lad how are ter nobbut sick an sadly like why then its a shame my owd lad  she heard the rope run through the hole as the horse lifted its head from the lads caress how she loved to listen when he thought only the horse could hear but there was a serpent in her eden she searched earnestly in herself to see if she wanted paul morel she felt there would be some disgrace in it full of twisted feeling she was afraid she did want him she stood selfconvicted then came an agony of new shame she shrank within herself in a coil of torture did she want paul morel and did he know she wanted him what a subtle infamy upon her she felt as if her whole soul coiled into knots of shame  agatha was dressed first and ran downstairs miriam heard her greet the lad gaily knew exactly how brilliant her grey eyes became with that tone she herself would have felt it bold to have greeted him in such wise yet there she stood under the selfaccusation of wanting him tied to that stake of torture in bitter perplexity she kneeled down and prayed  o lord let me not love paul morel keep me from loving him if i ought not to love him  something anomalous in the prayer arrested her she lifted her head and pondered how could it be wrong to love him love was gods gift and yet it caused her shame that was because of him paul morel but then it was not his affair it was her own between herself and god she was to be a sacrifice but it was gods sacrifice not paul morels or her own after a few minutes she hid her face in the pillow again and said  but lord if it is thy will that i should love him make me love himas christ would who died for the souls of men make me love him splendidly because he is thy son  she remained kneeling for some time quite still and deeply moved her black hair against the red squares and the lavendersprigged squares of the patchwork quilt prayer was almost essential to her then she fell into that rapture of selfsacrifice identifying herself with a god who was sacrificed which gives to so many human souls their deepest bliss  when she went downstairs paul was lying back in an armchair holding forth with much vehemence to agatha who was scorning a little painting he had brought to show her miriam glanced at the two and avoided their levity she went into the parlour to be alone  it was teatime before she was able to speak to paul and then her manner was so distant he thought he had offended her  miriam discontinued her practice of going each thursday evening to the library in bestwood after calling for paul regularly during the whole spring a number of trifling incidents and tiny insults from his family awakened her to their attitude towards her and she decided to go no more so she announced to paul one evening she would not call at his house again for him on thursday nights  why he asked very short  nothing only id rather not  very well  but she faltered if youd care to meet me we could still go together  meet you where  somewherewhere you like  i shant meet you anywhere i dont see why you shouldnt keep calling for me but if you wont i dont want to meet you  so the thursday evenings which had been so precious to her and to him were dropped he worked instead mrs morel sniffed with satisfaction at this arrangement  he would not have it that they were lovers the intimacy between them had been kept so abstract such a matter of the soul all thought and weary struggle into consciousness that he saw it only as a platonic friendship he stoutly denied there was anything else between them miriam was silent or else she very quietly agreed he was a fool who did not know what was happening to himself by tacit agreement they ignored the remarks and insinuations of their acquaintances  we arent lovers we are friends he said to her we know it let them talk what does it matter what they say  sometimes as they were walking together she slipped her arm timidly into his but he always resented it and she knew it it caused a violent conflict in him with miriam he was always on the high plane of abstraction when his natural fire of love was transmitted into the fine stream of thought she would have it so if he were jolly and as she put it flippant she waited till he came back to her till the change had taken place in him again and he was wrestling with his own soul frowning passionate in his desire for understanding and in this passion for understanding her soul lay close to his she had him all to herself but he must be made abstract first  then if she put her arm in his it caused him almost torture his consciousness seemed to split the place where she was touching him ran hot with friction he was one internecine battle and he became cruel to her because of it  one evening in midsummer miriam called at the house warm from climbing paul was alone in the kitchen his mother could be heard moving about upstairs  come and look at the sweetpeas he said to the girl  they went into the garden the sky behind the townlet and the church was orangered the flowergarden was flooded with a strange warm light that lifted every leaf into significance paul passed along a fine row of sweetpeas gathering a blossom here and there all cream and pale blue miriam followed breathing the fragrance to her flowers appealed with such strength she felt she must make them part of herself when she bent and breathed a flower it was as if she and the flower were loving each other paul hated her for it there seemed a sort of exposure about the action something too intimate   when he had got a fair bunch they returned to the house he listened for a moment to his mothers quiet movement upstairs then he said  come here and let me pin them in for you he arranged them two or three at a time in the bosom of her dress stepping back now and then to see the effect you know he said taking the pin out of his mouth a woman ought always to arrange her flowers before her glass  miriam laughed she thought flowers ought to be pinned in ones dress without any care that paul should take pains to fix her flowers for her was his whim  he was rather offended at her laughter  some women dothose who look decent he said  miriam laughed again but mirthlessly to hear him thus mix her up with women in a general way from most men she would have ignored it but from him it hurt her  he had nearly finished arranging the flowers when he heard his mothers footstep on the stairs hurriedly he pushed in the last pin and turned away  dont let mater know he said  miriam picked up her books and stood in the doorway looking with chagrin at the beautiful sunset she would call for paul no more she said  goodevening mrs morel she said in a deferential way she sounded as if she felt she had no right to be there  oh is it you miriam replied mrs morel coolly  but paul insisted on everybodys accepting his friendship with the girl and mrs morel was too wise to have any open rupture  it was not till he was twenty years old that the family could ever afford to go away for a holiday mrs morel had never been away for a holiday except to see her sister since she had been married now at last paul had saved enough money and they were all going there was to be a party some of annies friends one friend of pauls a young man in the same office where william had previously been and miriam  it was great excitement writing for rooms paul and his mother debated it endlessly between them they wanted a furnished cottage for two weeks she thought one week would be enough but he insisted on two  at last they got an answer from mablethorpe a cottage such as they wished for thirty shillings a week there was immense jubilation paul was wild with joy for his mothers sake she would have a real holiday now he and she sat at evening picturing what it would be like annie came in and leonard and alice and kitty there was wild rejoicing and anticipation paul told miriam she seemed to brood with joy over it but the morels house rang with excitement  they were to go on saturday morning by the seven train paul suggested that miriam should sleep at his house because it was so far for her to walk she came down for supper everybody was so excited that even miriam was accepted with warmth but almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight he had discovered a poem by jean ingelow which mentioned mablethorpe and so he must read it to miriam he would never have got so far in the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family but now they condescended to listen miriam sat on the sofa absorbed in him she always seemed absorbed in him and by him when he was present mrs morel sat jealously in her own chair she was going to hear also and even annie and the father attended morel with his head cocked on one side like somebody listening to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact paul ducked his head over the book he had got now all the audience he cared for and mrs morel and annie almost contested with miriam who should listen best and win his favour he was in very high feather  but interrupted mrs morel what is the bride of enderby that the bells are supposed to ring  its an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning against water i suppose the bride of enderby was drowned in a flood he replied he had not the faintest knowledge what it really was but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk they listened and believed him he believed himself  and the people knew what that tune meant said his mother  yesjust like the scotch when they heard the flowers o the forestand when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm  how said annie a bell sounds the same whether its rung backwards or forwards  but he said if you start with the deep bell and ring up to the high onederderderderderderderder  he ran up the scale everybody thought it clever he thought so too then waiting a minute he continued the poem  hm said mrs morel curiously when he finished but i wish everything thats written werent so sad  i canna see what they want drownin theirselves for said morel  there was a pause annie got up to clear the table  miriam rose to help with the pots  let me help to wash up she said  certainly not cried annie you sit down again there arent many  and miriam who could not be familiar and insist sat down again to look at the book with paul  he was master of the party his father was no good and great tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at firsby instead of at mablethorpe and he wasnt equal to getting a carriage his bold little mother did that  here she cried to a man here  paul and annie got behind the rest convulsed with shamed laughter  how much will it be to drive to brook cottage said mrs morel  two shillings  why how far is it  a good way  i dont believe it she said  but she scrambled in there were eight crowded in one old seaside carriage  you see said mrs morel its only threepence each and if it were a tramcar  they drove along each cottage they came to mrs morel cried  is it this now this is it  everybody sat breathless they drove past there was a universal sigh  im thankful it wasnt that brute said mrs morel i was frightened they drove on and on  at last they descended at a house that stood alone over the dyke by the highroad there was wild excitement because they had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden but they loved the house that lay so solitary with a seameadow on one side and immense expanse of land patched in white barley yellow oats red wheat and green rootcrops flat and stretching level to the sky  paul kept accounts he and his mother ran the show the total expenseslodging food everythingwas sixteen shillings a week per person he and leonard went bathing in the mornings morel was wandering abroad quite early  you paul his mother called from the bedroom eat a piece of breadandbutter  all right he answered  and when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at the breakfasttable the woman of the house was young her husband was blind and she did laundry work so mrs morel always washed the pots in the kitchen and made the beds  but you said youd have a real holiday said paul and now you work  work she exclaimed what are you talking about  he loved to go with her across the fields to the village and the sea she was afraid of the plank bridge and he abused her for being a baby on the whole he stuck to her as if he were her man  miriam did not get much of him except perhaps when all the others went to the coons coons were insufferably stupid to miriam so he thought they were to himself also and he preached priggishly to annie about the fatuity of listening to them yet he too knew all their songs and sang them along the roads roisterously and if he found himself listening the stupidity pleased him very much yet to annie he said  such rot there isnt a grain of intelligence in it nobody with more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen and to miriam he said with much scorn of annie and the others i suppose theyre at the coons  it was queer to see miriam singing coon songs she had a straight chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn she always reminded paul of some sad botticelli angel when she sang even when it was       come down lovers lane      for a walk with me talk with me  only when he sketched or at evening when the others were at the coons she had him to herself he talked to her endlessly about his love of horizontals how they the great levels of sky and land in lincolnshire meant to him the eternality of the will just as the bowed norman arches of the church repeating themselves meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul on and on nobody knows where in contradiction to the perpendicular lines and to the gothic arch which he said leapt up at heaven and touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine himself he said was norman miriam was gothic she bowed in consent even to that  one evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore of sand towards theddlethorpe the long breakers plunged and ran in a hiss of foam along the coast it was a warm evening there was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand no noise but the sound of the sea paul loved to see it clanging at the land he loved to feel himself between the noise of it and the silence of the sandy shore miriam was with him everything grew very intense it was quite dark when they turned again the way home was through a gap in the sandhills and then along a raised grass road between two dykes the country was black and still from behind the sandhills came the whisper of the sea paul and miriam walked in silence suddenly he started the whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame and he could scarcely breathe an enormous orange moon was staring at them from the rim of the sandhills he stood still looking at it  ah cried miriam when she saw it  he remained perfectly still staring at the immense and ruddy moon the only thing in the farreaching darkness of the level his heart beat heavily the muscles of his arms contracted  what is it murmured miriam waiting for him  he turned and looked at her she stood beside him for ever in shadow her face covered with the darkness of her hat was watching him unseen but she was brooding she was slightly afraiddeeply moved and religious that was her best state he was impotent against it his blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest but he could not get across to her there were flashes in his blood but somehow she ignored them she was expecting some religious state in him still yearning she was half aware of his passion and gazed at him troubled  what is it she murmured again  its the moon he answered frowning  yes she assented isnt it wonderful she was curious about him the crisis was past  he did not know himself what was the matter he was naturally so young and their intimacy was so abstract he did not know he wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there he was afraid of her the fact that he might want her as a man wants a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame when she shrank in her convulsed coiled torture from the thought of such a thing he had winced to the depths of his soul and now this purity prevented even their first lovekiss it was as if she could scarcely stand the shock of physical love even a passionate kiss and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it  as they walked along the dark fenmeadow he watched the moon and did not speak she plodded beside him he hated her for she seemed in some way to make him despise himself looking aheadhe saw the one light in the darkness the window of their lamplit cottage  he loved to think of his mother and the other jolly people  well everybody else has been in long ago said his mother as they entered  what does that matter he cried irritably i can go a walk if i like cant i  and i should have thought you could get in to supper with the rest said mrs morel  i shall please myself he retorted its not late i shall do as i like  very well said his mother cuttingly then do as you like and she took no further notice of him that evening which he pretended neither to notice nor to care about but sat reading miriam read also obliterating herself mrs morel hated her for making her son like this she watched paul growing irritable priggish and melancholic for this she put the blame on miriam annie and all her friends joined against the girl miriam had no friend of her own only paul but she did not suffer so much because she despised the triviality of these other people  and paul hated her because somehow she spoilt his ease and naturalness and he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation    chapter viii  strife in love  arthur finished his apprenticeship and got a job on the electrical plant at minton pit he earned very little but had a good chance of getting on but he was wild and restless he did not drink nor gamble yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes always through some hotheaded thoughtlessness either he went rabbiting in the woods like a poacher or he stayed in nottingham all night instead of coming home or he miscalculated his dive into the canal at bestwood and scored his chest into one mass of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom  he had not been at his work many months when again he did not come home one night  do you know where arthur is asked paul at breakfast  i do not replied his mother  he is a fool said paul and if he did anything i shouldnt mind but no he simply cant come away from a game of whist or else he must see a girl home from the skatingrinkquite proprietouslyand so cant get home hes a fool  i dont know that it would make it any better if he did something to make us all ashamed said mrs morel  well i should respect him more said paul  i very much doubt it said his mother coldly  they went on with breakfast  are you fearfully fond of him paul asked his mother  what do you ask that for  because they say a woman always like the youngest best  she may dobut i dont no he wearies me  and youd actually rather he was good  id rather he showed some of a mans common sense  paul was raw and irritable he also wearied his mother very often she saw the sunshine going out of him and she resented it  as they were finishing breakfast came the postman with a letter from derby mrs morel screwed up her eyes to look at the address  give it here blind eye exclaimed her son snatching it away from her  she started and almost boxed his ears  its from your son arthur he said  what now cried mrs morel  my dearest mother paul read i dont know what made me such a fool i want you to come and fetch me back from here i came with jack bredon yesterday instead of going to work and enlisted he said he was sick of wearing the seat of a stool out and like the idiot you know i am i came away with him  i have taken the kings shilling but perhaps if you came for me they would let me go back with you i was a fool when i did it i dont want to be in the army my dear mother i am nothing but a trouble to you but if you get me out of this i promise i will have more sense and consideration     mrs morel sat down in her rockingchair  well now she cried let him stop  yes said paul let him stop  there was silence the mother sat with her hands folded in her apron her face set thinking  if im not sick she cried suddenly sick  now said paul beginning to frown youre not going to worry your soul out about this do you hear  i suppose im to take it as a blessing she flashed turning on her son  youre not going to mount it up to a tragedy so there he retorted  the foolthe young fool she cried  hell look well in uniform said paul irritatingly  his mother turned on him like a fury  oh will he she cried not in my eyes  he should get in a cavalry regiment hell have the time of his life and will look an awful swell  swellswella mighty swell idea indeeda common soldier  well said paul what am i but a common clerk  a good deal my boy cried his mother stung  what  at any rate a man and not a thing in a red coat  i shouldnt mind being in a red coator dark blue that would suit me betterif they didnt boss me about too much  but his mother had ceased to listen  just as he was getting on or might have been getting on at his joba young nuisancehere he goes and ruins himself for life what good will he be do you think after this  it may lick him into shape beautifully said paul  lick him into shapelick what marrow there was out of his bones a soldiera common soldiernothing but a body that makes movements when it hears a shout its a fine thing  i cant understand why it upsets you said paul  no perhaps you cant but i understand and she sat back in her chair her chin in one hand holding her elbow with the other brimmed up with wrath and chagrin  and shall you go to derby asked paul  yes  its no good  ill see for myself  and why on earth dont you let him stop its just what he wants  of course cried the mother you know what he wants  she got ready and went by the first train to derby where she saw her son and the sergeant it was however no good  when morel was having his dinner in the evening she said suddenly  ive had to go to derby today  the miner turned up his eyes showing the whites in his black face  has ter lass what took thee there  that arthur  ohan whats agate now  hes only enlisted  morel put down his knife and leaned back in his chair  nay he said that he niver as  and is going down to aldershot tomorrow  well exclaimed the miner thats a winder he considered it a moment said hm and proceeded with his dinner suddenly his face contracted with wrath i hope he may never set foot i my house again he said  the idea cried mrs morel saying such a thing  i do repeated morel a fool as runs away for a soldier let im look after issen i sll do no more for im  a fat sight you have done as it is she said  and morel was almost ashamed to go to his publichouse that evening  well did you go said paul to his mother when he came home  i did  and could you see him  yes  and what did he say  he blubbered when i came away  hm  and so did i so you neednt hm  mrs morel fretted after her son she knew he would not like the army he did not the discipline was intolerable to him  but the doctor she said with some pride to paul said he was perfectly proportionedalmost exactly all his measurements were correct he is goodlooking you know  hes awfully nicelooking but he doesnt fetch the girls like william does he  no its a different character hes a good deal like his father irresponsible  to console his mother paul did not go much to willey farm at this time and in the autumn exhibition of students work in the castle he had two studies a landscape in watercolour and a still life in oil both of which had firstprize awards he was highly excited  what do you think ive got for my pictures mother he asked coming home one evening she saw by his eyes he was glad her face flushed  now how should i know my boy  a first prize for those glass jars  hm  and a first prize for that sketch up at willey farm  both first  yes  hm  there was a rosy bright look about her though she said nothing  its nice he said isnt it  it is  why dont you praise me up to the skies  she laughed  i should have the trouble of dragging you down again she said  but she was full of joy nevertheless william had brought her his sporting trophies she kept them still and she did not forgive his death arthur was handsomeat least a good specimenand warm and generous and probably would do well in the end but paul was going to distinguish himself she had a great belief in him the more because he was unaware of his own powers there was so much to come out of him life for her was rich with promise she was to see herself fulfilled not for nothing had been her struggle  several times during the exhibition mrs morel went to the castle unknown to paul she wandered down the long room looking at the other exhibits yes they were good but they had not in them a certain something which she demanded for her satisfaction some made her jealous they were so good she looked at them a long time trying to find fault with them then suddenly she had a shock that made her heart beat there hung pauls picture she knew it as if it were printed on her heart  namepaul morelfirst prize  it looked so strange there in public on the walls of the castle gallery where in her lifetime she had seen so many pictures and she glanced round to see if anyone had noticed her again in front of the same sketch  but she felt a proud woman when she met welldressed ladies going home to the park she thought to herself  yes you look very wellbut i wonder if your son has two first prizes in the castle  and she walked on as proud a little woman as any in nottingham and paul felt he had done something for her if only a trifle all his work was hers  one day as he was going up castle gate he met miriam he had seen her on the sunday and had not expected to meet her in town she was walking with a rather striking woman blonde with a sullen expression and a defiant carriage it was strange how miriam in her bowed meditative bearing looked dwarfed beside this woman with the handsome shoulders miriam watched paul searchingly his gaze was on the stranger who ignored him the girl saw his masculine spirit rear its head  hello he said you didnt tell me you were coming to town  no replied miriam half apologetically i drove in to cattle market with father  he looked at her companion  ive told you about mrs dawes said miriam huskily she was nervous clara do you know paul  i think ive seen him before replied mrs dawes indifferently as she shook hands with him she had scornful grey eyes a skin like white honey and a full mouth with a slightly lifted upper lip that did not know whether it was raised in scorn of all men or out of eagerness to be kissed but which believed the former she carried her head back as if she had drawn away in contempt perhaps from men also she wore a large dowdy hat of black beaver and a sort of slightly affected simple dress that made her look rather sacklike she was evidently poor and had not much taste miriam usually looked nice  where have you seen me paul asked of the woman  she looked at him as if she would not trouble to answer then  walking with louie travers she said  louie was one of the spiral girls  why do you know her he asked  she did not answer he turned to miriam  where are you going he asked  to the castle  what train are you going home by  i am driving with father i wish you could come too what time are you free  you know not till eight tonight damn it  and directly the two women moved on  paul remembered that clara dawes was the daughter of an old friend of mrs leivers miriam had sought her out because she had once been spiral overseer at jordans and because her husband baxter dawes was smith for the factory making the irons for cripple instruments and so on through her miriam felt she got into direct contact with jordans and could estimate better pauls position but mrs dawes was separated from her husband and had taken up womens rights she was supposed to be clever it interested paul  baxter dawes he knew and disliked the smith was a man of thirtyone or thirtytwo he came occasionally through pauls cornera big wellset man also striking to look at and handsome there was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife he had the same white skin with a clear golden tinge his hair was of soft brown his moustache was golden and he had a similar defiance in his bearing and manner but then came the difference his eyes dark brown and quickshifting were dissolute they protruded very slightly and his eyelids hung over them in a way that was half hate his mouth too was sensual his whole manner was of cowed defiance as if he were ready to knock anybody down who disapproved of himperhaps because he really disapproved of himself  from the first day he had hated paul finding the lads impersonal deliberate gaze of an artist on his face he got into a fury  what are yer lookin at he sneered bullying  the boy glanced away but the smith used to stand behind the counter and talk to mr pappleworth his speech was dirty with a kind of rottenness again he found the youth with his cool critical gaze fixed on his face the smith started round as if he had been stung  whatr yer lookin at three haporth o pap he snarled  the boy shrugged his shoulders slightly  why yer shouted dawes  leave him alone said mr pappleworth in that insinuating voice which means hes only one of your good little sops who cant help it  since that time the boy used to look at the man every time he came through with the same curious criticism glancing away before he met the smiths eye it made dawes furious they hated each other in silence  clara dawes had no children when she had left her husband the home had been broken up and she had gone to live with her mother dawes lodged with his sister in the same house was a sisterinlaw and somehow paul knew that this girl louie travers was now dawess woman she was a handsome insolent hussy who mocked at the youth and yet flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home  the next time he went to see miriam it was saturday evening she had a fire in the parlour and was waiting for him the others except her father and mother and the young children had gone out so the two had the parlour together it was a long low warm room there were three of pauls small sketches on the wall and his photo was on the mantelpiece on the table and on the high old rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves he sat in the armchair she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet the glow was warm on her handsome pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee  what did you think of mrs dawes she asked quietly  she doesnt look very amiable he replied  no but dont you think shes a fine woman she said in a deep tone  yesin stature but without a grain of taste i like her for some things is she disagreeable  i dont think so i think shes dissatisfied  what with  wellhow would you like to be tied for life to a man like that  why did she marry him then if she was to have revulsions so soon  ay why did she repeated miriam bitterly  and i should have thought she had enough fight in her to match him he said  miriam bowed her head  ay she queried satirically what makes you think so  look at her mouthmade for passionand the very setback of her throat he threw his head back in claras defiant manner  miriam bowed a little lower  yes she said  there was a silence for some moments while he thought of clara  and what were the things you liked about her she asked  i dont knowher skin and the texture of herand heri dont knowtheres a sort of fierceness somewhere in her i appreciate her as an artist thats all  yes  he wondered why miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way it irritated him  you dont really like her do you he asked the girl  she looked at him with her great dazzled dark eyes  i do she said  you dontyou cantnot really  then what she asked slowly  eh i dont knowperhaps you like her because shes got a grudge against men  that was more probably one of his own reasons for liking mrs dawes but this did not occur to him they were silent there had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was becoming habitual with him particularly when he was with miriam she longed to smooth it away and she was afraid of it it seemed the stamp of a man who was not her man in paul morel  there were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl he reached over and pulled out a bunch  if you put red berries in your hair he said why would you look like some witch or priestess and never like a reveller  she laughed with a naked painful sound  i dont know she said  his vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries  why cant you laugh he said you never laugh laughter you only laugh when something is odd or incongruous and then it almost seems to hurt you  she bowed her head as if he were scolding her  i wish you could laugh at me just for one minutejust for one minute i feel as if it would set something free  butand she looked up at him with eyes frightened and strugglingi do laugh at youi do  never theres always a kind of intensity when you laugh i could always cry it seems as if it shows up your suffering oh you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate  slowly she shook her head despairingly  im sure i dont want to she said  im so damned spiritual with you always he cried  she remained silent thinking then why dont you be otherwise but he saw her crouching brooding figure and it seemed to tear him in two  but there its autumn he said and everybody feels like a disembodied spirit then  there was still another silence this peculiar sadness between them thrilled her soul he seemed so beautiful with his eyes gone dark and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well  you make me so spiritual he lamented and i dont want to be spiritual  she took her finger from her mouth with a little pop and looked up at him almost challenging but still her soul was naked in her great dark eyes and there was the same yearning appeal upon her if he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so but he could not kiss her thusand she seemed to leave no other way and she yearned to him  he gave a brief laugh  well he said get that french and well do somesome verlaine  yes she said in a deep tone almost of resignation and she rose and got the books and her rather red nervous hands looked so pitiful he was mad to comfort her and kiss her but then be dared notor could not there was something prevented him his kisses were wrong for her they continued the reading till ten oclock when they went into the kitchen and paul was natural and jolly again with the father and mother his eyes were dark and shining there was a kind of fascination about him  when he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front wheel punctured  fetch me a drop of water in a bowl he said to her i shall be late and then i sll catch it  he lighted the hurricane lamp took off his coat turned up the bicycle and set speedily to work miriam came with the bowl of water and stood close to him watching she loved to see his hands doing things he was slim and vigorous with a kind of easiness even in his most hasty movements and busy at his work he seemed to forget her she loved him absorbedly she wanted to run her hands down his sides she always wanted to embrace him so long as he did not want her  there he said rising suddenly now could you have done it quicker  no she laughed  he straightened himself his back was towards her she put her two hands on his sides and ran them quickly down  you are so fine she said  he laughed hating her voice but his blood roused to a wave of flame by her hands she did not seem to realise him in all this he might have been an object she never realised the male he was  he lighted his bicyclelamp bounced the machine on the barn floor to see that the tyres were sound and buttoned his coat  thats all right he said  she was trying the brakes that she knew were broken  did you have them mended she asked  no  but why didnt you  the back one goes on a bit  but its not safe  i can use my toe  i wish youd had them mended she murmured  dont worrycome to tea tomorrow with edgar  shall we  doabout four ill come to meet you  very well  she was pleased they went across the dark yard to the gate looking across he saw through the uncurtained window of the kitchen the heads of mr and mrs leivers in the warm glow it looked very cosy the road with pine trees was quite black in front  till tomorrow he said jumping on his bicycle  youll take care wont you she pleaded  yes  his voice already came out of the darkness she stood a moment watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground she turned very slowly indoors orion was wheeling up over the wood his dog twinkling after him half smothered for the rest the world was full of darkness and silent save for the breathing of cattle in their stalls she prayed earnestly for his safety that night when he left her she often lay in anxiety wondering if he had got home safely  he dropped down the hills on his bicycle the roads were greasy so he had to let it go he felt a pleasure as the machine plunged over the second steeper drop in the hill here goes he said it was risky because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom and because of the brewers waggons with drunken waggoners asleep his bicycle seemed to fall beneath him and he loved it recklessness is almost a mans revenge on his woman he feels he is not valued so he will risk destroying himself to deprive her altogether  the stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers silver upon the blackness as he spun past then there was the long climb home  see mother he said as he threw her the berries and leaves on to the table  hm she said glancing at them then away again she sat reading alone as she always did  arent they pretty  yes  he knew she was cross with him after a few minutes he said  edgar and miriam are coming to tea tomorrow  she did not answer  you dont mind  still she did not answer  do you he asked  you know whether i mind or not  i dont see why you should i have plenty of meals there  you do  then why do you begrudge them tea  i begrudge whom tea  what are you so horrid for  oh say no more youve asked her to tea its quite sufficient shell come  he was very angry with his mother he knew it was merely miriam she objected to he flung off his boots and went to bed  paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon he was glad to see them coming they arrived home at about four oclock everywhere was clean and still for sunday afternoon mrs morel sat in her black dress and black apron she rose to meet the visitors with edgar she was cordial but with miriam cold and rather grudging yet paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock  he helped his mother to get the tea ready miriam would have gladly proffered but was afraid he was rather proud of his home there was about it now he thought a certain distinction the chairs were only wooden and the sofa was old but the hearthrug and cushions were cosy the pictures were prints in good taste there was a simplicity in everything and plenty of books he was never ashamed in the least of his home nor was miriam of hers because both were what they should be and warm and then he was proud of the table the china was pretty the cloth was fine it did not matter that the spoons were not silver nor the knives ivoryhandled everything looked nice mrs morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up so that nothing was out of place  miriam talked books a little that was her unfailing topic but mrs morel was not cordial and turned soon to edgar  at first edgar and miriam used to go into mrs morels pew morel never went to chapel preferring the publichouse mrs morel like a little champion sat at the head of her pew paul at the other end and at first miriam sat next to him then the chapel was like home it was a pretty place with dark pews and slim elegant pillars and flowers and the same people had sat in the same places ever since he was a boy it was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit there for an hour and a half next to miriam and near to his mother uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship then he felt warm and happy and religious at once and after chapel he walked home with miriam whilst mrs morel spent the rest of the evening with her old friend mrs burns he was keenly alive on his walks on sunday nights with edgar and miriam he never went past the pits at night by the lighted lamphouse the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks past the fans spinning slowly like shadows without the feeling of miriam returning to him keen and almost unbearable  she did not very long occupy the morels pew her father took one for themselves once more it was under the little gallery opposite the morels when paul and his mother came in the chapel the leiverss pew was always empty he was anxious for fear she would not come it was so far and there were so many rainy sundays then often very late indeed she came in with her long stride her head bowed her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet her face as she sat opposite was always in shadow but it gave him a very keen feeling as if all his soul stirred within him to see her there it was not the same glow happiness and pride that he felt in having his mother in charge something more wonderful less human and tinged to intensity by a pain as if there were something he could not get to  at this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed he was twentyone and she was twenty she was beginning to dread the spring he became so wild and hurt her so much all the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs edgar enjoyed it he was by nature critical and rather dispassionate but miriam suffered exquisite pain as with an intellect like a knife the man she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had her being but he did not spare her he was cruel and when they went alone he was even more fierce as if he would kill her soul he bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness  she exultsshe exults as she carries him off from me mrs morel cried in her heart when paul had gone shes not like an ordinary woman who can leave me my share in him she wants to absorb him she wants to draw him out and absorb him till there is nothing left of him even for himself he will never be a man on his own feetshe will suck him up so the mother sat and battled and brooded bitterly  and he coming home from his walks with miriam was wild with torture he walked biting his lips and with clenched fists going at a great rate then brought up against a stile he stood for some minutes and did not move there was a great hollow of darkness fronting him and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights and in the lowest trough of the night a flare of the pit it was all weird and dreadful why was he torn so almost bewildered and unable to move why did his mother sit at home and suffer he knew she suffered badly but why should she and why did he hate miriam and feel so cruel towards her at the thought of his mother if miriam caused his mother suffering then he hated herand he easily hated her why did she make him feel as if he were uncertain of himself insecure an indefinite thing as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the space breaking into him how he hated her and then what a rush of tenderness and humility  suddenly he plunged on again running home his mother saw on him the marks of some agony and she said nothing but he had to make her talk to him then she was angry with him for going so far with miriam  why dont you like her mother he cried in despair  i dont know my boy she replied piteously im sure ive tried to like her ive tried and tried but i canti cant  and he felt dreary and hopeless between the two  spring was the worst time he was changeable and intense and cruel so he decided to stay away from her then came the hours when he knew miriam was expecting him his mother watched him growing restless he could not go on with his work he could do nothing it was as if something were drawing his soul out towards willey farm then he put on his hat and went saying nothing and his mother knew he was gone and as soon as he was on the way he sighed with relief and when he was with her he was cruel again  one day in march he lay on the bank of nethermere with miriam sitting beside him it was a glistening whiteandblue day big clouds so brilliant went by overhead while shadows stole along on the water the clear spaces in the sky were of clean cold blue paul lay on his back in the old grass looking up he could not bear to look at miriam she seemed to want him and he resisted he resisted all the time he wanted now to give her passion and tenderness and he could not he felt that she wanted the soul out of his body and not him all his strength and energy she drew into herself through some channel which united them she did not want to meet him so that there were two of them man and woman together she wanted to draw all of him into her it urged him to an intensity like madness which fascinated him as drugtaking might  he was discussing michael angelo it felt to her as if she were fingering the very quivering tissue the very protoplasm of life as she heard him it gave her deepest satisfaction and in the end it frightened her there he lay in the white intensity of his search and his voice gradually filled her with fear so level it was almost inhuman as if in a trance  dont talk any more she pleaded softly laying her hand on his forehead  he lay quite still almost unable to move his body was somewhere discarded  why not are you tired  yes and it wears you out  he laughed shortly realising  yet you always make me like it he said  i dont wish to she said very low  not when youve gone too far and you feel you cant bear it but your unconscious self always asks it of me and i suppose i want it  he went on in his dead fashion  if only you could want me and not want what i can reel off for you   i she cried bitterlyi why when would you let me take you  then its my fault he said and gathering himself together he got up and began to talk trivialities he felt insubstantial in a vague way he hated her for it and he knew he was as much to blame himself this however did not prevent his hating her  one evening about this time he had walked along the home road with her they stood by the pasture leading down to the wood unable to part as the stars came out the clouds closed they had glimpses of their own constellation orion towards the west his jewels glimmered for a moment his dog ran low struggling with difficulty through the spume of cloud  orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations they had gazed at him in their strange surcharged hours of feeling until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars this evening paul had been moody and perverse orion had seemed just an ordinary constellation to him he had fought against his glamour and fascination miriam was watching her lovers mood carefully but he said nothing that gave him away till the moment came to part when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds behind which the great constellation must be striding still  there was to be a little party at his house the next day at which she was to attend  i shant come and meet you he said  oh very well its not very nice out she replied slowly  its not thatonly they dont like me to they say i care more for you than for them and you understand dont you you know its only friendship  miriam was astonished and hurt for him it had cost him an effort she left him wanting to spare him any further humiliation a fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road she was hurt deep down and she despised him for being blown about by any wind of authority and in her heart of hearts unconsciously she felt that he was trying to get away from her this she would never have acknowledged she pitied him  at this time paul became an important factor in jordans warehouse mr pappleworth left to set up a business of his own and paul remained with mr jordan as spiral overseer his wages were to be raised to thirty shillings at the yearend if things went well  still on friday night miriam often came down for her french lesson paul did not go so frequently to willey farm and she grieved at the thought of her educations coming to end moreover they both loved to be together in spite of discords so they read balzac and did compositions and felt highly cultured  friday night was reckoning night for the miners morel reckonedshared up the money of the stalleither in the new inn at bretty or in his own house according as his fellowbutties wished barker had turned a nondrinker so now the men reckoned at morels house  annie who had been teaching away was at home again she was still a tomboy and she was engaged to be married paul was studying design  morel was always in good spirits on friday evening unless the weeks earnings were small he bustled immediately after his dinner prepared to get washed it was decorum for the women to absent themselves while the men reckoned women were not supposed to spy into such a masculine privacy as the butties reckoning nor were they to know the exact amount of the weeks earnings so whilst her father was spluttering in the scullery annie went out to spend an hour with a neighbour mrs morel attended to her baking  shut that dooer bawled morel furiously  annie banged it behind her and was gone  if tha oppens it again while im weshin me ill mae thy jaw rattle he threatened from the midst of his soapsuds paul and the mother frowned to hear him  presently he came running out of the scullery with the soapy water dripping from him dithering with cold  oh my sirs he said wheers my towel  it was hung on a chair to warm before the fire otherwise he would have bullied and blustered he squatted on his heels before the hot bakingfire to dry himself  ffff he went pretending to shudder with cold  goodness man dont be such a kid said mrs morel its not cold  thee strip thysen stark nakd to wesh thy flesh i that scullery said the miner as he rubbed his hair nowt br a iceouse  and i shouldnt make that fuss replied his wife  no thad drop down stiff as dead as a doorknob wi thy nesh sides  why is a doorknob deader than anything else asked paul curious  eh i dunno thats what they say replied his father but theres that much draught i yon scullery as it blows through your ribs like through a fivebarred gate  it would have some difficulty in blowing through yours said mrs morel  morel looked down ruefully at his sides  me he exclaimed im nowt br a skinned rabbit my bones fair juts out on me  i should like to know where retorted his wife  ivrywheer im nobbut a sack o faggots  mrs morel laughed he had still a wonderfully young body muscular without any fat his skin was smooth and clear it might have been the body of a man of twentyeight except that there were perhaps too many blue scars like tattoomarks where the coaldust remained under the skin and that his chest was too hairy but he put his hand on his side ruefully it was his fixed belief that because he did not get fat he was as thin as a starved rat paul looked at his fathers thick brownish hands all scarred with broken nails rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides and the incongruity struck him it seemed strange they were the same flesh  i suppose he said to his father you had a good figure once  eh exclaimed the miner glancing round startled and timid like a child  he had exclaimed mrs morel if he didnt hurtle himself up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could  me exclaimed morelme a good figure i wor niver much more nr a skeleton  man cried his wife dont be such a pulamiter  strewth he said thas niver knowed me but what i looked as if i wor goin off in a rapid decline  she sat and laughed  youve had a constitution like iron she said and never a man had a better start if it was body that counted you should have seen him as a young man she cried suddenly to paul drawing herself up to imitate her husbands once handsome bearing  morel watched her shyly he saw again the passion she had had for him it blazed upon her for a moment he was shy rather scared and humble yet again he felt his old glow and then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years he wanted to bustle about to run away from it  gie my back a bit of a wesh he asked her  his wife brought a wellsoaped flannel and clapped it on his shoulders he gave a jump  eh tha mucky little ussy he cried cowd as death  you ought to have been a salamander she laughed washing his back it was very rarely she would do anything so personal for him the children did those things  the next world wont be half hot enough for you she added  no he said thalt see as its draughty for me  but she had finished she wiped him in a desultory fashion and went upstairs returning immediately with his shiftingtrousers when he was dried he struggled into his shirt then ruddy and shiny with hair on end and his flannelette shirt hanging over his pittrousers he stood warming the garments he was going to put on he turned them he pulled them inside out he scorched them  goodness man cried mrs morel get dressed  should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd as a tub o water he said  at last he took off his pittrousers and donned decent black he did all this on the hearthrug as he would have done if annie and her familiar friends had been present  mrs morel turned the bread in the oven then from the red earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took another handful of paste worked it to the proper shape and dropped it into a tin as she was doing so barker knocked and entered he was a quiet compact little man who looked as if he would go through a stone wall his black hair was cropped short his head was bony like most miners he was pale but healthy and taut  evenin missis he nodded to mrs morel and he seated himself with a sigh  goodevening she replied cordially  thas made thy heels crack said morel  i dunno as i have said barker  he sat as the men always did in morels kitchen effacing himself rather  hows missis she asked of him  he had told her some time back  were expectin us third just now you see  well he answered rubbing his head she keeps pretty middlin i think  lets seewhen asked mrs morel  well i shouldnt be surprised any time now  ah and shes kept fairly  yes tidy  thats a blessing for shes none too strong  no an ive done another silly trick  whats that  mrs morel knew barker wouldnt do anything very silly  im come beout th marketbag  you can have mine  nay youll be wantin that yourself  i shant i take a string bag always  she saw the determined little collier buying in the weeks groceries and meat on the friday nights and she admired him barkers little but hes ten times the man you are she said to her husband  just then wesson entered he was thin rather fraillooking with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile despite his seven children but his wife was a passionate woman  i see youve kested me he said smiling rather vapidly  yes replied barker  the newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler his nose was pointed and red  im afraid youre cold mr wesson said mrs morel  its a bit nippy he replied  then come to the fire  nay i sll do where i am  both colliers sat away back they could not be induced to come on to the hearth the hearth is sacred to the family  go thy ways i th armchair cried morel cheerily  nay thank yer im very nicely here  yes come of course insisted mrs morel  he rose and went awkwardly he sat in morels armchair awkwardly it was too great a familiarity but the fire made him blissfully happy  and hows that chest of yours demanded mrs morel  he smiled again with his blue eyes rather sunny  oh its very middlin he said  wi a rattle in it like a kettledrum said barker shortly  tttt went mrs morel rapidly with her tongue did you have that flannel singlet made  not yet he smiled  then why didnt you she cried  itll come he smiled  ah an doomsday exclaimed barker  barker and morel were both impatient of wesson but then they were both as hard as nails physically  when morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to paul  count it boy he asked humbly  paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil tipped the bag upside down on the table there was a fivepound bag of silver sovereigns and loose money he counted quickly referred to the checksthe written papers giving amount of coalput the money in order then barker glanced at the checks  mrs morel went upstairs and the three men came to table morel as master of the house sat in his armchair with his back to the hot fire the two butties had cooler seats none of them counted the money  what did we say simpsons was asked morel and the butties cavilled for a minute over the daymans earnings then the amount was put aside  an bill naylors  this money also was taken from the pack  then because wesson lived in one of the companys houses and his rent had been deducted morel and barker took fourandsix each and because morels coals had come and the leading was stopped barker and wesson took four shillings each then it was plain sailing morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns each half a crown till there were no more halfcrowns each a shilling till there were no more shillings if there was anything at the end that wouldnt split morel took it and stood drinks  then the three men rose and went morel scuttled out of the house before his wife came down she heard the door close and descended she looked hastily at the bread in the oven then glancing on the table she saw her money lying paul had been working all the time but now he felt his mother counting the weeks money and her wrath rising  ttttt went her tongue  he frowned he could not work when she was cross she counted again  a measly twentyfive shillings she exclaimed how much was the cheque  ten pounds eleven said paul irritably he dreaded what was coming  and he gives me a scrattlin twentyfive an his club this week but i know him he thinks because youre earning he neednt keep the house any longer no all he has to do with his money is to guttle it but ill show him  oh mother dont cried paul  dont what i should like to know she exclaimed  dont carry on again i cant work  she went very quiet  yes its all very well she said but how do you think im going to manage  well it wont make it any better to whittle about it  i should like to know what youd do if you had it to put up with  it wont be long you can have my money let him go to hell  he went back to his work and she tied her bonnetstrings grimly when she was fretted he could not bear it but now he began to insist on her recognizing him  the two loaves at the top she said will be done in twenty minutes dont forget them  all right he answered and she went to market  he remained alone working but his usual intense concentration became unsettled he listened for the yardgate at a quarterpast seven came a low knock and miriam entered  all alone she said  yes  as if at home she took off her tamoshanter and her long coat hanging them up it gave him a thrill this might be their own house his and hers then she came back and peered over his work  what is it she asked  still design for decorating stuffs and for embroidery  she bent shortsightedly over the drawings  it irritated him that she peered so into everything that was his searching him out he went into the parlour and returned with a bundle of brownish linen carefully unfolding it he spread it on the floor it proved to be a curtain or portiere beautifully stencilled with a design on roses  ah how beautiful she cried  the spread cloth with its wonderful reddish roses and dark green stems all so simple and somehow so wickedlooking lay at her feet she went on her knees before it her dark curls dropping he saw her crouched voluptuously before his work and his heart beat quickly suddenly she looked up at him  why does it seem cruel she asked  what  there seems a feeling of cruelty about it she said  its jolly good whether or not he replied folding up his work with a lovers hands  she rose slowly pondering  and what will you do with it she asked  send it to libertys i did it for my mother but i think shed rather have the money  yes said miriam he had spoken with a touch of bitterness and miriam sympathised money would have been nothing to her  he took the cloth back into the parlour when he returned he threw to miriam a smaller piece it was a cushioncover with the same design  i did that for you he said  she fingered the work with trembling hands and did not speak he became embarrassed  by jove the bread he cried  he took the top loaves out tapped them vigorously they were done he put them on the hearth to cool then he went to the scullery wetted his hands scooped the last white dough out of the punchion and dropped it in a bakingtin miriam was still bent over her painted cloth he stood rubbing the bits of dough from his hands  you do like it he asked  she looked up at him with her dark eyes one flame of love he laughed uncomfortably then he began to talk about the design there was for him the most intense pleasure in talking about his work to miriam all his passion all his wild blood went into this intercourse with her when he talked and conceived his work she brought forth to him his imaginations she did not understand any more than a woman understands when she conceives a child in her womb but this was life for her and for him  while they were talking a young woman of about twentytwo small and pale holloweyed yet with a relentless look about her entered the room she was a friend at the morels  take your things off said paul  no im not stopping  she sat down in the armchair opposite paul and miriam who were on the sofa miriam moved a little farther from him the room was hot with a scent of new bread brown crisp loaves stood on the hearth  i shouldnt have expected to see you here tonight miriam leivers said beatrice wickedly  why not murmured miriam huskily  why lets look at your shoes  miriam remained uncomfortably still  if tha doesna tha dursna laughed beatrice  miriam put her feet from under her dress her boots had that queer irresolute rather pathetic look about them which showed how selfconscious and selfmistrustful she was and they were covered with mud  glory youre a positive muckheap exclaimed beatrice who cleans your boots  i clean them myself  then you wanted a job said beatrice it would ha taken a lot of men to ha brought me down here tonight but love laughs at sludge doesnt it postle my duck  inter alia he said  oh lord are you going to spout foreign languages what does it mean miriam  there was a fine sarcasm in the last question but miriam did not see it  among other things i believe she said humbly  beatrice put her tongue between her teeth and laughed wickedly  among other things postle she repeated do you mean love laughs at mothers and fathers and sisters and brothers and men friends and lady friends and even at the bloved himself  she affected a great innocence  in fact its one big smile he replied  up its sleeve postle morelyou believe me she said and she went off into another burst of wicked silent laughter  miriam sat silent withdrawn into herself every one of pauls friends delighted in taking sides against her and he left her in the lurchseemed almost to have a sort of revenge upon her then  are you still at school asked miriam of beatrice  yes  youve not had your notice then  i expect it at easter  isnt it an awful shame to turn you off merely because you didnt pass the exam  i dont know said beatrice coldly  agatha says youre as good as any teacher anywhere it seems to me ridiculous i wonder why you didnt pass  short of brains eh postle said beatrice briefly  only brains to bite with replied paul laughing  nuisance she cried and springing from her seat she rushed and boxed his ears she had beautiful small hands he held her wrists while she wrestled with him at last she broke free and seized two handfuls of his thick dark brown hair which she shook  beat he said as he pulled his hair straight with his fingers i hate you  she laughed with glee  mind she said i want to sit next to you  id as lief be neighbours with a vixen he said nevertheless making place for her between him and miriam  did it ruffle his pretty hair then she cried and with her haircomb she combed him straight and his nice little moustache she exclaimed she tilted his head back and combed his young moustache its a wicked moustache postle she said its a red for danger have you got any of those cigarettes  he pulled his cigarettecase from his pocket beatrice looked inside it  and fancy me having connies last cig said beatrice putting the thing between her teeth he held a lit match to her and she puffed daintily  thanks so much darling she said mockingly  it gave her a wicked delight  dont you think he does it nicely miriam she asked  oh very said miriam  he took a cigarette for himself  light old boy said beatrice tilting her cigarette at him  he bent forward to her to light his cigarette at hers she was winking at him as he did so miriam saw his eyes trembling with mischief and his full almost sensual mouth quivering he was not himself and she could not bear it as he was now she had no connection with him she might as well not have existed she saw the cigarette dancing on his full red lips she hated his thick hair for being tumbled loose on his forehead  sweet boy said beatrice tipping up his chin and giving him a little kiss on the cheek  i sll kiss thee back beat he said  tha wunna she giggled jumping up and going away isnt he shameless miriam  quite said miriam by the way arent you forgetting the bread  by jove he cried flinging open the oven door  out puffed the bluish smoke and a smell of burned bread  oh golly cried beatrice coming to his side he crouched before the oven she peered over his shoulder this is what comes of the oblivion of love my boy  paul was ruefully removing the loaves one was burnt black on the hot side another was hard as a brick  poor mater said paul  you want to grate it said beatrice fetch me the nutmeggrater  she arranged the bread in the oven he brought the grater and she grated the bread on to a newspaper on the table he set the doors open to blow away the smell of burned bread beatrice grated away puffing her cigarette knocking the charcoal off the poor loaf  my word miriam youre in for it this time said beatrice  i exclaimed miriam in amazement  youd better be gone when his mother comes in i know why king alfred burned the cakes now i see it postle would fix up a tale about his work making him forget if he thought it would wash if that old woman had come in a bit sooner shed have boxed the brazen things ears who made the oblivion instead of poor alfreds  she giggled as she scraped the loaf even miriam laughed in spite of herself paul mended the fire ruefully  the garden gate was heard to bang  quick cried beatrice giving paul the scraped loaf wrap it up in a damp towel  paul disappeared into the scullery beatrice hastily blew her scrapings into the fire and sat down innocently annie came bursting in she was an abrupt quite smart young woman she blinked in the strong light  smell of burning she exclaimed  its the cigarettes replied beatrice demurely  wheres paul  leonard had followed annie he had a long comic face and blue eyes very sad  i suppose hes left you to settle it between you he said he nodded sympathetically to miriam and became gently sarcastic to beatrice  no said beatrice hes gone off with number nine  i just met number five inquiring for him said leonard  yeswere going to share him up like solomons baby said beatrice  annie laughed  oh ay said leonard and which bit should you have  i dont know said beatrice ill let all the others pick first  an youd have the leavings like said leonard twisting up a comic face  annie was looking in the oven miriam sat ignored paul entered  this breads a fine sight our paul said annie  then you should stop an look after it said paul  you mean you should do what youre reckoning to do replied annie  he should shouldnt he cried beatrice  i sd think hed got plenty on hand said leonard  you had a nasty walk didnt you miriam said annie  yesbut id been in all week  and you wanted a bit of a change like insinuated leonard kindly  well you cant be stuck in the house for ever annie agreed she was quite amiable beatrice pulled on her coat and went out with leonard and annie she would meet her own boy  dont forget that bread our paul cried annie goodnight miriam i dont think it will rain  when they had all gone paul fetched the swathed loaf unwrapped it and surveyed it sadly  its a mess he said  but answered miriam impatiently what is it after alltwopence hapenny  yes butits the maters precious baking and shell take it to heart however its no good bothering  he took the loaf back into the scullery there was a little distance between him and miriam he stood balanced opposite her for some moments considering thinking of his behaviour with beatrice he felt guilty inside himself and yet glad for some inscrutable reason it served miriam right he was not going to repent she wondered what he was thinking of as he stood suspended his thick hair was tumbled over his forehead why might she not push it back for him and remove the marks of beatrices comb why might she not press his body with her two hands it looked so firm and every whit living and he would let other girls why not her  suddenly he started into life it made her quiver almost with terror as he quickly pushed the hair off his forehead and came towards her  halfpast eight he said wed better buck up wheres your french  miriam shyly and rather bitterly produced her exercisebook every week she wrote for him a sort of diary of her inner life in her own french he had found this was the only way to get her to do compositions and her diary was mostly a loveletter he would read it now she felt as if her souls history were going to be desecrated by him in his present mood he sat beside her she watched his hand firm and warm rigorously scoring her work he was reading only the french ignoring her soul that was there but gradually his hand forgot its work he read in silence motionless she quivered  ce matin les oiseaux mont eveille he read il faisait encore un crepuscule mais la petite fenetre de ma chambre etait bleme et puis jaune et tous les oiseaux du bois eclaterent dans un chanson vif et resonnant toute laube tressaillit javais reve de vous estce que vous voyez aussi laube les oiseaux meveillent presque tous les matins et toujours il y a quelque chose de terreur dans le cri des grives il est si clair  miriam sat tremulous half ashamed he remained quite still trying to understand he only knew she loved him he was afraid of her love for him it was too good for him and he was inadequate his own love was at fault not hers ashamed he corrected her work humbly writing above her words  look he said quietly the past participle conjugated with avoir agrees with the direct object when it precedes  she bent forward trying to see and to understand her free fine curls tickled his face he started as if they had been red hot shuddering he saw her peering forward at the page her red lips parted piteously the black hair springing in fine strands across her tawny ruddy cheek she was coloured like a pomegranate for richness his breath came short as he watched her suddenly she looked up at him her dark eyes were naked with their love afraid and yearning his eyes too were dark and they hurt her they seemed to master her she lost all her selfcontrol was exposed in fear and he knew before he could kiss her he must drive something out of himself and a touch of hate for her crept back again into his heart he returned to her exercise  suddenly he flung down the pencil and was at the oven in a leap turning the bread for miriam he was too quick she started violently and it hurt her with real pain even the way he crouched before the oven hurt her there seemed to be something cruel in it something cruel in the swift way he pitched the bread out of the tins caught it up again if only he had been gentle in his movements she would have felt so rich and warm as it was she was hurt  he returned and finished the exercise  youve done well this week he said  she saw he was flattered by her diary it did not repay her entirely  you really do blossom out sometimes he said you ought to write poetry  she lifted her head with joy then she shook it mistrustfully  i dont trust myself she said  you should try  again she shook her head  shall we read or is it too late he asked  it is latebut we can read just a little she pleaded  she was really getting now the food for her life during the next week he made her copy baudelaires le balcon then he read it for her his voice was soft and caressing but growing almost brutal he had a way of lifting his lips and showing his teeth passionately and bitterly when he was much moved this he did now it made miriam feel as if he were trampling on her she dared not look at him but sat with her head bowed she could not understand why he got into such a tumult and fury it made her wretched she did not like baudelaire on the wholenor verlaine       behold her singing in the field      yon solitary highland lass  that nourished her heart so did fair ines and       it was a beauteous evening calm and pure      and breathing holy quiet like a nun  these were like herself and there was he saying in his throat bitterly  tu te rappelleras la beaute des caresses  the poem was finished he took the bread out of the oven arranging the burnt loaves at the bottom of the panchion the good ones at the top the desiccated loaf remained swathed up in the scullery  mater neednt know till morning he said it wont upset her so much then as at night  miriam looked in the bookcase saw what postcards and letters he had received saw what books were there she took one that had interested him then he turned down the gas and they set off he did not trouble to lock the door  he was not home again until a quarter to eleven his mother was seated in the rockingchair annie with a rope of hair hanging down her back remained sitting on a low stool before the fire her elbows on her knees gloomily on the table stood the offending loaf unswathed paul entered rather breathless no one spoke his mother was reading the little local newspaper he took off his coat and went to sit down on the sofa his mother moved curtly aside to let him pass no one spoke he was very uncomfortable for some minutes he sat pretending to read a piece of paper he found on the table then  i forgot that bread mother he said  there was no answer from either woman  well he said its only twopence hapenny i can pay you for that  being angry he put three pennies on the table and slid them towards his mother she turned away her head her mouth was shut tightly  yes said annie you dont know how badly my mother is  the girl sat staring glumly into the fire  why is she badly asked paul in his overbearing way  well said annie she could scarcely get home  he looked closely at his mother she looked ill  why could you scarcely get home he asked her still sharply she would not answer  i found her as white as a sheet sitting here said annie with a suggestion of tears in her voice  well why insisted paul his brows were knitting his eyes dilating passionately  it was enough to upset anybody said mrs morel hugging those parcelsmeat and greengroceries and a pair of curtains  well why did you hug them you neednt have done  then who would  let annie fetch the meat  yes and i would fetch the meat but how was i to know you were off with miriam instead of being in when my mother came  and what was the matter with you asked paul of his mother  i suppose its my heart she replied certainly she looked bluish round the mouth  and have you felt it before  yesoften enough  then why havent you told meand why havent you seen a doctor  mrs morel shifted in her chair angry with him for his hectoring  youd never notice anything said annie youre too eager to be off with miriam  oh am iand any worse than you with leonard  i was in at a quarter to ten  there was silence in the room for a time  i should have thought said mrs morel bitterly that she wouldnt have occupied you so entirely as to burn a whole ovenful of bread  beatrice was here as well as she  very likely but we know why the bread is spoilt  why he flashed  because you were engrossed with miriam replied mrs morel hotly  oh very wellthen it was not he replied angrily  he was distressed and wretched seizing a paper he began to read annie her blouse unfastened her long ropes of hair twisted into a plait went up to bed bidding him a very curt goodnight  paul sat pretending to read he knew his mother wanted to upbraid him he also wanted to know what had made her ill for he was troubled so instead of running away to bed as he would have liked to do he sat and waited there was a tense silence the clock ticked loudly  youd better go to bed before your father comes in said the mother harshly and if youre going to have anything to eat youd better get it  i dont want anything  it was his mothers custom to bring him some trifle for supper on friday night the night of luxury for the colliers he was too angry to go and find it in the pantry this night this insulted her  if i wanted you to go to selby on friday night i can imagine the scene said mrs morel but youre never too tired to go if she will come for you nay you neither want to eat nor drink then  i cant let her go alone  cant you and why does she come  not because i ask her  she doesnt come without you want her  well what if i do want her he replied  why nothing if it was sensible or reasonable but to go trapseing up there miles and miles in the mud coming home at midnight and got to go to nottingham in the morning  if i hadnt youd be just the same  yes i should because theres no sense in it is she so fascinating that you must follow her all that way mrs morel was bitterly sarcastic she sat still with averted face stroking with a rhythmic jerked movement the black sateen of her apron it was a movement that hurt paul to see  i do like her he said but  like her said mrs morel in the same biting tones it seems to me you like nothing and nobody else theres neither annie nor me nor anyone now for you  what nonsense motheryou know i dont love herii tell you i dont love hershe doesnt even walk with my arm because i dont want her to  then why do you fly to her so often  i do like to talk to heri never said i didnt but i dont love her  is there nobody else to talk to  not about the things we talk of theres a lot of things that youre not interested in that  what things  mrs morel was so intense that paul began to pant  whypaintingand books you dont care about herbert spencer  no was the sad reply and you wont at my age  well but i do nowand miriam does  and how do you know mrs morel flashed defiantly that i shouldnt do you ever try me  but you dont mother you know you dont care whether a pictures decorative or not you dont care what manner it is in  how do you know i dont care do you ever try me do you ever talk to me about these things to try  but its not that that matters to you mother you know ts not  what is it thenwhat is it then that matters to me she flashed he knitted his brows with pain  youre old mother and were young  he only meant that the interests of her age were not the interests of his but he realised the moment he had spoken that he had said the wrong thing  yes i know it welli am old and therefore i may stand aside i have nothing more to do with you you only want me to wait on youthe rest is for miriam  he could not bear it instinctively he realised that he was life to her and after all she was the chief thing to him the only supreme thing  you know it isnt mother you know it isnt  she was moved to pity by his cry  it looks a great deal like it she said half putting aside her despair  no motheri really dont love her i talk to her but i want to come home to you  he had taken off his collar and tie and rose barethroated to go to bed as he stooped to kiss his mother she threw her arms round his neck hid her face on his shoulder and cried in a whimpering voice so unlike her own that he writhed in agony  i cant bear it i could let another womanbut not her shed leave me no room not a bit of room  and immediately he hated miriam bitterly  and ive neveryou know paulive never had a husbandnot really  he stroked his mothers hair and his mouth was on her throat  and she exults so in taking you from meshes not like ordinary girls  well i dont love her mother he murmured bowing his head and hiding his eyes on her shoulder in misery his mother kissed him a long fervent kiss  my boy she said in a voice trembling with passionate love  without knowing he gently stroked her face  there said his mother now go to bed youll be so tired in the morning as she was speaking she heard her husband coming theres your fathernow go suddenly she looked at him almost as if in fear perhaps im selfish if you want her take her my boy  his mother looked so strange paul kissed her trembling  hamother he said softly  morel came in walking unevenly his hat was over one corner of his eye he balanced in the doorway  at your mischief again he said venomously  mrs morels emotion turned into sudden hate of the drunkard who had come in thus upon her  at any rate it is sober she said  hmhm hmhm he sneered he went into the passage hung up his hat and coat then they heard him go down three steps to the pantry he returned with a piece of porkpie in his fist it was what mrs morel had bought for her son  nor was that bought for you if you can give me no more than twentyfive shillings im sure im not going to buy you porkpie to stuff after youve swilled a bellyful of beer  whaatwhaat snarled morel toppling in his balance whaatnot for me he looked at the piece of meat and crust and suddenly in a vicious spurt of temper flung it into the fire  paul started to his feet  waste your own stuff he cried  whatwhat suddenly shouted morel jumping up and clenching his fist ill show yer yer young jockey  all right said paul viciously putting his head on one side show me  he would at that moment dearly have loved to have a smack at something morel was half crouching fists up ready to spring the young man stood smiling with his lips  ussha hissed the father swiping round with a great stroke just past his sons face he dared not even though so close really touch the young man but swerved an inch away  right said paul his eyes upon the side of his fathers mouth where in another instant his fist would have hit he ached for that stroke but he heard a faint moan from behind his mother was deadly pale and dark at the mouth morel was dancing up to deliver another blow  father said paul so that the word rang  morel started and stood at attention  mother moaned the boy mother  she began to struggle with herself her open eyes watched him although she could not move gradually she was coming to herself he laid her down on the sofa and ran upstairs for a little whisky which at last she could sip the tears were hopping down his face as he kneeled in front of her he did not cry but the tears ran down his face quickly morel on the opposite side of the room sat with his elbows on his knees glaring across  whats amatter with er he asked  faint replied paul  hm  the elderly man began to unlace his boots he stumbled off to bed his last fight was fought in that home  paul kneeled there stroking his mothers hand  dont be poorly motherdont be poorly he said time after time  its nothing my boy she murmured  at last he rose fetched in a large piece of coal and raked the fire then he cleared the room put everything straight laid the things for breakfast and brought his mothers candle  can you go to bed mother  yes ill come  sleep with annie mother not with him  no ill sleep in my own bed  dont sleep with him mother  ill sleep in my own bed  she rose and he turned out the gas then followed her closely upstairs carrying her candle on the landing he kissed her close  goodnight mother  goodnight she said  he pressed his face upon the pillow in a fury of misery and yet somewhere in his soul he was at peace because he still loved his mother best it was the bitter peace of resignation  the efforts of his father to conciliate him next day were a great humiliation to him  everybody tried to forget the scene    chapter ix  defeat of miriam  paul was dissatisfied with himself and with everything the deepest of his love belonged to his mother when he felt he had hurt her or wounded his love for her he could not bear it now it was spring and there was battle between him and miriam this year he had a good deal against her she was vaguely aware of it the old feeling that she was to be a sacrifice to this love which she had had when she prayed was mingled in all her emotions she did not at the bottom believe she ever would have him she did not believe in herself primarily doubted whether she could ever be what he would demand of her certainly she never saw herself living happily through a lifetime with him she saw tragedy sorrow and sacrifice ahead and in sacrifice she was proud in renunciation she was strong for she did not trust herself to support everyday life she was prepared for the big things and the deep things like tragedy it was the sufficiency of the small daylife she could not trust  the easter holidays began happily paul was his own frank self yet she felt it would go wrong on the sunday afternoon she stood at her bedroom window looking across at the oaktrees of the wood in whose branches a twilight was tangled below the bright sky of the afternoon greygreen rosettes of honeysuckle leaves hung before the window some already she fancied showing bud it was spring which she loved and dreaded  hearing the clack of the gate she stood in suspense it was a bright grey day paul came into the yard with his bicycle which glittered as he walked usually he rang his bell and laughed towards the house today he walked with shut lips and cold cruel bearing that had something of a slouch and a sneer in it she knew him well by now and could tell from that keenlooking aloof young body of his what was happening inside him there was a cold correctness in the way he put his bicycle in its place that made her heart sink  she came downstairs nervously she was wearing a new net blouse that she thought became her it had a high collar with a tiny ruff reminding her of mary queen of scots and making her she thought look wonderfully a woman and dignified at twenty she was fullbreasted and luxuriously formed her face was still like a soft rich mask unchangeable but her eyes once lifted were wonderful she was afraid of him he would notice her new blouse  he being in a hard ironical mood was entertaining the family to a description of a service given in the primitive methodist chapel conducted by one of the wellknown preachers of the sect he sat at the head of the table his mobile face with the eyes that could be so beautiful shining with tenderness or dancing with laughter now taking on one expression and then another in imitation of various people he was mocking his mockery always hurt her it was too near the reality he was too clever and cruel she felt that when his eyes were like this hard with mocking hate he would spare neither himself nor anybody else but mrs leivers was wiping her eyes with laughter and mr leivers just awake from his sunday nap was rubbing his head in amusement the three brothers sat with ruffled sleepy appearance in their shirtsleeves giving a guffaw from time to time the whole family loved a takeoff more than anything  he took no notice of miriam later she saw him remark her new blouse saw that the artist approved but it won from him not a spark of warmth she was nervous could hardly reach the teacups from the shelves  when the men went out to milk she ventured to address him personally  you were late she said  was i he answered  there was silence for a while  was it rough riding she asked  i didnt notice it she continued quickly to lay the table when she had finished  tea wont be for a few minutes will you come and look at the daffodils she said  he rose without answering they went out into the back garden under the budding damsontrees the hills and the sky were clean and cold everything looked washed rather hard miriam glanced at paul he was pale and impassive it seemed cruel to her that his eyes and brows which she loved could look so hurting  has the wind made you tired she asked she detected an underneath feeling of weariness about him  no i think not he answered  it must be rough on the roadthe wood moans so  you can see by the clouds its a southwest wind that helps me here  you see i dont cycle so i dont understand she murmured  is there need to cycle to know that he said  she thought his sarcasms were unnecessary they went forward in silence round the wild tussocky lawn at the back of the house was a thorn hedge under which daffodils were craning forward from among their sheaves of greygreen blades the cheeks of the flowers were greenish with cold but still some had burst and their gold ruffled and glowed miriam went on her knees before one cluster took a wildlooking daffodil between her hands turned up its face of gold to her and bowed down caressing it with her mouth and cheeks and brow he stood aside with his hands in his pockets watching her one after another she turned up to him the faces of the yellow bursten flowers appealingly fondling them lavishly all the while  arent they magnificent she murmured  magnificent its a bit thicktheyre pretty  she bowed again to her flowers at his censure of her praise he watched her crouching sipping the flowers with fervid kisses  why must you always be fondling things he said irritably  but i love to touch them she replied hurt  can you never like things without clutching them as if you wanted to pull the heart out of them why dont you have a bit more restraint or reserve or something  she looked up at him full of pain then continued slowly to stroke her lips against a ruffled flower their scent as she smelled it was so much kinder than he it almost made her cry  you wheedle the soul out of things he said i would never wheedleat any rate id go straight  he scarcely knew what he was saying these things came from him mechanically she looked at him his body seemed one weapon firm and hard against her  youre always begging things to love you he said as if you were a beggar for love even the flowers you have to fawn on them  rhythmically miriam was swaying and stroking the flower with her mouth inhaling the scent which ever after made her shudder as it came to her nostrils  you dont want to loveyour eternal and abnormal craving is to be loved you arent positive youre negative you absorb absorb as if you must fill yourself up with love because youve got a shortage somewhere  she was stunned by his cruelty and did not hear he had not the faintest notion of what he was saying it was as if his fretted tortured soul run hot by thwarted passion jetted off these sayings like sparks from electricity she did not grasp anything he said she only sat crouched beneath his cruelty and his hatred of her she never realised in a flash over everything she brooded and brooded  after tea he stayed with edgar and the brothers taking no notice of miriam she extremely unhappy on this lookedfor holiday waited for him and at last he yielded and came to her she was determined to track this mood of his to its origin she counted it not much more than a mood  shall we go through the wood a little way she asked him knowing he never refused a direct request  they went down to the warren on the middle path they passed a trap a narrow horseshoe hedge of small firboughs baited with the guts of a rabbit paul glanced at it frowning she caught his eye  isnt it dreadful she asked  i dont know is it worse than a weasel with its teeth in a rabbits throat one weasel or many rabbits one or the other must go  he was taking the bitterness of life badly she was rather sorry for him  we will go back to the house he said i dont want to walk out  they went past the lilactree whose bronze leafbuds were coming unfastened just a fragment remained of the haystack a monument squared and brown like a pillar of stone there was a little bed of hay from the last cutting  let us sit here a minute said miriam  he sat down against his will resting his back against the hard wall of hay they faced the amphitheatre of round hills that glowed with sunset tiny white farms standing out the meadows golden the woods dark and yet luminous treetops folded over treetops distinct in the distance the evening had cleared and the east was tender with a magenta flush under which the land lay still and rich  isnt it beautiful she pleaded  but he only scowled he would rather have had it ugly just then  at that moment a big bullterrier came rushing up openmouthed pranced his two paws on the youths shoulders licking his face paul drew back laughing bill was a great relief to him he pushed the dog aside but it came leaping back  get out said the lad or ill dot thee one  but the dog was not to be pushed away so paul had a little battle with the creature pitching poor bill away from him who however only floundered tumultuously back again wild with joy the two fought together the man laughing grudgingly the dog grinning all over miriam watched them there was something pathetic about the man he wanted so badly to love to be tender the rough way he bowled the dog over was really loving bill got up panting with happiness his brown eyes rolling in his white face and lumbered back again he adored paul the lad frowned  bill ive had enough o thee he said  but the dog only stood with two heavy paws that quivered with love upon his thigh and flickered a red tongue at him he drew back  no he saidnoive had enough  and in a minute the dog trotted off happily to vary the fun  he remained staring miserably across at the hills whose still beauty he begrudged he wanted to go and cycle with edgar yet he had not the courage to leave miriam  why are you sad she asked humbly  im not sad why should i be he answered im only normal  she wondered why he always claimed to be normal when he was disagreeable  but what is the matter she pleaded coaxing him soothingly  nothing  nay she murmured  he picked up a stick and began to stab the earth with it  youd far better not talk he said  but i wish to know she replied  he laughed resentfully  you always do he said  its not fair to me she murmured  he thrust thrust thrust at the ground with the pointed stick digging up little clods of earth as if he were in a fever of irritation she gently and firmly laid her band on his wrist  dont she said put it away  he flung the stick into the currantbushes and leaned back now he was bottled up  what is it she pleaded softly  he lay perfectly still only his eyes alive and they full of torment  you know he said at length rather wearilyyou knowwed better break off  it was what she dreaded swiftly everything seemed to darken before her eyes  why she murmured what has happened  nothing has happened we only realise where we are its no good  she waited in silence sadly patiently it was no good being impatient with him at any rate he would tell her now what ailed him  we agreed on friendship he went on in a dull monotonous voice how often have we agreed for friendship and yetit neither stops there nor gets anywhere else  he was silent again she brooded what did he mean he was so wearying there was something he would not yield yet she must be patient with him  i can only give friendshipits all im capable ofits a flaw in my makeup the thing overbalances to one sidei hate a toppling balance let us have done  there was warmth of fury in his last phrases he meant she loved him more than he her perhaps he could not love her perhaps she had not in herself that which he wanted it was the deepest motive of her soul this selfmistrust it was so deep she dared neither realise nor acknowledge perhaps she was deficient like an infinitely subtle shame it kept her always back if it were so she would do without him she would never let herself want him she would merely see  but what has happened she said  nothingits all in myselfit only comes out just now were always like this towards eastertime  he grovelled so helplessly she pitied him at least she never floundered in such a pitiable way after all it was he who was chiefly humiliated  what do you want she asked him  whyi mustnt come oftenthats all why should i monopolise you when im notyou see im deficient in something with regard to you  he was telling her he did not love her and so ought to leave her a chance with another man how foolish and blind and shamefully clumsy he was what were other men to her what were men to her at all but he ah she loved his soul was he deficient in something perhaps he was  but i dont understand she said huskily yesterday  the night was turning jangled and hateful to him as the twilight faded and she bowed under her suffering  i know he cried you never will youll never believe that i cantcant physically any more than i can fly up like a skylark  what she murmured now she dreaded  love you  he hated her bitterly at that moment because he made her suffer love her she knew he loved her he really belonged to her this about not loving her physically bodily was a mere perversity on his part because he knew she loved him he was stupid like a child he belonged to her his soul wanted her she guessed somebody had been influencing him she felt upon him the hardness the foreignness of another influence  what have they been saying at home she asked  its not that he answered  and then she knew it was she despised them for their commonness his people they did not know what things were really worth  he and she talked very little more that night after all he left her to cycle with edgar  he had come back to his mother hers was the strongest tie in his life when he thought round miriam shrank away there was a vague unreal feel about her and nobody else mattered there was one place in the world that stood solid and did not melt into unreality the place where his mother was everybody else could grow shadowy almost nonexistent to him but she could not it was as if the pivot and pole of his life from which he could not escape was his mother  and in the same way she waited for him in him was established her life now after all the life beyond offered very little to mrs morel she saw that our chance for doing is here and doing counted with her paul was going to prove that she had been right he was going to make a man whom nothing should shift off his feet he was going to alter the face of the earth in some way which mattered wherever he went she felt her soul went with him whatever he did she felt her soul stood by him ready as it were to hand him his tools she could not bear it when he was with miriam william was dead she would fight to keep paul  and he came back to her and in his soul was a feeling of the satisfaction of selfsacrifice because he was faithful to her she loved him first he loved her first and yet it was not enough his new young life so strong and imperious was urged towards something else it made him mad with restlessness she saw this and wished bitterly that miriam had been a woman who could take this new life of his and leave her the roots he fought against his mother almost as he fought against miriam  it was a week before he went again to willey farm miriam had suffered a great deal and was afraid to see him again was she now to endure the ignominy of his abandoning her that would only be superficial and temporary he would come back she held the keys to his soul but meanwhile how he would torture her with his battle against her she shrank from it  however the sunday after easter he came to tea mrs leivers was glad to see him she gathered something was fretting him that he found things hard he seemed to drift to her for comfort and she was good to him she did him that great kindness of treating him almost with reverence  he met her with the young children in the front garden  im glad youve come said the mother looking at him with her great appealing brown eyes it is such a sunny day i was just going down the fields for the first time this year  he felt she would like him to come that soothed him they went talking simply he gentle and humble he could have wept with gratitude that she was deferential to him he was feeling humiliated  at the bottom of the mow close they found a thrushs nest  shall i show you the eggs he said  do replied mrs leivers they seem such a sign of spring and so hopeful  he put aside the thorns and took out the eggs holding them in the palm of his hand  they are quite hoti think we frightened her off them he said  ay poor thing said mrs leivers  miriam could not help touching the eggs and his hand which it seemed to her cradled them so well  isnt it a strange warmth she murmured to get near him  blood heat he answered  she watched him putting them back his body pressed against the hedge his arm reaching slowly through the thorns his hand folded carefully over the eggs he was concentrated on the act seeing him so she loved him he seemed so simple and sufficient to himself and she could not get to him  after tea she stood hesitating at the bookshelf he took tartarin de tarascon again they sat on the bank of hay at the foot of the stack he read a couple of pages but without any heart for it again the dog came racing up to repeat the fun of the other day he shoved his muzzle in the mans chest paul fingered his ear for a moment then he pushed him away  go away bill he said i dont want you  bill slunk off and miriam wondered and dreaded what was coming there was a silence about the youth that made her still with apprehension it was not his furies but his quiet resolutions that she feared  turning his face a little to one side so that she could not see him he began speaking slowly and painfully  do you thinkif i didnt come up so muchyou might get to like somebody elseanother man  so this was what he was still harping on  but i dont know any other men why do you ask she replied in a low tone that should have been a reproach to him  why he blurted because they say ive no right to come up like thiswithout we mean to marry  miriam was indignant at anybodys forcing the issues between them she had been furious with her own father for suggesting to paul laughingly that he knew why he came so much  who says she asked wondering if her people had anything to do with it they had not  motherand the others they say at this rate everybody will consider me engaged and i ought to consider myself so because its not fair to you and ive tried to find outand i dont think i love you as a man ought to love his wife what do you think about it  miriam bowed her head moodily she was angry at having this struggle people should leave him and her alone  i dont know she murmured  do you think we love each other enough to marry he asked definitely it made her tremble  no she answered truthfully i dont think sowere too young  i thought perhaps he went on miserably that you with your intensity in things might have given me morethan i could ever make up to you and even nowif you think it betterwell be engaged  now miriam wanted to cry and she was angry too he was always such a child for people to do as they liked with  no i dont think so she said firmly  he pondered a minute  you see he said with mei dont think one person would ever monopolize mebe everything to mei think never  this she did not consider  no she murmured then after a pause she looked at him and her dark eyes flashed  this is your mother she said i know she never liked me  no no it isnt he said hastily it was for your sake she spoke this time she only said if i was going on i ought to consider myself engaged there was a silence and if i ask you to come down any time you wont stop away will you  she did not answer by this time she was very angry  well what shall we do she said shortly i suppose id better drop french i was just beginning to get on with it but i suppose i can go on alone  i dont see that we need he said i can give you a french lesson surely  welland there are sunday nights i shant stop coming to chapel because i enjoy it and its all the social life i get but youve no need to come home with me i can go alone  all right he answered rather taken aback but if i ask edgar hell always come with us and then they can say nothing  there was silence after all then she would not lose much for all their talk down at his home there would not be much difference she wished they would mind their own business  and you wont think about it and let it trouble you will you he asked  oh no replied miriam without looking at him  he was silent she thought him unstable he had no fixity of purpose no anchor of righteousness that held him  because he continued a man gets across his bicycleand goes to workand does all sorts of things but a woman broods  no i shant bother said miriam and she meant it  it had gone rather chilly they went indoors  how white paul looks mrs leivers exclaimed miriam you shouldnt have let him sit out of doors do you think youve taken cold paul  oh no he laughed  but he felt done up it wore him out the conflict in himself miriam pitied him now but quite early before nine oclock he rose to go  youre not going home are you asked mrs leivers anxiously  yes he replied i said id be early he was very awkward  but this is early said mrs leivers  miriam sat in the rockingchair and did not speak he hesitated expecting her to rise and go with him to the barn as usual for his bicycle she remained as she was he was at a loss  wellgoodnight all he faltered  she spoke her goodnight along with all the others but as he went past the window he looked in she saw him pale his brows knit slightly in a way that had become constant with him his eyes dark with pain  she rose and went to the doorway to wave goodbye to him as he passed through the gate he rode slowly under the pinetrees feeling a cur and a miserable wretch his bicycle went tilting down the hills at random he thought it would be a relief to break ones neck  two days later he sent her up a book and a little note urging her to read and be busy  at this time he gave all his friendship to edgar he loved the family so much he loved the farm so much it was the dearest place on earth to him his home was not so lovable it was his mother but then he would have been just as happy with his mother anywhere whereas willey farm he loved passionately he loved the little pokey kitchen where mens boots tramped and the dog slept with one eye open for fear of being trodden on where the lamp hung over the table at night and everything was so silent he loved miriams long low parlour with its atmosphere of romance its flowers its books its high rosewood piano he loved the gardens and the buildings that stood with their scarlet roofs on the naked edges of the fields crept towards the wood as if for cosiness the wild country scooping down a valley and up the uncultured hills of the other side only to be there was an exhilaration and a joy to him he loved mrs leivers with her unworldliness and her quaint cynicism he loved mr leivers so warm and young and lovable he loved edgar who lit up when he came and the boys and the children and billeven the sow circe and the indian gamecock called tippoo all this besides miriam he could not give it up  so he went as often but he was usually with edgar only all the family including the father joined in charades and games at evening and later miriam drew them together and they read macbeth out of penny books taking parts it was great excitement miriam was glad and mrs leivers was glad and mr leivers enjoyed it then they all learned songs together from tonic solfa singing in a circle round the fire but now paul was very rarely alone with miriam she waited when she and edgar and he walked home together from chapel or from the literary society in bestwood she knew his talk so passionate and so unorthodox nowadays was for her she did envy edgar however his cycling with paul his friday nights his days working in the fields for her friday nights and her french lessons were gone she was nearly always alone walking pondering in the wood reading studying dreaming waiting and he wrote to her frequently  one sunday evening they attained to their old rare harmony edgar had stayed to communionhe wondered what it was likewith mrs morel so paul came on alone with miriam to his home he was more or less under her spell again as usual they were discussing the sermon he was setting now full sail towards agnosticism but such a religious agnosticism that miriam did not suffer so badly they were at the renan vie de jesus stage miriam was the threshingfloor on which he threshed out all his beliefs while he trampled his ideas upon her soul the truth came out for him she alone was his threshingfloor she alone helped him towards realization almost impassive she submitted to his argument and expounding and somehow because of her he gradually realized where he was wrong and what he realized she realized she felt he could not do without her  they came to the silent house he took the key out of the scullery window and they entered all the time he went on with his discussion he lit the gas mended the fire and brought her some cakes from the pantry she sat on the sofa quietly with a plate on her knee she wore a large white hat with some pinkish flowers it was a cheap hat but he liked it her face beneath was still and pensive goldenbrown and ruddy always her ears were hid in her short curls she watched him  she liked him on sundays then he wore a dark suit that showed the lithe movement of his body there was a clean clearcut look about him he went on with his thinking to her suddenly he reached for a bible miriam liked the way he reached upso sharp straight to the mark he turned the pages quickly and read her a chapter of st john as he sat in the armchair reading intent his voice only thinking she felt as if he were using her unconsciously as a man uses his tools at some work he is bent on she loved it and the wistfulness of his voice was like a reaching to something and it was as if she were what he reached with she sat back on the sofa away from him and yet feeling herself the very instrument his hand grasped it gave her great pleasure  then he began to falter and to get selfconscious and when he came to the verse a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow because her hour is come he missed it out miriam had felt him growing uncomfortable she shrank when the wellknown words did not follow he went on reading but she did not hear a grief and shame made her bend her head six months ago he would have read it simply now there was a scotch in his running with her now she felt there was really something hostile between them something of which they were ashamed  she ate her cake mechanically he tried to go on with his argument but could not get back the right note soon edgar came in mrs morel had gone to her friends the three set off to willey farm  miriam brooded over his split with her there was something else he wanted he could not be satisfied he could give her no peace there was between them now always a ground for strife she wanted to prove him she believed that his chief need in life was herself if she could prove it both to herself and to him the rest might go she could simply trust to the future  so in may she asked him to come to willey farm and meet mrs dawes there was something he hankered after she saw him whenever they spoke of clara dawes rouse and get slightly angry he said he did not like her yet he was keen to know about her well he should put himself to the test she believed that there were in him desires for higher things and desires for lower and that the desire for the higher would conquer at any rate he should try she forgot that her higher and lower were arbitrary  he was rather excited at the idea of meeting clara at willey farm mrs dawes came for the day her heavy duncoloured hair was coiled on top of her head she wore a white blouse and navy skirt and somehow wherever she was seemed to make things look paltry and insignificant when she was in the room the kitchen seemed too small and mean altogether miriams beautiful twilighty parlour looked stiff and stupid all the leivers were eclipsed like candles they found her rather hard to put up with yet she was perfectly amiable but indifferent and rather hard  paul did not come till afternoon he was early as he swung off his bicycle miriam saw him look round at the house eagerly he would be disappointed if the visitor had not come miriam went out to meet him bowing her head because of the sunshine nasturtiums were coming out crimson under the cool green shadow of their leaves the girl stood darkhaired glad to see him  hasnt clara come he asked  yes replied miriam in her musical tone shes reading  he wheeled his bicycle into the barn he had put on a handsome tie of which he was rather proud and socks to match  she came this morning he asked  yes replied miriam as she walked at his side you said youd bring me that letter from the man at libertys have you remembered  oh dash no he said but nag at me till you get it  i dont like to nag at you  do it whether or not and is she any more agreeable he continued  you know i always think she is quite agreeable  he was silent evidently his eagerness to be early today had been the newcomer miriam already began to suffer they went together towards the house he took the clips off his trousers but was too lazy to brush the dust from his shoes in spite of the socks and tie  clara sat in the cool parlour reading he saw the nape of her white neck and the fine hair lifted from it she rose looking at him indifferently to shake hands she lifted her arm straight in a manner that seemed at once to keep him at a distance and yet to fling something to him he noticed how her breasts swelled inside her blouse and how her shoulder curved handsomely under the thin muslin at the top of her arm  you have chosen a fine day he said  it happens so she said  yes he said i am glad  she sat down not thanking him for his politeness  what have you been doing all morning asked paul of miriam  well you see said miriam coughing huskily clara only came with fatherand soshes not been here very long  clara sat leaning on the table holding aloof he noticed her hands were large but well kept and the skin on them seemed almost coarse opaque and white with fine golden hairs she did not mind if he observed her hands she intended to scorn him her heavy arm lay negligently on the table her mouth was closed as if she were offended and she kept her face slightly averted  you were at margaret bonfords meeting the other evening he said to her  miriam did not know this courteous paul clara glanced at him  yes she said  why asked miriam how do you know  i went in for a few minutes before the train came he answered  clara turned away again rather disdainfully  i think shes a lovable little woman said paul  margaret bonford exclaimed clara shes a great deal cleverer than most men  well i didnt say she wasnt he said deprecating shes lovable for all that  and of course that is all that matters said clara witheringly  he rubbed his head rather perplexed rather annoyed  i suppose it matters more than her cleverness he said which after all would never get her to heaven  its not heaven she wants to getits her fair share on earth retorted clara she spoke as if he were responsible for some deprivation which miss bonford suffered  well he said i thought she was warm and awfully niceonly too frail i wished she was sitting comfortably in peace  darning her husbands stockings said clara scathingly  im sure she wouldnt mind darning even my stockings he said and im sure shed do them well just as i wouldnt mind blacking her boots if she wanted me to  but clara refused to answer this sally of his he talked to miriam for a little while the other woman held aloof  well he said i think ill go and see edgar is he on the land  i believe said miriam hes gone for a load of coal he should be back directly  then he said ill go and meet him  miriam dared not propose anything for the three of them he rose and left them  on the top road where the gorse was out he saw edgar walking lazily beside the mare who nodded her whitestarred forehead as she dragged the clanking load of coal the young farmers face lighted up as he saw his friend edgar was goodlooking with dark warm eyes his clothes were old and rather disreputable and he walked with considerable pride  hello he said seeing paul bareheaded where are you going  came to meet you cant stand nevermore  edgars teeth flashed in a laugh of amusement  who is nevermore he asked  the ladymrs dawesit ought to be mrs the raven that quothed nevermore  edgar laughed with glee  dont you like her he asked  not a fat lot said paul why do you  no the answer came with a deep ring of conviction no edgar pursed up his lips i cant say shes much in my line he mused a little then but why do you call her nevermore he asked  well said paul if she looks at a man she says haughtily nevermore and if she looks at herself in the lookingglass she says disdainfully nevermore and if she thinks back she says it in disgust and if she looks forward she says it cynically  edgar considered this speech failed to make much out of it and said laughing  you think shes a manhater  she thinks she is replied paul  but you dont think so  no replied paul  wasnt she nice with you then  could you imagine her nice with anybody asked the young man  edgar laughed together they unloaded the coal in the yard paul was rather selfconscious because he knew clara could see if she looked out of the window she didnt look  on saturday afternoons the horses were brushed down and groomed paul and edgar worked together sneezing with the dust that came from the pelts of jimmy and flower  do you know a new song to teach me said edgar  he continued to work all the time the back of his neck was sunred when he bent down and his fingers that held the brush were thick paul watched him sometimes  mary morrison suggested the younger  edgar agreed he had a good tenor voice and he loved to learn all the songs his friend could teach him so that he could sing whilst he was carting paul had a very indifferent baritone voice but a good ear however he sang softly for fear of clara edgar repeated the line in a clear tenor at times they both broke off to sneeze and first one then the other abused his horse  miriam was impatient of men it took so little to amuse themeven paul she thought it anomalous in him that he could be so thoroughly absorbed in a triviality  it was teatime when they had finished  what song was that asked miriam  edgar told her the conversation turned to singing  we have such jolly times miriam said to clara  mrs dawes ate her meal in a slow dignified way whenever the men were present she grew distant  do you like singing miriam asked her  if it is good she said  paul of course coloured  you mean if it is highclass and trained he said  i think a voice needs training before the singing is anything she said  you might as well insist on having peoples voices trained before you allowed them to talk he replied really people sing for their own pleasure as a rule  and it may be for other peoples discomfort  then the other people should have flaps to their ears he replied  the boys laughed there was a silence he flushed deeply and ate in silence  after tea when all the men had gone but paul mrs leivers said to clara  and you find life happier now  infinitely  and you are satisfied  so long as i can be free and independent  and you dont miss anything in your life asked mrs leivers gently  ive put all that behind me  paul had been feeling uncomfortable during this discourse he got up  youll find youre always tumbling over the things youve put behind you he said then he took his departure to the cowsheds he felt he had been witty and his manly pride was high he whistled as he went down the brick track  miriam came for him a little later to know if he would go with clara and her for a walk they set off down to strelley mill farm as they were going beside the brook on the willey water side looking through the brake at the edge of the wood where pink campions glowed under a few sunbeams they saw beyond the treetrunks and the thin hazel bushes a man leading a great bay horse through the gullies the big red beast seemed to dance romantically through that dimness of green hazel drift away there where the air was shadowy as if it were in the past among the fading bluebells that might have bloomed for deidre or iseult  the three stood charmed  what a treat to be a knight he said and to have a pavilion here  and to have us shut up safely replied clara  yes he answered singing with your maids at your broidery i would carry your banner of white and green and heliotrope i would have wspu emblazoned on my shield beneath a woman rampant  i have no doubt said clara that you would much rather fight for a woman than let her fight for herself  i would when she fights for herself she seems like a dog before a lookingglass gone into a mad fury with its own shadow  and you are the lookingglass she asked with a curl of the lip  or the shadow he replied  i am afraid she said that you are too clever  well i leave it to you to be good he retorted laughing be good sweet maid and just let me be clever  but clara wearied of his flippancy suddenly looking at her he saw that the upward lifting of her face was misery and not scorn his heart grew tender for everybody he turned and was gentle with miriam whom he had neglected till then  at the woods edge they met limb a thin swarthy man of forty tenant of strelley mill which he ran as a cattleraising farm he held the halter of the powerful stallion indifferently as if he were tired the three stood to let him pass over the steppingstones of the first brook paul admired that so large an animal should walk on such springy toes with an endless excess of vigour limb pulled up before them  tell your father miss leivers he said in a peculiar piping voice that his young beases as broke that bottom fence three days an runnin  which asked miriam tremulous  the great horse breathed heavily shifting round its red flanks and looking suspiciously with its wonderful big eyes upwards from under its lowered head and falling mane  come along a bit replied limb an ill show you  the man and the stallion went forward it danced sideways shaking its white fetlocks and looking frightened as it felt itself in the brook  no hankypankyin said the man affectionately to the beast  it went up the bank in little leaps then splashed finely through the second brook clara walking with a kind of sulky abandon watched it halffascinated halfcontemptuous limb stopped and pointed to the fence under some willows  there you see where they got through he said my mans druv em back three times  yes answered miriam colouring as if she were at fault  are you comin in asked the man  no thanks but we should like to go by the pond  well just as youve a mind he said  the horse gave little whinneys of pleasure at being so near home  he is glad to be back said clara who was interested in the creature  yeses been a tidy step today  they went through the gate and saw approaching them from the big farmhouse a smallish dark excitablelooking woman of about thirtyfive her hair was touched with grey her dark eyes looked wild she walked with her hands behind her back her brother went forward as it saw her the big bay stallion whinneyed again she came up excitedly  are you home again my boy she said tenderly to the horse not to the man the great beast shifted round to her ducking his head she smuggled into his mouth the wrinkled yellow apple she had been hiding behind her back then she kissed him near the eyes he gave a big sigh of pleasure she held his head in her arms against her breast  isnt he splendid said miriam to her  miss limb looked up her dark eyes glanced straight at paul  oh goodevening miss leivers she said its ages since youve been down  miriam introduced her friends  your horse is a fine fellow said clara  isnt he again she kissed him as loving as any man  more loving than most men i should think replied clara  hes a nice boy cried the woman again embracing the horse  clara fascinated by the big beast went up to stroke his neck  hes quite gentle said miss limb dont you think big fellows are  hes a beauty replied clara  she wanted to look in his eyes she wanted him to look at her  its a pity he cant talk she said  oh but he canall but replied the other woman  then her brother moved on with the horse  are you coming in do come in mri didnt catch it  morel said miriam no we wont come in but we should like to go by the millpond  yesyes do do you fish mr morel  no said paul  because if you do you might come and fish any time said miss limb we scarcely see a soul from weeks end to weeks end i should be thankful  what fish are there in the pond he asked  they went through the front garden over the sluice and up the steep bank to the pond which lay in shadow with its two wooded islets paul walked with miss limb  i shouldnt mind swimming here he said  do she replied come when you like my brother will be awfully pleased to talk with you he is so quiet because there is no one to talk to do come and swim  clara came up  its a fine depth she said and so clear  yes said miss limb  do you swim said paul miss limb was just saying we could come when we liked  of course theres the farmhands said miss limb  they talked a few moments then went on up the wild hill leaving the lonely haggardeyed woman on the bank  the hillside was all ripe with sunshine it was wild and tussocky given over to rabbits the three walked in silence then  she makes me feel uncomfortable said paul  you mean miss limb asked miriam yes  whats a matter with her is she going dotty with being too lonely  yes said miriam its not the right sort of life for her i think its cruel to bury her there i really ought to go and see her more butshe upsets me  she makes me feel sorry for heryes and she bothers me he said  i suppose blurted clara suddenly she wants a man  the other two were silent for a few moments  but its the loneliness sends her cracked said paul  clara did not answer but strode on uphill she was walking with her hand hanging her legs swinging as she kicked through the dead thistles and the tussocky grass her arms hanging loose rather than walking her handsome body seemed to be blundering up the hill a hot wave went over paul he was curious about her perhaps life had been cruel to her he forgot miriam who was walking beside him talking to him she glanced at him finding he did not answer her his eyes were fixed ahead on clara  do you still think she is disagreeable she asked  he did not notice that the question was sudden it ran with his thoughts  somethings the matter with her he said  yes answered miriam  they found at the top of the hill a hidden wild field two sides of which were backed by the wood the other sides by high loose hedges of hawthorn and elder bushes between these overgrown bushes were gaps that the cattle might have walked through had there been any cattle now there the turf was smooth as velveteen padded and holed by the rabbits the field itself was coarse and crowded with tall big cowslips that had never been cut clusters of strong flowers rose everywhere above the coarse tussocks of bent it was like a roadstead crowded with tan fairy shipping  ah cried miriam and she looked at paul her dark eyes dilating he smiled together they enjoyed the field of flowers clara a little way off was looking at the cowslips disconsolately paul and miriam stayed close together talking in subdued tones he kneeled on one knee quickly gathering the best blossoms moving from tuft to tuft restlessly talking softly all the time miriam plucked the flowers lovingly lingering over them he always seemed to her too quick and almost scientific yet his bunches had a natural beauty more than hers he loved them but as if they were his and he had a right to them she had more reverence for them they held something she had not  the flowers were very fresh and sweet he wanted to drink them as he gathered them he ate the little yellow trumpets clara was still wandering about disconsolately going towards her he said  why dont you get some  i dont believe in it they look better growing  but youd like some  they want to be left  i dont believe they do  i dont want the corpses of flowers about me she said  thats a stiff artificial notion he said they dont die any quicker in water than on their roots and besides they look nice in a bowlthey look jolly and you only call a thing a corpse because it looks corpselike  whether it is one or not she argued  it isnt one to me a dead flower isnt a corpse of a flower  clara now ignored him  and even sowhat right have you to pull them she asked  because i like them and want themand theres plenty of them  and that is sufficient  yes why not im sure theyd smell nice in your room in nottingham  and i should have the pleasure of watching them die  but thenit does not matter if they do die  whereupon he left her and went stooping over the clumps of tangled flowers which thickly sprinkled the field like pale luminous foamclots miriam had come close clara was kneeling breathing some scent from the cowslips  i think said miriam if you treat them with reverence you dont do them any harm it is the spirit you pluck them in that matters  yes he said but no you get em because you want em and thats all he held out his bunch  miriam was silent he picked some more  look at these he continued sturdy and lusty like little trees and like boys with fat legs  claras hat lay on the grass not far off she was kneeling bending forward still to smell the flowers her neck gave him a sharp pang such a beautiful thing yet not proud of itself just now her breasts swung slightly in her blouse the arching curve of her back was beautiful and strong she wore no stays suddenly without knowing he was scattering a handful of cowslips over her hair and neck saying       ashes to ashes and dust to dust      if the lord wont have you the devil must  the chill flowers fell on her neck she looked up at him with almost pitiful scared grey eyes wondering what he was doing flowers fell on her face and she shut her eyes  suddenly standing there above her he felt awkward  i thought you wanted a funeral he said ill at ease  clara laughed strangely and rose picking the cowslips from her hair she took up her hat and pinned it on one flower had remained tangled in her hair he saw but would not tell her he gathered up the flowers he had sprinkled over her  at the edge of the wood the bluebells had flowed over into the field and stood there like floodwater but they were fading now clara strayed up to them he wandered after her the bluebells pleased him  look how theyve come out of the wood he said  then she turned with a flash of warmth and of gratitude  yes she smiled  his blood beat up  it makes me think of the wild men of the woods how terrified they would be when they got breast to breast with the open space  do you think they were she asked  i wonder which was more frightened among old tribesthose bursting out of their darkness of woods upon all the space of light or those from the open tiptoeing into the forests  i should think the second she answered  yes you do feel like one of the open space sort trying to force yourself into the dark dont you  how should i know she answered queerly  the conversation ended there  the evening was deepening over the earth already the valley was full of shadow one tiny square of light stood opposite at crossleigh bank farm brightness was swimming on the tops of the hills miriam came up slowly her face in her big loose bunch of flowers walking ankledeep through the scattered froth of the cowslips beyond her the trees were coming into shape all shadow  shall we go she asked  and the three turned away they were all silent going down the path they could see the light of home right across and on the ridge of the hill a thin dark outline with little lights where the colliery village touched the sky  it has been nice hasnt it he asked  miriam murmured assent clara was silent  dont you think so he persisted  but she walked with her head up and still did not answer he could tell by the way she moved as if she didnt care that she suffered  at this time paul took his mother to lincoln she was bright and enthusiastic as ever but as he sat opposite her in the railway carriage she seemed to look frail he had a momentary sensation as if she were slipping away from him then he wanted to get hold of her to fasten her almost to chain her he felt he must keep hold of her with his hand  they drew near to the city both were at the window looking for the cathedral  there she is mother he cried  they saw the great cathedral lying couchant above the plain  ah she exclaimed so she is  he looked at his mother her blue eyes were watching the cathedral quietly she seemed again to be beyond him something in the eternal repose of the uplifted cathedral blue and noble against the sky was reflected in her something of the fatality what was was with all his young will he could not alter it he saw her face the skin still fresh and pink and downy but crowsfeet near her eyes her eyelids steady sinking a little her mouth always closed with disillusion and there was on her the same eternal look as if she knew fate at last he beat against it with all the strength of his soul  look mother how big she is above the town think there are streets and streets below her she looks bigger than the city altogether  so she does exclaimed his mother breaking bright into life again but he had seen her sitting looking steady out of the window at the cathedral her face and eyes fixed reflecting the relentlessness of life and the crowsfeet near her eyes and her mouth shut so hard made him feel he would go mad  they ate a meal that she considered wildly extravagant  dont imagine i like it she said as she ate her cutlet i dont like it i really dont just think of your money wasted  you never mind my money he said you forget im a fellow taking his girl for an outing  and he bought her some blue violets  stop it at once sir she commanded how can i do it  youve got nothing to do stand still  and in the middle of high street he stuck the flowers in her coat  an old thing like me she said sniffing  you see he said i want people to think were awful swells so look ikey  ill jowl your head she laughed  strut he commanded be a fantail pigeon  it took him an hour to get her through the street she stood above glory hole she stood before stone bow she stood everywhere and exclaimed  a man came up took off his hat and bowed to her  can i show you the town madam  no thank you she answered ive got my son  then paul was cross with her for not answering with more dignity  you go away with you she exclaimed ha thats the jews house now do you remember that lecture paul  but she could scarcely climb the cathedral hill he did not notice then suddenly he found her unable to speak he took her into a little publichouse where she rested  its nothing she said my heart is only a bit old one must expect it  he did not answer but looked at her again his heart was crushed in a hot grip he wanted to cry he wanted to smash things in fury  they set off again pace by pace so slowly and every step seemed like a weight on his chest he felt as if his heart would burst at last they came to the top she stood enchanted looking at the castle gate looking at the cathedral front she had quite forgotten herself  now this is better than i thought it could be she cried  but he hated it everywhere he followed her brooding they sat together in the cathedral they attended a little service in the choir she was timid  i suppose it is open to anybody she asked him  yes he replied do you think theyd have the damned cheek to send us away  well im sure she exclaimed they would if they heard your language  her face seemed to shine again with joy and peace during the service and all the time he was wanting to rage and smash things and cry  afterwards when they were leaning over the wall looking at the town below he blurted suddenly  why cant a man have a young mother what is she old for  well his mother laughed she can scarcely help it  and why wasnt i the oldest son lookthey say the young ones have the advantagebut look they had the young mother you should have had me for your eldest son  i didnt arrange it she remonstrated come to consider youre as much to blame as me  he turned on her white his eyes furious  what are you old for he said mad with his impotence why cant you walk why cant you come with me to places  at one time she replied i could have run up that hill a good deal better than you  whats the good of that to me he cried hitting his fist on the wall then he became plaintive its too bad of you to be ill little it is  ill she cried im a bit old and youll have to put up with it thats all  they were quiet but it was as much as they could bear they got jolly again over tea as they sat by brayford watching the boats he told her about clara his mother asked him innumerable questions  then who does she live with  with her mother on bluebell hill  and have they enough to keep them  i dont think so i think they do lace work  and wherein lies her charm my boy  i dont know that shes charming mother but shes nice and she seems straight you knownot a bit deep not a bit  but shes a good deal older than you  shes thirty im going on twentythree  you havent told me what you like her for  because i dont knowa sort of defiant way shes gota sort of angry way  mrs morel considered she would have been glad now for her son to fall in love with some woman who wouldshe did not know what but he fretted so got so furious suddenly and again was melancholic she wished he knew some nice womanshe did not know what she wished but left it vague at any rate she was not hostile to the idea of clara  annie too was getting married leonard had gone away to work in birmingham one weekend when he was home she had said to him  you dont look very well my lad  i dunno he said i feel anyhow or nohow ma  he called her ma already in his boyish fashion  are you sure theyre good lodgings she asked  yesyes onlyits a winder when you have to pour your own tea outan nobody to grouse if you team it in your saucer and sup it up it somehow takes a the taste out of it  mrs morel laughed  and so it knocks you up she said  i dunno i want to get married he blurted twisting his fingers and looking down at his boots there was a silence  but she exclaimed i thought you said youd wait another year  yes i did say so he replied stubbornly  again she considered  and you know she said annies a bit of a spendthrift shes saved no more than eleven pounds and i know lad you havent had much chance  he coloured up to the ears  ive got thirtythree quid he said  it doesnt go far she answered  he said nothing but twisted his fingers  and you know she said ive nothing  i didnt want ma he cried very red suffering and remonstrating  no my lad i know i was only wishing i had and take away five pounds for the wedding and thingsit leaves twentynine pounds you wont do much on that  he twisted still impotent stubborn not looking up  but do you really want to get married she asked do you feel as if you ought  he gave her one straight look from his blue eyes  yes he said  then she replied we must all do the best we can for it lad  the next time he looked up there were tears in his eyes  i dont want annie to feel handicapped he said struggling  my lad she said youre steadyyouve got a decent place if a man had needed me id have married him on his last weeks wages she may find it a bit hard to start humbly young girls are like that they look forward to the fine home they think theyll have but i had expensive furniture its not everything  so the wedding took place almost immediately arthur came home and was splendid in uniform annie looked nice in a dovegrey dress that she could take for sundays morel called her a fool for getting married and was cool with his soninlaw mrs morel had white tips in her bonnet and some white on her blouse and was teased by both her sons for fancying herself so grand leonard was jolly and cordial and felt a fearful fool paul could not quite see what annie wanted to get married for he was fond of her and she of him still he hoped rather lugubriously that it would turn out all right arthur was astonishingly handsome in his scarlet and yellow and he knew it well but was secretly ashamed of the uniform annie cried her eyes up in the kitchen on leaving her mother mrs morel cried a little then patted her on the back and said  but dont cry child hell be good to you  morel stamped and said she was a fool to go and tie herself up leonard looked white and overwrought mrs morel said to him  i sll trust her to you my lad and hold you responsible for her  you can he said nearly dead with the ordeal and it was all over  when morel and arthur were in bed paul sat talking as he often did with his mother  youre not sorry shes married mother are you he asked  im not sorry shes marriedbutit seems strange that she should go from me it even seems to me hard that she can prefer to go with her leonard thats how mothers arei know its silly  and shall you be miserable about her  when i think of my own wedding day his mother answered i can only hope her life will be different  but you can trust him to be good to her  yes yes they say hes not good enough for her but i say if a man is genuine as he is and a girl is fond of himthenit should be all right hes as good as she  so you dont mind  i would never have let a daughter of mine marry a man i didnt feel to be genuine through and through and yet theres a gap now shes gone  they were both miserable and wanted her back again it seemed to paul his mother looked lonely in her new black silk blouse with its bit of white trimming  at any rate mother i sll never marry he said  ay they all say that my lad youve not met the one yet only wait a year or two  but i shant marry mother i shall live with you and well have a servant  ay my lad its easy to talk well see when the time comes  what time im nearly twentythree  yes youre not one that would marry young but in three years time  i shall be with you just the same  well see my boy well see  but you dont want me to marry  i shouldnt like to think of you going through your life without anybody to care for you and dono  and you think i ought to marry  sooner or later every man ought  but youd rather it were later  it would be hardand very hard its as they say       a sons my son till he takes him a wife      but my daughters my daughter the whole of her life  and you think id let a wife take me from you  well you wouldnt ask her to marry your mother as well as you mrs morel smiled  she could do what she liked she wouldnt have to interfere  she wouldnttill shed got youand then youd see  i never will see ill never marry while ive got youi wont  but i shouldnt like to leave you with nobody my boy she cried  youre not going to leave me what are you fiftythree ill give you till seventyfive there you are im fat and fortyfour then ill marry a staid body see  his mother sat and laughed  go to bed she saidgo to bed  and well have a pretty house you and me and a servant and itll be just all right i sll perhaps be rich with my painting  will you go to bed  and then you sll have a ponycarriage see yourselfa little queen victoria trotting round  i tell you to go to bed she laughed  he kissed her and went his plans for the future were always the same  mrs morel sat broodingabout her daughter about paul about arthur she fretted at losing annie the family was very closely bound and she felt she must live now to be with her children life was so rich for her paul wanted her and so did arthur arthur never knew how deeply he loved her he was a creature of the moment never yet had he been forced to realise himself the army had disciplined his body but not his soul he was in perfect health and very handsome his dark vigorous hair sat close to his smallish head there was something childish about his nose something almost girlish about his dark blue eyes but he had the fun red mouth of a man under his brown moustache and his jaw was strong it was his fathers mouth it was the nose and eyes of her own mothers peoplegoodlooking weakprincipled folk mrs morel was anxious about him once he had really run the rig he was safe but how far would he go  the army had not really done him any good he resented bitterly the authority of the officers he hated having to obey as if he were an animal but he had too much sense to kick so he turned his attention to getting the best out of it he could sing he was a booncompanion often he got into scrapes but they were the manly scrapes that are easily condoned so he made a good time out of it whilst his selfrespect was in suppression he trusted to his good looks and handsome figure his refinement his decent education to get him most of what he wanted and he was not disappointed yet he was restless something seemed to gnaw him inside he was never still he was never alone with his mother he was rather humble paul he admired and loved and despised slightly and paul admired and loved and despised him slightly  mrs morel had had a few pounds left to her by her father and she decided to buy her son out of the army he was wild with joy now he was like a lad taking a holiday  he had always been fond of beatrice wyld and during his furlough he picked up with her again she was stronger and better in health the two often went long walks together arthur taking her arm in soldiers fashion rather stiffly and she came to play the piano whilst he sang then arthur would unhook his tunic collar he grew flushed his eyes were bright he sang in a manly tenor afterwards they sat together on the sofa he seemed to flaunt his body she was aware of him sothe strong chest the sides the thighs in their closefitting trousers  he liked to lapse into the dialect when he talked to her she would sometimes smoke with him occasionally she would only take a few whiffs at his cigarette  nay he said to her one evening when she reached for his cigarette nay tha doesna ill gie thee a smoke kiss if ters a mind  i wanted a whiff no kiss at all she answered  well an tha slt hae a whiff he said along wi t kiss  i want a draw at thy fag she cried snatching for the cigarette between his lips  he was sitting with his shoulder touching her she was small and quick as lightning he just escaped  ill gie thee a smoke kiss he said  thart a knivey nuisance arty morel she said sitting back  hae a smoke kiss  the soldier leaned forward to her smiling his face was near hers  shonna she replied turning away her head  he took a draw at his cigarette and pursed up his mouth and put his lips close to her his darkbrown cropped moustache stood out like a brush she looked at the puckered crimson lips then suddenly snatched the cigarette from his fingers and darted away he leaping after her seized the comb from her back hair she turned threw the cigarette at him he picked it up put it in his mouth and sat down  nuisance she cried give me my comb  she was afraid that her hair specially done for him would come down she stood with her hands to her head he hid the comb between his knees  ive non got it he said  the cigarette trembled between his lips with laughter as he spoke  liar she said  s true as im here he laughed showing his hands  you brazen imp she exclaimed rushing and scuffling for the comb which he had under his knees as she wrestled with him pulling at his smooth tightcovered knees he laughed till he lay back on the sofa shaking with laughter the cigarette fell from his mouth almost singeing his throat under his delicate tan the blood flushed up and he laughed till his blue eyes were blinded his throat swollen almost to choking then he sat up beatrice was putting in her comb  tha tickled me beat he said thickly  like a flash her small white hand went out and smacked his face he started up glaring at her they stared at each other slowly the flush mounted her cheek she dropped her eyes then her head he sat down sulkily she went into the scullery to adjust her hair in private there she shed a few tears she did not know what for  when she returned she was pursed up close but it was only a film over her fire he with ruffled hair was sulking upon the sofa she sat down opposite in the armchair and neither spoke the clock ticked in the silence like blows  you are a little cat beat he said at length half apologetically  well you shouldnt be brazen she replied  there was again a long silence he whistled to himself like a man much agitated but defiant suddenly she went across to him and kissed him  did it pore fing she mocked  he lifted his face smiling curiously  kiss he invited her  darent i she asked  go on he challenged his mouth lifted to her  deliberately and with a peculiar quivering smile that seemed to overspread her whole body she put her mouth on his immediately his arms folded round her as soon as the long kiss was finished she drew back her head from him put her delicate fingers on his neck through the open collar then she closed her eyes giving herself up again in a kiss  she acted of her own free will what she would do she did and made nobody responsible   paul felt life changing around him the conditions of youth were gone now it was a home of grownup people annie was a married woman arthur was following his own pleasure in a way unknown to his folk for so long they had all lived at home and gone out to pass their time but now for annie and arthur life lay outside their mothers house they came home for holiday and for rest so there was that strange halfempty feeling about the house as if the birds had flown paul became more and more unsettled annie and arthur had gone he was restless to follow yet home was for him beside his mother and still there was something else something outside something he wanted  he grew more and more restless miriam did not satisfy him his old mad desire to be with her grew weaker sometimes he met clara in nottingham sometimes he went to meetings with her sometimes he saw her at willey farm but on these last occasions the situation became strained there was a triangle of antagonism between paul and clara and miriam with clara he took on a smart worldly mocking tone very antagonistic to miriam it did not matter what went before she might be intimate and sad with him then as soon as clara appeared it all vanished and he played to the newcomer  miriam had one beautiful evening with him in the hay he had been on the horserake and having finished came to help her to put the hay in cocks then he talked to her of his hopes and despairs and his whole soul seemed to lie bare before her she felt as if she watched the very quivering stuff of life in him the moon came out they walked home together he seemed to have come to her because he needed her so badly and she listened to him gave him all her love and her faith it seemed to her he brought her the best of himself to keep and that she would guard it all her life nay the sky did not cherish the stars more surely and eternally than she would guard the good in the soul of paul morel she went on home alone feeling exalted glad in her faith  and then the next day clara came they were to have tea in the hayfield miriam watched the evening drawing to gold and shadow and all the time paul was sporting with clara he made higher and higher heaps of hay that they were jumping over miriam did not care for the game and stood aside edgar and geoffrey and maurice and clara and paul jumped paul won because he was light claras blood was roused she could run like an amazon paul loved the determined way she rushed at the haycock and leaped landed on the other side her breasts shaken her thick hair come undone  you touched he cried you touched  no she flashed turning to edgar i didnt touch did i wasnt i clear  i couldnt say laughed edgar  none of them could say  but you touched said paul youre beaten  i did not touch she cried  as plain as anything said paul  box his ears for me she cried to edgar  nay edgar laughed i darent you must do it yourself  and nothing can alter the fact that you touched laughed paul  she was furious with him her little triumph before these lads and men was gone she had forgotten herself in the game now he was to humble her  i think you are despicable she said  and again he laughed in a way that tortured miriam  and i knew you couldnt jump that heap he teased  she turned her back on him yet everybody could see that the only person she listened to or was conscious of was he and he of her it pleased the men to see this battle between them but miriam was tortured  paul could choose the lesser in place of the higher she saw he could be unfaithful to himself unfaithful to the real deep paul morel there was a danger of his becoming frivolous of his running after his satisfaction like any arthur or like his father it made miriam bitter to think that he should throw away his soul for this flippant traffic of triviality with clara she walked in bitterness and silence while the other two rallied each other and paul sported  and afterwards he would not own it but he was rather ashamed of himself and prostrated himself before miriam then again he rebelled  its not religious to be religious he said i reckon a crow is religious when it sails across the sky but it only does it because it feels itself carried to where its going not because it thinks it is being eternal  but miriam knew that one should be religious in everything have god whatever god might be present in everything  i dont believe god knows such a lot about himself he cried god doesnt know things he is things and im sure hes not soulful  and then it seemed to her that paul was arguing god on to his own side because he wanted his own way and his own pleasure there was a long battle between him and her he was utterly unfaithful to her even in her own presence then he was ashamed then repentant then he hated her and went off again those were the everrecurring conditions  she fretted him to the bottom of his soul there she remainedsad pensive a worshipper and he caused her sorrow half the time he grieved for her half the time he hated her she was his conscience and he felt somehow he had got a conscience that was too much for him he could not leave her because in one way she did hold the best of him he could not stay with her because she did not take the rest of him which was threequarters so he chafed himself into rawness over her  when she was twentyone he wrote her a letter which could only have been written to her   may i speak of our old worn love this last time it too is changing is it not say has not the body of that love died and left you its invulnerable soul you see i can give you a spirit love i have given it you this long long time but not embodied passion see you are a nun i have given you what i would give a holy nunas a mystic monk to a mystic nun surely you esteem it best yet you regretno have regrettedthe other in all our relations no body enters i do not talk to you through the sensesrather through the spirit that is why we cannot love in the common sense ours is not an everyday affection as yet we are mortal and to live side by side with one another would be dreadful for somehow with you i cannot long be trivial and you know to be always beyond this mortal state would be to lose it if people marry they must live together as affectionate humans who may be commonplace with each other without feeling awkwardnot as two souls so i feel it  ought i to send this letteri doubt it but thereit is best to understand au revoir   miriam read this letter twice after which she sealed it up a year later she broke the seal to show her mother the letter  you are a nunyou are a nun the words went into her heart again and again nothing he ever had said had gone into her so deeply fixedly like a mortal wound  she answered him two days after the party  our intimacy would have been allbeautiful but for one little mistake she quoted was the mistake mine  almost immediately he replied to her from nottingham sending her at the same time a little omar khayyam   i am glad you answered you are so calm and natural you put me to shame what a ranter i am we are often out of sympathy but in fundamentals we may always be together i think  i must thank you for your sympathy with my painting and drawing many a sketch is dedicated to you i do look forward to your criticisms which to my shame and glory are always grand appreciations it is a lovely joke that au revoir   this was the end of the first phase of pauls love affair he was now about twentythree years old and though still virgin the sex instinct that miriam had overrefined for so long now grew particularly strong often as he talked to clara dawes came that thickening and quickening of his blood that peculiar concentration in the breast as if something were alive there a new self or a new centre of consciousness warning him that sooner or later he would have to ask one woman or another but he belonged to miriam of that she was so fixedly sure that he allowed her right    chapter x  clara  when he was twentythree years old paul sent in a landscape to the winter exhibition at nottingham castle miss jordan had taken a good deal of interest in him and invited him to her house where he met other artists he was beginning to grow ambitious  one morning the postman came just as he was washing in the scullery suddenly he heard a wild noise from his mother rushing into the kitchen he found her standing on the hearthrug wildly waving a letter and crying hurrah as if she had gone mad he was shocked and frightened  why mother he exclaimed  she flew to him flung her arms round him for a moment then waved the letter crying  hurrah my boy i knew we should do it  he was afraid of herthe small severe woman with graying hair suddenly bursting out in such frenzy the postman came running back afraid something had happened they saw his tipped cap over the short curtains mrs morel rushed to the door  his pictures got first prize fred she cried and is sold for twenty guineas  my word thats something like said the young postman whom they had known all his life  and major moreton has bought it she cried  it looks like meanin something that does mrs morel said the postman his blue eyes bright he was glad to have brought such a lucky letter mrs morel went indoors and sat down trembling paul was afraid lest she might have misread the letter and might be disappointed after all he scrutinised it once twice yes he became convinced it was true then he sat down his heart beating with joy  mother he exclaimed  didnt i say we should do it she said pretending she was not crying  he took the kettle off the fire and mashed the tea  you didnt think mother he began tentatively  no my sonnot so muchbut i expected a good deal  but not so much he said  nonobut i knew we should do it  and then she recovered her composure apparently at least he sat with his shirt turned back showing his young throat almost like a girls and the towel in his hand his hair sticking up wet  twenty guineas mother thats just what you wanted to buy arthur out now you neednt borrow any itll just do  indeed i shant take it all she said  but why  because i shant  wellyou have twelve pounds ill have nine  they cavilled about sharing the twenty guineas she wanted to take only the five pounds she needed he would not hear of it so they got over the stress of emotion by quarrelling  morel came home at night from the pit saying  they tell me pauls got first prize for his picture and sold it to lord henry bentley for fifty pound  oh what stories people do tell she cried  ha he answered i said i wor sure it wor a lie but they said thad told fred hodgkisson  as if i would tell him such stuff  ha assented the miner  but he was disappointed nevertheless  its true he has got the first prize said mrs morel  the miner sat heavily in his chair  has he beguy he exclaimed  he stared across the room fixedly  but as for fifty poundssuch nonsense she was silent awhile major moreton bought it for twenty guineas thats true  twenty guineas tha niver says exclaimed morel  yes and it was worth it  ay he said i dont misdoubt it but twenty guineas for a bit of a paintin as he knocked off in an hour or two  he was silent with conceit of his son mrs morel sniffed as if it were nothing  and when does he handle th money asked the collier  that i couldnt tell you when the picture is sent home i suppose  there was silence morel stared at the sugarbasin instead of eating his dinner his black arm with the hand all gnarled with work lay on the table his wife pretended not to see him rub the back of his hand across his eyes nor the smear in the coaldust on his black face  yes an that other lad ud a done as much if they hadna ha killed im he said quietly  the thought of william went through mrs morel like a cold blade it left her feeling she was tired and wanted rest  paul was invited to dinner at mr jordans afterwards he said  mother i want an evening suit  yes i was afraid you would she said she was glad there was a moment or two of silence theres that one of williams she continued that i know cost four pounds ten and which hed only worn three times  should you like me to wear it mother he asked  yes i think it would fit youat least the coat the trousers would want shortening  he went upstairs and put on the coat and vest coming down he looked strange in a flannel collar and a flannel shirtfront with an evening coat and vest it was rather large  the tailor can make it right she said smoothing her hand over his shoulder its beautiful stuff i never could find in my heart to let your father wear the trousers and very glad i am now  and as she smoothed her hand over the silk collar she thought of her eldest son but this son was living enough inside the clothes she passed her hand down his back to feel him he was alive and hers the other was dead  he went out to dinner several times in his evening suit that had been williams each time his mothers heart was firm with pride and joy he was started now the studs she and the children had bought for william were in his shirtfront he wore one of williams dress shirts but he had an elegant figure his face was rough but warmlooking and rather pleasing he did not look particularly a gentleman but she thought he looked quite a man  he told her everything that took place everything that was said it was as if she had been there and he was dying to introduce her to these new friends who had dinner at seventhirty in the evening  go along with you she said what do they want to know me for  they do he cried indignantly if they want to know meand they say they dothen they want to know you because you are quite as clever as i am  go along with you child she laughed  but she began to spare her hands they too were workgnarled now the skin was shiny with so much hot water the knuckles rather swollen but she began to be careful to keep them out of soda she regretted what they had beenso small and exquisite and when annie insisted on her having more stylish blouses to suit her age she submitted she even went so far as to allow a black velvet bow to be placed on her hair then she sniffed in her sarcastic manner and was sure she looked a sight but she looked a lady paul declared as much as mrs major moreton and far far nicer the family was coming on only morel remained unchanged or rather lapsed slowly  paul and his mother now had long discussions about life religion was fading into the background he had shovelled away an the beliefs that would hamper him had cleared the ground and come more or less to the bedrock of belief that one should feel inside oneself for right and wrong and should have the patience to gradually realise ones god now life interested him more  you know he said to his mother i dont want to belong to the welltodo middle class i like my common people best i belong to the common people  but if anyone else said so my son wouldnt you be in a tear you know you consider yourself equal to any gentleman  in myself he answered not in my class or my education or my manners but in myself i am  very well then then why talk about the common people  becausethe difference between people isnt in their class but in themselves only from the middle classes one gets ideas and from the common peoplelife itself warmth you feel their hates and loves  its all very well my boy but then why dont you go and talk to your fathers pals  but theyre rather different  not at all theyre the common people after all whom do you mix with nowamong the common people those that exchange ideas like the middle classes the rest dont interest you  buttheres the life  i dont believe theres a jot more life from miriam than you could get from any educated girlsay miss moreton it is you who are snobbish about class  she frankly wanted him to climb into the middle classes a thing not very difficult she knew and she wanted him in the end to marry a lady  now she began to combat him in his restless fretting he still kept up his connection with miriam could neither break free nor go the whole length of engagement and this indecision seemed to bleed him of his energy moreover his mother suspected him of an unrecognised leaning towards clara and since the latter was a married woman she wished he would fall in love with one of the girls in a better station of life but he was stupid and would refuse to love or even to admire a girl much just because she was his social superior  my boy said his mother to him all your cleverness your breaking away from old things and taking life in your own hands doesnt seem to bring you much happiness  what is happiness he cried its nothing to me how am i to be happy  the plump question disturbed her  thats for you to judge my lad but if you could meet some good woman who would make you happyand you began to think of settling your lifewhen you have the meansso that you could work without all this frettingit would be much better for you  he frowned his mother caught him on the raw of his wound of miriam he pushed the tumbled hair off his forehead his eyes full of pain and fire  you mean easy mother he cried thats a womans whole doctrine for lifeease of soul and physical comfort and i do despise it  oh do you replied his mother and do you call yours a divine discontent  yes i dont care about its divinity but damn your happiness so long as lifes full it doesnt matter whether its happy or not im afraid your happiness would bore me  you never give it a chance she said then suddenly all her passion of grief over him broke out but it does matter she cried and you ought to be happy you ought to try to be happy to live to be happy how could i bear to think your life wouldnt be a happy one  your owns been bad enough mater but it hasnt left you so much worse off than the folk whove been happier i reckon youve done well and i am the same arent i well enough off  youre not my son battlebattleand suffer its about all you do as far as i can see  but why not my dear i tell you its the best  it isnt and one ought to be happy one ought  by this time mrs morel was trembling violently struggles of this kind often took place between her and her son when she seemed to fight for his very life against his own will to die he took her in his arms she was ill and pitiful  never mind little he murmured so long as you dont feel lifes paltry and a miserable business the rest doesnt matter happiness or unhappiness  she pressed him to her  but i want you to be happy she said pathetically  eh my dearsay rather you want me to live  mrs morel felt as if her heart would break for him at this rate she knew he would not live he had that poignant carelessness about himself his own suffering his own life which is a form of slow suicide it almost broke her heart with all the passion of her strong nature she hated miriam for having in this subtle way undermined his joy it did not matter to her that miriam could not help it miriam did it and she hated her  she wished so much he would fall in love with a girl equal to be his mateeducated and strong but he would not look at anybody above him in station he seemed to like mrs dawes at any rate that feeling was wholesome his mother prayed and prayed for him that he might not be wasted that was all her prayernot for his soul or his righteousness but that he might not be wasted and while he slept for hours and hours she thought and prayed for him  he drifted away from miriam imperceptibly without knowing he was going arthur only left the army to be married the baby was born six months after his wedding mrs morel got him a job under the firm again at twentyone shillings a week she furnished for him with the help of beatrices mother a little cottage of two rooms he was caught now it did not matter how he kicked and struggled he was fast for a time he chafed was irritable with his young wife who loved him he went almost distracted when the baby which was delicate cried or gave trouble he grumbled for hours to his mother she only said well my lad you did it yourself now you must make the best of it and then the grit came out in him he buckled to work undertook his responsibilities acknowledged that he belonged to his wife and child and did make a good best of it he had never been very closely inbound into the family now he was gone altogether  the months went slowly along paul had more or less got into connection with the socialist suffragette unitarian people in nottingham owing to his acquaintance with clara one day a friend of his and of claras in bestwood asked him to take a message to mrs dawes he went in the evening across sneinton market to bluebell hill he found the house in a mean little street paved with granite cobbles and having causeways of dark blue grooved bricks the front door went up a step from off this rough pavement where the feet of the passersby rasped and clattered the brown paint on the door was so old that the naked wood showed between the rents he stood on the street below and knocked there came a heavy footstep a large stout woman of about sixty towered above him he looked up at her from the pavement she had a rather severe face  she admitted him into the parlour which opened on to the street it was a small stuffy defunct room of mahogany and deathly enlargements of photographs of departed people done in carbon mrs radford left him she was stately almost martial in a moment clara appeared she flushed deeply and he was covered with confusion it seemed as if she did not like being discovered in her home circumstances  i thought it couldnt be your voice she said  but she might as well be hung for a sheep as for a lamb she invited him out of the mausoleum of a parlour into the kitchen  that was a little darkish room too but it was smothered in white lace the mother had seated herself again by the cupboard and was drawing thread from a vast web of lace a clump of fluff and ravelled cotton was at her right hand a heap of threequarterinch lace lay on her left whilst in front of her was the mountain of lace web piling the hearthrug threads of curly cotton pulled out from between the lengths of lace strewed over the fender and the fireplace paul dared not go forward for fear of treading on piles of white stuff  on the table was a jenny for carding the lace there was a pack of brown cardboard squares a pack of cards of lace a little box of pins and on the sofa lay a heap of drawn lace  the room was all lace and it was so dark and warm that the white snowy stuff seemed the more distinct  if youre coming in you wont have to mind the work said mrs radford i know were about blocked up but sit you down  clara much embarrassed gave him a chair against the wall opposite the white heaps then she herself took her place on the sofa shamedly  will you drink a bottle of stout mrs radford asked clara get him a bottle of stout  he protested but mrs radford insisted  you look as if you could do with it she said havent you never any more colour than that  its only a thick skin ive got that doesnt show the blood through he answered  clara ashamed and chagrined brought him a bottle of stout and a glass he poured out some of the black stuff  well he said lifting the glass heres health  and thank you said mrs radford  he took a drink of stout  and light yourself a cigarette so long as you dont set the house on fire said mrs radford  thank you he replied  nay you neednt thank me she answered i sll be glad to smell a bit of smoke in th ouse again a house o women is as dead as a house wi no fire to my thinkin im not a spider as likes a corner to myself i like a man about if hes only something to snap at  clara began to work her jenny spun with a subdued buzz the white lace hopped from between her fingers on to the card it was filled she snipped off the length and pinned the end down to the banded lace then she put a new card in her jenny paul watched her she sat square and magnificent her throat and arms were bare the blood still mantled below her ears she bent her head in shame of her humility her face was set on her work her arms were creamy and full of life beside the white lace her large wellkept hands worked with a balanced movement as if nothing would hurry them he not knowing watched her all the time he saw the arch of her neck from the shoulder as she bent her head he saw the coil of dun hair he watched her moving gleaming arms  ive heard a bit about you from clara continued the mother youre in jordans arent you she drew her lace unceasing  yes  ay well and i can remember when thomas jordan used to ask me for one of my toffies  did he laughed paul and did he get it  sometimes he did sometimes he didntwhich was latterly for hes the sort that takes all and gives naught he isor used to be  i think hes very decent said paul  yes well im glad to hear it  mrs radford looked across at him steadily there was something determined about her that he liked her face was falling loose but her eyes were calm and there was something strong in her that made it seem she was not old merely her wrinkles and loose cheeks were an anachronism she had the strength and sangfroid of a woman in the prime of life she continued drawing the lace with slow dignified movements the big web came up inevitably over her apron the length of lace fell away at her side her arms were finely shapen but glossy and yellow as old ivory they had not the peculiar dull gleam that made claras so fascinating to him  and youve been going with miriam leivers the mother asked him  well he answered  yes shes a nice girl she continued shes very nice but shes a bit too much above this world to suit my fancy  she is a bit like that he agreed  shell never be satisfied till shes got wings and can fly over everybodys head she wont she said  clara broke in and he told her his message she spoke humbly to him he had surprised her in her drudgery to have her humble made him feel as if he were lifting his head in expectation  do you like jennying he asked  what can a woman do she replied bitterly  is it sweated  more or less isnt all womans work thats another trick the men have played since we force ourselves into the labour market  now then you shut up about the men said her mother if the women wasnt fools the men wouldnt be bad uns thats what i say no man was ever that bad wi me but what he got it back again not but what theyre a lousy lot theres no denying it  but theyre all right really arent they he asked  well theyre a bit different from women she answered  would you care to be back at jordans he asked clara  i dont think so she replied  yes she would cried her mother thank her stars if she could get back dont you listen to her shes for ever on that igh horse of hers an its backs that thin an starved itll cut her in two one of these days  clara suffered badly from her mother paul felt as if his eyes were coming very wide open wasnt he to take claras fulminations so seriously after all she spun steadily at her work he experienced a thrill of joy thinking she might need his help she seemed denied and deprived of so much and her arm moved mechanically that should never have been subdued to a mechanism and her head was bowed to the lace that never should have been bowed she seemed to be stranded there among the refuse that life has thrown away doing her jennying it was a bitter thing to her to be put aside by life as if it had no use for her no wonder she protested  she came with him to the door he stood below in the mean street looking up at her so fine she was in her stature and her bearing she reminded him of juno dethroned as she stood in the doorway she winced from the street from her surroundings  and you will go with mrs hodgkisson to hucknall  he was talking quite meaninglessly only watching her her grey eyes at last met his they looked dumb with humiliation pleading with a kind of captive misery he was shaken and at a loss he had thought her high and mighty  when he left her he wanted to run he went to the station in a sort of dream and was at home without realising he had moved out of her street  he had an idea that susan the overseer of the spiral girls was about to be married he asked her the next day  i say susan i heard a whisper of your getting married what about it  susan flushed red  whos been talking to you she replied  nobody i merely heard a whisper that you were thinking  well i am though you neednt tell anybody whats more i wish i wasnt  nay susan you wont make me believe that  shant i you can believe it though id rather stop here a thousand times  paul was perturbed  why susan  the girls colour was high and her eyes flashed  thats why  and must you  for answer she looked at him there was about him a candour and gentleness which made the women trust him he understood  ah im sorry he said  tears came to her eyes  but youll see itll turn out all right youll make the best of it he continued rather wistfully  theres nothing else for it  yea theres making the worst of it try and make it all right  he soon made occasion to call again on clara  would you he said care to come back to jordans  she put down her work laid her beautiful arms on the table and looked at him for some moments without answering gradually the flush mounted her cheek  why she asked  paul felt rather awkward  well because susan is thinking of leaving he said  clara went on with her jennying the white lace leaped in little jumps and bounds on to the card he waited for her without raising her head she said at last in a peculiar low voice  have you said anything about it  except to you not a word  there was again a long silence  i will apply when the advertisement is out she said  you will apply before that i will let you know exactly when  she went on spinning her little machine and did not contradict him  clara came to jordans some of the older hands fanny among them remembered her earlier rule and cordially disliked the memory clara had always been ikey reserved and superior she had never mixed with the girls as one of themselves if she had occasion to find fault she did it coolly and with perfect politeness which the defaulter felt to be a bigger insult than crassness towards fanny the poor overstrung hunchback clara was unfailingly compassionate and gentle as a result of which fanny shed more bitter tears than ever the rough tongues of the other overseers had caused her  there was something in clara that paul disliked and much that piqued him if she were about he always watched her strong throat or her neck upon which the blonde hair grew low and fluffy there was a fine down almost invisible upon the skin of her face and arms and when once he had perceived it he saw it always  when he was at his work painting in the afternoon she would come and stand near to him perfectly motionless then he felt her though she neither spoke nor touched him although she stood a yard away he felt as if he were in contact with her then he could paint no more he flung down the brushes and turned to talk to her  sometimes she praised his work sometimes she was critical and cold  you are affected in that piece she would say and as there was an element of truth in her condemnation his blood boiled with anger  again what of this he would ask enthusiastically  hm she made a small doubtful sound it doesnt interest me much  because you dont understand it he retorted  then why ask me about it  because i thought you would understand  she would shrug her shoulders in scorn of his work she maddened him he was furious then he abused her and went into passionate exposition of his stuff this amused and stimulated her but she never owned that she had been wrong  during the ten years that she had belonged to the womens movement she had acquired a fair amount of education and having had some of miriams passion to be instructed had taught herself french and could read in that language with a struggle she considered herself as a woman apart and particularly apart from her class the girls in the spiral department were all of good homes it was a small special industry and had a certain distinction there was an air of refinement in both rooms but clara was aloof also from her fellowworkers  none of these things however did she reveal to paul she was not the one to give herself away there was a sense of mystery about her she was so reserved he felt she had much to reserve her history was open on the surface but its inner meaning was hidden from everybody it was exciting and then sometimes he caught her looking at him from under her brows with an almost furtive sullen scrutiny which made him move quickly often she met his eyes but then her own were as it were covered over revealing nothing she gave him a little lenient smile she was to him extraordinarily provocative because of the knowledge she seemed to possess and gathered fruit of experience he could not attain  one day he picked up a copy of lettres de mon moulin from her workbench  you read french do you he cried  clara glanced round negligently she was making an elastic stocking of heliotrope silk turning the spiral machine with slow balanced regularity occasionally bending down to see her work or to adjust the needles then her magnificent neck with its down and fine pencils of hair shone white against the lavender lustrous silk she turned a few more rounds and stopped  what did you say she asked smiling sweetly  pauls eyes glittered at her insolent indifference to him  i did not know you read french he said very polite  did you not she replied with a faint sarcastic smile  rotten swank he said but scarcely loud enough to be heard  he shut his mouth angrily as he watched her she seemed to scorn the work she mechanically produced yet the hose she made were as nearly perfect as possible  you dont like spiral work he said  oh well all work is work she answered as if she knew all about it  he marvelled at her coldness he had to do everything hotly she must be something special  what would you prefer to do he asked  she laughed at him indulgently as she said  there is so little likelihood of my ever being given a choice that i havent wasted time considering  pah he said contemptuous on his side now you only say that because youre too proud to own up what you want and cant get  you know me very well she replied coldly  i know you think youre terrific great shakes and that you live under the eternal insult of working in a factory  he was very angry and very rude she merely turned away from him in disdain he walked whistling down the room flirted and laughed with hilda  later on he said to himself  what was i so impudent to clara for he was rather annoyed with himself at the same time glad serve her right she stinks with silent pride he said to himself angrily  in the afternoon he came down there was a certain weight on his heart which he wanted to remove he thought to do it by offering her chocolates  have one he said i bought a handful to sweeten me up  to his great relief she accepted he sat on the workbench beside her machine twisting a piece of silk round his finger she loved him for his quick unexpected movements like a young animal his feet swung as he pondered the sweets lay strewn on the bench she bent over her machine grinding rhythmically then stooping to see the stocking that hung beneath pulled down by the weight he watched the handsome crouching of her back and the apronstrings curling on the floor  there is always about you he said a sort of waiting whatever i see you doing youre not really there you are waitinglike penelope when she did her weaving he could not help a spurt of wickedness ill call you penelope he said  would it make any difference she said carefully removing one of her needles  that doesnt matter so long as it pleases me here i say you seem to forget im your boss it just occurs to me  and what does that mean she asked coolly  it means ive got a right to boss you  is there anything you want to complain about  oh i say you neednt be nasty he said angrily  i dont know what you want she said continuing her task  i want you to treat me nicely and respectfully  call you sir perhaps she asked quietly  yes call me sir i should love it  then i wish you would go upstairs sir  his mouth closed and a frown came on his face he jumped suddenly down  youre too blessed superior for anything he said  and he went away to the other girls he felt he was being angrier than he had any need to be in fact he doubted slightly that he was showing off but if he were then he would clara heard him laughing in a way she hated with the girls down the next room  when at evening he went through the department after the girls had gone he saw his chocolates lying untouched in front of claras machine he left them in the morning they were still there and clara was at work later on minnie a little brunette they called pussy called to him  hey havent you got a chocolate for anybody  sorry pussy he replied i meant to have offered them then i went and forgot em  i think you did she answered  ill bring you some this afternoon you dont want them after theyve been lying about do you  oh im not particular smiled pussy  oh no he said theyll be dusty  he went up to claras bench  sorry i left these things littering about he said  she flushed scarlet he gathered them together in his fist  theyll be dirty now he said you should have taken them i wonder why you didnt i meant to have told you i wanted you to  he flung them out of the window into the yard below he just glanced at her she winced from his eyes  in the afternoon he brought another packet  will you take some he said offering them first to clara these are fresh  she accepted one and put it on to the bench  oh take severalfor luck he said  she took a couple more and put them on the bench also then she turned in confusion to her work he went on up the room  here you are pussy he said dont be greedy  are they all for her cried the others rushing up  of course theyre not he said  the girls clamoured round pussy drew back from her mates  come out she cried i can have first pick cant i paul  be nice with em he said and went away  you are a dear the girls cried  tenpence he answered  he went past clara without speaking she felt the three chocolate creams would burn her if she touched them it needed all her courage to slip them into the pocket of her apron  the girls loved him and were afraid of him he was so nice while he was nice but if he were offended so distant treating them as if they scarcely existed or not more than the bobbins of thread and then if they were impudent he said quietly do you mind going on with your work and stood and watched  when he celebrated his twentythird birthday the house was in trouble arthur was just going to be married his mother was not well his father getting an old man and lame from his accidents was given a paltry poor job miriam was an eternal reproach he felt he owed himself to her yet could not give himself the house moreover needed his support he was pulled in all directions he was not glad it was his birthday it made him bitter  he got to work at eight oclock most of the clerks had not turned up the girls were not due till 830 as he was changing his coat he heard a voice behind him say  paul paul i want you  it was fanny the hunchback standing at the top of her stairs her face radiant with a secret paul looked at her in astonishment  i want you she said  he stood at a loss  come on she coaxed come before you begin on the letters  he went down the halfdozen steps into her dry narrow finishingoff room fanny walked before him her black bodice was shortthe waist was under her armpitsand her greenblack cashmere skirt seemed very long as she strode with big strides before the young man himself so graceful she went to her seat at the narrow end of the room where the window opened on to chimneypots paul watched her thin hands and her flat red wrists as she excitedly twitched her white apron which was spread on the bench in front of her she hesitated  you didnt think wed forgot you she asked reproachful  why he asked he had forgotten his birthday himself  why he says why why look here she pointed to the calendar and he saw surrounding the big black number 21 hundreds of little crosses in blacklead  oh kisses for my birthday he laughed how did you know  yes you want to know dont you fanny mocked hugely delighted theres one from everybodyexcept lady claraand two from some but i shant tell you how many i put  oh i know youre spooney he said  there you are mistaken she cried indignant i could never be so soft her voice was strong and contralto  you always pretend to be such a hardhearted hussy he laughed and you know youre as sentimental  id rather be called sentimental than frozen meat fanny blurted paul knew she referred to clara and he smiled  do you say such nasty things about me he laughed  no my duck the hunchback woman answered lavishly tender she was thirtynine no my duck because you dont think yourself a fine figure in marble and us nothing but dirt im as good as you arent i paul and the question delighted her  why were not better than one another are we he replied  but im as good as you arent i paul she persisted daringly  of course you are if it comes to goodness youre better  she was rather afraid of the situation she might get hysterical  i thought id get here before the otherswont they say im deep now shut your eyes she said  and open your mouth and see what god sends you he continued suiting action to words and expecting a piece of chocolate he heard the rustle of the apron and a faint clink of metal im going to look he said  he opened his eyes fanny her long cheeks flushed her blue eyes shining was gazing at him there was a little bundle of painttubes on the bench before him he turned pale  no fanny he said quickly  from us all she answered hastily  no but  are they the right sort she asked rocking herself with delight  jove theyre the best in the catalogue  but theyre the right sorts she cried  theyre off the little list id made to get when my ship came in he bit his lip  fanny was overcome with emotion she must turn the conversation  they was all on thorns to do it they all paid their shares all except the queen of sheba  the queen of sheba was clara  and wouldnt she join paul asked  she didnt get the chance we never told her we wasnt going to have her bossing this show we didnt want her to join  paul laughed at the woman he was much moved at last he must go she was very close to him suddenly she flung her arms round his neck and kissed him vehemently  i can give you a kiss today she said apologetically youve looked so white its made my heart ache  paul kissed her and left her her arms were so pitifully thin that his heart ached also  that day he met clara as he ran downstairs to wash his hands at dinnertime  you have stayed to dinner he exclaimed it was unusual for her  yes and i seem to have dined on old surgicalappliance stock i must go out now or i shall feel stale indiarubber right through  she lingered he instantly caught at her wish  you are going anywhere he asked  they went together up to the castle outdoors she dressed very plainly down to ugliness indoors she always looked nice she walked with hesitating steps alongside paul bowing and turning away from him dowdy in dress and drooping she showed to great disadvantage he could scarcely recognise her strong form that seemed to slumber with power she appeared almost insignificant drowning her stature in her stoop as she shrank from the public gaze  the castle grounds were very green and fresh climbing the precipitous ascent he laughed and chattered but she was silent seeming to brood over something there was scarcely time to go inside the squat square building that crowns the bluff of rock they leaned upon the wall where the cliff runs sheer down to the park below them in their holes in the sandstone pigeons preened themselves and cooed softly away down upon the boulevard at the foot of the rock tiny trees stood in their own pools of shadow and tiny people went scurrying about in almost ludicrous importance  you feel as if you could scoop up the folk like tadpoles and have a handful of them he said  she laughed answering  yes it is not necessary to get far off in order to see us proportionately the trees are much more significant  bulk only he said  she laughed cynically  away beyond the boulevard the thin stripes of the metals showed upon the railwaytrack whose margin was crowded with little stacks of timber beside which smoking toy engines fussed then the silver string of the canal lay at random among the black heaps beyond the dwellings very dense on the river flat looked like black poisonous herbage in thick rows and crowded beds stretching right away broken now and then by taller plants right to where the river glistened in a hieroglyph across the country the steep scarp cliffs across the river looked puny great stretches of country darkened with trees and faintly brightened with cornland spread towards the haze where the hills rose blue beyond grey  it is comforting said mrs dawes to think the town goes no farther it is only a little sore upon the country yet  a little scab paul said  she shivered she loathed the town looking drearily across at the country which was forbidden her her impassive face pale and hostile she reminded paul of one of the bitter remorseful angels  but the towns all right he said its only temporary this is the crude clumsy makeshift weve practised on till we find out what the idea is the town will come all right  the pigeons in the pockets of rock among the perched bushes cooed comfortably to the left the large church of st mary rose into space to keep close company with the castle above the heaped rubble of the town mrs dawes smiled brightly as she looked across the country  i feel better she said  thank you he replied great compliment  oh my brother she laughed  hm thats snatching back with the left hand what you gave with the right and no mistake he said  she laughed in amusement at him  but what was the matter with you he asked i know you were brooding something special i can see the stamp of it on your face yet  i think i will not tell you she said  all right hug it he answered  she flushed and bit her lip  no she said it was the girls  what about em paul asked  they have been plotting something for a week now and today they seem particularly full of it all alike they insult me with their secrecy  do they he asked in concern  i should not mind she went on in the metallic angry tone if they did not thrust it into my facethe fact that they have a secret  just like women said he  it is hateful their mean gloating she said intensely  paul was silent he knew what the girls gloated over he was sorry to be the cause of this new dissension  they can have all the secrets in the world she went on brooding bitterly but they might refrain from glorying in them and making me feel more out of it than ever it isit is almost unbearable  paul thought for a few minutes he was much perturbed  i will tell you what its all about he said pale and nervous its my birthday and theyve bought me a fine lot of paints all the girls theyre jealous of youhe felt her stiffen coldly at the word jealousmerely because i sometimes bring you a book he added slowly but you see its only a trifle dont bother about it will youbecausehe laughed quicklywell what would they say if they saw us here now in spite of their victory  she was angry with him for his clumsy reference to their present intimacy it was almost insolent of him yet he was so quiet she forgave him although it cost her an effort  their two hands lay on the rough stone parapet of the castle wall he had inherited from his mother a fineness of mould so that his hands were small and vigorous hers were large to match her large limbs but white and powerful looking as paul looked at them he knew her she is wanting somebody to take her handsfor all she is so contemptuous of us he said to himself and she saw nothing but his two hands so warm and alive which seemed to live for her he was brooding now staring out over the country from under sullen brows the little interesting diversity of shapes had vanished from the scene all that remained was a vast dark matrix of sorrow and tragedy the same in all the houses and the riverflats and the people and the birds they were only shapen differently and now that the forms seemed to have melted away there remained the mass from which all the landscape was composed a dark mass of struggle and pain the factory the girls his mother the large uplifted church the thicket of the town merged into one atmospheredark brooding and sorrowful every bit  is that two oclock striking mrs dawes said in surprise  paul started and everything sprang into form regained its individuality its forgetfulness and its cheerfulness  they hurried back to work  when he was in the rush of preparing for the nights post examining the work up from fannys room which smelt of ironing the evening postman came in  mr paul morel he said smiling handing paul a package a ladys handwriting dont let the girls see it  the postman himself a favourite was pleased to make fun of the girls affection for paul  it was a volume of verse with a brief note you will allow me to send you this and so spare me my isolation i also sympathise and wish you wellcd paul flushed hot  good lord mrs dawes she cant afford it good lord who everd have thought it  he was suddenly intensely moved he was filled with the warmth of her in the glow he could almost feel her as if she were presenther arms her shoulders her bosom see them feel them almost contain them  this move on the part of clara brought them into closer intimacy the other girls noticed that when paul met mrs dawes his eyes lifted and gave that peculiar bright greeting which they could interpret knowing he was unaware clara made no sign save that occasionally she turned aside her face from him when he came upon her  they walked out together very often at dinnertime it was quite open quite frank everybody seemed to feel that he was quite unaware of the state of his own feeling and that nothing was wrong he talked to her now with some of the old fervour with which he had talked to miriam but he cared less about the talk he did not bother about his conclusions  one day in october they went out to lambley for tea suddenly they came to a halt on top of the hill he climbed and sat on a gate she sat on the stile the afternoon was perfectly still with a dim haze and yellow sheaves glowing through they were quiet  how old were you when you married he asked quietly  twentytwo  her voice was subdued almost submissive she would tell him now  it is eight years ago  yes  and when did you leave him  three years ago  five years did you love him when you married him  she was silent for some time then she said slowly  i thought i didmore or less i didnt think much about it and he wanted me i was very prudish then  and you sort of walked into it without thinking  yes i seemed to have been asleep nearly all my life  somnambule butwhen did you wake up  i dont know that i ever did or ever havesince i was a child  you went to sleep as you grew to be a woman how queer and he didnt wake you  no he never got there she replied in a monotone  the brown birds dashed over the hedges where the rosehips stood naked and scarlet  got where he asked  at me he never really mattered to me  the afternoon was so gently warm and dim red roofs of the cottages burned among the blue haze he loved the day he could feel but he could not understand what clara was saying  but why did you leave him was he horrid to you  she shuddered lightly  hehe sort of degraded me he wanted to bully me because he hadnt got me and then i felt as if i wanted to run as if i was fastened and bound up and he seemed dirty  i see  he did not at all see  and was he always dirty he asked  a bit she replied slowly and then he seemed as if he couldnt get at me really and then he got brutalhe was brutal  and why did you leave him finally  becausebecause he was unfaithful to me  they were both silent for some time her hand lay on the gatepost as she balanced he put his own over it his heart beat quickly  but did youwere you everdid you ever give him a chance  chance how  to come near to you  i married himand i was willing  they both strove to keep their voices steady  i believe he loves you he said  it looks like it she replied  he wanted to take his hand away and could not she saved him by removing her own after a silence he began again  did you leave him out of count all along  he left me she said  and i suppose he couldnt make himself mean everything to you  he tried to bully me into it  but the conversation had got them both out of their depth suddenly paul jumped down  come on he said lets go and get some tea  they found a cottage where they sat in the cold parlour she poured out his tea she was very quiet he felt she had withdrawn again from him after tea she stared broodingly into her teacup twisting her wedding ring all the time in her abstraction she took the ring off her finger stood it up and spun it upon the table the gold became a diaphanous glittering globe it fell and the ring was quivering upon the table she spun it again and again paul watched fascinated  but she was a married woman and he believed in simple friendship and he considered that he was perfectly honourable with regard to her it was only a friendship between man and woman such as any civilised persons might have  he was like so many young men of his own age sex had become so complicated in him that he would have denied that he ever could want clara or miriam or any woman whom he knew sex desire was a sort of detached thing that did not belong to a woman he loved miriam with his soul he grew warm at the thought of clara he battled with her he knew the curves of her breast and shoulders as if they had been moulded inside him and yet he did not positively desire her he would have denied it for ever he believed himself really bound to miriam if ever he should marry some time in the far future it would be his duty to marry miriam that he gave clara to understand and she said nothing but left him to his courses he came to her mrs dawes whenever he could then he wrote frequently to miriam and visited the girl occasionally so he went on through the winter but he seemed not so fretted his mother was easier about him she thought he was getting away from miriam  miriam knew now how strong was the attraction of clara for him but still she was certain that the best in him would triumph his feeling for mrs daweswho moreover was a married womanwas shallow and temporal compared with his love for herself he would come back to her she was sure with some of his young freshness gone perhaps but cured of his desire for the lesser things which other women than herself could give him she could bear all if he were inwardly true to her and must come back  he saw none of the anomaly of his position miriam was his old friend lover and she belonged to bestwood and home and his youth clara was a newer friend and she belonged to nottingham to life to the world it seemed to him quite plain  mrs dawes and he had many periods of coolness when they saw little of each other but they always came together again  were you horrid with baxter dawes he asked her it was a thing that seemed to trouble him  in what way  oh i dont know but werent you horrid with him didnt you do something that knocked him to pieces  what pray  making him feel as if he were nothingi know paul declared  you are so clever my friend she said coolly  the conversation broke off there but it made her cool with him for some time  she very rarely saw miriam now the friendship between the two women was not broken off but considerably weakened  will you come in to the concert on sunday afternoon clara asked him just after christmas  i promised to go up to willey farm he replied  oh very well  you dont mind do you he asked  why should i she answered  which almost annoyed him  you know he said miriam and i have been a lot to each other ever since i was sixteenthats seven years now  its a long time clara replied  yes but somehow sheit doesnt go right  how asked clara  she seems to draw me and draw me and she wouldnt leave a single hair of me free to fall out and blow awayshed keep it  but you like to be kept  no he said i dont i wish it could be normal give and takelike me and you i want a woman to keep me but not in her pocket  but if you love her it couldnt be normal like me and you  yes i should love her better then she sort of wants me so much that i cant give myself  wants you how  wants the soul out of my body i cant help shrinking back from her  and yet you love her  no i dont love her i never even kiss her  why not clara asked  i dont know  i suppose youre afraid she said  im not something in me shrinks from her like hellshes so good when im not good  how do you know what she is  i do i know she wants a sort of soul union  but how do you know what she wants  ive been with her for seven years  and you havent found out the very first thing about her  whats that  that she doesnt want any of your soul communion thats your own imagination she wants you  he pondered over this perhaps he was wrong  but she seems he began  youve never tried she answered    chapter xi  the test on miriam  with the spring came again the old madness and battle now he knew he would have to go to miriam but what was his reluctance he told himself it was only a sort of overstrong virginity in her and him which neither could break through he might have married her but his circumstances at home made it difficult and moreover he did not want to marry marriage was for life and because they had become close companions he and she he did not see that it should inevitably follow they should be man and wife he did not feel that he wanted marriage with miriam he wished he did he would have given his head to have felt a joyous desire to marry her and to have her then why couldnt he bring it off there was some obstacle and what was the obstacle it lay in the physical bondage he shrank from the physical contact but why with her he felt bound up inside himself he could not go out to her something struggled in him but he could not get to her why she loved him clara said she even wanted him then why couldnt he go to her make love to her kiss her why when she put her arm in his timidly as they walked did he feel he would burst forth in brutality and recoil he owed himself to her he wanted to belong to her perhaps the recoil and the shrinking from her was love in its first fierce modesty he had no aversion for her no it was the opposite it was a strong desire battling with a still stronger shyness and virginity it seemed as if virginity were a positive force which fought and won in both of them and with her he felt it so hard to overcome yet he was nearest to her and with her alone could he deliberately break through and he owed himself to her then if they could get things right they could marry but he would not marry unless he could feel strong in the joy of itnever he could not have faced his mother it seemed to him that to sacrifice himself in a marriage he did not want would be degrading and would undo all his life make it a nullity he would try what he could do  and he had a great tenderness for miriam always she was sad dreaming her religion and he was nearly a religion to her he could not bear to fail her it would all come right if they tried  he looked round a good many of the nicest men he knew were like himself bound in by their own virginity which they could not break out of they were so sensitive to their women that they would go without them for ever rather than do them a hurt an injustice being the sons of mothers whose husbands had blundered rather brutally through their feminine sanctities they were themselves too diffident and shy they could easier deny themselves than incur any reproach from a woman for a woman was like their mother and they were full of the sense of their mother they preferred themselves to suffer the misery of celibacy rather than risk the other person  he went back to her something in her when he looked at her brought the tears almost to his eyes one day he stood behind her as she sang annie was playing a song on the piano as miriam sang her mouth seemed hopeless she sang like a nun singing to heaven it reminded him so much of the mouth and eyes of one who sings beside a botticelli madonna so spiritual again hot as steel came up the pain in him why must he ask her for the other thing why was there his blood battling with her if only he could have been always gentle tender with her breathing with her the atmosphere of reverie and religious dreams he would give his right hand it was not fair to hurt her there seemed an eternal maidenhood about her and when he thought of her mother he saw the great brown eyes of a maiden who was nearly scared and shocked out of her virgin maidenhood but not quite in spite of her seven children they had been born almost leaving her out of count not of her but upon her so she could never let them go because she never had possessed them  mrs morel saw him going again frequently to miriam and was astonished he said nothing to his mother he did not explain nor excuse himself if he came home late and she reproached him he frowned and turned on her in an overbearing way  i shall come home when i like he said i am old enough  must she keep you till this time  it is i who stay he answered  and she lets you but very well she said  and she went to bed leaving the door unlocked for him but she lay listening until he came often long after it was a great bitterness to her that he had gone back to miriam she recognised however the uselessness of any further interference he went to willey farm as a man now not as a youth she had no right over him there was a coldness between him and her he hardly told her anything discarded she waited on him cooked for him still and loved to slave for him but her face closed again like a mask there was nothing for her to do now but the housework for all the rest he had gone to miriam she could not forgive him miriam killed the joy and the warmth in him he had been such a jolly lad and full of the warmest affection now he grew colder more and more irritable and gloomy it reminded her of william but paul was worse he did things with more intensity and more realisation of what he was about his mother knew how he was suffering for want of a woman and she saw him going to miriam if he had made up his mind nothing on earth would alter him mrs morel was tired she began to give up at last she had finished she was in the way  he went on determinedly he realised more or less what his mother felt it only hardened his soul he made himself callous towards her but it was like being callous to his own health it undermined him quickly yet he persisted  he lay back in the rockingchair at willey farm one evening he had been talking to miriam for some weeks but had not come to the point now he said suddenly  i am twentyfour almost  she had been brooding she looked up at him suddenly in surprise  yes what makes you say it  there was something in the charged atmosphere that she dreaded  sir thomas more says one can marry at twentyfour  she laughed quaintly saying  does it need sir thomas mores sanction  no but one ought to marry about then  ay she answered broodingly and she waited  i cant marry you he continued slowly not now because weve no money and they depend on me at home  she sat halfguessing what was coming  but i want to marry now  you want to marry she repeated  a womanyou know what i mean  she was silent  now at last i must he said  ay she answered  and you love me  she laughed bitterly  why are you ashamed of it he answered you wouldnt be ashamed before your god why are you before people  nay she answered deeply i am not ashamed  you are he replied bitterly and its my fault but you know i cant help beingas i amdont you  i know you cant help it she replied  i love you an awful lotthen there is something short  where she answered looking at him  oh in me it is i who ought to be ashamedlike a spiritual cripple and i am ashamed it is misery why is it  i dont know replied miriam  and i dont know he repeated dont you think we have been too fierce in our what they call purity dont you think that to be so much afraid and averse is a sort of dirtiness  she looked at him with startled dark eyes  you recoiled away from anything of the sort and i took the motion from you and recoiled also perhaps worse  there was silence in the room for some time  yes she said it is so  there is between us he said all these years of intimacy i feel naked enough before you do you understand  i think so she answered  and you love me  she laughed  dont be bitter he pleaded  she looked at him and was sorry for him his eyes were dark with torture she was sorry for him it was worse for him to have this deflated love than for herself who could never be properly mated he was restless for ever urging forward and trying to find a way out he might do as he liked and have what he liked of her  nay she said softly i am not bitter  she felt she could bear anything for him she would suffer for him she put her hand on his knee as he leaned forward in his chair he took it and kissed it but it hurt to do so he felt he was putting himself aside he sat there sacrificed to her purity which felt more like nullity how could he kiss her hand passionately when it would drive her away and leave nothing but pain yet slowly he drew her to him and kissed her  they knew each other too well to pretend anything as she kissed him she watched his eyes they were staring across the room with a peculiar dark blaze in them that fascinated her he was perfectly still she could feel his heart throbbing heavily in his breast  what are you thinking about she asked  the blaze in his eyes shuddered became uncertain  i was thinking all the while i love you i have been obstinate  she sank her head on his breast  yes she answered  thats all he said and his voice seemed sure and his mouth was kissing her throat  then she raised her head and looked into his eyes with her full gaze of love the blaze struggled seemed to try to get away from her and then was quenched he turned his head quickly aside it was a moment of anguish  kiss me she whispered  he shut his eyes and kissed her and his arms folded her closer and closer  when she walked home with him over the fields he said  i am glad i came back to you i feel so simple with youas if there was nothing to hide we will be happy  yes she murmured and the tears came to her eyes  some sort of perversity in our souls he said makes us not want get away from the very thing we want we have to fight against that  yes she said and she felt stunned  as she stood under the droopingthorn tree in the darkness by the roadside he kissed her and his fingers wandered over her face in the darkness where he could not see her but only feel her his passion flooded him he clasped her very close  sometime you will have me he murmured hiding his face on her shoulder it was so difficult  not now she said  his hopes and his heart sunk a dreariness came over him  no he said  his clasp of her slackened  i love to feel your arm there she said pressing his arm against her back where it went round her waist it rests me so  he tightened the pressure of his arm upon the small of her back to rest her  we belong to each other he said  yes  then why shouldnt we belong to each other altogether  but she faltered  i know its a lot to ask he said but theres not much risk for you reallynot in the gretchen way you can trust me there  oh i can trust you the answer came quick and strong its not thatits not that at allbut  what  she hid her face in his neck with a little cry of misery  i dont know she cried  she seemed slightly hysterical but with a sort of horror his heart died in him  you dont think it ugly he asked  no not now you have taught me it isnt  you are afraid  she calmed herself hastily  yes i am only afraid she said  he kissed her tenderly  never mind he said you should please yourself  suddenly she gripped his arms round her and clenched her body stiff  you shall have me she said through her shut teeth  his heart beat up again like fire he folded her close and his mouth was on her throat she could not bear it she drew away he disengaged her  wont you be late she asked gently  he sighed scarcely hearing what she said she waited wishing he would go at last he kissed her quickly and climbed the fence looking round he saw the pale blotch of her face down in the darkness under the hanging tree there was no more of her but this pale blotch  goodbye she called softly she had no body only a voice and a dim face he turned away and ran down the road his fists clenched and when he came to the wall over the lake he leaned there almost stunned looking up the black water  miriam plunged home over the meadows she was not afraid of people what they might say but she dreaded the issue with him yes she would let him have her if he insisted and then when she thought of it afterwards her heart went down he would be disappointed he would find no satisfaction and then he would go away yet he was so insistent and over this which did not seem so allimportant to her was their love to break down after all he was only like other men seeking his satisfaction oh but there was something more in him something deeper she could trust to it in spite of all desires he said that possession was a great moment in life all strong emotions concentrated there perhaps it was so there was something divine in it then she would submit religiously to the sacrifice he should have her and at the thought her whole body clenched itself involuntarily hard as if against something but life forced her through this gate of suffering too and she would submit at any rate it would give him what he wanted which was her deepest wish she brooded and brooded and brooded herself towards accepting him  he courted her now like a lover often when he grew hot she put his face from her held it between her hands and looked in his eyes he could not meet her gaze her dark eyes full of love earnest and searching made him turn away not for an instant would she let him forget back again he had to torture himself into a sense of his responsibility and hers never any relaxing never any leaving himself to the great hunger and impersonality of passion he must be brought back to a deliberate reflective creature as if from a swoon of passion she caged him back to the littleness the personal relationship he could not bear it leave me aloneleave me alone he wanted to cry but she wanted him to look at her with eyes full of love his eyes full of the dark impersonal fire of desire did not belong to her  there was a great crop of cherries at the farm the trees at the back of the house very large and tall hung thick with scarlet and crimson drops under the dark leaves paul and edgar were gathering the fruit one evening it had been a hot day and now the clouds were rolling in the sky dark and warm paul combed high in the tree above the scarlet roofs of the buildings the wind moaning steadily made the whole tree rock with a subtle thrilling motion that stirred the blood the young man perched insecurely in the slender branches rocked till he felt slightly drunk reached down the boughs where the scarlet beady cherries hung thick underneath and tore off handful after handful of the sleek coolfleshed fruit cherries touched his ears and his neck as he stretched forward their chill fingertips sending a flash down his blood all shades of red from a golden vermilion to a rich crimson glowed and met his eyes under a darkness of leaves  the sun going down suddenly caught the broken clouds immense piles of gold flared out in the southeast heaped in soft glowing yellow right up the sky the world till now dusk and grey reflected the gold glow astonished everywhere the trees and the grass and the faroff water seemed roused from the twilight and shining  miriam came out wondering  oh paul heard her mellow voice call isnt it wonderful  he looked down there was a faint gold glimmer on her face that looked very soft turned up to him  how high you are she said  beside her on the rhubarb leaves were four dead birds thieves that had been shot paul saw some cherry stones hanging quite bleached like skeletons picked clear of flesh he looked down again to miriam  clouds are on fire he said  beautiful she cried  she seemed so small so soft so tender down there he threw a handful of cherries at her she was startled and frightened he laughed with a low chuckling sound and pelted her she ran for shelter picking up some cherries two fine red pairs she hung over her ears then she looked up again  havent you got enough she asked  nearly it is like being on a ship up here  and how long will you stay  while the sunset lasts  she went to the fence and sat there watching the gold clouds fall to pieces and go in immense rosecoloured ruin towards the darkness gold flamed to scarlet like pain in its intense brightness then the scarlet sank to rose and rose to crimson and quickly the passion went out of the sky all the world was dark grey paul scrambled quickly down with his basket tearing his shirtsleeve as he did so  they are lovely said miriam fingering the cherries  ive torn my sleeve he answered  she took the threecornered rip saying  i shall have to mend it it was near the shoulder she put her fingers through the tear how warm she said  he laughed there was a new strange note in his voice one that made her pant  shall we stay out he said  wont it rain she asked  no let us walk a little way  they went down the fields and into the thick plantation of trees and pines  shall we go in among the trees he asked  do you want to  yes  it was very dark among the firs and the sharp spines pricked her face she was afraid paul was silent and strange  i like the darkness he said i wish it were thickergood thick darkness  he seemed to be almost unaware of her as a person she was only to him then a woman she was afraid  he stood against a pinetree trunk and took her in his arms she relinquished herself to him but it was a sacrifice in which she felt something of horror this thickvoiced oblivious man was a stranger to her  later it began to rain the pinetrees smelled very strong paul lay with his head on the ground on the dead pine needles listening to the sharp hiss of the raina steady keen noise his heart was down very heavy now he realised that she had not been with him all the time that her soul had stood apart in a sort of horror he was physically at rest but no more very dreary at heart very sad and very tender his fingers wandered over her face pitifully now again she loved him deeply he was tender and beautiful  the rain he said  yesis it coming on you  she put her hands over him on his hair on his shoulders to feel if the raindrops fell on him she loved him dearly he as he lay with his face on the dead pineleaves felt extraordinarily quiet he did not mind if the raindrops came on him he would have lain and got wet through he felt as if nothing mattered as if his living were smeared away into the beyond near and quite lovable this strange gentle reachingout to death was new to him  we must go said miriam  yes he answered but did not move  to him now life seemed a shadow day a white shadow night and death and stillness and inaction this seemed like being to be alive to be urgent and insistentthat was nottobe the highest of all was to melt out into the darkness and sway there identified with the great being  the rain is coming in on us said miriam  he rose and assisted her  it is a pity he said  what  to have to go i feel so still  still she repeated  stiller than i have ever been in my life  he was walking with his hand in hers she pressed his fingers feeling a slight fear now he seemed beyond her she had a fear lest she should lose him  the firtrees are like presences on the darkness each one only a presence  she was afraid and said nothing  a sort of hush the whole night wondering and asleep i suppose thats what we do in deathsleep in wonder  she had been afraid before of the brute in him now of the mystic she trod beside him in silence the rain fell with a heavy hush on the trees at last they gained the cartshed  let us stay here awhile he said  there was a sound of rain everywhere smothering everything  i feel so strange and still he said along with everything  ay she answered patiently  he seemed again unaware of her though he held her hand close  to be rid of our individuality which is our will which is our effortto live effortless a kind of curious sleepthat is very beautiful i think that is our afterlifeour immortality  yes  yesand very beautiful to have  you dont usually say that  no  in a while they went indoors everybody looked at them curiously he still kept the quiet heavy look in his eyes the stillness in his voice instinctively they all left him alone  about this time miriams grandmother who lived in a tiny cottage in woodlinton fell ill and the girl was sent to keep house it was a beautiful little place the cottage had a big garden in front with red brick walls against which the plum trees were nailed at the back another garden was separated from the fields by a tall old hedge it was very pretty miriam had not much to do so she found time for her beloved reading and for writing little introspective pieces which interested her  at the holidaytime her grandmother being better was driven to derby to stay with her daughter for a day or two she was a crotchety old lady and might return the second day or the third so miriam stayed alone in the cottage which also pleased her  paul used often to cycle over and they had as a rule peaceful and happy times he did not embarrass her much but then on the monday of the holiday he was to spend a whole day with her  it was perfect weather he left his mother telling her where he was going she would be alone all the day it cast a shadow over him but he had three days that were all his own when he was going to do as he liked it was sweet to rush through the morning lanes on his bicycle  he got to the cottage at about eleven oclock miriam was busy preparing dinner she looked so perfectly in keeping with the little kitchen ruddy and busy he kissed her and sat down to watch the room was small and cosy the sofa was covered all over with a sort of linen in squares of red and pale blue old much washed but pretty there was a stuffed owl in a case over a corner cupboard the sunlight came through the leaves of the scented geraniums in the window she was cooking a chicken in his honour it was their cottage for the day and they were man and wife he beat the eggs for her and peeled the potatoes he thought she gave a feeling of home almost like his mother and no one could look more beautiful with her tumbled curls when she was flushed from the fire  the dinner was a great success like a young husband he carved they talked all the time with unflagging zest then he wiped the dishes she had washed and they went out down the fields there was a bright little brook that ran into a bog at the foot of a very steep bank here they wandered picking still a few marshmarigolds and many big blue forgetmenots then she sat on the bank with her hands full of flowers mostly golden waterblobs as she put her face down into the marigolds it was all overcast with a yellow shine  your face is bright he said like a transfiguration  she looked at him questioning he laughed pleadingly to her laying his hands on hers then he kissed her fingers then her face  the world was all steeped in sunshine and quite still yet not asleep but quivering with a kind of expectancy  i have never seen anything more beautiful than this he said he held her hand fast all the time  and the water singing to itself as it runsdo you love it she looked at him full of love his eyes were very dark very bright  dont you think its a great day he asked  she murmured her assent she was happy and he saw it  and our dayjust between us he said  they lingered a little while then they stood up upon the sweet thyme and he looked down at her simply  will you come he asked  they went back to the house hand in hand in silence the chickens came scampering down the path to her he locked the door and they had the little house to themselves  he never forgot seeing her as she lay on the bed when he was unfastening his collar first he saw only her beauty and was blind with it she had the most beautiful body he had ever imagined he stood unable to move or speak looking at her his face halfsmiling with wonder and then he wanted her but as he went forward to her her hands lifted in a little pleading movement and he looked at her face and stopped her big brown eyes were watching him still and resigned and loving she lay as if she had given herself up to sacrifice there was her body for him but the look at the back of her eyes like a creature awaiting immolation arrested him and all his blood fell back  you are sure you want me he asked as if a cold shadow had come over him  yes quite sure  she was very quiet very calm she only realised that she was doing something for him he could hardly bear it she lay to be sacrificed for him because she loved him so much and he had to sacrifice her for a second he wished he were sexless or dead then he shut his eyes again to her and his blood beat back again  and afterwards he loved herloved her to the last fibre of his being he loved her but he wanted somehow to cry there was something he could not bear for her sake he stayed with her till quite late at night as he rode home he felt that he was finally initiated he was a youth no longer but why had he the dull pain in his soul why did the thought of death the afterlife seem so sweet and consoling  he spent the week with miriam and wore her out with his passion before it was gone he had always almost wilfully to put her out of count and act from the brute strength of his own feelings and he could not do it often and there remained afterwards always the sense of failure and of death if he were really with her he had to put aside himself and his desire if he would have her he had to put her aside  when i come to you he asked her his eyes dark with pain and shame you dont really want me do you  ah yes she replied quickly  he looked at her  nay he said  she began to tremble  you see she said taking his face and shutting it out against her shoulderyou seeas we arehow can i get used to you it would come all right if we were married  he lifted her head and looked at her  you mean now it is always too much shock  yesand  you are always clenched against me  she was trembling with agitation  you see she said im not used to the thought  you are lately he said  but all my life mother said to me there is one thing in marriage that is always dreadful but you have to bear it and i believed it  and still believe it he said  no she cried hastily i believe as you do that loving even in that way is the highwater mark of living  that doesnt alter the fact that you never want it  no she said taking his head in her arms and rocking in despair dont say so you dont understand she rocked with pain dont i want your children  but not me  how can you say so but we must be married to have children  shall we be married then i want you to have my children  he kissed her hand reverently she pondered sadly watching him  we are too young she said at length  twentyfour and twentythree  not yet she pleaded as she rocked herself in distress  when you will he said  she bowed her head gravely the tone of hopelessness in which he said these things grieved her deeply it had always been a failure between them tacitly she acquiesced in what he felt  and after a week of love he said to his mother suddenly one sunday night just as they were going to bed  i shant go so much to miriams mother  she was surprised but she would not ask him anything  you please yourself she said  so he went to bed but there was a new quietness about him which she had wondered at she almost guessed she would leave him alone however precipitation might spoil things she watched him in his loneliness wondering where he would end he was sick and much too quiet for him there was a perpetual little knitting of his brows such as she had seen when he was a small baby and which had been gone for many years now it was the same again and she could do nothing for him he had to go on alone make his own way  he continued faithful to miriam for one day he had loved her utterly but it never came again the sense of failure grew stronger at first it was only a sadness then he began to feel he could not go on he wanted to run to go abroad anything gradually he ceased to ask her to have him instead of drawing them together it put them apart and then he realised consciously that it was no good it was useless trying it would never be a success between them  for some months he had seen very little of clara they had occasionally walked out for half an hour at dinnertime but he always reserved himself for miriam with clara however his brow cleared and he was gay again she treated him indulgently as if he were a child he thought he did not mind but deep below the surface it piqued him  sometimes miriam said  what about clara i hear nothing of her lately  i walked with her about twenty minutes yesterday he replied  and what did she talk about  i dont know i suppose i did all the jawingi usually do i think i was telling her about the strike and how the women took it  yes  so he gave the account of himself  but insidiously without his knowing it the warmth he felt for clara drew him away from miriam for whom he felt responsible and to whom he felt he belonged he thought he was being quite faithful to her it was not easy to estimate exactly the strength and warmth of ones feelings for a woman till they have run away with one  he began to give more time to his men friends there was jessop at the art school swain who was chemistry demonstrator at the university newton who was a teacher besides edgar and miriams younger brothers pleading work he sketched and studied with jessop he called in the university for swain and the two went down town together having come home in the train with newton he called and had a game of billiards with him in the moon and stars if he gave to miriam the excuse of his men friends he felt quite justified his mother began to be relieved he always told her where he had been  during the summer clara wore sometimes a dress of soft cotton stuff with loose sleeves when she lifted her hands her sleeves fell back and her beautiful strong arms shone out  half a minute he cried hold your arm still  he made sketches of her hand and arm and the drawings contained some of the fascination the real thing had for him miriam who always went scrupulously through his books and papers saw the drawings  i think clara has such beautiful arms he said  yes when did you draw them  on tuesday in the workroom you know ive got a corner where i can work often i can do every single thing they need in the department before dinner then i work for myself in the afternoon and just see to things at night  yes she said turning the leaves of his sketchbook  frequently he hated miriam he hated her as she bent forward and pored over his things he hated her way of patiently casting him up as if he were an endless psychological account when he was with her he hated her for having got him and yet not got him and he tortured her she took all and gave nothing he said at least she gave no living warmth she was never alive and giving off life looking for her was like looking for something which did not exist she was only his conscience not his mate he hated her violently and was more cruel to her they dragged on till the next summer he saw more and more of clara  at last he spoke he had been sitting working at home one evening there was between him and his mother a peculiar condition of people frankly finding fault with each other mrs morel was strong on her feet again he was not going to stick to miriam very well then she would stand aloof till he said something it had been coming a long time this bursting of the storm in him when he would come back to her this evening there was between them a peculiar condition of suspense he worked feverishly and mechanically so that he could escape from himself it grew late through the open door stealthily came the scent of madonna lilies almost as if it were prowling abroad suddenly he got up and went out of doors  the beauty of the night made him want to shout a halfmoon dusky gold was sinking behind the black sycamore at the end of the garden making the sky dull purple with its glow nearer a dim white fence of lilies went across the garden and the air all round seemed to stir with scent as if it were alive he went across the bed of pinks whose keen perfume came sharply across the rocking heavy scent of the lilies and stood alongside the white barrier of flowers they flagged all loose as if they were panting the scent made him drunk he went down to the field to watch the moon sink under  a corncrake in the hayclose called insistently the moon slid quite quickly downwards growing more flushed behind him the great flowers leaned as if they were calling and then like a shock he caught another perfume something raw and coarse hunting round he found the purple iris touched their fleshy throats and their dark grasping hands at any rate he had found something they stood stiff in the darkness their scent was brutal the moon was melting down upon the crest of the hill it was gone all was dark the corncrake called still  breaking off a pink he suddenly went indoors  come my boy said his mother im sure its time you went to bed  he stood with the pink against his lips  i shall break off with miriam mother he answered calmly  she looked up at him over her spectacles he was staring back at her unswerving she met his eyes for a moment then took off her glasses he was white the male was up in him dominant she did not want to see him too clearly  but i thought she began  well he answered i dont love her i dont want to marry herso i shall have done  but exclaimed his mother amazed i thought lately you had made up your mind to have her and so i said nothing  i hadi wanted tobut now i dont want its no good i shall break off on sunday i ought to oughtnt i  you know best you know i said so long ago  i cant help that now i shall break off on sunday  well said his mother i think it will be best but lately i decided you had made up your mind to have her so i said nothing and should have said nothing but i say as i have always said i dont think she is suited to you  on sunday i break off he said smelling the pink he put the flower in his mouth unthinking he bared his teeth closed them on the blossom slowly and had a mouthful of petals these he spat into the fire kissed his mother and went to bed  on sunday he went up to the farm in the early afternoon he had written miriam that they would walk over the fields to hucknall his mother was very tender with him he said nothing but she saw the effort it was costing the peculiar set look on his face stilled her  never mind my son she said you will be so much better when it is all over  paul glanced swiftly at his mother in surprise and resentment he did not want sympathy  miriam met him at the laneend she was wearing a new dress of figured muslin that had short sleeves those short sleeves and miriams brownskinned arms beneath themsuch pitiful resigned armsgave him so much pain that they helped to make him cruel she had made herself look so beautiful and fresh for him she seemed to blossom for him alone every time he looked at hera mature young woman now and beautiful in her new dressit hurt so much that his heart seemed almost to be bursting with the restraint he put on it but he had decided and it was irrevocable  on the hills they sat down and he lay with his head in her lap whilst she fingered his hair she knew that he was not there as she put it often when she had him with her she looked for him and could not find him but this afternoon she was not prepared  it was nearly five oclock when he told her they were sitting on the bank of a stream where the lip of turf hung over a hollow bank of yellow earth and he was hacking away with a stick as he did when he was perturbed and cruel  i have been thinking he said we ought to break off  why she cried in surprise  because its no good going on  why is it no good  it isnt i dont want to marry i dont want ever to marry and if were not going to marry its no good going on  but why do you say this now  because ive made up my mind  and what about these last months and the things you told me then  i cant help it i dont want to go on  you dont want any more of me  i want us to break offyou be free of me i free of you  and what about these last months  i dont know ive not told you anything but what i thought was true  then why are you different now  im notim the sameonly i know its no good going on  you havent told me why its no good  because i dont want to go onand i dont want to marry  how many times have you offered to marry me and i wouldnt  i know but i want us to break off  there was silence for a moment or two while he dug viciously at the earth she bent her head pondering he was an unreasonable child he was like an infant which when it has drunk its fill throws away and smashes the cup she looked at him feeling she could get hold of him and wring some consistency out of him but she was helpless then she cried  i have said you were only fourteenyou are only four  he still dug at the earth viciously he heard  you are a child of four she repeated in her anger  he did not answer but said in his heart all right if im a child of four what do you want me for i dont want another mother but he said nothing to her and there was silence  and have you told your people she asked  i have told my mother  there was another long interval of silence  then what do you want she asked  why i want us to separate we have lived on each other all these years now let us stop i will go my own way without you and you will go your way without me you will have an independent life of your own then  there was in it some truth that in spite of her bitterness she could not help registering she knew she felt in a sort of bondage to him which she hated because she could not control it she hated her love for him from the moment it grew too strong for her and deep down she had hated him because she loved him and he dominated her she had resisted his domination she had fought to keep herself free of him in the last issue and she was free of him even more than he of her  and he continued we shall always be more or less each others work you have done a lot for me i for you now let us start and live by ourselves  what do you want to do she asked  nothingonly to be free he answered  she however knew in her heart that claras influence was over him to liberate him but she said nothing  and what have i to tell my mother she asked  i told my mother he answered that i was breaking offclean and altogether  i shall not tell them at home she said  frowning you please yourself he said  he knew he had landed her in a nasty hole and was leaving her in the lurch it angered him  tell them you wouldnt and wont marry me and have broken off he said its true enough  she bit her finger moodily she thought over their whole affair she had known it would come to this she had seen it all along it chimed with her bitter expectation  alwaysit has always been so she cried it has been one long battle between usyou fighting away from me  it came from her unawares like a flash of lightning the mans heart stood still was this how she saw it  but weve had some perfect hours some perfect times when we were together he pleaded  never she cried never it has always been you fighting me off  not alwaysnot at first he pleaded  always from the very beginningalways the same  she had finished but she had done enough he sat aghast he had wanted to say it has been good but it is at an end and sheshe whose love he had believed in when he had despised himselfdenied that their love had ever been love he had always fought away from her then it had been monstrous there had never been anything really between them all the time he had been imagining something where there was nothing and she had known she had known so much and had told him so little she had known all the time all the time this was at the bottom of her  he sat silent in bitterness at last the whole affair appeared in a cynical aspect to him she had really played with him not he with her she had hidden all her condemnation from him had flattered him and despised him she despised him now he grew intellectual and cruel  you ought to marry a man who worships you he said then you could do as you liked with him plenty of men will worship you if you get on the private side of their natures you ought to marry one such they would never fight you off  thank you she said but dont advise me to marry someone else any more youve done it before  very well he said i will say no more  he sat still feeling as if he had had a blow instead of giving one their eight years of friendship and love the eight years of his life were nullified  when did you think of this she asked  i thought definitely on thursday night  i knew it was coming she said  that pleased him bitterly oh very well if she knew then it doesnt come as a surprise to her he thought  and have you said anything to clara she asked  no but i shall tell her now  there was a silence  do you remember the things you said this time last year in my grandmothers housenay last month even  yes he said i do and i meant them i cant help that its failed  it has failed because you want something else  it would have failed whether or not you never believed in me  she laughed strangely  he sat in silence he was full of a feeling that she had deceived him she had despised him when he thought she worshipped him she had let him say wrong things and had not contradicted him she had let him fight alone but it stuck in his throat that she had despised him whilst he thought she worshipped him she should have told him when she found fault with him she had not played fair he hated her all these years she had treated him as if he were a hero and thought of him secretly as an infant a foolish child then why had she left the foolish child to his folly his heart was hard against her  she sat full of bitterness she had knownoh well she had known all the time he was away from her she had summed him up seen his littleness his meanness and his folly even she had guarded her soul against him she was not overthrown not prostrated not even much hurt she had known only why as he sat there had he still this strange dominance over her his very movements fascinated her as if she were hypnotised by him yet he was despicable false inconsistent and mean why this bondage for her why was it the movement of his arm stirred her as nothing else in the world could why was she fastened to him why even now if he looked at her and commanded her would she have to obey she would obey him in his trifling commands but once he was obeyed then she had him in her power she knew to lead him where she would she was sure of herself only this new influence ah he was not a man he was a baby that cries for the newest toy and all the attachment of his soul would not keep him very well he would have to go but he would come back when he had tired of his new sensation  he hacked at the earth till she was fretted to death she rose he sat flinging lumps of earth in the stream  we will go and have tea here he asked  yes she answered  they chattered over irrelevant subjects during tea he held forth on the love of ornamentthe cottage parlour moved him theretoand its connection with aesthetics she was cold and quiet as they walked home she asked  and we shall not see each other  noor rarely he answered  nor write she asked almost sarcastically  as you will he answered were not strangersnever should be whatever happened i will write to you now and again you please yourself  i see she answered cuttingly  but he was at that stage at which nothing else hurts he had made a great cleavage in his life he had had a great shock when she had told him their love had been always a conflict nothing more mattered if it never had been much there was no need to make a fuss that it was ended  he left her at the laneend as she went home solitary in her new frock having her people to face at the other end he stood still with shame and pain in the highroad thinking of the suffering he caused her  in the reaction towards restoring his selfesteem he went into the willow tree for a drink there were four girls who had been out for the day drinking a modest glass of port they had some chocolates on the table paul sat near with his whisky he noticed the girls whispering and nudging presently one a bonny dark hussy leaned to him and said  have a chocolate  the others laughed loudly at her impudence  all right said paul give me a hard onenut i dont like creams  here you are then said the girl heres an almond for you  she held the sweet between her fingers he opened his mouth she popped it in and blushed  you are nice he said  well she answered we thought you looked overcast and they dared me offer you a chocolate  i dont mind if i have anotheranother sort he said  and presently they were all laughing together  it was nine oclock when he got home falling dark he entered the house in silence his mother who had been waiting rose anxiously  i told her he said  im glad replied the mother with great relief  he hung up his cap wearily  i said wed have done altogether he said  thats right my son said the mother its hard for her now but best in the long run i know you werent suited for her  he laughed shakily as he sat down  ive had such a lark with some girls in a pub he said  his mother looked at him he had forgotten miriam now he told her about the girls in the willow tree mrs morel looked at him it seemed unreal his gaiety at the back of it was too much horror and misery  now have some supper she said very gently  afterwards he said wistfully  she never thought shed have me mother not from the first and so shes not disappointed  im afraid said his mother she doesnt give up hopes of you yet  no he said perhaps not  youll find its better to have done she said  i dont know he said desperately  well leave her alone replied his mother so he left her and she was alone very few people cared for her and she for very few people she remained alone with herself waiting    chapter xii  passion  he was gradually making it possible to earn a livelihood by his art libertys had taken several of his painted designs on various stuffs and he could sell designs for embroideries for altarcloths and similar things in one or two places it was not very much he made at present but he might extend it he had also made friends with the designer for a pottery firm and was gaining some knowledge of his new acquaintances art the applied arts interested him very much at the same time he laboured slowly at his pictures he loved to paint large figures full of light but not merely made up of lights and cast shadows like the impressionists rather definite figures that had a certain luminous quality like some of michael angelos people and these he fitted into a landscape in what he thought true proportion he worked a great deal from memory using everybody he knew he believed firmly in his work that it was good and valuable in spite of fits of depression shrinking everything he believed in his work  he was twentyfour when he said his first confident thing to his mother  mother he said i sll make a painter that theyll attend to  she sniffed in her quaint fashion it was like a halfpleased shrug of the shoulders  very well my boy well see she said  you shall see my pigeon you see if youre not swanky one of these days  im quite content my boy she smiled  but youll have to alter look at you with minnie  minnie was the small servant a girl of fourteen  and what about minnie asked mrs morel with dignity  i heard her this morning eh mrs morel i was going to do that when you went out in the rain for some coal he said that looks a lot like your being able to manage servants  well it was only the childs niceness said mrs morel  and you apologising to her you cant do two things at once can you  she was busy washing up replied mrs morel  and what did she say it could easy have waited a bit now look how your feet paddle  yesbrazen young baggage said mrs morel smiling  he looked at his mother laughing she was quite warm and rosy again with love of him it seemed as if all the sunshine were on her for a moment he continued his work gladly she seemed so well when she was happy that he forgot her grey hair  and that year she went with him to the isle of wight for a holiday it was too exciting for them both and too beautiful mrs morel was full of joy and wonder but he would have her walk with him more than she was able she had a bad fainting bout so grey her face was so blue her mouth it was agony to him he felt as if someone were pushing a knife in his chest then she was better again and he forgot but the anxiety remained inside him like a wound that did not close  after leaving miriam he went almost straight to clara on the monday following the day of the rupture he went down to the workroom she looked up at him and smiled they had grown very intimate unawares she saw a new brightness about him  well queen of sheba he said laughing  but why she asked  i think it suits you youve got a new frock on  she flushed asking  and what of it  suits youawfully i could design you a dress  how would it be  he stood in front of her his eyes glittering as he expounded he kept her eyes fixed with his then suddenly he took hold of her she halfstarted back he drew the stuff of her blouse tighter smoothed it over her breast  more so he explained  but they were both of them flaming with blushes and immediately he ran away he had touched her his whole body was quivering with the sensation  there was already a sort of secret understanding between them the next evening he went to the cinematograph with her for a few minutes before traintime as they sat he saw her hand lying near him for some moments he dared not touch it the pictures danced and dithered then he took her hand in his it was large and firm it filled his grasp he held it fast she neither moved nor made any sign when they came out his train was due he hesitated  goodnight she said he darted away across the road  the next day he came again talking to her she was rather superior with him  shall we go a walk on monday he asked  she turned her face aside  shall you tell miriam she replied sarcastically  i have broken off with her he said  when  last sunday  you quarrelled  no i had made up my mind i told her quite definitely i should consider myself free  clara did not answer and he returned to his work she was so quiet and so superb  on the saturday evening he asked her to come and drink coffee with him in a restaurant meeting him after work was over she came looking very reserved and very distant he had threequarters of an hour to traintime  we will walk a little while he said  she agreed and they went past the castle into the park he was afraid of her she walked moodily at his side with a kind of resentful reluctant angry walk he was afraid to take her hand  which way shall we go he asked as they walked in darkness  i dont mind  then well go up the steps  he suddenly turned round they had passed the park steps she stood still in resentment at his suddenly abandoning her he looked for her she stood aloof he caught her suddenly in his arms held her strained for a moment kissed her then he let her go  come along he said penitent  she followed him he took her hand and kissed her fingertips they went in silence when they came to the light he let go her hand neither spoke till they reached the station then they looked each other in the eyes  goodnight she said  and he went for his train his body acted mechanically people talked to him he heard faint echoes answering them he was in a delirium he felt that he would go mad if monday did not come at once on monday he would see her again all himself was pitched there ahead sunday intervened he could not bear it he could not see her till monday and sunday intervenedhour after hour of tension he wanted to beat his head against the door of the carriage but he sat still he drank some whisky on the way home but it only made it worse his mother must not be upset that was all he dissembled and got quickly to bed there he sat dressed with his chin on his knees staring out of the window at the far hill with its few lights he neither thought nor slept but sat perfectly still staring and when at last he was so cold that he came to himself he found his watch had stopped at halfpast two it was after three oclock he was exhausted but still there was the torment of knowing it was only sunday morning he went to bed and slept then he cycled all day long till he was fagged out and he scarcely knew where he had been but the day after was monday he slept till four oclock then he lay and thought he was coming nearer to himselfhe could see himself real somewhere in front she would go a walk with him in the afternoon afternoon it seemed years ahead  slowly the hours crawled his father got up he heard him pottering about then the miner set off to the pit his heavy boots scraping the yard cocks were still crowing a cart went down the road his mother got up she knocked the fire presently she called him softly he answered as if he were asleep this shell of himself did well  he was walking to the stationanother mile the train was near nottingham would it stop before the tunnels but it did not matter it would get there before dinnertime he was at jordans she would come in half an hour at any rate she would be near he had done the letters she would be there perhaps she had not come he ran downstairs ah he saw her through the glass door her shoulders stooping a little to her work made him feel he could not go forward he could not stand he went in he was pale nervous awkward and quite cold would she misunderstand him he could not write his real self with this shell  and this afternoon he struggled to say you will come  i think so she replied murmuring  he stood before her unable to say a word she hid her face from him again came over him the feeling that he would lose consciousness he set his teeth and went upstairs he had done everything correctly yet and he would do so all the morning things seemed a long way off as they do to a man under chloroform he himself seemed under a tight band of constraint then there was his other self in the distance doing things entering stuff in a ledger and he watched that faroff him carefully to see he made no mistake  but the ache and strain of it could not go on much longer he worked incessantly still it was only twelve oclock as if he had nailed his clothing against the desk he stood there and worked forcing every stroke out of himself it was a quarter to one he could clear away then he ran downstairs  you will meet me at the fountain at two oclock he said  i cant be there till halfpast  yes he said  she saw his dark mad eyes  i will try at a quarter past  and he had to be content he went and got some dinner all the time he was still under chloroform and every minute was stretched out indefinitely he walked miles of streets then he thought he would be late at the meetingplace he was at the fountain at five past two the torture of the next quarter of an hour was refined beyond expression it was the anguish of combining the living self with the shell then he saw her she came and he was there  you are late he said  only five minutes she answered  id never have done it to you he laughed  she was in a dark blue costume he looked at her beautiful figure  you want some flowers he said going to the nearest florists  she followed him in silence he bought her a bunch of scarlet brickred carnations she put them in her coat flushing  thats a fine colour he said  id rather have had something softer she said  he laughed  do you feel like a blot of vermilion walking down the street he said  she hung her head afraid of the people they met he looked sideways at her as they walked there was a wonderful close down on her face near the ear that he wanted to touch and a certain heaviness the heaviness of a very full ear of corn that dips slightly in the wind that there was about her made his brain spin he seemed to be spinning down the street everything going round  as they sat in the tramcar she leaned her heavy shoulder against him and he took her hand he felt himself coming round from the anaesthetic beginning to breathe her ear halfhidden among her blonde hair was near to him the temptation to kiss it was almost too great but there were other people on top of the car it still remained to him to kiss it after all he was not himself he was some attribute of hers like the sunshine that fell on her  he looked quickly away it had been raining the big bluff of the castle rock was streaked with rain as it reared above the flat of the town they crossed the wide black space of the midland railway and passed the cattle enclosure that stood out white then they ran down sordid wilford road  she rocked slightly to the trams motion and as she leaned against him rocked upon him he was a vigorous slender man with exhaustless energy his face was rough with roughhewn features like the common peoples but his eyes under the deep brows were so full of life that they fascinated her they seemed to dance and yet they were still trembling on the finest balance of laughter his mouth the same was just going to spring into a laugh of triumph yet did not there was a sharp suspense about him she bit her lip moodily his hand was hard clenched over hers  they paid their two halfpennies at the turnstile and crossed the bridge the trent was very full it swept silent and insidious under the bridge travelling in a soft body there had been a great deal of rain on the river levels were flat gleams of flood water the sky was grey with glisten of silver here and there in wilford churchyard the dahlias were sodden with rainwet blackcrimson balls no one was on the path that went along the green river meadow along the elmtree colonnade  there was the faintest haze over the silverydark water and the green meadowbank and the elmtrees that were spangled with gold the river slid by in a body utterly silent and swift intertwining among itself like some subtle complex creature clara walked moodily beside him  why she asked at length in rather a jarring tone did you leave miriam  he frowned  because i wanted to leave her he said  why  because i didnt want to go on with her and i didnt want to marry  she was silent for a moment they picked their way down the muddy path drops of water fell from the elmtrees  you didnt want to marry miriam or you didnt want to marry at all she asked  both he answeredboth  they had to manoeuvre to get to the stile because of the pools of water  and what did she say clara asked  miriam she said i was a baby of four and that i always had battled her off  clara pondered over this for a time  but you have really been going with her for some time she asked  yes  and now you dont want any more of her  no i know its no good  she pondered again  dont you think youve treated her rather badly she asked  yes i ought to have dropped it years back but it would have been no good going on two wrongs dont make a right  how old are you clara asked  twentyfive  and i am thirty she said  i know you are  i shall be thirtyoneor am i thirtyone  i neither know nor care what does it matter  they were at the entrance to the grove the wet red track already sticky with fallen leaves went up the steep bank between the grass on either side stood the elmtrees like pillars along a great aisle arching over and making high up a roof from which the dead leaves fell all was empty and silent and wet she stood on top of the stile and he held both her hands laughing she looked down into his eyes then she leaped her breast came against his he held her and covered her face with kisses  they went on up the slippery steep red path presently she released his hand and put it round her waist  you press the vein in my arm holding it so tightly she said  they walked along his fingertips felt the rocking of her breast all was silent and deserted on the left the red wet ploughland showed through the doorways between the elmboles and their branches on the right looking down they could see the treetops of elms growing far beneath them hear occasionally the gurgle of the river sometimes there below they caught glimpses of the full softsliding trent and of watermeadows dotted with small cattle  it has scarcely altered since little kirke white used to come he said  but he was watching her throat below the ear where the flush was fusing into the honeywhite and her mouth that pouted disconsolate she stirred against him as she walked and his body was like a taut string  halfway up the big colonnade of elms where the grove rose highest above the river their forward movement faltered to an end he led her across to the grass under the trees at the edge of the path the cliff of red earth sloped swiftly down through trees and bushes to the river that glimmered and was dark between the foliage the farbelow watermeadows were very green he and she stood leaning against one another silent afraid their bodies touching all along there came a quick gurgle from the river below  why he asked at length did you hate baxter dawes  she turned to him with a splendid movement her mouth was offered him and her throat her eyes were halfshut her breast was tilted as if it asked for him he flashed with a small laugh shut his eyes and met her in a long whole kiss her mouth fused with his their bodies were sealed and annealed it was some minutes before they withdrew they were standing beside the public path  will you go down to the river he asked  she looked at him leaving herself in his hands he went over the brim of the declivity and began to climb down  it is slippery he said  never mind she replied  the red clay went down almost sheer he slid went from one tuft of grass to the next hanging on to the bushes making for a little platform at the foot of a tree there he waited for her laughing with excitement her shoes were clogged with red earth it was hard for her he frowned at last he caught her hand and she stood beside him the cliff rose above them and fell away below her colour was up her eyes flashed he looked at the big drop below them  its risky he said or messy at any rate shall we go back  not for my sake she said quickly  all right you see i cant help you i should only hinder give me that little parcel and your gloves your poor shoes  they stood perched on the face of the declivity under the trees  well ill go again he said  away he went slipping staggering sliding to the next tree into which he fell with a slam that nearly shook the breath out of him she came after cautiously hanging on to the twigs and grasses so they descended stage by stage to the rivers brink there to his disgust the flood had eaten away the path and the red decline ran straight into the water he dug in his heels and brought himself up violently the string of the parcel broke with a snap the brown parcel bounded down leaped into the water and sailed smoothly away he hung on to his tree  well ill be damned he cried crossly then he laughed she was coming perilously down  mind he warned her he stood with his back to the tree waiting come now he called opening his arms  she let herself run he caught her and together they stood watching the dark water scoop at the raw edge of the bank the parcel had sailed out of sight  it doesnt matter she said  he held her close and kissed her there was only room for their four feet  its a swindle he said but theres a rut where a man has been so if we go on i guess we shall find the path again  the river slid and twined its great volume on the other bank cattle were feeding on the desolate flats the cliff rose high above paul and clara on their right hand they stood against the tree in the watery silence  let us try going forward he said and they struggled in the red clay along the groove a mans nailed boots had made they were hot and flushed their barkled shoes hung heavy on their steps at last they found the broken path it was littered with rubble from the water but at any rate it was easier they cleaned their boots with twigs his heart was beating thick and fast  suddenly coming on to the little level he saw two figures of men standing silent at the waters edge his heart leaped they were fishing he turned and put his hand up warningly to clara she hesitated buttoned her coat the two went on together  the fishermen turned curiously to watch the two intruders on their privacy and solitude they had had a fire but it was nearly out all kept perfectly still the men turned again to their fishing stood over the grey glinting river like statues clara went with bowed head flushing he was laughing to himself directly they passed out of sight behind the willows  now they ought to be drowned said paul softly  clara did not answer they toiled forward along a tiny path on the rivers lip suddenly it vanished the bank was sheer red solid clay in front of them sloping straight into the river he stood and cursed beneath his breath setting his teeth  its impossible said clara  he stood erect looking round just ahead were two islets in the stream covered with osiers but they were unattainable the cliff came down like a sloping wall from far above their heads behind not far back were the fishermen across the river the distant cattle fed silently in the desolate afternoon he cursed again deeply under his breath he gazed up the great steep bank was there no hope but to scale back to the public path  stop a minute he said and digging his heels sideways into the steep bank of red clay he began nimbly to mount he looked across at every treefoot at last he found what he wanted two beechtrees side by side on the hill held a little level on the upper face between their roots it was littered with damp leaves but it would do the fishermen were perhaps sufficiently out of sight he threw down his rainproof and waved to her to come  she toiled to his side arriving there she looked at him heavily dumbly and laid her head on his shoulder he held her fast as he looked round they were safe enough from all but the small lonely cows over the river he sunk his mouth on her throat where he felt her heavy pulse beat under his lips everything was perfectly still there was nothing in the afternoon but themselves  when she arose he looking on the ground all the time saw suddenly sprinkled on the black wet beechroots many scarlet carnation petals like splashed drops of blood and red small splashes fell from her bosom streaming down her dress to her feet  your flowers are smashed he said  she looked at him heavily as she put back her hair suddenly he put his fingertips on her cheek  why dost look so heavy he reproached her  she smiled sadly as if she felt alone in herself he caressed her cheek with his fingers and kissed her  nay he said never thee bother  she gripped his fingers tight and laughed shakily then she dropped her hand he put the hair back from her brows stroking her temples kissing them lightly  but tha shouldna worrit he said softly pleading  no i dont worry she laughed tenderly and resigned  yea tha does dunna thee worrit he implored caressing  no she consoled him kissing him  they had a stiff climb to get to the top again it took them a quarter of an hour when he got on to the level grass he threw off his cap wiped the sweat from his forehead and sighed  now were back at the ordinary level he said  she sat down panting on the tussocky grass her cheeks were flushed pink he kissed her and she gave way to joy  and now ill clean thy boots and make thee fit for respectable folk he said  he kneeled at her feet worked away with a stick and tufts of grass she put her fingers in his hair drew his head to her and kissed it  what am i supposed to be doing he said looking at her laughing cleaning shoes or dibbling with love answer me that  just whichever i please she replied  im your bootboy for the time being and nothing else but they remained looking into each others eyes and laughing then they kissed with little nibbling kisses  tttt he went with his tongue like his mother i tell you nothing gets done when theres a woman about  and he returned to his bootcleaning singing softly she touched his thick hair and he kissed her fingers he worked away at her shoes at last they were quite presentable  there you are you see he said arent i a great hand at restoring you to respectability stand up there you look as irreproachable as britannia herself  he cleaned his own boots a little washed his hands in a puddle and sang they went on into clifton village he was madly in love with her every movement she made every crease in her garments sent a hot flash through him and seemed adorable  the old lady at whose house they had tea was roused into gaiety by them  i could wish youd had something of a better day she said hovering round  nay he laughed weve been saying how nice it is  the old lady looked at him curiously there was a peculiar glow and charm about him his eyes were dark and laughing he rubbed his moustache with a glad movement  have you been saying so she exclaimed a light rousing in her old eyes  truly he laughed  then im sure the days good enough said the old lady  she fussed about and did not want to leave them  i dont know whether youd like some radishes as well she said to clara but ive got some in the gardenand a cucumber  clara flushed she looked very handsome  i should like some radishes she answered  and the old lady pottered off gleefully  if she knew said clara quietly to him  well she doesnt know and it shows were nice in ourselves at any rate you look quite enough to satisfy an archangel and im sure i feel harmlesssoif it makes you look nice and makes folk happy when they have us and makes us happywhy were not cheating them out of much  they went on with the meal when they were going away the old lady came timidly with three tiny dahlias in full blow neat as bees and speckled scarlet and white she stood before clara pleased with herself saying  i dont know whether and holding the flowers forward in her old hand  oh how pretty cried clara accepting the flowers  shall she have them all asked paul reproachfully of the old woman  yes she shall have them all she replied beaming with joy you have got enough for your share  ah but i shall ask her to give me one he teased  then she does as she pleases said the old lady smiling and she bobbed a little curtsey of delight  clara was rather quiet and uncomfortable as they walked along he said  you dont feel criminal do you  she looked at him with startled grey eyes  criminal she said no  but you seem to feel you have done a wrong  no she said i only think if they knew  if they knew theyd cease to understand as it is they do understand and they like it what do they matter here with only the trees and me you dont feel not the least bit wrong do you  he took her by the arm held her facing him holding her eyes with his something fretted him  not sinners are we he said with an uneasy little frown  no she replied  he kissed her laughing  you like your little bit of guiltiness i believe he said i believe eve enjoyed it when she went cowering out of paradise  but there was a certain glow and quietness about her that made him glad when he was alone in the railwaycarriage he found himself tumultuously happy and the people exceedingly nice and the night lovely and everything good  mrs morel was sitting reading when he got home her health was not good now and there had come that ivory pallor into her face which he never noticed and which afterwards he never forgot she did not mention her own illhealth to him after all she thought it was not much  you are late she said looking at him  his eyes were shining his face seemed to glow he smiled to her  yes ive been down clifton grove with clara  his mother looked at him again  but wont people talk she said  why they know shes a suffragette and so on and what if they do talk  of course there may be nothing wrong in it said his mother but you know what folks are and if once she gets talked about  well i cant help it their jaw isnt so almighty important after all  i think you ought to consider her  so i do what can people saythat we take a walk together i believe youre jealous  you know i should be glad if she werent a married woman  well my dear she lives separate from her husband and talks on platforms so shes already singled out from the sheep and as far as i can see hasnt much to lose no her lifes nothing to her so whats the worth of nothing she goes with meit becomes something then she must paywe both must pay folk are so frightened of paying theyd rather starve and die  very well my son well see how it will end  very well my mother ill abide by the end  well see  and shesshes awfully nice mother she is really you dont know  thats not the same as marrying her  its perhaps better  there was silence for a while he wanted to ask his mother something but was afraid  should you like to know her he hesitated  yes said mrs morel coolly i should like to know what shes like  but shes nice mother she is and not a bit common  i never suggested she was  but you seem to think shesnot as good asshes better than ninetynine folk out of a hundred i tell you shes better she is shes fair shes honest shes straight there isnt anything underhand or superior about her dont be mean about her  mrs morel flushed  i am sure i am not mean about her she may be quite as you say but  you dont approve he finished  and do you expect me to she answered coldly  yesyesif youd anything about you youd be glad do you want to see her  i said i did  then ill bring hershall i bring her here  you please yourself  then i will bring her hereone sundayto tea if you think a horrid thing about her i shant forgive you  his mother laughed  as if it would make any difference she said he knew he had won  oh but it feels so fine when shes there shes such a queen in her way  occasionally he still walked a little way from chapel with miriam and edgar he did not go up to the farm she however was very much the same with him and he did not feel embarrassed in her presence one evening she was alone when he accompanied her they began by talking books it was their unfailing topic mrs morel had said that his and miriams affair was like a fire fed on booksif there were no more volumes it would die out miriam for her part boasted that she could read him like a book could place her finger any minute on the chapter and the line he easily taken in believed that miriam knew more about him than anyone else so it pleased him to talk to her about himself like the simplest egoist very soon the conversation drifted to his own doings it flattered him immensely that he was of such supreme interest  and what have you been doing lately  ioh not much i made a sketch of bestwood from the garden that is nearly right at last its the hundredth try  so they went on then she said  youve not been out then lately  yes i went up clifton grove on monday afternoon with clara  it was not very nice weather said miriam was it  but i wanted to go out and it was all right the trent is full  and did you go to barton she asked  no we had tea in clifton  did you that would be nice  it was the jolliest old woman she gave us several pompom dahlias as pretty as you like  miriam bowed her head and brooded he was quite unconscious of concealing anything from her  what made her give them you she asked  he laughed  because she liked usbecause we were jolly i should think  miriam put her finger in her mouth  were you late home she asked  at last he resented her tone  i caught the seventhirty  ha  they walked on in silence and he was angry  and how is clara asked miriam  quite all right i think  thats good she said with a tinge of irony by the way what of her husband one never hears anything of him  hes got some other woman and is also quite all right he replied at least so i think  i seeyou dont know for certain dont you think a position like that is hard on a woman  rottenly hard  its so unjust said miriam the man does as he likes  then let the woman also he said  how can she and if she does look at her position  what of it  why its impossible you dont understand what a woman forfeits  no i dont but if a womans got nothing but her fair fame to feed on why its thin tack and a donkey would die of it  so she understood his moral attitude at least and she knew he would act accordingly  she never asked him anything direct but she got to know enough  another day when he saw miriam the conversation turned to marriage then to claras marriage with dawes  you see he said she never knew the fearful importance of marriage she thought it was all in the days marchit would have to comeand daweswell a good many women would have given their souls to get him so why not him then she developed into the femme incomprise and treated him badly ill bet my boots  and she left him because he didnt understand her  i suppose so i suppose she had to it isnt altogether a question of understanding its a question of living with him she was only halfalive the rest was dormant deadened and the dormant woman was the femme incomprise and she had to be awakened  and what about him  i dont know i rather think he loves her as much as he can but hes a fool  it was something like your mother and father said miriam  yes but my mother i believe got real joy and satisfaction out of my father at first i believe she had a passion for him thats why she stayed with him after all they were bound to each other  yes said miriam  thats what one must have i think he continuedthe real real flame of feeling through another persononce only once if it only lasts three months see my mother looks as if shed had everything that was necessary for her living and developing theres not a tiny bit of feeling of sterility about her  no said miriam  and with my father at first im sure she had the real thing she knows she has been there you can feel it about her and about him and about hundreds of people you meet every day and once it has happened to you you can go on with anything and ripen  what happened exactly asked miriam  its so hard to say but the something big and intense that changes you when you really come together with somebody else it almost seems to fertilise your soul and make it that you can go on and mature  and you think your mother had it with your father  yes and at the bottom she feels grateful to him for giving it her even now though they are miles apart  and you think clara never had it  im sure  miriam pondered this she saw what he was seekinga sort of baptism of fire in passion it seemed to her she realised that he would never be satisfied till he had it perhaps it was essential to him as to some men to sow wild oats and afterwards when he was satisfied he would not rage with restlessness any more but could settle down and give her his life into her hands well then if he must go let him go and have his fillsomething big and intense he called it at any rate when he had got it he would not want itthat he said himself he would want the other thing that she could give him he would want to be owned so that he could work it seemed to her a bitter thing that he must go but she could let him go into an inn for a glass of whisky so she could let him go to clara so long as it was something that would satisfy a need in him and leave him free for herself to possess  have you told your mother about clara she asked  she knew this would be a test of the seriousness of his feeling for the other woman she knew he was going to clara for something vital not as a man goes for pleasure to a prostitute if he told his mother  yes he said and she is coming to tea on sunday  to your house  yes i want mater to see her  ah  there was a silence things had gone quicker than she thought she felt a sudden bitterness that he could leave her so soon and so entirely and was clara to be accepted by his people who had been so hostile to herself  i may call in as i go to chapel she said it is a long time since i saw clara  very well he said astonished and unconsciously angry  on the sunday afternoon he went to keston to meet clara at the station as he stood on the platform he was trying to examine in himself if he had a premonition  do i feel as if shed come he said to himself and he tried to find out his heart felt queer and contracted that seemed like foreboding then he had a foreboding she would not come then she would not come and instead of taking her over the fields home as he had imagined he would have to go alone the train was late the afternoon would be wasted and the evening he hated her for not coming why had she promised then if she could not keep her promise perhaps she had missed her trainhe himself was always missing trainsbut that was no reason why she should miss this particular one he was angry with her he was furious  suddenly he saw the train crawling sneaking round the corner here then was the train but of course she had not come the green engine hissed along the platform the row of brown carriages drew up several doors opened no she had not come no yes ah there she was she had a big black hat on he was at her side in a moment  i thought you werent coming he said  she was laughing rather breathlessly as she put out her hand to him their eyes met he took her quickly along the platform talking at a great rate to hide his feeling she looked beautiful in her hat were large silk roses coloured like tarnished gold her costume of dark cloth fitted so beautifully over her breast and shoulders his pride went up as he walked with her he felt the station people who knew him eyed her with awe and admiration  i was sure you werent coming he laughed shakily  she laughed in answer almost with a little cry  and i wondered when i was in the train whatever i should do if you werent there she said  he caught her hand impulsively and they went along the narrow twitchel they took the road into nuttall and over the reckoning house farm it was a blue mild day everywhere the brown leaves lay scattered many scarlet hips stood upon the hedge beside the wood he gathered a few for her to wear  though really he said as he fitted them into the breast of her coat you ought to object to my getting them because of the birds but they dont care much for rosehips in this part where they can get plenty of stuff you often find the berries going rotten in the springtime  so he chattered scarcely aware of what he said only knowing he was putting berries in the bosom of her coat while she stood patiently for him and she watched his quick hands so full of life and it seemed to her she had never seen anything before till now everything had been indistinct  they came near to the colliery it stood quite still and black among the cornfields its immense heap of slag seen rising almost from the oats  what a pity there is a coalpit here where it is so pretty said clara  do you think so he answered you see i am so used to it i should miss it no and i like the pits here and there i like the rows of trucks and the headstocks and the steam in the daytime and the lights at night when i was a boy i always thought a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night was a pit with its steam and its lights and the burning bankand i thought the lord was always at the pittop  as they drew near home she walked in silence and seemed to hang back he pressed her fingers in his own she flushed but gave no response  dont you want to come home he asked  yes i want to come she replied  it did not occur to him that her position in his home would be rather a peculiar and difficult one to him it seemed just as if one of his men friends were going to be introduced to his mother only nicer  the morels lived in a house in an ugly street that ran down a steep hill the street itself was hideous the house was rather superior to most it was old grimy with a big bay window and it was semidetached but it looked gloomy then paul opened the door to the garden and all was different the sunny afternoon was there like another land by the path grew tansy and little trees in front of the window was a plot of sunny grass with old lilacs round it and away went the garden with heaps of dishevelled chrysanthemums in the sunshine down to the sycamoretree and the field and beyond one looked over a few redroofed cottages to the hills with all the glow of the autumn afternoon  mrs morel sat in her rockingchair wearing her black silk blouse her greybrown hair was taken smooth back from her brow and her high temples her face was rather pale clara suffering followed paul into the kitchen mrs morel rose clara thought her a lady even rather stiff the young woman was very nervous she had almost a wistful look almost resigned  motherclara said paul  mrs morel held out her hand and smiled  he has told me a good deal about you she said  the blood flamed in claras cheek  i hope you dont mind my coming she faltered  i was pleased when he said he would bring you replied mrs morel  paul watching felt his heart contract with pain his mother looked so small and sallow and donefor beside the luxuriant clara  its such a pretty day mother he said and we saw a jay  his mother looked at him he had turned to her she thought what a man he seemed in his dark wellmade clothes he was pale and detachedlooking it would be hard for any woman to keep him her heart glowed then she was sorry for clara  perhaps youll leave your things in the parlour said mrs morel nicely to the young woman  oh thank you she replied  come on said paul and he led the way into the little front room with its old piano its mahogany furniture its yellowing marble mantelpiece a fire was burning the place was littered with books and drawingboards i leave my things lying about he said its so much easier  she loved his artists paraphernalia and the books and the photos of people soon he was telling her this was william this was williams young lady in the evening dress this was annie and her husband this was arthur and his wife and the baby she felt as if she were being taken into the family he showed her photos books sketches and they talked a little while then they returned to the kitchen mrs morel put aside her book clara wore a blouse of fine silk chiffon with narrow blackandwhite stripes her hair was done simply coiled on top of her head she looked rather stately and reserved  you have gone to live down sneinton boulevard said mrs morel when i was a girlgirl i saywhen i was a young woman we lived in minerva terrace  oh did you said clara i have a friend in number 6  and the conversation had started they talked nottingham and nottingham people it interested them both clara was still rather nervous mrs morel was still somewhat on her dignity she clipped her language very clear and precise but they were going to get on well together paul saw  mrs morel measured herself against the younger woman and found herself easily stronger clara was deferential she knew pauls surprising regard for his mother and she had dreaded the meeting expecting someone rather hard and cold she was surprised to find this little interested woman chatting with such readiness and then she felt as she felt with paul that she would not care to stand in mrs morels way there was something so hard and certain in his mother as if she never had a misgiving in her life  presently morel came down ruffled and yawning from his afternoon sleep he scratched his grizzled head he plodded in his stocking feet his waistcoat hung open over his shirt he seemed incongruous  this is mrs dawes father said paul  then morel pulled himself together clara saw pauls manner of bowing and shaking hands  oh indeed exclaimed morel i am very glad to see youi am i assure you but dont disturb yourself no no make yourself quite comfortable and be very welcome  clara was astonished at this flood of hospitality from the old collier he was so courteous so gallant she thought him most delightful  and may you have come far he asked  only from nottingham she said  from nottingham then you have had a beautiful day for your journey  then he strayed into the scullery to wash his hands and face and from force of habit came on to the hearth with the towel to dry himself  at tea clara felt the refinement and sangfroid of the household mrs morel was perfectly at her ease the pouring out the tea and attending to the people went on unconsciously without interrupting her in her talk there was a lot of room at the oval table the china of dark blue willowpattern looked pretty on the glossy cloth there was a little bowl of small yellow chrysanthemums clara felt she completed the circle and it was a pleasure to her but she was rather afraid of the selfpossession of the morels father and all she took their tone there was a feeling of balance it was a cool clear atmosphere where everyone was himself and in harmony clara enjoyed it but there was a fear deep at the bottom of her  paul cleared the table whilst his mother and clara talked clara was conscious of his quick vigorous body as it came and went seeming blown quickly by a wind at its work it was almost like the hither and thither of a leaf that comes unexpected most of herself went with him by the way she leaned forward as if listening mrs morel could see she was possessed elsewhere as she talked and again the elder woman was sorry for her  having finished he strolled down the garden leaving the two women to talk it was a hazy sunny afternoon mild and soft clara glanced through the window after him as he loitered among the chrysanthemums she felt as if something almost tangible fastened her to him yet he seemed so easy in his graceful indolent movement so detached as he tied up the tooheavy flower branches to their stakes that she wanted to shriek in her helplessness  mrs morel rose  you will let me help you wash up said clara  eh there are so few it will only take a minute said the other  clara however dried the teathings and was glad to be on such good terms with his mother but it was torture not to be able to follow him down the garden at last she allowed herself to go she felt as if a rope were taken off her ankle  the afternoon was golden over the hills of derbyshire he stood across in the other garden beside a bush of pale michaelmas daisies watching the last bees crawl into the hive hearing her coming he turned to her with an easy motion saying  its the end of the run with these chaps  clara stood near him over the low red wall in front was the country and the faroff hills all golden dim  at that moment miriam was entering through the gardendoor she saw clara go up to him saw him turn and saw them come to rest together something in their perfect isolation together made her know that it was accomplished between them that they were as she put it married she walked very slowly down the cindertrack of the long garden  clara had pulled a button from a hollyhock spire and was breaking it to get the seeds above her bowed head the pink flowers stared as if defending her the last bees were falling down to the hive  count your money laughed paul as she broke the flat seeds one by one from the roll of coin she looked at him  im well off she said smiling  how much pf he snapped his fingers can i turn them into gold  im afraid not she laughed  they looked into each others eyes laughing at that moment they became aware of miriam there was a click and everything had altered  hello miriam he exclaimed you said youd come  yes had you forgotten  she shook hands with clara saying  it seems strange to see you here  yes replied the other it seems strange to be here  there was a hesitation  this is pretty isnt it said miriam  i like it very much replied clara  then miriam realised that clara was accepted as she had never been  have you come down alone asked paul  yes i went to agathas to tea we are going to chapel i only called in for a moment to see clara  you should have come in here to tea he said  miriam laughed shortly and clara turned impatiently aside  do you like the chrysanthemums he asked  yes they are very fine replied miriam  which sort do you like best he asked  i dont know the bronze i think  i dont think youve seen all the sorts come and look come and see which are your favourites clara  he led the two women back to his own garden where the towsled bushes of flowers of all colours stood raggedly along the path down to the field the situation did not embarrass him to his knowledge  look miriam these are the white ones that came from your garden they arent so fine here are they  no said miriam  but theyre hardier youre so sheltered things grow big and tender and then die these little yellow ones i like will you have some  while they were out there the bells began to ring in the church sounding loud across the town and the field miriam looked at the tower proud among the clustering roofs and remembered the sketches he had brought her it had been different then but he had not left her even yet she asked him for a book to read he ran indoors  what is that miriam asked his mother coldly  yes she said shed call and see clara  you told her then came the sarcastic answer  yes why shouldnt i  theres certainly no reason why you shouldnt said mrs morel and she returned to her book he winced from his mothers irony frowned irritably thinking why cant i do as i like  youve not seen mrs morel before miriam was saying to clara  no but shes so nice  yes said miriam dropping her head in some ways shes very fine  i should think so  had paul told you much about her  he had talked a good deal  ha  there was silence until he returned with the book  when will you want it back miriam asked  when you like he answered  clara turned to go indoors whilst he accompanied miriam to the gate  when will you come up to willey farm the latter asked  i couldnt say replied clara  mother asked me to say shed be pleased to see you any time if you cared to come  thank you i should like to but i cant say when  oh very well exclaimed miriam rather bitterly turning away  she went down the path with her mouth to the flowers he had given her  youre sure you wont come in he said  no thanks  we are going to chapel  ah i shall see you then miriam was very bitter  yes  they parted he felt guilty towards her she was bitter and she scorned him he still belonged to herself she believed yet he could have clara take her home sit with her next his mother in chapel give her the same hymnbook he had given herself years before she heard him running quickly indoors  but he did not go straight in halting on the plot of grass he heard his mothers voice then claras answer  what i hate is the bloodhound quality in miriam  yes said his mother quickly yes doesnt it make you hate her now  his heart went hot and he was angry with them for talking about the girl what right had they to say that something in the speech itself stung him into a flame of hate against miriam then his own heart rebelled furiously at claras taking the liberty of speaking so about miriam after all the girl was the better woman of the two he thought if it came to goodness he went indoors his mother looked excited she was beating with her hand rhythmically on the sofaarm as women do who are wearing out he could never bear to see the movement there was a silence then he began to talk  in chapel miriam saw him find the place in the hymnbook for clara in exactly the same way as he used for herself and during the sermon he could see the girl across the chapel her hat throwing a dark shadow over her face what did she think seeing clara with him he did not stop to consider he felt himself cruel towards miriam  after chapel he went over pentrich with clara it was a dark autumn night they had said goodbye to miriam and his heart had smitten him as he left the girl alone but it serves her right he said inside himself and it almost gave him pleasure to go off under her eyes with this other handsome woman  there was a scent of damp leaves in the darkness claras hand lay warm and inert in his own as they walked he was full of conflict the battle that raged inside him made him feel desperate  up pentrich hill clara leaned against him as he went he slid his arm round her waist feeling the strong motion of her body under his arm as she walked the tightness in his chest because of miriam relaxed and the hot blood bathed him he held her closer and closer  then you still keep on with miriam she said quietly  only talk there never was a great deal more than talk between us he said bitterly  your mother doesnt care for her said clara  no or i might have married her but its all up really  suddenly his voice went passionate with hate  if i was with her now we should be jawing about the christian mystery or some such tack thank god im not  they walked on in silence for some time  but you cant really give her up said clara  i dont give her up because theres nothing to give he said  there is for her  i dont know why she and i shouldnt be friends as long as we live he said but itll only be friends  clara drew away from him leaning away from contact with him  what are you drawing away for he asked  she did not answer but drew farther from him  why do you want to walk alone he asked  still there was no answer she walked resentfully hanging her head  because i said i would be friends with miriam he exclaimed  she would not answer him anything  i tell you its only words that go between us he persisted trying to take her again  she resisted suddenly he strode across in front of her barring her way  damn it he said what do you want now  youd better run after miriam mocked clara  the blood flamed up in him he stood showing his teeth she drooped sulkily the lane was dark quite lonely he suddenly caught her in his arms stretched forward and put his mouth on her face in a kiss of rage she turned frantically to avoid him he held her fast hard and relentless his mouth came for her her breasts hurt against the wall of his chest helpless she went loose in his arms and he kissed her and kissed her  he heard people coming down the hill  stand up stand up he said thickly gripping her arm till it hurt if he had let go she would have sunk to the ground  she sighed and walked dizzily beside him they went on in silence  we will go over the fields he said and then she woke up  but she let herself be helped over the stile and she walked in silence with him over the first dark field it was the way to nottingham and to the station she knew he seemed to be looking about they came out on a bare hilltop where stood the dark figure of the ruined windmill there he halted they stood together high up in the darkness looking at the lights scattered on the night before them handfuls of glittering points villages lying high and low on the dark here and there  like treading among the stars he said with a quaky laugh  then he took her in his arms and held her fast she moved aside her mouth to ask dogged and low  what time is it  it doesnt matter he pleaded thickly  yes it doesyes i must go  its early yet he said  what time is it she insisted  all round lay the black night speckled and spangled with lights  i dont know  she put her hand on his chest feeling for his watch he felt the joints fuse into fire she groped in his waistcoat pocket while he stood panting in the darkness she could see the round pale face of the watch but not the figures she stooped over it he was panting till he could take her in his arms again  i cant see she said  then dont bother  yes im going she said turning away  wait ill look but he could not see ill strike a match  he secretly hoped it was too late to catch the train she saw the glowing lantern of his hands as he cradled the light then his face lit up his eyes fixed on the watch instantly all was dark again all was black before her eyes only a glowing match was red near her feet where was he  what is it she asked afraid  you cant do it his voice answered out of the darkness  there was a pause she felt in his power she had heard the ring in his voice it frightened her  what time is it she asked quiet definite hopeless  two minutes to nine he replied telling the truth with a struggle  and can i get from here to the station in fourteen minutes  no at any rate  she could distinguish his dark form again a yard or so away she wanted to escape  but cant i do it she pleaded  if you hurry he said brusquely but you could easily walk it clara its only seven miles to the tram ill come with you  no i want to catch the train  but why  i doi want to catch the train  suddenly his voice altered  very well he said dry and hard come along then  and he plunged ahead into the darkness she ran after him wanting to cry now he was hard and cruel to her she ran over the rough dark fields behind him out of breath ready to drop but the double row of lights at the station drew nearer suddenly  there she is he cried breaking into a run  there was a faint rattling noise away to the right the train like a luminous caterpillar was threading across the night the rattling ceased  shes over the viaduct youll just do it  clara ran quite out of breath and fell at last into the train the whistle blew he was gone goneand she was in a carriage full of people she felt the cruelty of it  he turned round and plunged home before he knew where he was he was in the kitchen at home he was very pale his eyes were dark and dangerouslooking as if he were drunk his mother looked at him  well i must say your boots are in a nice state she said  he looked at his feet then he took off his overcoat his mother wondered if he were drunk  she caught the train then she said  yes  i hope her feet werent so filthy where on earth you dragged her i dont know  he was silent and motionless for some time  did you like her he asked grudgingly at last  yes i liked her but youll tire of her my son you know you will  he did not answer she noticed how he laboured in his breathing  have you been running she asked  we had to run for the train  youll go and knock yourself up youd better drink hot milk  it was as good a stimulant as he could have but he refused and went to bed there he lay face down on the counterpane and shed tears of rage and pain there was a physical pain that made him bite his lips till they bled and the chaos inside him left him unable to think almost to feel  this is how she serves me is it he said in his heart over and over pressing his face in the quilt and he hated her again he went over the scene and again he hated her  the next day there was a new aloofness about him clara was very gentle almost loving but he treated her distantly with a touch of contempt she sighed continuing to be gentle he came round  one evening of that week sarah bernhardt was at the theatre royal in nottingham giving la dame aux camelias paul wanted to see this old and famous actress and he asked clara to accompany him he told his mother to leave the key in the window for him  shall i book seats he asked of clara  yes and put on an evening suit will you ive never seen you in it  but good lord clara think of me in evening suit at the theatre he remonstrated  would you rather not she asked  i will if you want me to but i sll feel a fool  she laughed at him  then feel a fool for my sake once wont you  the request made his blood flush up  i suppose i sll have to  what are you taking a suitcase for his mother asked  he blushed furiously  clara asked me he said  and what seats are you going in  circlethreeandsix each  well im sure exclaimed his mother sarcastically  its only once in the bluest of blue moons he said  he dressed at jordans put on an overcoat and a cap and met clara in a cafe she was with one of her suffragette friends she wore an old long coat which did not suit her and had a little wrap over her head which he hated the three went to the theatre together  clara took off her coat on the stairs and he discovered she was in a sort of semievening dress that left her arms and neck and part of her breast bare her hair was done fashionably the dress a simple thing of green crape suited her she looked quite grand he thought he could see her figure inside the frock as if that were wrapped closely round her the firmness and the softness of her upright body could almost be felt as he looked at her he clenched his fists  and he was to sit all the evening beside her beautiful naked arm watching the strong throat rise from the strong chest watching the breasts under the green stuff the curve of her limbs in the tight dress something in him hated her again for submitting him to this torture of nearness and he loved her as she balanced her head and stared straight in front of her pouting wistful immobile as if she yielded herself to her fate because it was too strong for her she could not help herself she was in the grip of something bigger than herself a kind of eternal look about her as if she were a wistful sphinx made it necessary for him to kiss her he dropped his programme and crouched down on the floor to get it so that he could kiss her hand and wrist her beauty was a torture to him she sat immobile only when the lights went down she sank a little against him and he caressed her hand and arm with his fingers he could smell her faint perfume all the time his blood kept sweeping up in great whitehot waves that killed his consciousness momentarily  the drama continued he saw it all in the distance going on somewhere he did not know where but it seemed far away inside him he was claras white heavy arms her throat her moving bosom that seemed to be himself then away somewhere the play went on and he was identified with that also there was no himself the grey and black eyes of clara her bosom coming down on him her arm that he held gripped between his hands were all that existed then he felt himself small and helpless her towering in her force above him  only the intervals when the lights came up hurt him expressibly he wanted to run anywhere so long as it would be dark again in a maze he wandered out for a drink then the lights were out and the strange insane reality of clara and the drama took hold of him again  the play went on but he was obsessed by the desire to kiss the tiny blue vein that nestled in the bend of her arm he could feel it his whole face seemed suspended till he had put his lips there it must be done and the other people at last he bent quickly forward and touched it with his lips his moustache brushed the sensitive flesh clara shivered drew away her arm  when all was over the lights up the people clapping he came to himself and looked at his watch his train was gone  i sll have to walk home he said  clara looked at him  it is too late she asked  he nodded then he helped her on with her coat  i love you you look beautiful in that dress he murmured over her shoulder among the throng of bustling people  she remained quiet together they went out of the theatre he saw the cabs waiting the people passing it seemed he met a pair of brown eyes which hated him but he did not know he and clara turned away mechanically taking the direction to the station  the train had gone he would have to walk the ten miles home  it doesnt matter he said i shall enjoy it  wont you she said flushing come home for the night i can sleep with mother  he looked at her their eyes met  what will your mother say he asked  she wont mind  youre sure  quite  shall i come  if you will  very well  and they turned away at the first stoppingplace they took the car the wind blew fresh in their faces the town was dark the tram tipped in its haste he sat with her hand fast in his  will your mother be gone to bed he asked  she may be i hope not  they hurried along the silent dark little street the only people out of doors clara quickly entered the house he hesitated  he leaped up the step and was in the room her mother appeared in the inner doorway large and hostile  who have you got there she asked  its mr morel he has missed his train i thought we might put him up for the night and save him a tenmile walk  hm exclaimed mrs radford thats your lookout if youve invited him hes very welcome as far as im concerned you keep the house  if you dont like me ill go away again he said  nay nay you neednt come along in i dunno what youll think of the supper id got her  it was a little dish of chip potatoes and a piece of bacon the table was roughly laid for one  you can have some more bacon continued mrs radford more chips you cant have  its a shame to bother you he said  oh dont you be apologetic it doesnt do wi me you treated her to the theatre didnt you there was a sarcasm in the last question  well laughed paul uncomfortably  well and whats an inch of bacon take your coat off  the big straightstanding woman was trying to estimate the situation she moved about the cupboard clara took his coat the room was very warm and cosy in the lamplight  my sirs exclaimed mrs radford but you twos a pair of bright beauties i must say whats all that getup for  i believe we dont know he said feeling a victim  there isnt room in this house for two such bobbydazzlers if you fly your kites that high she rallied them it was a nasty thrust  he in his dinner jacket and clara in her green dress and bare arms were confused they felt they must shelter each other in that little kitchen  and look at that blossom continued mrs radford pointing to clara what does she reckon she did it for  paul looked at clara she was rosy her neck was warm with blushes there was a moment of silence  you like to see it dont you he asked  the mother had them in her power all the time his heart was beating hard and he was tight with anxiety but he would fight her  me like to see it exclaimed the old woman what should i like to see her make a fool of herself for  ive seen people look bigger fools he said clara was under his protection now  oh ay and when was that came the sarcastic rejoinder  when they made frights of themselves he answered  mrs radford large and threatening stood suspended on the hearthrug holding her fork  theyre fools either road she answered at length turning to the dutch oven  no he said fighting stoutly folk ought to look as well as they can  and do you call that looking nice cried the mother pointing a scornful fork at clara thatthat looks as if it wasnt properly dressed  i believe youre jealous that you cant swank as well he said laughing  me i could have worn evening dress with anybody if id wanted to came the scornful answer  and why didnt you want to he asked pertinently or did you wear it  there was a long pause mrs radford readjusted the bacon in the dutch oven his heart beat fast for fear he had offended her  me she exclaimed at last no i didnt and when i was in service i knew as soon as one of the maids came out in bare shoulders what sort she was going to her sixpenny hop  were you too good to go to a sixpenny hop he said  clara sat with bowed head his eyes were dark and glittering mrs radford took the dutch oven from the fire and stood near him putting bits of bacon on his plate  theres a nice crozzly bit she said  dont give me the best he said  shes got what she wants was the answer  there was a sort of scornful forbearance in the womans tone that made paul know she was mollified  but do have some he said to clara  she looked up at him with her grey eyes humiliated and lonely  no thanks she said  why wont you he answered carelessly  the blood was beating up like fire in his veins mrs radford sat down again large and impressive and aloof he left clara altogether to attend to the mother  they say sarah bernhardts fifty he said  fifty shes turned sixty came the scornful answer  well he said youd never think it she made me want to howl even now  i should like to see myself howling at that bad old baggage said mrs radford its time she began to think herself a grandmother not a shrieking catamaran  he laughed  a catamaran is a boat the malays use he said  and its a word as i use she retorted  my mother does sometimes and its no good my telling her he said  i sd think she boxes your ears said mrs radford goodhumouredly  shed like to and she says she will so i give her a little stool to stand on  thats the worst of my mother said clara she never wants a stool for anything  but she often cant touch that lady with a long prop retorted mrs radford to paul  i sd think she doesnt want touching with a prop he laughed i shouldnt  it might do the pair of you good to give you a crack on the head with one said the mother laughing suddenly  why are you so vindictive towards me he said ive not stolen anything from you  no ill watch that laughed the older woman  soon the supper was finished mrs radford sat guard in her chair paul lit a cigarette clara went upstairs returning with a sleepingsuit which she spread on the fender to air  why id forgot all about them said mrs radford where have they sprung from  out of my drawer  hm you bought em for baxter an he wouldnt wear em would helaughing said he reckoned to do wiout trousers i bed she turned confidentially to paul saying he couldnt bear em them pyjama things  the young man sat making rings of smoke  well its everyone to his taste he laughed  then followed a little discussion of the merits of pyjamas  my mother loves me in them he said she says im a pierrot  i can imagine theyd suit you said mrs radford  after a while he glanced at the little clock that was ticking on the mantelpiece it was halfpast twelve  it is funny he said but it takes hours to settle down to sleep after the theatre  its about time you did said mrs radford clearing the table  are you tired he asked of clara  not the least bit she answered avoiding his eyes  shall we have a game at cribbage he said  ive forgotten it  well ill teach you again may we play crib mrs radford he asked  youll please yourselves she said but its pretty late  a game or so will make us sleepy he answered  clara brought the cards and sat spinning her weddingring whilst he shuffled them mrs radford was washing up in the scullery as it grew later paul felt the situation getting more and more tense  fifteen two fifteen four fifteen six and twos eight  the clock struck one still the game continued mrs radford had done all the little jobs preparatory to going to bed had locked the door and filled the kettle still paul went on dealing and counting he was obsessed by claras arms and throat he believed he could see where the division was just beginning for her breasts he could not leave her she watched his hands and felt her joints melt as they moved quickly she was so near it was almost as if he touched her and yet not quite his mettle was roused he hated mrs radford she sat on nearly dropping asleep but determined and obstinate in her chair paul glanced at her then at clara she met his eyes that were angry mocking and hard as steel her own answered him in shame he knew she at any rate was of his mind he played on  at last mrs radford roused herself stiffly and said  isnt it nigh on time you two was thinking o bed  paul played on without answering he hated her sufficiently to murder her  half a minute he said  the elder woman rose and sailed stubbornly into the scullery returning with his candle which she put on the mantelpiece then she sat down again the hatred of her went so hot down his veins he dropped his cards  well stop then he said but his voice was still a challenge  clara saw his mouth shut hard again he glanced at her it seemed like an agreement she bent over the cards coughing to clear her throat  well im glad youve finished said mrs radford here take your thingsshe thrust the warm suit in his handand this is your candle your rooms over this theres only two so you cant go far wrong well goodnight i hope youll rest well  im sure i shall i always do he said  yes and so you ought at your age she replied  he bade goodnight to clara and went the twisting stairs of white scrubbed wood creaked and clanged at every step he went doggedly the two doors faced each other he went in his room pushed the door to without fastening the latch  it was a small room with a large bed some of claras hairpins were on the dressingtableher hairbrush her clothes and some skirts hung under a cloth in a corner there was actually a pair of stockings over a chair he explored the room two books of his own were there on the shelf he undressed folded his suit and sat on the bed listening then he blew out the candle lay down and in two minutes was almost asleep then clickhe was wide awake and writhing in torment it was as if when he had nearly got to sleep something had bitten him suddenly and sent him mad he sat up and looked at the room in the darkness his feet doubled under him perfectly motionless listening he heard a cat somewhere away outside then the heavy poised tread of the mother then claras distinct voice  will you unfasten my dress  there was silence for some time at last the mother said  now then arent you coming up  no not yet replied the daughter calmly  oh very well then if its not late enough stop a bit longer only you neednt come waking me up when ive got to sleep  i shant be long said clara  immediately afterwards paul heard the mother slowly mounting the stairs the candlelight flashed through the cracks in his door her dress brushed the door and his heart jumped then it was dark and he heard the clatter of her latch she was very leisurely indeed in her preparations for sleep after a long time it was quite still he sat strung up on the bed shivering slightly his door was an inch open as clara came upstairs he would intercept her he waited all was dead silence the clock struck two then he heard a slight scrape of the fender downstairs now he could not help himself his shivering was uncontrollable he felt he must go or die  he stepped off the bed and stood a moment shuddering then he went straight to the door he tried to step lightly the first stair cracked like a shot he listened the old woman stirred in her bed the staircase was dark there was a slit of light under the stairfoot door which opened into the kitchen he stood a moment then he went on mechanically every step creaked and his back was creeping lest the old womans door should open behind him up above he fumbled with the door at the bottom the latch opened with a loud clack he went through into the kitchen and shut the door noisily behind him the old woman darent come now  then he stood arrested clara was kneeling on a pile of white underclothing on the hearthrug her back towards him warming herself she did not look round but sat crouching on her heels and her rounded beautiful back was towards him and her face was hidden she was warming her body at the fire for consolation the glow was rosy on one side the shadow was dark and warm on the other her arms hung slack  he shuddered violently clenching his teeth and fists hard to keep control then he went forward to her he put one hand on her shoulder the fingers of the other hand under her chin to raise her face a convulsed shiver ran through her once twice at his touch she kept her head bent  sorry he murmured realising that his hands were very cold  then she looked up at him frightened like a thing that is afraid of death  my hands are so cold he murmured  i like it she whispered closing her eyes  the breath of her words were on his mouth her arms clasped his knees the cord of his sleepingsuit dangled against her and made her shiver as the warmth went into him his shuddering became less  at length unable to stand so any more he raised her and she buried her head on his shoulder his hands went over her slowly with an infinite tenderness of caress she clung close to him trying to hide herself against him he clasped her very fast then at last she looked at him mute imploring looking to see if she must be ashamed  his eyes were dark very deep and very quiet it was as if her beauty and his taking it hurt him made him sorrowful he looked at her with a little pain and was afraid he was so humble before her she kissed him fervently on the eyes first one then the other and she folded herself to him she gave herself he held her fast it was a moment intense almost to agony  she stood letting him adore her and tremble with joy of her it healed her hurt pride it healed her it made her glad it made her feel erect and proud again her pride had been wounded inside her she had been cheapened now she radiated with joy and pride again it was her restoration and her recognition  then he looked at her his face radiant they laughed to each other and he strained her to his chest the seconds ticked off the minutes passed and still the two stood clasped rigid together mouth to mouth like a statue in one block  but again his fingers went seeking over her restless wandering dissatisfied the hot blood came up wave upon wave she laid her head on his shoulder  come you to my room he murmured  she looked at him and shook her head her mouth pouting disconsolately her eyes heavy with passion he watched her fixedly  yes he said  again she shook her head  why not he asked  she looked at him still heavily sorrowfully and again she shook her head his eyes hardened and he gave way  when later on he was back in bed he wondered why she had refused to come to him openly so that her mother would know at any rate then things would have been definite and she could have stayed with him the night without having to go as she was to her mothers bed it was strange and he could not understand it and then almost immediately he fell asleep  he awoke in the morning with someone speaking to him opening his eyes he saw mrs radford big and stately looking down on him she held a cup of tea in her hand  do you think youre going to sleep till doomsday she said  he laughed at once  it ought only to be about five oclock he said  well she answered its halfpast seven whether or not here ive brought you a cup of tea  he rubbed his face pushed the tumbled hair off his forehead and roused himself  whats it so late for he grumbled  he resented being wakened it amused her she saw his neck in the flannel sleepingjacket as white and round as a girls he rubbed his hair crossly  its no good your scratching your head she said it wont make it no earlier here an how long dyou think im going to stand waiting wi this here cup  oh dash the cup he said  you should go to bed earlier said the woman  he looked up at her laughing with impudence  i went to bed before you did he said  yes my guyney you did she exclaimed  fancy he said stirring his tea having tea brought to bed to me my motherll think im ruined for life  dont she never do it asked mrs radford  shed as leave think of flying  ah i always spoilt my lot thats why theyve turned out such bad uns said the elderly woman  youd only clara he said and mr radfords in heaven so i suppose theres only you left to be the bad un  im not bad im only soft she said as she went out of the bedroom im only a fool i am  clara was very quiet at breakfast but she had a sort of air of proprietorship over him that pleased him infinitely mrs radford was evidently fond of him he began to talk of his painting  whats the good exclaimed the mother of your whittling and worrying and twistin and tooin at that painting of yours what good does it do you i should like to know youd better be enjoyin yourself  oh but exclaimed paul i made over thirty guineas last year  did you well thats a consideration but its nothing to the time you put in  and ive got four pounds owing a man said hed give me five pounds if id paint him and his missis and the dog and the cottage and i went and put the fowls in instead of the dog and he was waxy so i had to knock a quid off i was sick of it and i didnt like the dog i made a picture of it what shall i do when he pays me the four pounds  nay you know your own uses for your money said mrs radford  but im going to bust this four pounds should we go to the seaside for a day or two  who  you and clara and me  what on your money she exclaimed halfwrathful  why not  you wouldnt be long in breaking your neck at a hurdle race she said  so long as i get a good run for my money will you  nay you may settle that atween you  and youre willing he asked amazed and rejoicing  youll do as you like said mrs radford whether im willing or not    chapter xiii  baxter dawes  soon after paul had been to the theatre with clara he was drinking in the punch bowl with some friends of his when dawes came in claras husband was growing stout his eyelids were getting slack over his brown eyes he was losing his healthy firmness of flesh he was very evidently on the downward track having quarrelled with his sister he had gone into cheap lodgings his mistress had left him for a man who would marry her he had been in prison one night for fighting when he was drunk and there was a shady betting episode in which he was concerned  paul and he were confirmed enemies and yet there was between them that peculiar feeling of intimacy as if they were secretly near to each other which sometimes exists between two people although they never speak to one another paul often thought of baxter dawes often wanted to get at him and be friends with him he knew that dawes often thought about him and that the man was drawn to him by some bond or other and yet the two never looked at each other save in hostility  since he was a superior employee at jordans it was the thing for paul to offer dawes a drink  whatll you have he asked of him  nowt wi a bleeder like you replied the man  paul turned away with a slight disdainful movement of the shoulders very irritating  the aristocracy he continued is really a military institution take germany now shes got thousands of aristocrats whose only means of existence is the army theyre deadly poor and lifes deadly slow so they hope for a war they look for war as a chance of getting on till theres a war they are idle goodfornothings when theres a war they are leaders and commanders there you are thenthey want war  he was not a favourite debater in the publichouse being too quick and overbearing he irritated the older men by his assertive manner and his cocksureness they listened in silence and were not sorry when he finished  dawes interrupted the young mans flow of eloquence by asking in a loud sneer  did you learn all that at th theatre th other night  paul looked at him their eyes met then he knew dawes had seen him coming out of the theatre with clara  why what about th theatre asked one of pauls associates glad to get a dig at the young fellow and sniffing something tasty  oh him in a bobtailed evening suit on the lardyda sneered dawes jerking his head contemptuously at paul  thats comin it strong said the mutual friend tart an all  tart begod said dawes  go on lets have it cried the mutual friend  youve got it said dawes an i reckon morelly had it an all  well ill be jiggered said the mutual friend an was it a proper tart  tart god blimeyyes  how do you know  oh said dawes i reckon he spent th night  there was a good deal of laughter at pauls expense  but who was she dyou know her asked the mutual friend  i should shay sho said dawes  this brought another burst of laughter  then spit it out said the mutual friend  dawes shook his head and took a gulp of beer  its a wonder he hasnt let on himself he said hell be braggin of it in a bit  come on paul said the friend its no good you might just as well own up  own up what that i happened to take a friend to the theatre  oh well if it was all right tell us who she was lad said the friend  she was all right said dawes  paul was furious dawes wiped his golden moustache with his fingers sneering  strike me one o that sort said the mutual friend paul boy im surprised at you and do you know her baxter  just a bit like  he winked at the other men  oh well said paul ill be going  the mutual friend laid a detaining hand on his shoulder  nay he said you dont get off as easy as that my lad weve got to have a full account of this business  then get it from dawes he said  you shouldnt funk your own deeds man remonstrated the friend  then dawes made a remark which caused paul to throw half a glass of beer in his face  oh mr morel cried the barmaid and she rang the bell for the chuckerout  dawes spat and rushed for the young man at that minute a brawny fellow with his shirtsleeves rolled up and his trousers tight over his haunches intervened  now then he said pushing his chest in front of dawes  come out cried dawes  paul was leaning white and quivering against the brass rail of the bar he hated dawes wished something could exterminate him at that minute and at the same time seeing the wet hair on the mans forehead he thought he looked pathetic he did not move  come out you said dawes  thats enough dawes cried the barmaid  come on said the chuckerout with kindly insistence youd better be getting on  and by making dawes edge away from his own close proximity he worked him to the door  thats the little sod as started it cried dawes halfcowed pointing to paul morel  why what a story mr dawes said the barmaid you know it was you all the time  still the chuckerout kept thrusting his chest forward at him still he kept edging back until he was in the doorway and on the steps outside then he turned round  all right he said nodding straight at his rival  paul had a curious sensation of pity almost of affection mingled with violent hate for the man the coloured door swung to there was silence in the bar  serve him jolly well right said the barmaid  but its a nasty thing to get a glass of beer in your eyes said the mutual friend  i tell you i was glad he did said the barmaid will you have another mr morel  she held up pauls glass questioningly he nodded  hes a man as doesnt care for anything is baxter dawes said one  pooh is he said the barmaid hes a loudmouthed one he is and theyre never much good give me a pleasantspoken chap if you want a devil  well paul my lad said the friend youll have to take care of yourself now for a while  you wont have to give him a chance over you thats all said the barmaid  can you box asked a friend  not a bit he answered still very white  i might give you a turn or two said the friend  thanks i havent time  and presently he took his departure  go along with him mr jenkinson whispered the barmaid tipping mr jenkinson the wink  the man nodded took his hat said goodnight all very heartily and followed paul calling  half a minute old man you an mes going the same road i believe  mr morel doesnt like it said the barmaid youll see we shant have him in much more im sorry hes good company and baxter dawes wants locking up thats what he wants  paul would have died rather than his mother should get to know of this affair he suffered tortures of humiliation and selfconsciousness there was now a good deal of his life of which necessarily he could not speak to his mother he had a life apart from herhis sexual life the rest she still kept but he felt he had to conceal something from her and it irked him there was a certain silence between them and he felt he had in that silence to defend himself against her he felt condemned by her then sometimes he hated her and pulled at her bondage his life wanted to free itself of her it was like a circle where life turned back on itself and got no farther she bore him loved him kept him and his love turned back into her so that he could not be free to go forward with his own life really love another woman at this period unknowingly he resisted his mothers influence he did not tell her things there was a distance between them  clara was happy almost sure of him she felt she had at last got him for herself and then again came the uncertainty he told her jestingly of the affair with her husband her colour came up her grey eyes flashed  thats him to a t she criedlike a navvy hes not fit for mixing with decent folk  yet you married him he said  it made her furious that he reminded her  i did she cried but how was i to know  i think he might have been rather nice he said  you think i made him what he is she exclaimed  oh no he made himself but theres something about him  clara looked at her lover closely there was something in him she hated a sort of detached criticism of herself a coldness which made her womans soul harden against him  and what are you going to do she asked  how  about baxter  theres nothing to do is there he replied  you can fight him if you have to i suppose she said  no i havent the least sense of the fist its funny with most men theres the instinct to clench the fist and hit its not so with me i should want a knife or a pistol or something to fight with  then youd better carry something she said  nay he laughed im not daggeroso  but hell do something to you you dont know him  all right he said well see  and youll let him  perhaps if i cant help it  and if he kills you she said  i should be sorry for his sake and mine  clara was silent for a moment  you do make me angry she exclaimed  thats nothing afresh he laughed  but why are you so silly you dont know him  and dont want  yes but youre not going to let a man do as he likes with you  what must i do he replied laughing  i should carry a revolver she said im sure hes dangerous  i might blow my fingers off he said  no but wont you she pleaded  no  not anything  no  and youll leave him to  yes  you are a fool  fact  she set her teeth with anger  i could shake you she cried trembling with passion  why  let a man like him do as he likes with you  you can go back to him if he triumphs he said  do you want me to hate you she asked  well i only tell you he said  and you say you love me she exclaimed low and indignant  ought i to slay him to please you he said but if i did see what a hold hed have over me  do you think im a fool she exclaimed  not at all but you dont understand me my dear  there was a pause between them  but you ought not to expose yourself she pleaded  he shrugged his shoulders       the man in righteousness arrayed      the pure and blameless liver      needs not the keen toledo blade      nor venomfreighted quiver  he quoted  she looked at him searchingly  i wish i could understand you she said  theres simply nothing to understand he laughed  she bowed her head brooding  he did not see dawes for several days then one morning as he ran upstairs from the spiral room he almost collided with the burly metalworker  what the cried the smith  sorry said paul and passed on  sorry sneered dawes  paul whistled lightly put me among the girls  ill stop your whistle my jockey he said  the other took no notice  youre goin to answer for that job of the other night  paul went to his desk in his corner and turned over the leaves of the ledger  go and tell fanny i want order 097 quick he said to his boy  dawes stood in the doorway tall and threatening looking at the top of the young mans head  six and fives eleven and sevens oneandsix paul added aloud  an you hear do you said dawes  five and ninepence he wrote a figure whats that he said  im going to show you what it is said the smith  the other went on adding the figures aloud  yer crawlin little yer daresnt face me proper  paul quickly snatched the heavy ruler dawes started the young man ruled some lines in his ledger the elder man was infuriated  but wait till i light on you no matter where it is ill settle your hash for a bit yer little swine  all right said paul  at that the smith started heavily from the doorway just then a whistle piped shrilly paul went to the speakingtube  yes he said and he listened eryes he listened then he laughed ill come down directly ive got a visitor just now  dawes knew from his tone that he had been speaking to clara he stepped forward  yer little devil he said ill visitor you inside of two minutes think im goin to have you whippertysnappin round  the other clerks in the warehouse looked up pauls officeboy appeared holding some white article  fanny says you could have had it last night if youd let her know he said  all right answered paul looking at the stocking get it off dawes stood frustrated helpless with rage morel turned round  excuse me a minute he said to dawes and he would have run downstairs  by god ill stop your gallop shouted the smith seizing him by the arm he turned quickly  hey hey cried the officeboy alarmed  thomas jordan started out of his little glass office and came running down the room  whats amatter whats amatter he said in his old mans sharp voice  im just goin ter settle this little thats all said dawes desperately  what do you mean snapped thomas jordan  what i say said dawes but he hung fire  morel was leaning against the counter ashamed halfgrinning  whats it all about snapped thomas jordan  couldnt say said paul shaking his head and shrugging his shoulders  couldnt yer couldnt yer cried dawes thrusting forward his handsome furious face and squaring his fist  have you finished cried the old man strutting get off about your business and dont come here tipsy in the morning  dawes turned his big frame slowly upon him  tipsy he said whos tipsy im no more tipsy than you are  weve heard that song before snapped the old man now you get off and dont be long about it comin here with your rowdying  the smith looked down contemptuously on his employer his hands large and grimy and yet well shaped for his labour worked restlessly paul remembered they were the hands of claras husband and a flash of hate went through him  get out before youre turned out snapped thomas jordan  why wholl turn me out said dawes beginning to sneer  mr jordan started marched up to the smith waving him off thrusting his stout little figure at the man saying  get off my premisesget off  he seized and twitched dawess arm  come off said the smith and with a jerk of the elbow he sent the little manufacturer staggering backwards  before anyone could help him thomas jordan had collided with the flimsy springdoor it had given way and let him crash down the halfdozen steps into fannys room there was a second of amazement then men and girls were running dawes stood a moment looking bitterly on the scene then he took his departure  thomas jordan was shaken and braised not otherwise hurt he was however beside himself with rage he dismissed dawes from his employment and summoned him for assault  at the trial paul morel had to give evidence asked how the trouble began he said  dawes took occasion to insult mrs dawes and me because i accompanied her to the theatre one evening then i threw some beer at him and he wanted his revenge  cherchez la femme smiled the magistrate  the case was dismissed after the magistrate had told dawes he thought him a skunk  you gave the case away snapped mr jordan to paul  i dont think i did replied the latter besides you didnt really want a conviction did you  what do you think i took the case up for  well said paul im sorry if i said the wrong thing clara was also very angry  why need my name have been dragged in she said  better speak it openly than leave it to be whispered  there was no need for anything at all she declared  we are none the poorer he said indifferently  you may not be she said  and you he asked  i need never have been mentioned  im sorry he said but he did not sound sorry  he told himself easily she will come round and she did  he told his mother about the fall of mr jordan and the trial of dawes mrs morel watched him closely  and what do you think of it all she asked him  i think hes a fool he said  but he was very uncomfortable nevertheless  have you ever considered where it will end his mother said  no he answered things work out of themselves  they do in a way one doesnt like as a rule said his mother  and then one has to put up with them he said  youll find youre not as good at putting up as you imagine she said  he went on working rapidly at his design  do you ever ask her opinion she said at length  what of  of you and the whole thing  i dont care what her opinion of me is shes fearfully in love with me but its not very deep  but quite as deep as your feeling for her  he looked up at his mother curiously  yes he said you know mother i think there must be something the matter with me that i cant love when shes there as a rule i do love her sometimes when i see her just as the woman i love her mother but then when she talks and criticises i often dont listen to her  yet shes as much sense as miriam  perhaps and i love her better than miriam but why dont they hold me  the last question was almost a lamentation his mother turned away her face sat looking across the room very quiet grave with something of renunciation  but you wouldnt want to marry clara she said  no at first perhaps i would but whywhy dont i want to marry her or anybody i feel sometimes as if i wronged my women mother  how wronged them my son  i dont know  he went on painting rather despairingly he had touched the quick of the trouble  and as for wanting to marry said his mother theres plenty of time yet  but no mother i even love clara and i did miriam but to give myself to them in marriage i couldnt i couldnt belong to them they seem to want me and i cant ever give it them  you havent met the right woman  and i never shall meet the right woman while you live he said  she was very quiet now she began to feel again tired as if she were done  well see my son she answered  the feeling that things were going in a circle made him mad  clara was indeed passionately in love with him and he with her as far as passion went in the daytime he forgot her a good deal she was working in the same building but he was not aware of it he was busy and her existence was of no matter to him but all the time she was in her spiral room she had a sense that he was upstairs a physical sense of his person in the same building every second she expected him to come through the door and when he came it was a shock to her but he was often short and offhand with her he gave her his directions in an official manner keeping her at bay with what wits she had left she listened to him she dared not misunderstand or fail to remember but it was a cruelty to her she wanted to touch his chest she knew exactly how his breast was shapen under the waistcoat and she wanted to touch it it maddened her to hear his mechanical voice giving orders about the work she wanted to break through the sham of it smash the trivial coating of business which covered him with hardness get at the man again but she was afraid and before she could feel one touch of his warmth he was gone and she ached again  he knew that she was dreary every evening she did not see him so he gave her a good deal of his time the days were often a misery to her but the evenings and the nights were usually a bliss to them both then they were silent for hours they sat together or walked together in the dark and talked only a few almost meaningless words but he had her hand in his and her bosom left its warmth in his chest making him feel whole  one evening they were walking down by the canal and something was troubling him she knew she had not got him all the time he whistled softly and persistently to himself she listened feeling she could learn more from his whistling than from his speech it was a sad dissatisfied tunea tune that made her feel he would not stay with her she walked on in silence when they came to the swing bridge he sat down on the great pole looking at the stars in the water he was a long way from her she had been thinking  will you always stay at jordans she asked  no he answered without reflecting no i sll leave nottingham and go abroadsoon  go abroad what for  i dunno i feel restless  but what shall you do  i shall have to get some steady designing work and some sort of sale for my pictures first he said i am gradually making my way i know i am  and when do you think youll go  i dont know i shall hardly go for long while theres my mother  you couldnt leave her  not for long  she looked at the stars in the black water they lay very white and staring it was an agony to know he would leave her but it was almost an agony to have him near her  and if you made a nice lot of money what would you do she asked  go somewhere in a pretty house near london with my mother  i see  there was a long pause  i could still come and see you he said i dont know dont ask me what i should do i dont know  there was a silence the stars shuddered and broke upon the water there came a breath of wind he went suddenly to her and put his hand on her shoulder  dont ask me anything about the future he said miserably i dont know anything be with me now will you no matter what it is  and she took him in her arms after all she was a married woman and she had no right even to what he gave her he needed her badly she had him in her arms and he was miserable with her warmth she folded him over consoled him loved him she would let the moment stand for itself  after a moment he lifted his head as if he wanted to speak  clara he said struggling  she caught him passionately to her pressed his head down on her breast with her hand she could not bear the suffering in his voice she was afraid in her soul he might have anything of heranything but she did not want to know she felt she could not bear it she wanted him to be soothed upon hersoothed she stood clasping him and caressing him and he was something unknown to hersomething almost uncanny she wanted to soothe him into forgetfulness  and soon the struggle went down in his soul and he forgot but then clara was not there for him only a woman warm something he loved and almost worshipped there in the dark but it was not clara and she submitted to him the naked hunger and inevitability of his loving her something strong and blind and ruthless in its primitiveness made the hour almost terrible to her she knew how stark and alone he was and she felt it was great that he came to her and she took him simply because his need was bigger either than her or him and her soul was still within her she did this for him in his need even if he left her for she loved him  all the while the peewits were screaming in the field when he came to he wondered what was near his eyes curving and strong with life in the dark and what voice it was speaking then he realised it was the grass and the peewit was calling the warmth was claras breathing heaving he lifted his head and looked into her eyes they were dark and shining and strange life wild at the source staring into his life stranger to him yet meeting him and he put his face down on her throat afraid what was she a strong strange wild life that breathed with his in the darkness through this hour it was all so much bigger than themselves that he was hushed they had met and included in their meeting the thrust of the manifold grass stems the cry of the peewit the wheel of the stars  when they stood up they saw other lovers stealing down the opposite hedge it seemed natural they were there the night contained them  and after such an evening they both were very still having known the immensity of passion they felt small halfafraid childish and wondering like adam and eve when they lost their innocence and realised the magnificence of the power which drove them out of paradise and across the great night and the great day of humanity it was for each of them an initiation and a satisfaction to know their own nothingness to know the tremendous living flood which carried them always gave them rest within themselves if so great a magnificent power could overwhelm them identify them altogether with itself so that they knew they were only grains in the tremendous heave that lifted every grass blade its little height and every tree and living thing then why fret about themselves they could let themselves be carried by life and they felt a sort of peace each in the other there was a verification which they had had together nothing could nullify it nothing could take it away it was almost their belief in life  but clara was not satisfied something great was there she knew something great enveloped her but it did not keep her in the morning it was not the same they had known but she could not keep the moment she wanted it again she wanted something permanent she had not realised fully she thought it was he whom she wanted he was not safe to her this that had been between them might never be again he might leave her she had not got him she was not satisfied she had been there but she had not gripped thethe somethingshe knew not whatwhich she was mad to have  in the morning he had considerable peace and was happy in himself it seemed almost as if he had known the baptism of fire in passion and it left him at rest but it was not clara it was something that happened because of her but it was not her they were scarcely any nearer each other it was as if they had been blind agents of a great force  when she saw him that day at the factory her heart melted like a drop of fire it was his body his brows the drop of fire grew more intense in her breast she must hold him but he very quiet very subdued this morning went on giving his instruction she followed him into the dark ugly basement and lifted her arms to him he kissed her and the intensity of passion began to burn him again somebody was at the door he ran upstairs she returned to her room moving as if in a trance  after that the fire slowly went down he felt more and more that his experience had been impersonal and not clara he loved her there was a big tenderness as after a strong emotion they had known together but it was not she who could keep his soul steady he had wanted her to be something she could not be  and she was mad with desire of him she could not see him without touching him in the factory as he talked to her about spiral hose she ran her hand secretly along his side she followed him out into the basement for a quick kiss her eyes always mute and yearning full of unrestrained passion she kept fixed on his he was afraid of her lest she should too flagrantly give herself away before the other girls she invariably waited for him at dinnertime for him to embrace her before she went he felt as if she were helpless almost a burden to him and it irritated him  but what do you always want to be kissing and embracing for he said surely theres a time for everything  she looked up at him and the hate came into her eyes  do i always want to be kissing you she said  always even if i come to ask you about the work i dont want anything to do with love when im at work works work  and what is love she asked has it to have special hours  yes out of work hours  and youll regulate it according to mr jordans closing time  yes and according to the freedom from business of any sort  it is only to exist in spare time  thats all and not always thennot the kissing sort of love  and thats all you think of it  its quite enough  im glad you think so  and she was cold to him for some timeshe hated him and while she was cold and contemptuous he was uneasy till she had forgiven him again but when they started afresh they were not any nearer he kept her because he never satisfied her  in the spring they went together to the seaside they had rooms at a little cottage near theddlethorpe and lived as man and wife mrs radford sometimes went with them  it was known in nottingham that paul morel and mrs dawes were going together but as nothing was very obvious and clara always a solitary person and he seemed so simple and innocent it did not make much difference  he loved the lincolnshire coast and she loved the sea in the early morning they often went out together to bathe the grey of the dawn the far desolate reaches of the fenland smitten with winter the seameadows rank with herbage were stark enough to rejoice his soul as they stepped on to the highroad from their plank bridge and looked round at the endless monotony of levels the land a little darker than the sky the sea sounding small beyond the sandhills his heart filled strong with the sweeping relentlessness of life she loved him then he was solitary and strong and his eyes had a beautiful light  they shuddered with cold then he raced her down the road to the green turf bridge she could run well her colour soon came her throat was bare her eyes shone he loved her for being so luxuriously heavy and yet so quick himself was light she went with a beautiful rush they grew warm and walked hand in hand  a flush came into the sky the wan moon halfway down the west sank into insignificance on the shadowy land things began to take life plants with great leaves became distinct they came through a pass in the big cold sandhills on to the beach the long waste of foreshore lay moaning under the dawn and the sea the ocean was a flat dark strip with a white edge over the gloomy sea the sky grew red quickly the fire spread among the clouds and scattered them crimson burned to orange orange to dull gold and in a golden glitter the sun came up dribbling fierily over the waves in little splashes as if someone had gone along and the light had spilled from her pail as she walked  the breakers ran down the shore in long hoarse strokes tiny seagulls like specks of spray wheeled above the line of surf their crying seemed larger than they far away the coast reached out and melted into the morning the tussocky sandhills seemed to sink to a level with the beach mablethorpe was tiny on their right they had alone the space of all this level shore the sea and the upcoming sun the faint noise of the waters the sharp crying of the gulls  they had a warm hollow in the sandhills where the wind did not come he stood looking out to sea  its very fine he said  now dont get sentimental she said  it irritated her to see him standing gazing at the sea like a solitary and poetic person he laughed she quickly undressed  there are some fine waves this morning she said triumphantly  she was a better swimmer than he he stood idly watching her  arent you coming she said  in a minute he answered  she was white and velvet skinned with heavy shoulders a little wind coming from the sea blew across her body and ruffled her hair  the morning was of a lovely limpid gold colour veils of shadow seemed to be drifting away on the north and the south clara stood shrinking slightly from the touch of the wind twisting her hair the seagrass rose behind the white stripped woman she glanced at the sea then looked at him he was watching her with dark eyes which she loved and could not understand she hugged her breasts between her arms cringing laughing  oo it will be so cold she said  he bent forward and kissed her held her suddenly close and kissed her again she stood waiting he looked into her eyes then away at the pale sands  go then he said quietly  she flung her arms round his neck drew him against her kissed him passionately and went saying  but youll come in  in a minute  she went plodding heavily over the sand that was soft as velvet he on the sandhills watched the great pale coast envelop her she grew smaller lost proportion seemed only like a large white bird toiling forward  not much more than a big white pebble on the beach not much more than a clot of foam being blown and rolled over the sand he said to himself  she seemed to move very slowly across the vast sounding shore as he watched he lost her she was dazzled out of sight by the sunshine again he saw her the merest white speck moving against the white muttering seaedge  look how little she is he said to himself shes lost like a grain of sand in the beachjust a concentrated speck blown along a tiny white foambubble almost nothing among the morning why does she absorb me  the morning was altogether uninterrupted she was gone in the water far and wide the beach the sandhills with their blue marrain the shining water glowed together in immense unbroken solitude  what is she after all he said to himself heres the seacoast morning big and permanent and beautiful there is she fretting always unsatisfied and temporary as a bubble of foam what does she mean to me after all she represents something like a bubble of foam represents the sea but what is she its not her i care for  then startled by his own unconscious thoughts that seemed to speak so distinctly that all the morning could hear he undressed and ran quickly down the sands she was watching for him her arm flashed up to him she heaved on a wave subsided her shoulders in a pool of liquid silver he jumped through the breakers and in a moment her hand was on his shoulder  he was a poor swimmer and could not stay long in the water she played round him in triumph sporting with her superiority which he begrudged her the sunshine stood deep and fine on the water they laughed in the sea for a minute or two then raced each other back to the sandhills  when they were drying themselves panting heavily he watched her laughing breathless face her bright shoulders her breasts that swayed and made him frightened as she rubbed them and he thought again  but she is magnificent and even bigger than the morning and the sea is she is she  she seeing his dark eyes fixed on her broke off from her drying with a laugh  what are you looking at she said  you he answered laughing  her eyes met his and in a moment he was kissing her white goosefleshed shoulder and thinking  what is she what is she  she loved him in the morning there was something detached hard and elemental about his kisses then as if he were only conscious of his own will not in the least of her and her wanting him  later in the day he went out sketching  you he said to her go with your mother to sutton i am so dull  she stood and looked at him he knew she wanted to come with him but he preferred to be alone she made him feel imprisoned when she was there as if he could not get a free deep breath as if there were something on top of him she felt his desire to be free of her  in the evening he came back to her they walked down the shore in the darkness then sat for a while in the shelter of the sandhills  it seems she said as they stared over the darkness of the sea where no light was to be seenit seemed as if you only loved me at nightas if you didnt love me in the daytime  he ran the cold sand through his fingers feeling guilty under the accusation  the night is free to you he replied in the daytime i want to be by myself  but why she said why even now when we are on this short holiday  i dont know lovemaking stifles me in the daytime  but it neednt be always lovemaking she said  it always is he answered when you and i are together  she sat feeling very bitter  do you ever want to marry me he asked curiously  do you me she replied  yes yes i should like us to have children he answered slowly  she sat with her head bent fingering the sand  but you dont really want a divorce from baxter do you he said  it was some minutes before she replied  no she said very deliberately i dont think i do  why  i dont know  do you feel as if you belonged to him  no i dont think so  what then  i think he belongs to me she replied  he was silent for some minutes listening to the wind blowing over the hoarse dark sea  and you never really intended to belong to me he said  yes i do belong to you she answered  no he said because you dont want to be divorced  it was a knot they could not untie so they left it took what they could get and what they could not attain they ignored  i consider you treated baxter rottenly he said another time  he halfexpected clara to answer him as his mother would you consider your own affairs and dont know so much about other peoples but she took him seriously almost to his own surprise  why she said  i suppose you thought he was a lily of the valley and so you put him in an appropriate pot and tended him according you made up your mind he was a lily of the valley and it was no good his being a cowparsnip you wouldnt have it  i certainly never imagined him a lily of the valley  you imagined him something he wasnt thats just what a woman is she thinks she knows whats good for a man and shes going to see he gets it and no matter if hes starving he may sit and whistle for what he needs while shes got him and is giving him whats good for him  and what are you doing she asked  im thinking what tune i shall whistle he laughed  and instead of boxing his ears she considered him in earnest  you think i want to give you whats good for you she asked  i hope so but love should give a sense of freedom not of prison miriam made me feel tied up like a donkey to a stake i must feed on her patch and nowhere else its sickening  and would you let a woman do as she likes  yes ill see that she likes to love me if she doesntwell i dont hold her  if you were as wonderful as you say replied clara  i should be the marvel i am he laughed  there was a silence in which they hated each other though they laughed  loves a dog in a manger he said  and which of us is the dog she asked  oh well you of course  so there went on a battle between them she knew she never fully had him some part big and vital in him she had no hold over nor did she ever try to get it or even to realise what it was and he knew in some way that she held herself still as mrs dawes she did not love dawes never had loved him but she believed he loved her at least depended on her she felt a certain surety about him that she never felt with paul morel her passion for the young man had filled her soul given her a certain satisfaction eased her of her selfmistrust her doubt whatever else she was she was inwardly assured it was almost as if she had gained herself and stood now distinct and complete she had received her confirmation but she never believed that her life belonged to paul morel nor his to her they would separate in the end and the rest of her life would be an ache after him but at any rate she knew now she was sure of herself and the same could almost be said of him together they had received the baptism of life each through the other but now their missions were separate where he wanted to go she could not come with him they would have to part sooner or later even if they married and were faithful to each other still he would have to leave her go on alone and she would only have to attend to him when he came home but it was not possible each wanted a mate to go side by side with  clara had gone to live with her mother upon mapperley plains one evening as paul and she were walking along woodborough road they met dawes morel knew something about the bearing of the man approaching but he was absorbed in his thinking at the moment so that only his artists eye watched the form of the stranger then he suddenly turned to clara with a laugh and put his hand on her shoulder saying laughing  but we walk side by side and yet im in london arguing with an imaginary orpen and where are you  at that instant dawes passed almost touching morel the young man glanced saw the dark brown eyes burning full of hate and yet tired  who was that he asked of clara  it was baxter she replied  paul took his hand from her shoulder and glanced round then he saw again distinctly the mans form as it approached him dawes still walked erect with his fine shoulders flung back and his face lifted but there was a furtive look in his eyes that gave one the impression he was trying to get unnoticed past every person he met glancing suspiciously to see what they thought of him and his hands seemed to be wanting to hide he wore old clothes the trousers were torn at the knee and the handkerchief tied round his throat was dirty but his cap was still defiantly over one eye as she saw him clara felt guilty there was a tiredness and despair on his face that made her hate him because it hurt her  he looks shady said paul  but the note of pity in his voice reproached her and made her feel hard  his true commonness comes out she answered  do you hate him he asked  you talk she said about the cruelty of women i wish you knew the cruelty of men in their brute force they simply dont know that the woman exists  dont i he said  no she answered  dont i know you exist  about me you know nothing she said bitterlyabout me  no more than baxter knew he asked  perhaps not as much  he felt puzzled and helpless and angry there she walked unknown to him though they had been through such experience together  but you know me pretty well he said  she did not answer  did you know baxter as well as you know me he asked  he wouldnt let me she said  and i have let you know me  its what men wont let you do they wont let you get really near to them she said  and havent i let you  yes she answered slowly but youve never come near to me you cant come out of yourself you cant baxter could do that better than you  he walked on pondering he was angry with her for preferring baxter to him  you begin to value baxter now youve not got him he said  no i can only see where he was different from you  but he felt she had a grudge against him  one evening as they were coming home over the fields she startled him by asking  do you think its worth itthethe sex part  the act of loving itself  yes is it worth anything to you  but how can you separate it he said its the culmination of everything all our intimacy culminates then  not for me she said  he was silent a flash of hate for her came up after all she was dissatisfied with him even there where he thought they fulfilled each other but he believed her too implicitly  i feel she continued slowly as if i hadnt got you as if all of you werent there and as if it werent me you were taking  who then  something just for yourself it has been fine so that i darent think of it but is it me you want or is it it  he again felt guilty did he leave clara out of count and take simply women but he thought that was splitting a hair  when i had baxter actually had him then i did feel as if i had all of him she said  and it was better he asked  yes yes it was more whole i dont say you havent given me more than he ever gave me  or could give you  yes perhaps but youve never given me yourself  he knitted his brows angrily  if i start to make love to you he said i just go like a leaf down the wind  and leave me out of count she said  and then is it nothing to you he asked almost rigid with chagrin  its something and sometimes you have carried me awayright awayi knowandi reverence you for itbut  dont but me he said kissing her quickly as a fire ran through him  she submitted and was silent  it was true as he said as a rule when he started lovemaking the emotion was strong enough to carry with it everythingreason soul bloodin a great sweep like the trent carries bodily its backswirls and intertwinings noiselessly gradually the little criticisms the little sensations were lost thought also went everything borne along in one flood he became not a man with a mind but a great instinct his hands were like creatures living his limbs his body were all life and consciousness subject to no will of his but living in themselves just as he was so it seemed the vigorous wintry stars were strong also with life he and they struck with the same pulse of fire and the same joy of strength which held the brackenfrond stiff near his eyes held his own body firm it was as if he and the stars and the dark herbage and clara were licked up in an immense tongue of flame which tore onwards and upwards everything rushed along in living beside him everything was still perfect in itself along with him this wonderful stillness in each thing in itself while it was being borne along in a very ecstasy of living seemed the highest point of bliss  and clara knew this held him to her so she trusted altogether to the passion it however failed her very often they did not often reach again the height of that once when the peewits had called gradually some mechanical effort spoilt their loving or when they had splendid moments they had them separately and not so satisfactorily so often he seemed merely to be running on alone often they realised it had been a failure not what they had wanted he left her knowing that evening had only made a little split between them their loving grew more mechanical without the marvellous glamour gradually they began to introduce novelties to get back some of the feeling of satisfaction they would be very near almost dangerously near to the river so that the black water ran not far from his face and it gave a little thrill or they loved sometimes in a little hollow below the fence of the path where people were passing occasionally on the edge of the town and they heard footsteps coming almost felt the vibration of the tread and they heard what the passersby saidstrange little things that were never intended to be heard and afterwards each of them was rather ashamed and these things caused a distance between the two of them he began to despise her a little as if she had merited it  one night he left her to go to daybrook station over the fields it was very dark with an attempt at snow although the spring was so far advanced morel had not much time he plunged forward the town ceases almost abruptly on the edge of a steep hollow there the houses with their yellow lights stand up against the darkness he went over the stile and dropped quickly into the hollow of the fields under the orchard one warm window shone in swineshead farm paul glanced round behind the houses stood on the brim of the dip black against the sky like wild beasts glaring curiously with yellow eyes down into the darkness it was the town that seemed savage and uncouth glaring on the clouds at the back of him some creature stirred under the willows of the farm pond it was too dark to distinguish anything  he was close up to the next stile before he saw a dark shape leaning against it the man moved aside  goodevening he said  goodevening morel answered not noticing  paul morel said the man  then he knew it was dawes the man stopped his way  ive got yer have i he said awkwardly  i shall miss my train said paul  he could see nothing of dawess face the mans teeth seemed to chatter as he talked  youre going to get it from me now said dawes  morel attempted to move forward the other man stepped in front of him  are yer goin to take that topcoat off he said or are you goin to lie down to it  paul was afraid the man was mad  but he said i dont know how to fight  all right then answered dawes and before the younger man knew where he was he was staggering backwards from a blow across the face  the whole night went black he tore off his overcoat and coat dodging a blow and flung the garments over dawes the latter swore savagely morel in his shirtsleeves was now alert and furious he felt his whole body unsheath itself like a claw he could not fight so he would use his wits the other man became more distinct to him he could see particularly the shirtbreast dawes stumbled over pauls coats then came rushing forward the young mans mouth was bleeding it was the other mans mouth he was dying to get at and the desire was anguish in its strength he stepped quickly through the stile and as dawes was coming through after him like a flash he got a blow in over the others mouth he shivered with pleasure dawes advanced slowly spitting paul was afraid he moved round to get to the stile again suddenly from out of nowhere came a great blow against his ear that sent him falling helpless backwards he heard dawess heavy panting like a wild beasts then came a kick on the knee giving him such agony that he got up and quite blind leapt clean under his enemys guard he felt blows and kicks but they did not hurt he hung on to the bigger man like a wild cat till at last dawes fell with a crash losing his presence of mind paul went down with him pure instinct brought his hands to the mans neck and before dawes in frenzy and agony could wrench him free he had got his fists twisted in the scarf and his knuckles dug in the throat of the other man he was a pure instinct without reason or feeling his body hard and wonderful in itself cleaved against the struggling body of the other man not a muscle in him relaxed he was quite unconscious only his body had taken upon itself to kill this other man for himself he had neither feeling nor reason he lay pressed hard against his adversary his body adjusting itself to its one pure purpose of choking the other man resisting exactly at the right moment with exactly the right amount of strength the struggles of the other silent intent unchanging gradually pressing its knuckles deeper feeling the struggles of the other body become wilder and more frenzied tighter and tighter grew his body like a screw that is gradually increasing in pressure till something breaks  then suddenly he relaxed full of wonder and misgiving dawes had been yielding morel felt his body flame with pain as he realised what he was doing he was all bewildered dawess struggles suddenly renewed themselves in a furious spasm pauls hands were wrenched torn out of the scarf in which they were knotted and he was flung away helpless he heard the horrid sound of the others gasping but he lay stunned then still dazed he felt the blows of the others feet and lost consciousness  dawes grunting with pain like a beast was kicking the prostrate body of his rival suddenly the whistle of the train shrieked two fields away he turned round and glared suspiciously what was coming he saw the lights of the train draw across his vision it seemed to him people were approaching he made off across the field into nottingham and dimly in his consciousness as he went he felt on his foot the place where his boot had knocked against one of the lads bones the knock seemed to reecho inside him he hurried to get away from it  morel gradually came to himself he knew where he was and what had happened but he did not want to move he lay still with tiny bits of snow tickling his face it was pleasant to lie quite quite still the time passed it was the bits of snow that kept rousing him when he did not want to be roused at last his will clicked into action  i mustnt lie here he said its silly  but still he did not move  i said i was going to get up he repeated why dont i  and still it was some time before he had sufficiently pulled himself together to stir then gradually he got up pain made him sick and dazed but his brain was clear reeling he groped for his coats and got them on buttoning his overcoat up to his ears it was some time before he found his cap he did not know whether his face was still bleeding walking blindly every step making him sick with pain he went back to the pond and washed his face and hands the icy water hurt but helped to bring him back to himself he crawled back up the hill to the tram he wanted to get to his motherhe must get to his motherthat was his blind intention he covered his face as much as he could and struggled sickly along continually the ground seemed to fall away from him as he walked and he felt himself dropping with a sickening feeling into space so like a nightmare he got through with the journey home  everybody was in bed he looked at himself his face was discoloured and smeared with blood almost like a dead mans face he washed it and went to bed the night went by in delirium in the morning he found his mother looking at him her blue eyesthey were all he wanted to see she was there he was in her hands  its not much mother he said it was baxter dawes  tell me where it hurts you she said quietly  i dont knowmy shoulder say it was a bicycle accident mother  he could not move his arm presently minnie the little servant came upstairs with some tea  your mothers nearly frightened me out of my witsfainted away she said  he felt he could not bear it his mother nursed him he told her about it  and now i should have done with them all she said quietly  i will mother  she covered him up  and dont think about it she saidonly try to go to sleep the doctor wont be here till eleven  he had a dislocated shoulder and the second day acute bronchitis set in his mother was pale as death now and very thin she would sit and look at him then away into space there was something between them that neither dared mention clara came to see him afterwards he said to his mother  she makes me tired mother  yes i wish she wouldnt come mrs morel replied  another day miriam came but she seemed almost like a stranger to him  you know i dont care about them mother he said  im afraid you dont my son she replied sadly  it was given out everywhere that it was a bicycle accident soon he was able to go to work again but now there was a constant sickness and gnawing at his heart he went to clara but there seemed as it were nobody there he could not work he and his mother seemed almost to avoid each other there was some secret between them which they could not bear he was not aware of it he only knew that his life seemed unbalanced as if it were going to smash into pieces  clara did not know what was the matter with him she realised that he seemed unaware of her even when he came to her he seemed unaware of her always he was somewhere else she felt she was clutching for him and he was somewhere else it tortured her and so she tortured him for a month at a time she kept him at arms length he almost hated her and was driven to her in spite of himself he went mostly into the company of men was always at the george or the white horse his mother was ill distant quiet shadowy he was terrified of something he dared not look at her her eyes seemed to grow darker her face more waxen still she dragged about at her work  at whitsuntide he said he would go to blackpool for four days with his friend newton the latter was a big jolly fellow with a touch of the bounder about him paul said his mother must go to sheffield to stay a week with annie who lived there perhaps the change would do her good mrs morel was attending a womans doctor in nottingham he said her heart and her digestion were wrong she consented to go to sheffield though she did not want to but now she would do everything her son wished of her paul said he would come for her on the fifth day and stay also in sheffield till the holiday was up it was agreed  the two young men set off gaily for blackpool mrs morel was quite lively as paul kissed her and left her once at the station he forgot everything four days were clearnot an anxiety not a thought the two young men simply enjoyed themselves paul was like another man none of himself remainedno clara no miriam no mother that fretted him he wrote to them all and long letters to his mother but they were jolly letters that made her laugh he was having a good time as young fellows will in a place like blackpool and underneath it all was a shadow for her  paul was very gay excited at the thought of staying with his mother in sheffield newton was to spend the day with them their train was late joking laughing with their pipes between their teeth the young men swung their bags on to the tramcar paul had bought his mother a little collar of real lace that he wanted to see her wear so that he could tease her about it  annie lived in a nice house and had a little maid paul ran gaily up the steps he expected his mother laughing in the hall but it was annie who opened to him she seemed distant to him he stood a second in dismay annie let him kiss her cheek  is my mother ill he said  yes shes not very well dont upset her  is she in bed  yes  and then the queer feeling went over him as if all the sunshine had gone out of him and it was all shadow he dropped the bag and ran upstairs hesitating he opened the door his mother sat up in bed wearing a dressinggown of oldrose colour she looked at him almost as if she were ashamed of herself pleading to him humble he saw the ashy look about her  mother he said  i thought you were never coming she answered gaily  but he only fell on his knees at the bedside and buried his face in the bedclothes crying in agony and saying  mothermothermother  she stroked his hair slowly with her thin hand  dont cry she said dont cryits nothing  but he felt as if his blood was melting into tears and he cried in terror and pain  dontdont cry his mother faltered  slowly she stroked his hair shocked out of himself he cried and the tears hurt in every fibre of his body suddenly he stopped but he dared not lift his face out of the bedclothes  you are late where have you been his mother asked  the train was late he replied muffled in the sheet  yes that miserable central is newton come  yes  im sure you must be hungry and theyve kept dinner waiting  with a wrench he looked up at her  what is it mother he asked brutally  she averted her eyes as she answered  only a bit of a tumour my boy you neednt trouble its been therethe lump hasa long time  up came the tears again his mind was clear and hard but his body was crying  where he said  she put her hand on her side  here but you know they can sweal a tumour away  he stood feeling dazed and helpless like a child he thought perhaps it was as she said yes he reassured himself it was so but all the while his blood and his body knew definitely what it was he sat down on the bed and took her hand she had never had but the one ringher weddingring  when were you poorly he asked  it was yesterday it began she answered submissively  pains  yes but not more than ive often had at home i believe dr ansell is an alarmist  you ought not to have travelled alone he said to himself more than to her  as if that had anything to do with it she answered quickly  they were silent for a while  now go and have your dinner she said you must be hungry  have you had yours  yes a beautiful sole i had annie is good to me  they talked a little while then he went downstairs he was very white and strained newton sat in miserable sympathy  after dinner he went into the scullery to help annie to wash up the little maid had gone on an errand  is it really a tumour he asked  annie began to cry again  the pain she had yesterdayi never saw anybody suffer like it she cried leonard ran like a madman for dr ansell and when shed got to bed she said to me annie look at this lump on my side i wonder what it is and there i looked and i thought i should have dropped paul as true as im here its a lump as big as my double fist i said good gracious mother whenever did that come why child she said its been there a long time i thought i should have died our paul i did shes been having these pains for months at home and nobody looking after her  the tears came to his eyes then dried suddenly  but shes been attending the doctor in nottinghamand she never told me he said  if id have been at home said annie i should have seen for myself  he felt like a man walking in unrealities in the afternoon he went to see the doctor the latter was a shrewd lovable man  but what is it he said  the doctor looked at the young man then knitted his fingers  it may be a large tumour which has formed in the membrane he said slowly and which we may be able to make go away  cant you operate asked paul  not there replied the doctor  are you sure  quite  paul meditated a while  are you sure its a tumour he asked why did dr jameson in nottingham never find out anything about it shes been going to him for weeks and hes treated her for heart and indigestion  mrs morel never told dr jameson about the lump said the doctor  and do you know its a tumour  no i am not sure  what else might it be you asked my sister if there was cancer in the family might it be cancer  i dont know  and what shall you do  i should like an examination with dr jameson  then have one  you must arrange about that his fee wouldnt be less than ten guineas to come here from nottingham  when would you like him to come  i will call in this evening and we will talk it over  paul went away biting his lip  his mother could come downstairs for tea the doctor said her son went upstairs to help her she wore the oldrose dressinggown that leonard had given annie and with a little colour in her face was quite young again  but you look quite pretty in that he said  yes they make me so fine i hardly know myself she answered  but when she stood up to walk the colour went paul helped her halfcarrying her at the top of the stairs she was gone he lifted her up and carried her quickly downstairs laid her on the couch she was light and frail her face looked as if she were dead with blue lips shut tight her eyes openedher blue unfailing eyesand she looked at him pleadingly almost wanting him to forgive her he held brandy to her lips but her mouth would not open all the time she watched him lovingly she was only sorry for him the tears ran down his face without ceasing but not a muscle moved he was intent on getting a little brandy between her lips soon she was able to swallow a teaspoonful she lay back so tired the tears continued to run down his face  but she panted itll go off dont cry  im not doing he said  after a while she was better again he was kneeling beside the couch they looked into each others eyes  i dont want you to make a trouble of it she said  no mother youll have to be quite still and then youll get better soon  but he was white to the lips and their eyes as they looked at each other understood her eyes were so bluesuch a wonderful forgetmenot blue he felt if only they had been of a different colour he could have borne it better his heart seemed to be ripping slowly in his breast he kneeled there holding her hand and neither said anything then annie came in  are you all right she murmured timidly to her mother  of course said mrs morel  paul sat down and told her about blackpool she was curious  a day or two after he went to see dr jameson in nottingham to arrange for a consultation paul had practically no money in the world but he could borrow  his mother had been used to go to the public consultation on saturday morning when she could see the doctor for only a nominal sum her son went on the same day the waitingroom was full of poor women who sat patiently on a bench around the wall paul thought of his mother in her little black costume sitting waiting likewise the doctor was late the women all looked rather frightened paul asked the nurse in attendance if he could see the doctor immediately he came it was arranged so the women sitting patiently round the walls of the room eyed the young man curiously  at last the doctor came he was about forty goodlooking brownskinned his wife had died and he who had loved her had specialised on womens ailments paul told his name and his mothers the doctor did not remember  number fortysix m said the nurse and the doctor looked up the case in his book  there is a big lump that may be a tumour said paul but dr ansell was going to write you a letter  ah yes replied the doctor drawing the letter from his pocket he was very friendly affable busy kind he would come to sheffield the next day  what is your father he asked  he is a coalminer replied paul  not very well off i suppose  thisi see after this said paul  and you smiled the doctor  i am a clerk in jordans appliance factory  the doctor smiled at him  erto go to sheffield he said putting the tips of his fingers together and smiling with his eyes eight guineas  thank you said paul flushing and rising and youll come tomorrow  tomorrowsunday yes can you tell me about what time there is a train in the afternoon  there is a central gets in at fourfifteen  and will there be any way of getting up to the house shall i have to walk the doctor smiled  there is the tram said paul the western park tram  the doctor made a note of it  thank you he said and shook hands  then paul went on home to see his father who was left in the charge of minnie walter morel was getting very grey now paul found him digging in the garden he had written him a letter he shook hands with his father  hello son tha has landed then said the father  yes replied the son but im going back tonight  are ter beguy exclaimed the collier an has ter eaten owt  no  thats just like thee said morel come thy ways in  the father was afraid of the mention of his wife the two went indoors paul ate in silence his father with earthy hands and sleeves rolled up sat in the armchair opposite and looked at him  well an how is she asked the miner at length in a little voice  she can sit up she can be carried down for tea said paul  thats a blessin exclaimed morel i hope we sll soon be havin her whoam then an whats that nottingham doctor say  hes going tomorrow to have an examination of her  is he beguy thats a tidy penny im thinkin  eight guineas  eight guineas the miner spoke breathlessly well we mun find it from somewhere  i can pay that said paul  there was silence between them for some time  she says she hopes youre getting on all right with minnie paul said  yes im all right an i wish as she was answered morel but minnies a good little wench bless er heart he sat looking dismal  i sll have to be going at halfpast three said paul  its a trapse for thee lad eight guineas an when dost think shell be able to get as far as this  we must see what the doctors say tomorrow paul said  morel sighed deeply the house seemed strangely empty and paul thought his father looked lost forlorn and old  youll have to go and see her next week father he said  i hope shell be awhoam by that time said morel  if shes not said paul then you must come  i dunno wheer i sll find th money said morel  and ill write to you what the doctor says said paul  but tha writes i such a fashion i canna mae it out said morel  well ill write plain  it was no good asking morel to answer for he could scarcely do more than write his own name  the doctor came leonard felt it his duty to meet him with a cab the examination did not take long annie arthur paul and leonard were waiting in the parlour anxiously the doctors came down paul glanced at them he had never had any hope except when he had deceived himself  it may be a tumour we must wait and see said dr jameson  and if it is said annie can you sweal it away  probably said the doctor  paul put eight sovereigns and half a sovereign on the table the doctor counted them took a florin out of his purse and put that down  thank you he said im sorry mrs morel is so ill but we must see what we can do  there cant be an operation said paul  the doctor shook his head  no he said and even if there could her heart wouldnt stand it  is her heart risky asked paul  yes you must be careful with her  very risky  noerno no just take care  and the doctor was gone  then paul carried his mother downstairs she lay simply like a child but when he was on the stairs she put her arms round his neck clinging  im so frightened of these beastly stairs she said  and he was frightened too he would let leonard do it another time he felt he could not carry her  he thinks its only a tumour cried annie to her mother and he can sweal it away  i knew he could protested mrs morel scornfully  she pretended not to notice that paul had gone out of the room he sat in the kitchen smoking then he tried to brush some grey ash off his coat he looked again it was one of his mothers grey hairs it was so long he held it up and it drifted into the chimney he let go the long grey hair floated and was gone in the blackness of the chimney  the next day he kissed her before going back to work it was very early in the morning and they were alone  you wont fret my boy she said  no mother  no it would be silly and take care of yourself  yes he answered then after a while and i shall come next saturday and shall bring my father  i suppose he wants to come she replied at any rate if he does youll have to let him  he kissed her again and stroked the hair from her temples gently tenderly as if she were a lover  shant you be late she murmured  im going he said very low  still he sat a few minutes stroking the brown and grey hair from her temples  and you wont be any worse mother  no my son  you promise me  yes i wont be any worse  he kissed her held her in his arms for a moment and was gone in the early sunny morning he ran to the station crying all the way he did not know what for and her blue eyes were wide and staring as she thought of him  in the afternoon he went a walk with clara they sat in the little wood where bluebells were standing he took her hand  youll see he said to clara shell never be better  oh you dont know replied the other  i do he said  she caught him impulsively to her breast  try and forget it dear she said try and forget it  i will he answered  her breast was there warm for him her hands were in his hair it was comforting and he held his arms round her but he did not forget he only talked to clara of something else and it was always so when she felt it coming the agony she cried to him  dont think of it paul dont think of it my darling  and she pressed him to her breast rocked him soothed him like a child so he put the trouble aside for her sake to take it up again immediately he was alone all the time as he went about he cried mechanically his mind and hands were busy he cried he did not know why it was his blood weeping he was just as much alone whether he was with clara or with the men in the white horse just himself and this pressure inside him that was all that existed he read sometimes he had to keep his mind occupied and clara was a way of occupying his mind  on the saturday walter morel went to sheffield he was a forlorn figure looking rather as if nobody owned him paul ran upstairs  my fathers come he said kissing his mother  has he she answered wearily  the old collier came rather frightened into the bedroom  how dun i find thee lass he said going forward and kissing her in a hasty timid fashion  well im middlin she replied  i see tha art he said he stood looking down on her then he wiped his eyes with his handkerchief helpless and as if nobody owned him he looked  have you gone on all right asked the wife rather wearily as if it were an effort to talk to him  yis he answered ers a bit behinthand now and again as yer might expect  does she have your dinner ready asked mrs morel  well ive ad to shout at er once or twice he said  and you must shout at her if shes not ready she will leave things to the last minute  she gave him a few instructions he sat looking at her as if she were almost a stranger to him before whom he was awkward and humble and also as if he had lost his presence of mind and wanted to run this feeling that he wanted to run away that he was on thorns to be gone from so trying a situation and yet must linger because it looked better made his presence so trying he put up his eyebrows for misery and clenched his fists on his knees feeling so awkward in presence of big trouble  mrs morel did not change much she stayed in sheffield for two months if anything at the end she was rather worse but she wanted to go home annie had her children mrs morel wanted to go home so they got a motorcar from nottinghamfor she was too ill to go by trainand she was driven through the sunshine it was just august everything was bright and warm under the blue sky they could all see she was dying yet she was jollier than she had been for weeks they all laughed and talked  annie she exclaimed i saw a lizard dart on that rock  her eyes were so quick she was still so full of life  morel knew she was coming he had the front door open everybody was on tiptoe half the street turned out they heard the sound of the great motorcar mrs morel smiling drove home down the street  and just look at them all come out to see me she said but there i suppose i should have done the same how do you do mrs mathews how are you mrs harrison  they none of them could hear but they saw her smile and nod and they all saw death on her face they said it was a great event in the street  morel wanted to carry her indoors but he was too old arthur took her as if she were a child they had set her a big deep chair by the hearth where her rockingchair used to stand when she was unwrapped and seated and had drunk a little brandy she looked round the room  dont think i dont like your house annie she said but its nice to be in my own home again  and morel answered huskily  it is lass it is  and minnie the little quaint maid said  an we glad t ave yer  there was a lovely yellow ravel of sunflowers in the garden she looked out of the window  there are my sunflowers she said    chapter xiv  the release  by the way said dr ansell one evening when morel was in sheffield weve got a man in the fever hospital here who comes from nottinghamdawes he doesnt seem to have many belongings in this world  baxter dawes paul exclaimed  thats the manhas been a fine fellow physically i should think been in a bit of a mess lately you know him  he used to work at the place where i am  did he do you know anything about him hes just sulking or hed be a lot better than he is by now  i dont know anything of his home circumstances except that hes separated from his wife and has been a bit down i believe but tell him about me will you tell him ill come and see him  the next time morel saw the doctor he said  and what about dawes  i said to him answered the other do you know a man from nottingham named morel and he looked at me as if hed jump at my throat so i said i see you know the name its paul morel then i told him about your saying you would go and see him what does he want he said as if you were a policeman  and did he say he would see me asked paul  he wouldnt say anythinggood bad or indifferent replied the doctor  why not  thats what i want to know there he lies and sulks day in day out cant get a word of information out of him  do you think i might go asked paul  you might  there was a feeling of connection between the rival men more than ever since they had fought in a way morel felt guilty towards the other and more or less responsible and being in such a state of soul himself he felt an almost painful nearness to dawes who was suffering and despairing too besides they had met in a naked extremity of hate and it was a bond at any rate the elemental man in each had met  he went down to the isolation hospital with dr ansells card this sister a healthy young irishwoman led him down the ward  a visitor to see you jim crow she said  dawes turned over suddenly with a startled grunt  eh  caw she mocked he can only say caw i have brought you a gentleman to see you now say thank you and show some manners  dawes looked swiftly with his dark startled eyes beyond the sister at paul his look was full of fear mistrust hate and misery morel met the swift dark eyes and hesitated the two men were afraid of the naked selves they had been  dr ansell told me you were here said morel holding out his hand  dawes mechanically shook hands  so i thought id come in continued paul  there was no answer dawes lay staring at the opposite wall  say caw mocked the nurse say caw jim crow  he is getting on all right said paul to her  oh yes he lies and imagines hes going to die said the nurse and it frightens every word out of his mouth  and you must have somebody to talk to laughed morel  thats it laughed the nurse only two old men and a boy who always cries it is hard lines here am i dying to hear jim crows voice and nothing but an odd caw will he give  so rough on you said morel  isnt it said the nurse  i suppose i am a godsend he laughed  oh dropped straight from heaven laughed the nurse  presently she left the two men alone dawes was thinner and handsome again but life seemed low in him as the doctor said he was lying sulking and would not move forward towards convalescence he seemed to grudge every beat of his heart  have you had a bad time asked paul  suddenly again dawes looked at him  what are you doing in sheffield he asked  my mother was taken ill at my sisters in thurston street what are you doing here  there was no answer  how long have you been in morel asked  i couldnt say for sure dawes answered grudgingly  he lay staring across at the wall opposite as if trying to believe morel was not there paul felt his heart go hard and angry  dr ansell told me you were here he said coldly  the other man did not answer  typhoids pretty bad i know morel persisted  suddenly dawes said  what did you come for  because dr ansell said you didnt know anybody here do you  i know nobody nowhere said dawes  well said paul its because you dont choose to then  there was another silence  we sll be taking my mother home as soon as we can said paul  whats amatter with her asked dawes with a sick mans interest in illness  shes got a cancer  there was another silence  but we want to get her home said paul we sll have to get a motorcar  dawes lay thinking  why dont you ask thomas jordan to lend you his said dawes  its not big enough morel answered  dawes blinked his dark eyes as he lay thinking  then ask jack pilkington hed lend it you you know him  i think i sll hire one said paul  youre a fool if you do said dawes  the sick man was gaunt and handsome again paul was sorry for him because his eyes looked so tired  did you get a job here he asked  i was only here a day or two before i was taken bad dawes replied  you want to get in a convalescent home said paul  the others face clouded again  im goin in no convalescent home he said  my fathers been in the one at seathorpe an he liked it dr ansell would get you a recommend  dawes lay thinking it was evident he dared not face the world again  the seaside would be all right just now morel said sun on those sandhills and the waves not far out  the other did not answer  by gad paul concluded too miserable to bother much its all right when you know youre going to walk again and swim  dawes glanced at him quickly the mans dark eyes were afraid to meet any other eyes in the world but the real misery and helplessness in pauls tone gave him a feeling of relief  is she far gone he asked  shes going like wax paul answered but cheerfullively  he bit his lip after a minute he rose  well ill be going he said ill leave you this halfcrown  i dont want it dawes muttered  morel did not answer but left the coin on the table  well he said ill try and run in when im back in sheffield happen you might like to see my brotherinlaw he works in pyecrofts  i dont know him said dawes  hes all right should i tell him to come he might bring you some papers to look at  the other man did not answer paul went the strong emotion that dawes aroused in him repressed made him shiver  he did not tell his mother but next day he spoke to clara about this interview it was in the dinnerhour the two did not often go out together now but this day he asked her to go with him to the castle grounds there they sat while the scarlet geraniums and the yellow calceolarias blazed in the sunlight she was now always rather protective and rather resentful towards him  did you know baxter was in sheffield hospital with typhoid he asked  she looked at him with startled grey eyes and her face went pale  no she said frightened  hes getting better i went to see him yesterdaythe doctor told me  clara seemed stricken by the news  is he very bad she asked guiltily  he has been hes mending now  what did he say to you  oh nothing he seems to be sulking  there was a distance between the two of them he gave her more information  she went about shut up and silent the next time they took a walk together she disengaged herself from his arm and walked at a distance from him he was wanting her comfort badly  wont you be nice with me he asked  she did not answer  whats the matter he said putting his arm across her shoulder  dont she said disengaging herself  he left her alone and returned to his own brooding  is it baxter that upsets you he asked at length  i have been vile to him she said  ive said many a time you havent treated him well he replied  and there was a hostility between them each pursued his own train of thought  ive treated himno ive treated him badly she said and now you treat me badly it serves me right  how do i treat you badly he said  it serves me right she repeated i never considered him worth having and now you dont consider me but it serves me right he loved me a thousand times better than you ever did  he didnt protested paul  he did at any rate he did respect me and thats what you dont do  it looked as if he respected you he said  he did and i made him horridi know i did youve taught me that and he loved me a thousand times better than ever you do  all right said paul  he only wanted to be left alone now he had his own trouble which was almost too much to bear clara only tormented him and made him tired he was not sorry when he left her  she went on the first opportunity to sheffield to see her husband the meeting was not a success but she left him roses and fruit and money she wanted to make restitution it was not that she loved him as she looked at him lying there her heart did not warm with love only she wanted to humble herself to him to kneel before him she wanted now to be selfsacrificial after all she had failed to make morel really love her she was morally frightened she wanted to do penance so she kneeled to dawes and it gave him a subtle pleasure but the distance between them was still very greattoo great it frightened the man it almost pleased the woman she liked to feel she was serving him across an insuperable distance she was proud now  morel went to see dawes once or twice there was a sort of friendship between the two men who were all the while deadly rivals but they never mentioned the woman who was between them  mrs morel got gradually worse at first they used to carry her downstairs sometimes even into the garden she sat propped in her chair smiling and so pretty the gold weddingring shone on her white hand her hair was carefully brushed and she watched the tangled sunflowers dying the chrysanthemums coming out and the dahlias  paul and she were afraid of each other he knew and she knew that she was dying but they kept up a pretence of cheerfulness every morning when he got up he went into her room in his pyjamas  did you sleep my dear he asked  yes she answered  not very well  well yes  then he knew she had lain awake he saw her hand under the bedclothes pressing the place on her side where the pain was  has it been bad he asked  no it hurt a bit but nothing to mention  and she sniffed in her old scornful way as she lay she looked like a girl and all the while her blue eyes watched him but there were the dark paincircles beneath that made him ache again  its a sunny day he said  its a beautiful day  do you think youll be carried down  i shall see  then he went away to get her breakfast all day long he was conscious of nothing but her it was a long ache that made him feverish then when he got home in the early evening he glanced through the kitchen window she was not there she had not got up  he ran straight upstairs and kissed her he was almost afraid to ask  didnt you get up pigeon  no she said it was that morphia it made me tired  i think he gives you too much he said  i think he does she answered  he sat down by the bed miserably she had a way of curling and lying on her side like a child the grey and brown hair was loose over her ear  doesnt it tickle you he said gently putting it back  it does she replied  his face was near hers her blue eyes smiled straight into his like a girlswarm laughing with tender love it made him pant with terror agony and love  you want your hair doing in a plait he said lie still  and going behind her he carefully loosened her hair brushed it out it was like fine long silk of brown and grey her head was snuggled between her shoulders as he lightly brushed and plaited her hair he bit his lip and felt dazed it all seemed unreal he could not understand it  at night he often worked in her room looking up from time to time and so often he found her blue eyes fixed on him and when their eyes met she smiled he worked away again mechanically producing good stuff without knowing what he was doing  sometimes he came in very pale and still with watchful sudden eyes like a man who is drunk almost to death they were both afraid of the veils that were ripping between them  then she pretended to be better chattered to him gaily made a great fuss over some scraps of news for they had both come to the condition when they had to make much of the trifles lest they should give in to the big thing and their human independence would go smash they were afraid so they made light of things and were gay  sometimes as she lay he knew she was thinking of the past her mouth gradually shut hard in a line she was holding herself rigid so that she might die without ever uttering the great cry that was tearing from her he never forgot that hard utterly lonely and stubborn clenching of her mouth which persisted for weeks sometimes when it was lighter she talked about her husband now she hated him she did not forgive him she could not bear him to be in the room and a few things the things that had been most bitter to her came up again so strongly that they broke from her and she told her son  he felt as if his life were being destroyed piece by piece within him often the tears came suddenly he ran to the station the teardrops falling on the pavement often he could not go on with his work the pen stopped writing he sat staring quite unconscious and when he came round again he felt sick and trembled in his limbs he never questioned what it was his mind did not try to analyse or understand he merely submitted and kept his eyes shut let the thing go over him  his mother did the same she thought of the pain of the morphia of the next day hardly ever of the death that was coming she knew she had to submit to it but she would never entreat it or make friends with it blind with her face shut hard and blind she was pushed towards the door the days passed the weeks the months  sometimes in the sunny afternoons she seemed almost happy  i try to think of the nice timeswhen we went to mablethorpe and robin hoods bay and shanklin she said after all not everybody has seen those beautiful places and wasnt it beautiful i try to think of that not of the other things  then again for a whole evening she spoke not a word neither did he they were together rigid stubborn silent he went into his room at last to go to bed and leaned against the doorway as if paralysed unable to go any farther his consciousness went a furious storm he knew not what seemed to ravage inside him he stood leaning there submitting never questioning  in the morning they were both normal again though her face was grey with the morphia and her body felt like ash but they were bright again nevertheless often especially if annie or arthur were at home he neglected her he did not see much of clara usually he was with men he was quick and active and lively but when his friends saw him go white to the gills his eyes dark and glittering they had a certain mistrust of him sometimes he went to clara but she was almost cold to him  take me he said simply  occasionally she would but she was afraid when he had her then there was something in it that made her shrink away from himsomething unnatural she grew to dread him he was so quiet yet so strange she was afraid of the man who was not there with her whom she could feel behind this makebelief lover somebody sinister that filled her with horror she began to have a kind of horror of him it was almost as if he were a criminal he wanted herhe had herand it made her feel as if death itself had her in its grip she lay in horror there was no man there loving her she almost hated him then came little bouts of tenderness but she dared not pity him  dawes had come to colonel seelys home near nottingham there paul visited him sometimes clara very occasionally between the two men the friendship developed peculiarly dawes who mended very slowly and seemed very feeble seemed to leave himself in the hands of morel  in the beginning of november clara reminded paul that it was her birthday  id nearly forgotten he said  id thought quite she replied  no shall we go to the seaside for the weekend  they went it was cold and rather dismal she waited for him to be warm and tender with her instead of which he seemed hardly aware of her he sat in the railwaycarriage looking out and was startled when she spoke to him he was not definitely thinking things seemed as if they did not exist she went across to him  what is it dear she asked  nothing he said dont those windmill sails look monotonous  he sat holding her hand he could not talk nor think it was a comfort however to sit holding her hand she was dissatisfied and miserable he was not with her she was nothing  and in the evening they sat among the sandhills looking at the black heavy sea  she will never give in he said quietly  claras heart sank  no she replied  there are different ways of dying my fathers people are frightened and have to be hauled out of life into death like cattle into a slaughterhouse pulled by the neck but my mothers people are pushed from behind inch by inch they are stubborn people and wont die  yes said clara  and she wont die she cant mr renshaw the parson was in the other day think he said to her you will have your mother and father and your sisters and your son in the other land and she said i have done without them for a long time and can do without them now it is the living i want not the dead she wants to live even now  oh how horrible said clara too frightened to speak  and she looks at me and she wants to stay with me he went on monotonously shes got such a will it seems as if she would never gonever  dont think of it cried clara  and she was religiousshe is religious nowbut it is no good she simply wont give in and do you know i said to her on thursday mother if i had to die id die id will to die and she said to me sharp do you think i havent do you think you can die when you like  his voice ceased he did not cry only went on speaking monotonously clara wanted to run she looked round there was the black reechoing shore the dark sky down on her she got up terrified she wanted to be where there was light where there were other people she wanted to be away from him he sat with his head dropped not moving a muscle  and i dont want her to eat he said and she knows it when i ask her shall you have anything shes almost afraid to say yes ill have a cup of bengers she says itll only keep your strength up i said to her yesand she almost criedbut theres such a gnawing when i eat nothing i cant bear it so i went and made her the food its the cancer that gnaws like that at her i wish shed die  come said clara roughly im going  he followed her down the darkness of the sands he did not come to her he seemed scarcely aware of her existence and she was afraid of him and disliked him  in the same acute daze they went back to nottingham he was always busy always doing something always going from one to the other of his friends  on the monday he went to see baxter dawes listless and pale the man rose to greet the other clinging to his chair as he held out his hand  you shouldnt get up said paul  dawes sat down heavily eyeing morel with a sort of suspicion  dont you waste your time on me he said if youve owt better to do  i wanted to come said paul here i brought you some sweets  the invalid put them aside  its not been much of a weekend said morel  hows your mother asked the other  hardly any different  i thought she was perhaps worse being as you didnt come on sunday  i was at skegness said paul i wanted a change  the other looked at him with dark eyes he seemed to be waiting not quite daring to ask trusting to be told  i went with clara said paul  i knew as much said dawes quietly  it was an old promise said paul  you have it your own way said dawes  this was the first time clara had been definitely mentioned between them  nay said morel slowly shes tired of me  again dawes looked at him  since august shes been getting tired of me morel repeated  the two men were very quiet together paul suggested a game of draughts they played in silence  i sll go abroad when my mothers dead said paul  abroad repeated dawes  yes i dont care what i do  they continued the game dawes was winning  i sll have to begin a new start of some sort said paul and you as well i suppose  he took one of dawess pieces  i dunno where said the other  things have to happen morel said its no good doing anythingat leastno i dont know give me some toffee  the two men ate sweets and began another game of draughts  what made that scar on your mouth asked dawes  paul put his hand hastily to his lips and looked over the garden  i had a bicycle accident he said  dawess hand trembled as he moved the piece  you shouldnt ha laughed at me he said very low  when  that night on woodborough road when you and her passed meyou with your hand on her shoulder  i never laughed at you said paul  dawes kept his fingers on the draughtpiece  i never knew you were there till the very second when you passed said morel  it was that as did me dawes said very low  paul took another sweet  i never laughed he said except as im always laughing  they finished the game  that night morel walked home from nottingham in order to have something to do the furnaces flared in a red blotch over bulwell the black clouds were like a low ceiling as he went along the ten miles of highroad he felt as if he were walking out of life between the black levels of the sky and the earth but at the end was only the sickroom if he walked and walked for ever there was only that place to come to  he was not tired when he got near home or he did not know it across the field he could see the red firelight leaping in her bedroom window  when shes dead he said to himself that fire will go out  he took off his boots quietly and crept upstairs his mothers door was wide open because she slept alone still the red firelight dashed its glow on the landing soft as a shadow he peeped in her doorway  paul she murmured  his heart seemed to break again he went in and sat by the bed  how late you are she murmured  not very he said  why what time is it the murmur came plaintive and helpless  its only just gone eleven  that was not true it was nearly one oclock  oh she said i thought it was later  and he knew the unutterable misery of her nights that would not go  cant you sleep my pigeon he said  no i cant she wailed  never mind little he said crooning never mind my love ill stop with you half an hour my pigeon then perhaps it will be better  and he sat by the bedside slowly rhythmically stroking her brows with his fingertips stroking her eyes shut soothing her holding her fingers in his free hand they could hear the sleepers breathing in the other rooms  now go to bed she murmured lying quite still under his fingers and his love  will you sleep he asked  yes i think so  you feel better my little dont you  yes she said like a fretful halfsoothed child  still the days and the weeks went by he hardly ever went to see clara now but he wandered restlessly from one person to another for some help and there was none anywhere miriam had written to him tenderly he went to see her her heart was very sore when she saw him white gaunt with his eyes dark and bewildered her pity came up hurting her till she could not bear it  how is she she asked  the samethe same he said the doctor says she cant last but i know she will shell be here at christmas  miriam shuddered she drew him to her she pressed him to her bosom she kissed him and kissed him he submitted but it was torture she could not kiss his agony that remained alone and apart she kissed his face and roused his blood while his soul was apart writhing with the agony of death and she kissed him and fingered his body till at last feeling he would go mad he got away from her it was not what he wanted just thennot that and she thought she had soothed him and done him good  december came and some snow he stayed at home all the while now they could not afford a nurse annie came to look after her mother the parish nurse whom they loved came in morning and evening paul shared the nursing with annie often in the evenings when friends were in the kitchen with them they all laughed together and shook with laughter it was reaction paul was so comical annie was so quaint the whole party laughed till they cried trying to subdue the sound and mrs morel lying alone in the darkness heard them and among her bitterness was a feeling of relief  then paul would go upstairs gingerly guiltily to see if she had heard  shall i give you some milk he asked  a little she replied plaintively  and he would put some water with it so that it should not nourish her yet he loved her more than his own life  she had morphia every night and her heart got fitful annie slept beside her paul would go in in the early morning when his sister got up his mother was wasted and almost ashen in the morning with the morphia darker and darker grew her eyes all pupil with the torture in the mornings the weariness and ache were too much to bear yet she could notwould notweep or even complain much  you slept a bit later this morning little one he would say to her  did i she answered with fretful weariness  yes its nearly eight oclock  he stood looking out of the window the whole country was bleak and pallid under the snow then he felt her pulse there was a strong stroke and a weak one like a sound and its echo that was supposed to betoken the end she let him feel her wrist knowing what he wanted  sometimes they looked in each others eyes then they almost seemed to make an agreement it was almost as if he were agreeing to die also but she did not consent to die she would not her body was wasted to a fragment of ash her eyes were dark and full of torture  cant you give her something to put an end to it he asked the doctor at last  but the doctor shook his head  she cant last many days now mr morel he said  paul went indoors  i cant bear it much longer we shall all go mad said annie  the two sat down to breakfast  go and sit with her while we have breakfast minnie said annie but the girl was frightened  paul went through the country through the woods over the snow he saw the marks of rabbits and birds in the white snow he wandered miles and miles a smoky red sunset came on slowly painfully lingering he thought she would die that day there was a donkey that came up to him over the snow by the woods edge and put its head against him and walked with him alongside he put his arms round the donkeys neck and stroked his cheeks against his ears  his mother silent was still alive with her hard mouth gripped grimly her eyes of dark torture only living  it was nearing christmas there was more snow annie and he felt as if they could go on no more still her dark eyes were alive morel silent and frightened obliterated himself sometimes he would go into the sickroom and look at her then he backed out bewildered  she kept her hold on life still the miners had been out on strike and returned a fortnight or so before christmas minnie went upstairs with the feedingcup it was two days after the men had been in  have the men been saying their hands are sore minnie she asked in the faint querulous voice that would not give in minnie stood surprised  not as i know of mrs morel she answered  but ill bet they are sore said the dying woman as she moved her head with a sigh of weariness but at any rate therell be something to buy in with this week  not a thing did she let slip  your fathers pit things will want well airing annie she said when the men were going back to work  dont you bother about that my dear said annie  one night annie and paul were alone nurse was upstairs  shell live over christmas said annie they were both full of horror she wont he replied grimly i sll give her morphia  which said annie  all that came from sheffield said paul  aydo said annie  the next day he was painting in the bedroom she seemed to be asleep he stepped softly backwards and forwards at his painting suddenly her small voice wailed  dont walk about paul  he looked round her eyes like dark bubbles in her face were looking at him  no my dear he said gently another fibre seemed to snap in his heart  that evening he got all the morphia pills there were and took them downstairs carefully he crushed them to powder  what are you doing said annie  i sll put em in her night milk  then they both laughed together like two conspiring children on top of all their horror flicked this little sanity  nurse did not come that night to settle mrs morel down paul went up with the hot milk in a feedingcup it was nine oclock  she was reared up in bed and he put the feedingcup between her lips that he would have died to save from any hurt she took a sip then put the spout of the cup away and looked at him with her dark wondering eyes he looked at her  oh it is bitter paul she said making a little grimace  its a new sleeping draught the doctor gave me for you he said he thought it would leave you in such a state in the morning  and i hope it wont she said like a child  she drank some more of the milk  but it is horrid she said  he saw her frail fingers over the cup her lips making a little move  i knowi tasted it he said but ill give you some clean milk afterwards  i think so she said and she went on with the draught she was obedient to him like a child he wondered if she knew he saw her poor wasted throat moving as she drank with difficulty then he ran downstairs for more milk there were no grains in the bottom of the cup  has she had it whispered annie  yesand she said it was bitter  oh laughed annie putting her under lip between her teeth  and i told her it was a new draught wheres that milk  they both went upstairs  i wonder why nurse didnt come to settle me down complained the mother like a child wistfully  she said she was going to a concert my love replied annie  did she  they were silent a minute mrs morel gulped the little clean milk  annie that draught was horrid she said plaintively  was it my love well never mind  the mother sighed again with weariness her pulse was very irregular  let us settle you down said annie perhaps nurse will be so late  ay said the mothertry  they turned the clothes back paul saw his mother like a girl curled up in her flannel nightdress quickly they made one half of the bed moved her made the other straightened her nightgown over her small feet and covered her up  there said paul stroking her softly therenow youll sleep  yes she said i didnt think you could do the bed so nicely she added almost gaily then she curled up with her cheek on her hand her head snugged between her shoulders paul put the long thin plait of grey hair over her shoulder and kissed her  youll sleep my love he said  yes she answered trustfully goodnight  they put out the light and it was still  morel was in bed nurse did not come annie and paul came to look at her at about eleven she seemed to be sleeping as usual after her draught her mouth had come a bit open  shall we sit up said paul  i sll lie with her as i always do said annie she might wake up  all right and call me if you see any difference  yes  they lingered before the bedroom fire feeling the night big and black and snowy outside their two selves alone in the world at last he went into the next room and went to bed  he slept almost immediately but kept waking every now and again then he went sound asleep he started awake at annies whispered paul paul he saw his sister in her white nightdress with her long plait of hair down her back standing in the darkness  yes he whispered sitting up  come and look at her  he slipped out of bed a bud of gas was burning in the sick chamber his mother lay with her cheek on her hand curled up as she had gone to sleep but her mouth had fallen open and she breathed with great hoarse breaths like snoring and there were long intervals between  shes going he whispered  yes said annie  how long has she been like it  i only just woke up  annie huddled into the dressinggown paul wrapped himself in a brown blanket it was three oclock he mended the fire then the two sat waiting the great snoring breath was takenheld awhilethen given back there was a spacea long space then they started the great snoring breath was taken again he bent close down and looked at her  isnt it awful whispered annie  he nodded they sat down again helplessly again came the great snoring breath again they hung suspended again it was given back long and harsh the sound so irregular at such wide intervals sounded through the house morel in his room slept on paul and annie sat crouched huddled motionless the great snoring sound began againthere was a painful pause while the breath was heldback came the rasping breath minute after minute passed paul looked at her again bending low over her  she may last like this he said  they were both silent he looked out of the window and could faintly discern the snow on the garden  you go to my bed he said to annie ill sit up  no she said ill stop with you  id rather you didnt he said  at last annie crept out of the room and he was alone he hugged himself in his brown blanket crouched in front of his mother watching she looked dreadful with the bottom jaw fallen back he watched sometimes he thought the great breath would never begin again he could not bear itthe waiting then suddenly startling him came the great harsh sound he mended the fire again noiselessly she must not be disturbed the minutes went by the night was going breath by breath each time the sound came he felt it wring him till at last he could not feel so much  his father got up paul heard the miner drawing his stockings on yawning then morel in shirt and stockings entered  hush said paul  morel stood watching then he looked at his son helplessly and in horror  had i better stop awhoam he whispered  no go to work shell last through tomorrow  i dont think so  yes go to work  the miner looked at her again in fear and went obediently out of the room paul saw the tape of his garters swinging against his legs  after another halfhour paul went downstairs and drank a cup of tea then returned morel dressed for the pit came upstairs again  am i to go he said  yes  and in a few minutes paul heard his fathers heavy steps go thudding over the deadening snow miners called in the streets as they tramped in gangs to work the terrible longdrawn breaths continuedheaveheaveheave then a long pausethenahhhhh as it came back far away over the snow sounded the hooters of the ironworks one after another they crowed and boomed some small and far away some near the blowers of the collieries and the other works then there was silence he mended the fire the great breaths broke the silenceshe looked just the same he put back the blind and peered out still it was dark perhaps there was a lighter tinge perhaps the snow was bluer he drew up the blind and got dressed then shuddering he drank brandy from the bottle on the washstand the snow was growing blue he heard a cart clanking down the street yes it was seven oclock and it was coming a little bit light he heard some people calling the world was waking a grey deathly dawn crept over the snow yes he could see the houses he put out the gas it seemed very dark the breathing came still but he was almost used to it he could see her she was just the same he wondered if he piled heavy clothes on top of her it would stop he looked at her that was not hernot her a bit if he piled the blanket and heavy coats on her  suddenly the door opened and annie entered she looked at him questioningly  just the same he said calmly  they whispered together a minute then he went downstairs to get breakfast it was twenty to eight soon annie came down  isnt it awful doesnt she look awful she whispered dazed with horror  he nodded  if she looks like that said annie  drink some tea he said  they went upstairs again soon the neighbours came with their frightened question  how is she  it went on just the same she lay with her cheek in her hand her mouth fallen open and the great ghastly snores came and went  at ten oclock nurse came she looked strange and woebegone  nurse cried paul shell last like this for days  she cant mr morel said nurse she cant  there was a silence  isnt it dreadful wailed the nurse who would have thought she could stand it go down now mr morel go down  at last at about eleven oclock he went downstairs and sat in the neighbours house annie was downstairs also nurse and arthur were upstairs paul sat with his head in his hand suddenly annie came flying across the yard crying half mad  paulpaulshes gone  in a second he was back in his own house and upstairs she lay curled up and still with her face on her hand and nurse was wiping her mouth they all stood back he kneeled down and put his face to hers and his arms round her  my lovemy loveoh my love he whispered again and again my loveoh my love  then he heard the nurse behind him crying saying  shes better mr morel shes better  when he took his face up from his warm dead mother he went straight downstairs and began blacking his boots  there was a good deal to do letters to write and so on the doctor came and glanced at her and sighed  aypoor thing he said then turned away well call at the surgery about six for the certificate  the father came home from work at about four oclock he dragged silently into the house and sat down minnie bustled to give him his dinner tired he laid his black arms on the table there were swede turnips for his dinner which he liked paul wondered if he knew it was some time and nobody had spoken at last the son said  you noticed the blinds were down  morel looked up  no he said whyhas she gone  yes  when wor that  about twelve this morning  hm  the miner sat still for a moment then began his dinner it was as if nothing had happened he ate his turnips in silence afterwards he washed and went upstairs to dress the door of her room was shut  have you seen her annie asked of him when he came down  no he said  in a little while he went out annie went away and paul called on the undertaker the clergyman the doctor the registrar it was a long business he got back at nearly eight oclock the undertaker was coming soon to measure for the coffin the house was empty except for her he took a candle and went upstairs  the room was cold that had been warm for so long flowers bottles plates all sickroom litter was taken away everything was harsh and austere she lay raised on the bed the sweep of the sheet from the raised feet was like a clean curve of snow so silent she lay like a maiden asleep with his candle in his hand he bent over her she lay like a girl asleep and dreaming of her love the mouth was a little open as if wondering from the suffering but her face was young her brow clear and white as if life had never touched it he looked again at the eyebrows at the small winsome nose a bit on one side she was young again only the hair as it arched so beautifully from her temples was mixed with silver and the two simple plaits that lay on her shoulders were filigree of silver and brown she would wake up she would lift her eyelids she was with him still he bent and kissed her passionately but there was coldness against his mouth he bit his lips with horror looking at her he felt he could never never let her go no he stroked the hair from her temples that too was cold he saw the mouth so dumb and wondering at the hurt then he crouched on the floor whispering to her  mother mother  he was still with her when the undertakers came young men who had been to school with him they touched her reverently and in a quiet businesslike fashion they did not look at her he watched jealously he and annie guarded her fiercely they would not let anybody come to see her and the neighbours were offended  after a while paul went out of the house and played cards at a friends it was midnight when he got back his father rose from the couch as he entered saying in a plaintive way  i thought tha wor niver comin lad  i didnt think youd sit up said paul  his father looked so forlorn morel had been a man without fearsimply nothing frightened him paul realised with a start that he had been afraid to go to bed alone in the house with his dead he was sorry  i forgot youd be alone father he said  dost want owt to eat asked morel  no  sitheei made thee a drop o hot milk get it down thee its cold enough for owt  paul drank it  after a while morel went to bed he hurried past the closed door and left his own door open soon the son came upstairs also he went in to kiss her goodnight as usual it was cold and dark he wished they had kept her fire burning still she dreamed her young dream but she would be cold  my dear he whispered my dear  and he did not kiss her for fear she should be cold and strange to him it eased him she slept so beautifully he shut her door softly not to wake her and went to bed  in the morning morel summoned his courage hearing annie downstairs and paul coughing in the room across the landing he opened her door and went into the darkened room he saw the white uplifted form in the twilight but her he dared not see bewildered too frightened to possess any of his faculties he got out of the room again and left her he never looked at her again he had not seen her for months because he had not dared to look and she looked like his young wife again  have you seen her annie asked of him sharply after breakfast  yes he said  and dont you think she looks nice  yes  he went out of the house soon after and all the time he seemed to be creeping aside to avoid it  paul went about from place to place doing the business of the death he met clara in nottingham and they had tea together in a cafe when they were quite jolly again she was infinitely relieved to find he did not take it tragically  later when the relatives began to come for the funeral the affair became public and the children became social beings they put themselves aside they buried her in a furious storm of rain and wind the wet clay glistened all the white flowers were soaked annie gripped his arm and leaned forward down below she saw a dark corner of williams coffin the oak box sank steadily she was gone the rain poured in the grave the procession of black with its umbrellas glistening turned away the cemetery was deserted under the drenching cold rain  paul went home and busied himself supplying the guests with drinks his father sat in the kitchen with mrs morels relatives superior people and wept and said what a good lass shed been and how hed tried to do everything he could for hereverything he had striven all his life to do what he could for her and hed nothing to reproach himself with she was gone but hed done his best for her he wiped his eyes with his white handkerchief hed nothing to reproach himself for he repeated all his life hed done his best for her  and that was how he tried to dismiss her he never thought of her personally everything deep in him he denied paul hated his father for sitting sentimentalising over her he knew he would do it in the publichouses for the real tragedy went on in morel in spite of himself sometimes later he came down from his afternoon sleep white and cowering  i have been dreaming of thy mother he said in a small voice  have you father when i dream of her its always just as she was when she was well i dream of her often but it seems quite nice and natural as if nothing had altered  but morel crouched in front of the fire in terror  the weeks passed halfreal not much pain not much of anything perhaps a little relief mostly a nuit blanche paul went restless from place to place for some months since his mother had been worse he had not made love to clara she was as it were dumb to him rather distant dawes saw her very occasionally but the two could not get an inch across the great distance between them the three of them were drifting forward  dawes mended very slowly he was in the convalescent home at skegness at christmas nearly well again paul went to the seaside for a few days his father was with annie in sheffield dawes came to pauls lodgings his time in the home was up the two men between whom was such a big reserve seemed faithful to each other dawes depended on morel now he knew paul and clara had practically separated  two days after christmas paul was to go back to nottingham the evening before he sat with dawes smoking before the fire  you know claras coming down for the day tomorrow he said  the other man glanced at him  yes you told me he replied  paul drank the remainder of his glass of whisky  i told the landlady your wife was coming he said  did you said dawes shrinking but almost leaving himself in the others hands he got up rather stiffly and reached for morels glass  let me fill you up he said  paul jumped up  you sit still he said  but dawes with rather shaky hand continued to mix the drink  say when he said  thanks replied the other but youve no business to get up  it does me good lad replied dawes i begin to think im right again then  you are about right you know  i am certainly i am said dawes nodding to him  and len says he can get you on in sheffield  dawes glanced at him again with dark eyes that agreed with everything the other would say perhaps a trifle dominated by him  its funny said paul starting again i feel in a lot bigger mess than you  in what way lad  i dont know i dont know its as if i was in a tangled sort of hole rather dark and dreary and no road anywhere  i knowi understand it dawes said nodding but youll find itll come all right  he spoke caressingly  i suppose so said paul  dawes knocked his pipe in a hopeless fashion  youve not done for yourself like i have he said  morel saw the wrist and the white hand of the other man gripping the stem of the pipe and knocking out the ash as if he had given up  how old are you paul asked  thirtynine replied dawes glancing at him  those brown eyes full of the consciousness of failure almost pleading for reassurance for someone to reestablish the man in himself to warm him to set him up firm again troubled paul  youll just be in your prime said morel you dont look as if much life had gone out of you  the brown eyes of the other flashed suddenly  it hasnt he said the go is there  paul looked up and laughed  weve both got plenty of life in us yet to make things fly he said  the eyes of the two men met they exchanged one look having recognised the stress of passion each in the other they both drank their whisky  yes begod said dawes breathless  there was a pause  and i dont see said paul why you shouldnt go on where you left off  what said dawes suggestively  yesfit your old home together again  dawes hid his face and shook his head  couldnt be done he said and looked up with an ironic smile  why because you dont want  perhaps  they smoked in silence dawes showed his teeth as he bit his pipe stem  you mean you dont want her asked paul  dawes stared up at the picture with a caustic expression on his face  i hardly know he said  the smoke floated softly up  i believe she wants you said paul  do you replied the other soft satirical abstract  yes she never really hitched on to meyou were always there in the background thats why she wouldnt get a divorce  dawes continued to stare in a satirical fashion at the picture over the mantelpiece  thats how women are with me said paul they want me like mad but they dont want to belong to me and she belonged to you all the time i knew  the triumphant male came up in dawes he showed his teeth more distinctly  perhaps i was a fool he said  you were a big fool said morel  but perhaps even then you were a bigger fool said dawes  there was a touch of triumph and malice in it  do you think so said paul  they were silent for some time  at any rate im clearing out tomorrow said morel  i see answered dawes  then they did not talk any more the instinct to murder each other had returned they almost avoided each other  they shared the same bedroom when they retired dawes seemed abstract thinking of something he sat on the side of the bed in his shirt looking at his legs  arent you getting cold asked morel  i was lookin at these legs replied the other  whats up with em they look all right replied paul from his bed  they look all right but theres some water in em yet  and what about it  come and look  paul reluctantly got out of bed and went to look at the rather handsome legs of the other man that were covered with glistening dark gold hair  look here said dawes pointing to his shin look at the water under here  where said paul  the man pressed in his fingertips they left little dents that filled up slowly  its nothing said paul  you feel said dawes  paul tried with his fingers it made little dents  hm he said  rotten isnt it said dawes  why its nothing much  youre not much of a man with water in your legs  i cant see as it makes any difference said morel ive got a weak chest  he returned to his own bed  i suppose the rest of mes all right said dawes and he put out the light  in the morning it was raining morel packed his bag the sea was grey and shaggy and dismal he seemed to be cutting himself off from life more and more it gave him a wicked pleasure to do it  the two men were at the station clara stepped out of the train and came along the platform very erect and coldly composed she wore a long coat and a tweed hat both men hated her for her composure paul shook hands with her at the barrier dawes was leaning against the bookstall watching his black overcoat was buttoned up to the chin because of the rain he was pale with almost a touch of nobility in his quietness he came forward limping slightly  you ought to look better than this she said  oh im all right now  the three stood at a loss she kept the two men hesitating near her  shall we go to the lodging straight off said paul or somewhere else  we may as well go home said dawes  paul walked on the outside of the pavement then dawes then clara they made polite conversation the sittingroom faced the sea whose tide grey and shaggy hissed not far off  morel swung up the big armchair  sit down jack he said  i dont want that chair said dawes  sit down morel repeated  clara took off her things and laid them on the couch she had a slight air of resentment lifting her hair with her fingers she sat down rather aloof and composed paul ran downstairs to speak to the landlady  i should think youre cold said dawes to his wife come nearer to the fire  thank you im quite warm she answered  she looked out of the window at the rain and at the sea  when are you going back she asked  well the rooms are taken until tomorrow so he wants me to stop hes going back tonight  and then youre thinking of going to sheffield  yes  are you fit to start work  im going to start  youve really got a place  yesbegin on monday  you dont look fit  why dont i  she looked again out of the window instead of answering  and have you got lodgings in sheffield  yes  again she looked away out of the window the panes were blurred with streaming rain  and can you manage all right she asked  i sd think so i sll have to  they were silent when morel returned  i shall go by the fourtwenty he said as he entered  nobody answered  i wish youd take your boots off he said to clara  theres a pair of slippers of mine  thank you she said they arent wet  he put the slippers near her feet she left them there  morel sat down both the men seemed helpless and each of them had a rather hunted look but dawes now carried himself quietly seemed to yield himself while paul seemed to screw himself up clara thought she had never seen him look so small and mean he was as if trying to get himself into the smallest possible compass and as he went about arranging and as he sat talking there seemed something false about him and out of tune watching him unknown she said to herself there was no stability about him he was fine in his way passionate and able to give her drinks of pure life when he was in one mood and now he looked paltry and insignificant there was nothing stable about him her husband had more manly dignity at any rate he did not waft about with any wind there was something evanescent about morel she thought something shifting and false he would never make sure ground for any woman to stand on she despised him rather for his shrinking together getting smaller her husband at least was manly and when he was beaten gave in but this other would never own to being beaten he would shift round and round prowl get smaller she despised him and yet she watched him rather than dawes and it seemed as if their three fates lay in his hands she hated him for it  she seemed to understand better now about men and what they could or would do she was less afraid of them more sure of herself that they were not the small egoists she had imagined them made her more comfortable she had learned a good dealalmost as much as she wanted to learn her cup had been full it was still as full as she could carry on the whole she would not be sorry when he was gone  they had dinner and sat eating nuts and drinking by the fire not a serious word had been spoken yet clara realised that morel was withdrawing from the circle leaving her the option to stay with her husband it angered her he was a mean fellow after all to take what he wanted and then give her back she did not remember that she herself had had what she wanted and really at the bottom of her heart wished to be given back  paul felt crumpled up and lonely his mother had really supported his life he had loved her they two had in fact faced the world together now she was gone and for ever behind him was the gap in life the tear in the veil through which his life seemed to drift slowly as if he were drawn towards death he wanted someone of their own free initiative to help him the lesser things he began to let go from him for fear of this big thing the lapse towards death following in the wake of his beloved clara could not stand for him to hold on to she wanted him but not to understand him he felt she wanted the man on top not the real him that was in trouble that would be too much trouble to her he dared not give it her she could not cope with him it made him ashamed so secretly ashamed because he was in such a mess because his own hold on life was so unsure because nobody held him feeling unsubstantial shadowy as if he did not count for much in this concrete world he drew himself together smaller and smaller he did not want to die he would not give in but he was not afraid of death if nobody would help he would go on alone  dawes had been driven to the extremity of life until he was afraid he could go to the brink of death he could lie on the edge and look in then cowed afraid he had to crawl back and like a beggar take what offered there was a certain nobility in it as clara saw he owned himself beaten and he wanted to be taken back whether or not that she could do for him it was three oclock  i am going by the fourtwenty said paul again to clara are you coming then or later  i dont know she said  im meeting my father in nottingham at sevenfifteen he said  then she answered ill come later  dawes jerked suddenly as if he had been held on a strain he looked out over the sea but he saw nothing  there are one or two books in the corner said morel ive done with em  at about four oclock he went  i shall see you both later he said as he shook hands  i suppose so said dawes an perhapsone dayi sll be able to pay you back the money as  i shall come for it youll see laughed paul i sll be on the rocks before im very much older  aywell said dawes  goodbye he said to clara  goodbye she said giving him her hand then she glanced at him for the last time dumb and humble  he was gone dawes and his wife sat down again  its a nasty day for travelling said the man  yes she answered  they talked in a desultory fashion until it grew dark the landlady brought in the tea dawes drew up his chair to the table without being invited like a husband then he sat humbly waiting for his cup she served him as she would like a wife not consulting his wish  after tea as it drew near to six oclock he went to the window all was dark outside the sea was roaring  its raining yet he said  is it she answered  you wont go tonight shall you he said hesitating  she did not answer he waited  i shouldnt go in this rain he said  do you want me to stay she asked  his hand as he held the dark curtain trembled  yes he said  he remained with his back to her she rose and went slowly to him he let go the curtain turned hesitating towards her she stood with her hands behind her back looking up at him in a heavy inscrutable fashion  do you want me baxter she asked  his voice was hoarse as he answered  do you want to come back to me  she made a moaning noise lifted her arms and put them round his neck drawing him to her he hid his face on her shoulder holding her clasped  take me back she whispered ecstatic take me back take me back and she put her fingers through his fine thin dark hair as if she were only semiconscious he tightened his grasp on her  do you want me again he murmured broken    chapter xv  derelict  clara went with her husband to sheffield and paul scarcely saw her again walter morel seemed to have let all the trouble go over him and there he was crawling about on the mud of it just the same there was scarcely any bond between father and son save that each felt he must not let the other go in any actual want as there was no one to keep on the home and as they could neither of them bear the emptiness of the house paul took lodgings in nottingham and morel went to live with a friendly family in bestwood  everything seemed to have gone smash for the young man he could not paint the picture he finished on the day of his mothers deathone that satisfied himwas the last thing he did at work there was no clara when he came home he could not take up his brushes again there was nothing left  so he was always in the town at one place or another drinking knocking about with the men he knew it really wearied him he talked to barmaids to almost any woman but there was that dark strained look in his eyes as if he were hunting something  everything seemed so different so unreal there seemed no reason why people should go along the street and houses pile up in the daylight there seemed no reason why these things should occupy the space instead of leaving it empty his friends talked to him he heard the sounds and he answered but why there should be the noise of speech he could not understand  he was most himself when he was alone or working hard and mechanically at the factory in the latter case there was pure forgetfulness when he lapsed from consciousness but it had to come to an end it hurt him so that things had lost their reality the first snowdrops came he saw the tiny droppearls among the grey they would have given him the liveliest emotion at one time now they were there but they did not seem to mean anything in a few moments they would cease to occupy that place and just the space would be where they had been tall brilliant tramcars ran along the street at night it seemed almost a wonder they should trouble to rustle backwards and forwards why trouble to go tilting down to trent bridges he asked of the big trams it seemed they just as well might not be as be  the realest thing was the thick darkness at night that seemed to him whole and comprehensible and restful he could leave himself to it suddenly a piece of paper started near his feet and blew along down the pavement he stood still rigid with clenched fists a flame of agony going over him and he saw again the sickroom his mother her eyes unconsciously he had been with her in her company the swift hop of the paper reminded him she was gone but he had been with her he wanted everything to stand still so that he could be with her again  the days passed the weeks but everything seemed to have fused gone into a conglomerated mass he could not tell one day from another one week from another hardly one place from another nothing was distinct or distinguishable often he lost himself for an hour at a time could not remember what he had done  one evening he came home late to his lodging the fire was burning low everybody was in bed he threw on some more coal glanced at the table and decided he wanted no supper then he sat down in the armchair it was perfectly still he did not know anything yet he saw the dim smoke wavering up the chimney presently two mice came out cautiously nibbling the fallen crumbs he watched them as it were from a long way off the church clock struck two far away he could hear the sharp clinking of the trucks on the railway no it was not they that were far away they were there in their places but where was he himself  the time passed the two mice careering wildly scampered cheekily over his slippers he had not moved a muscle he did not want to move he was not thinking of anything it was easier so there was no wrench of knowing anything then from time to time some other consciousness working mechanically flashed into sharp phrases  what am i doing  and out of the semiintoxicated trance came the answer  destroying myself  then a dull live feeling gone in an instant told him that it was wrong after a while suddenly came the question  why wrong  again there was no answer but a stroke of hot stubbornness inside his chest resisted his own annihilation  there was a sound of a heavy cart clanking down the road suddenly the electric light went out there was a bruising thud in the pennyintheslot meter he did not stir but sat gazing in front of him only the mice had scuttled and the fire glowed red in the dark room  then quite mechanically and more distinctly the conversation began again inside him  shes dead what was it all forher struggle  that was his despair wanting to go after her  youre alive  shes not  she isin you  suddenly he felt tired with the burden of it  youve got to keep alive for her sake said his will in him  something felt sulky as if it would not rouse  youve got to carry forward her living and what she had done go on with it  but he did not want to he wanted to give up  but you can go on with your painting said the will in him or else you can beget children they both carry on her effort  painting is not living  then live  marry whom came the sulky question  as best you can  miriam  but he did not trust that  he rose suddenly went straight to bed when he got inside his bedroom and closed the door he stood with clenched fist  mater my dear he began with the whole force of his soul then he stopped he would not say it he would not admit that he wanted to die to have done he would not own that life had beaten him or that death had beaten him going straight to bed he slept at once abandoning himself to the sleep  so the weeks went on always alone his soul oscillated first on the side of death then on the side of life doggedly the real agony was that he had nowhere to go nothing to do nothing to say and was nothing himself sometimes he ran down the streets as if he were mad sometimes he was mad things werent there things were there it made him pant sometimes he stood before the bar of the publichouse where he called for a drink everything suddenly stood back away from him he saw the face of the barmaid the gobbling drinkers his own glass on the slopped mahogany board in the distance there was something between him and them he could not get into touch he did not want them he did not want his drink turning abruptly he went out on the threshold he stood and looked at the lighted street but he was not of it or in it something separated him everything went on there below those lamps shut away from him he could not get at them he felt he couldnt touch the lampposts not if he reached where could he go there was nowhere to go neither back into the inn or forward anywhere he felt stifled there was nowhere for him the stress grew inside him he felt he should smash  i mustnt he said and turning blindly he went in and drank sometimes the drink did him good sometimes it made him worse he ran down the road for ever restless he went here there everywhere he determined to work but when he had made six strokes he loathed the pencil violently got up and went away hurried off to a club where he could play cards or billiards to a place where he could flirt with a barmaid who was no more to him than the brass pumphandle she drew  he was very thin and lanternjawed he dared not meet his own eyes in the mirror he never looked at himself he wanted to get away from himself but there was nothing to get hold of in despair he thought of miriam perhapsperhaps  then happening to go into the unitarian church one sunday evening when they stood up to sing the second hymn he saw her before him the light glistened on her lower lip as she sang she looked as if she had got something at any rate some hope in heaven if not in earth her comfort and her life seemed in the afterworld a warm strong feeling for her came up she seemed to yearn as she sang for the mystery and comfort he put his hope in her he longed for the sermon to be over to speak to her  the throng carried her out just before him he could nearly touch her she did not know he was there he saw the brown humble nape of her neck under its black curls he would leave himself to her she was better and bigger than he he would depend on her  she went wandering in her blind way through the little throngs of people outside the church she always looked so lost and out of place among people he went forward and put his hand on her arm she started violently her great brown eyes dilated in fear then went questioning at the sight of him he shrank slightly from her  i didnt know she faltered  nor i he said  he looked away his sudden flaring hope sank again  what are you doing in town he asked  im staying at cousin annes  ha for long  no only till tomorrow  must you go straight home  she looked at him then hid her face under her hatbrim  no she saidno its not necessary  he turned away and she went with him they threaded through the throng of church people the organ was still sounding in st marys dark figures came through the lighted doors people were coming down the steps the large coloured windows glowed up in the night the church was like a great lantern suspended they went down hollow stone and he took the car for the bridges  you will just have supper with me he said then ill bring you back  very well she replied low and husky  they scarcely spoke while they were on the car the trent ran dark and full under the bridge away towards colwick all was black night he lived down holme road on the naked edge of the town facing across the river meadows towards sneinton hermitage and the steep scrap of colwick wood the floods were out the silent water and the darkness spread away on their left almost afraid they hurried along by the houses  supper was laid he swung the curtain over the window there was a bowl of freesias and scarlet anemones on the table she bent to them still touching them with her fingertips she looked up at him saying  arent they beautiful  yes he said what will you drinkcoffee  i should like it she said  then excuse me a moment  he went out to the kitchen  miriam took off her things and looked round it was a bare severe room her photo claras annies were on the wall she looked on the drawingboard to see what he was doing there were only a few meaningless lines she looked to see what books he was reading evidently just an ordinary novel the letters in the rack she saw were from annie arthur and from some man or other she did not know everything he had touched everything that was in the least personal to him she examined with lingering absorption he had been gone from her for so long she wanted to rediscover him his position what he was now but there was not much in the room to help her it only made her feel rather sad it was so hard and comfortless  she was curiously examining a sketchbook when he returned with the coffee  theres nothing new in it he said and nothing very interesting  he put down the tray and went to look over her shoulder she turned the pages slowly intent on examining everything  hm he said as she paused at a sketch id forgotten that its not bad is it  no she said i dont quite understand it  he took the book from her and went through it again he made a curious sound of surprise and pleasure  theres some not bad stuff in there he said  not at all bad she answered gravely  he felt again her interest in his work or was it for himself why was she always most interested in him as he appeared in his work  they sat down to supper  by the way he said didnt i hear something about your earning your own living  yes she replied bowing her dark head over her cup and what of it  im merely going to the farming college at broughton for three months and i shall probably be kept on as a teacher there  i saythat sounds all right for you you always wanted to be independent  yes  why didnt you tell me  i only knew last week  but i heard a month ago he said  yes but nothing was settled then  i should have thought he said youd have told me you were trying  she ate her food in the deliberate constrained way almost as if she recoiled a little from doing anything so publicly that he knew so well  i suppose youre glad he said  very glad  yesit will be something  he was rather disappointed  i think it will be a great deal she said almost haughtily resentfully  he laughed shortly  why do you think it wont she asked  oh i dont think it wont be a great deal only youll find earning your own living isnt everything  no she said swallowing with difficulty i dont suppose it is  i suppose work can be nearly everything to a man he said though it isnt to me but a woman only works with a part of herself the real and vital part is covered up  but a man can give all himself to work she asked  yes practically  and a woman only the unimportant part of herself  thats it  she looked up at him and her eyes dilated with anger  then she said if its true its a great shame  it is but i dont know everything he answered  after supper they drew up to the fire he swung her a chair facing him and they sat down she was wearing a dress of dark claret colour that suited her dark complexion and her large features still the curls were fine and free but her face was much older the brown throat much thinner she seemed old to him older than clara her bloom of youth had quickly gone a sort of stiffness almost of woodenness had come upon her she meditated a little while then looked at him  and how are things with you she asked  about all right he answered  she looked at him waiting  nay she said very low  her brown nervous hands were clasped over her knee they had still the lack of confidence or repose the almost hysterical look he winced as he saw them then he laughed mirthlessly she put her fingers between her lips his slim black tortured body lay quite still in the chair she suddenly took her finger from her mouth and looked at him  and you have broken off with clara  yes  his body lay like an abandoned thing strewn in the chair  you know she said i think we ought to be married  he opened his eyes for the first time since many months and attended to her with respect  why he said  see she said how you waste yourself you might be ill you might die and i never knowbe no more then than if i had never known you  and if we married he asked  at any rate i could prevent you wasting yourself and being a prey to other womenlikelike clara  a prey he repeated smiling  she bowed her head in silence he lay feeling his despair come up again  im not sure he said slowly that marriage would be much good  i only think of you she replied  i know you do butyou love me so much you want to put me in your pocket and i should die there smothered  she bent her head put her fingers between her lips while the bitterness surged up in her heart  and what will you do otherwise she asked  i dont knowgo on i suppose perhaps i shall soon go abroad  the despairing doggedness in his tone made her go on her knees on the rug before the fire very near to him there she crouched as if she were crushed by something and could not raise her head his hands lay quite inert on the arms of his chair she was aware of them she felt that now he lay at her mercy if she could rise take him put her arms round him and say you are mine then he would leave himself to her but dare she she could easily sacrifice herself but dare she assert herself she was aware of his darkclothed slender body that seemed one stroke of life sprawled in the chair close to her but no she dared not put her arms round it take it up and say it is mine this body leave it to me and she wanted to it called to all her womans instinct but she crouched and dared not she was afraid he would not let her she was afraid it was too much it lay there his body abandoned she knew she ought to take it up and claim it and claim every right to it butcould she do it her impotence before him before the strong demand of some unknown thing in him was her extremity her hands fluttered she halflifted her head her eyes shuddering appealing gone almost distracted pleaded to him suddenly his heart caught with pity he took her hands drew her to him and comforted her  will you have me to marry me he said very low  oh why did not he take her her very soul belonged to him why would he not take what was his she had borne so long the cruelty of belonging to him and not being claimed by him now he was straining her again it was too much for her she drew back her head held his face between her hands and looked him in the eyes no he was hard he wanted something else she pleaded to him with all her love not to make it her choice she could not cope with it with him she knew not with what but it strained her till she felt she would break  do you want it she asked very gravely  not much he replied with pain  she turned her face aside then raising herself with dignity she took his head to her bosom and rocked him softly she was not to have him then so she could comfort him she put her fingers through his hair for her the anguished sweetness of selfsacrifice for him the hate and misery of another failure he could not bear itthat breast which was warm and which cradled him without taking the burden of him so much he wanted to rest on her that the feint of rest only tortured him he drew away  and without marriage we can do nothing he asked  his mouth was lifted from his teeth with pain she put her little finger between her lips  no she said low and like the toll of a bell no i think not  it was the end then between them she could not take him and relieve him of the responsibility of himself she could only sacrifice herself to himsacrifice herself every day gladly and that he did not want he wanted her to hold him and say with joy and authority stop all this restlessness and beating against death you are mine for a mate she had not the strength or was it a mate she wanted or did she want a christ in him  he felt in leaving her he was defrauding her of life but he knew that in staying stilling the inner desperate man he was denying his own life and he did not hope to give life to her by denying his own  she sat very quiet he lit a cigarette the smoke went up from it wavering he was thinking of his mother and had forgotten miriam she suddenly looked at him her bitterness came surging up her sacrifice then was useless he lay there aloof careless about her suddenly she saw again his lack of religion his restless instability he would destroy himself like a perverse child well then he would  i think i must go she said softly  by her tone he knew she was despising him he rose quietly  ill come along with you he answered  she stood before the mirror pinning on her hat how bitter how unutterably bitter it made her that he rejected her sacrifice life ahead looked dead as if the glow were gone out she bowed her face over the flowersthe freesias so sweet and springlike the scarlet anemones flaunting over the table it was like him to have those flowers  he moved about the room with a certain sureness of touch swift and relentless and quiet she knew she could not cope with him he would escape like a weasel out of her hands yet without him her life would trail on lifeless brooding she touched the flowers  have them he said and he took them out of the jar dripping as they were and went quickly into the kitchen she waited for him took the flowers and they went out together he talking she feeling dead  she was going from him now in her misery she leaned against him as they sat on the car he was unresponsive where would he go what would be the end of him she could not bear it the vacant feeling where he should be he was so foolish so wasteful never at peace with himself and now where would he go and what did he care that he wasted her he had no religion it was all for the moments attraction that he cared nothing else nothing deeper well she would wait and see how it turned out with him when he had had enough he would give in and come to her  he shook hands and left her at the door of her cousins house when he turned away he felt the last hold for him had gone the town as he sat upon the car stretched away over the bay of railway a level fume of lights beyond the town the country little smouldering spots for more townsthe seathe nighton and on and he had no place in it whatever spot he stood on there he stood alone from his breast from his mouth sprang the endless space and it was there behind him everywhere the people hurrying along the streets offered no obstruction to the void in which he found himself they were small shadows whose footsteps and voices could be heard but in each of them the same night the same silence he got off the car in the country all was dead still little stars shone high up little stars spread far away in the floodwaters a firmament below everywhere the vastness and terror of the immense night which is roused and stirred for a brief while by the day but which returns and will remain at last eternal holding everything in its silence and its living gloom there was no time only space who could say his mother had lived and did not live she had been in one place and was in another that was all and his soul could not leave her wherever she was now she was gone abroad into the night and he was with her still they were together but yet there was his body his chest that leaned against the stile his hands on the wooden bar they seemed something where was heone tiny upright speck of flesh less than an ear of wheat lost in the field he could not bear it on every side the immense dark silence seemed pressing him so tiny a spark into extinction and yet almost nothing he could not be extinct night in which everything was lost went reaching out beyond stars and sun stars and sun a few bright grains went spinning round for terror and holding each other in embrace there in a darkness that outpassed them all and left them tiny and daunted so much and himself infinitesimal at the core a nothingness and yet not nothing  mother he whisperedmother  she was the only thing that held him up himself amid all this and she was gone intermingled herself he wanted her to touch him have him alongside with her  but no he would not give in turning sharply he walked towards the citys gold phosphorescence his fists were shut his mouth set fast he would not take that direction to the darkness to follow her he walked towards the faintly humming glowing town quickly   the end
