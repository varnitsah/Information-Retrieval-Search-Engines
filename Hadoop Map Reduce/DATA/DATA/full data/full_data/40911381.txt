40911381	outlines of english and american literature  an introduction to the chief writers of england and america to the books they wrote and to the times in which they lived  by  william j long   this is the wey to al good aventurechaucer   to my sister millie in grateful remembrance of a lifelong sympathy   illustration william shakespeare  after the chandos portrait in the national portrait gallery london which is attributed to richard burbage or john taylor in the catalogue of the national portrait gallery the following description is given        the chandos shakespeare was the property of john taylor       the player by whom or by richard burbage it was painted       the picture was left by the former in his will to sir       william davenant after his death it was bought by       betterton the actor upon whose decease mr keck of the       temple purchased it for 40 guineas from whom it was       inherited by mr nicoll of michenden house southgate       middlesex whose only daughter married james marquess of       caernarvon afterwards duke of chandos father to ann       eliza duchess of buckingham      the above is written on paper attached to the back of the canvas     its authenticity however has been doubted in some quarters      purchased at the stowe sale september 1848 by the earl of     ellesmere and presented by him to the nation march 1856

put firstpascal  when an author has finished his history after months or years of happy work there comes a dismal hour when he must explain its purpose and apologize for its shortcomings  the explanation in this case is very simple and goes back to a personal experience when the author first studied the history of our literature there was put into his hands as a textbook a most dreary catalogue of dead authors dead masterpieces dead criticisms dead ages and a boy who knew chiefly that he was alive was supposed to become interested in this literary sepulchre or else have it said that there was something hopeless about him later he learned that the great writers of england and america were concerned with life alone as the most familiar the most mysterious the most fascinating thing in the world and that the only valuable or interesting feature of any work of literature is its vitality  to introduce these writers not as dead worthies but as companionable men and women and to present their living subject as a living thing winsome as a smile on a human facesuch was the authors purpose in writing this book  the apology is harder to frame as anyone knows who has attempted to gather the writers of a thousand years into a single volume that shall have the three virtues of brevity readableness and accuracy that this record is brief in view of the immensity of the subject is plainly apparent that it may prove pleasantly readable is a hope inspired chiefly by the fact that it was a pleasure to write it and that pleasure is contagious as for accuracy every historian who fears god or regards man strives hard enough for that virtue but after all his striving remembering the difficulty of criticism and the perversity of names and dates that tend to error as the sparks fly upward he must still trust heaven and send forth his work with something of chaucers feeling when he wrote    o littel bookë thou art so unconning   how darst thou put thyself in prees for drede  which may mean to one who appreciates chaucers wisdom and humor that having written a little book in what seemed to him an unskilled or unconning way he hesitated to give it to the world for dread of the prees or crowd of critics who even in that early day were wont to look upon each new book as a camel that must be put through the needles eye of their tender mercies  in the selection and arrangement of his material the author has aimed to make a usable book that may appeal to pupils and teachers alike because history and literature are closely related one being the record of mans deed the other of his thought and feeling there is a brief historical introduction to every literary period there is also a review of the general literary tendencies of each age of the fashions humors and ideals that influenced writers in forming their style or selecting their subject then there is a biography of every important author written not to offer another subject for heroworship but to present the man exactly as he was a review of his chief works which is intended chiefly as a guide to the best reading and a critical estimate or appreciation of his writings based partly upon firsthand impressions partly upon the assumption that an author must deal honestly with life as he finds it and that the business of criticism is as emerson said not to legislate but to raise the dead this detailed study of the greater writers of a period is followed by an examination of some of the minor writers and their memorable works finally each chapter concludes with a concise summary of the period under consideration a list of selections for reading and a bibliography of works that will be found most useful in acquiring a larger knowledge of the subject  in its general plan this little volume is modeled on the authors more advanced english literature and american literature but the material the viewpoint the presentation of individual writersall the details of the work are entirely new such a book is like a second journey through ample and beautiful regions filled with historic associations a journey that one undertakes with new companions with renewed pleasure and it is to be hoped with increased wisdom it is hardly necessary to add that our subject has still its unvoiced charms that it cannot be exhausted or even adequately presented in any number of histories for literature deals with life and life with its endlessly surprising variety in unity has happily some suggestion of infinity  william j long  stamford connecticut     contents   english literature

sleep yet i love to be wakened and love to see   the fresh young faces bending over me   and the faces of them that are old i love them too   for these as well in the days of their youth i knew                                          song of the well   what is literature in an old english book written before columbus dreamed of a westward journey to find the east is the story of a traveler who set out to search the world for wisdom through palestine and india he passed traveling by sea or land through many seasons till he came to a wonderful island where he saw a man plowing in the fields and the wonder was that the man was calling familiar words to his oxen such wordes as men speken to bestes in his owne lond startled by the sound of his mother tongue he turned back on his course in gret mervayle for he knewe not how it myghte be but if he had passed on a little says the old record he would have founden his contree and his owne knouleche  facing a new study of literature our impulse is to search in strange places for a definition but though we compass a world of books we must return at last like the worthy man of mandevilles travels to our own knowledge since childhood we have been familiar with this noble subject of literature we have entered into the heritage of the ancient greeks who thought that homer was a good teacher for the nursery we have made acquaintance with psalm and prophecy and parable with the knightly tales of malory with the fairy stories of grimm or andersen with the poetry of shakespeare with the novels of scott or dickensin short with some of the best books that the world has ever produced we know therefore what literature is and that it is an excellent thing which ministers to the joy of living but when we are asked to define the subject we are in the position of st augustine who said of time if you ask me what time is i know not but if you ask me not then i know for literature is like happiness or love or life itself in that it can be understood or appreciated but can never be exactly described it has certain describable qualities however and the best place to discover these is our own bookcase  sidenote the tree and the book  here on a shelf are a dictionary a history of america a text on chemistry which we read or study for information on a higher shelf are as you like it hiawatha lorna doone the oregon trail and other works to which we go for pleasure when the days work is done in one sense all these and all other books are literature for the root meaning of the word is letters and a letter means a character inscribed or rubbed upon a prepared surface a series of letters intelligently arranged forms a book and for the root meaning of book you must go to a tree because the latin word for book liber means the inner layer of bark that covers a tree bole and book or boc is the old english name for the beech on whose silvery surface our ancestors carved their first runic letters  so also when we turn the leaves of a book our mind goes back over a long trail through rattling printingshop and peaceful monks cell and gloomy cave with walls covered with picture writing till the trail ends beside a shadowy forest where primitive man takes a smooth leaf and inscribes his thought upon it by means of a pointed stick a tree is the adam of all books and everything that the hand of man has written upon the tree or its products or its substitutes is literature but that is too broad a definition we must limit it by excluding what does not here concern us  sidenote books of knowledge and of power  our first exclusion is of that immense class of writingsbooks of science history philosophy and the restto which we go for information these aim to preserve or to systematize the discoveries of men they appeal chiefly to the intellect and they are known as the literature of knowledge there remains another large class of writings sometimes called the literature of power consisting of poems plays essays stories of every kind to which we go treasurehunting for happiness or counsel for noble thoughts or fine feelings for rest of body or exercise of spiritfor almost everything in fine except information as chaucer said long ago such writings are    for pleasaunce high and for noon other end  they aim to give us pleasure they appeal chiefly to our imagination and our emotions they awaken in us a feeling of sympathy or admiration for whatever is beautiful in nature or society or the soul of man  sidenote the art of literature  the author who would attempt books of such high purpose must be careful of both the matter and the manner of his writing must give one thought to what he shall say and another thought to how he shall say it he selects the best or most melodious words the finest figures and aims to make his story or poem beautiful in itself as a painter strives to reflect a face or a landscape in a beautiful way any photographer can in a few minutes reproduce a human face but only an artist can by care and labor bring forth a beautiful portrait so any historian can write the facts of the battle of gettysburg but only a lincoln can in noble words reveal the beauty and immortal meaning of that mighty conflict  to all such written works which quicken our sense of the beautiful and which are as a jacobs ladder on which we mount for higher views of nature or humanity we confidently give the name literature meaning the art of literature in distinction from the mere craft of writing  sidenote the passing and the permanent  such a definition though it cuts out the greater part of human records is still too broad for our purpose and again we must limit it by a process of exclusion for to study almost any period of english letters is to discover that it produced hundreds of books which served the purpose of literature if only for a season by affording pleasure to readers no sooner were they written than time began to winnow them over and over giving them to all the winds of opinion one generation after another till the hosts of ephemeral works were swept aside and only a remnant was left in the hands of the winnower to this remnant books of abiding interest on which the years have no effect save to mellow or flavor them we give the name of great or enduring literature and with these chiefly we deal in our present study  sidenote the quality of greatness  to the inevitable question what are the marks of great literature no positive answer can be returned as a tree is judged by its fruits so is literature judged not by theory but by the effect which it produces on human life and the judgment is first personal then general if a book has power to awaken in you a lively sense of pleasure or a profound emotion of sympathy if it quickens your love of beauty or truth or goodness if it moves you to generous thought or noble action then that book is for you and for the time a great book if after ten or fifty years it still has power to quicken you then for you at least it is a great book forever and if it affects many other men and women as it affects you and if it lives with power from one generation to another gladdening the children as it gladdened the fathers then surely it is great literature without further qualification or need of definition from this viewpoint the greatest poem in the worldgreatest in that it abides in most human hearts as a loved and honored guestis not a mighty iliad or paradise lost or divine comedy it is a familiar little poem of a dozen lines beginning the lord is my shepherd  it is obvious that great literature which appeals to all classes of men and to all times cannot go far afield for rare subjects or follow new inventions or concern itself with fashions that are here today and gone tomorrow its only subjects are nature and human nature it deals with common experiences of joy or sorrow pain or pleasure that all men understand it cherishes the unchanging ideals of love faith duty freedom reverence courtesy which were old to the men who kept their flocks on the plains of shinar and which will be young as the morning to our childrens children  such ideals tend to ennoble a writer and therefore are great books characterized by lofty thought by fine feeling and as a rule by a beautiful simplicity of expression they have another quality hard to define but easy to understand a quality which leaves upon us the impression of eternal youth as if they had been dipped in the fountain which ponce de leon sought for in vain through the new world if a great book could speak it would use the words of the cobzar poet in his last song    the merry spring he is my brother     and when he comes this way   each year again he always asks me     art thou not yet grown gray   but i i keep my youth forever     even as the spring his may  a definition literature then if one must formulate a definition is the written record of mans best thought and feeling and english literature is the part of that record which belongs to the english people in its broadest sense literature includes all writing but as we commonly define the term it excludes works which aim at instruction and includes only the works which aim to give pleasure and which are artistic in that they reflect nature or human life in a way to arouse our sense of beauty in a still narrower sense when we study the history of literature we deal chiefly with the great the enduring books which may have been written in an elder or a latter day but which have in them the magic of all time  one may easily challenge such a definition which like most others is far from faultless it is difficult for example to draw the line sharply between instructive and pleasuregiving works for many an instructive book of history gives us pleasure and there may be more instruction on important matters in a pleasurable poem than in a treatise on ethics again there are historians who allege that english literature must include not simply the works of britain but everything written in the english language there are other objections but to straighten them all out is to be long in starting and there is a pleasant journey ahead of us chaucer had literature in mind when he wrote    through me men goon into that blisful place        of hertës hele and dedly woundës cure   through me men goon unto the wells of grace        ther grene and lusty may shal ever endure        this is the wey to al good aventure     chapter ii  beginnings of english literature    then the warrior battletried touched the sounding gleewood   straight awoke the harps sweet note straight a song uprose   sooth and sad its music then from heros lips there fell   a wondertale well told                      beowulf line 2017 a free rendering   in its beginnings english literature is like a river which proceeds not from a single wellhead but from many springs each sending forth its rivulet of sweet or bitter water as there is a place where the river assumes a character of its own distinct from all its tributaries so in english literature there is a time when it becomes national rather than tribal and english rather than saxon or celtic or norman that time was in the fifteenth century when the poems of chaucer and the printing press of caxton exalted the midland above all other dialects and established it as the literary language of england  sidenote tributaries of literature  before that time if you study the records of britain you meet several different tribes and races of men the native celt the lawgiving roman the colonizing saxon the searoving dane the feudal baron of normandy each with his own language and literature reflecting the traditions of his own people here in these old records is a strange medley of folk heroes arthur and beowulf cnut and brutus finn and cuchulain roland and robin hood older than the tales of such folkheroes are ancient riddles charms invocations to earth and sky    hal wes thu folde fira moder   hail to thee earth thou mother of men  with these pagan spells are found the historical writings of the venerable bede the devout hymns of cædmon welsh legends irish and scottish fairy stories scandinavian myths hebrew and christian traditions romances from distant italy which had traveled far before the italians welcomed them all these and more whether originating on british soil or brought in by missionaries or invaders held each to its own course for a time then met and mingled in the swelling stream which became english literature  illustration stonehenge on salisbury plain probably the ruins of a temple of the native britons  to trace all these tributaries to their obscure and lonely sources would require the labor of a lifetime we shall here examine only the two main branches of our early literature to the end that we may better appreciate the vigor and variety of modern english the first is the anglosaxon which came into england in the middle of the fifth century with the colonizing angles jutes and saxons from the shores of the north sea and the baltic the second is the normanfrench which arrived six centuries later at the time of the norman invasion except in their emphasis on personal courage there is a marked contrast between these two branches the former being stern and somber the latter gay and fanciful in anglosaxon poetry we meet a strong man who cherishes his own ideals of honor in normanfrench poetry a youth eagerly interested in romantic tales gathered from all the world one represents life as a profound mystery the other as a happy adventure                                         anglosaxon or oldenglish period 4501050  specimens of the language our english speech has changed so much in the course of centuries that it is now impossible to read our earliest records without special study but that anglosaxon is our own and not a foreign tongue may appear from the following examples the first is a stanza from widsith the chant of a wandering gleeman or minstrel and for comparison we place beside it andrew langs modern version nobody knows how old widsith is it may have been sung to the accompaniment of a harp that was broken fourteen hundred years ago the second much easier to read is from the anglosaxon chronicle which was prepared by king alfred from an older record in the ninth century    swa scrithende       gesceapum hweorfath   gleomen gumena       geond grunda fela   thearfe secgath       thoncword sprecath   simle suth oththe north       sumne

called crayford and there slew four thousand     men and the britons then forsook kentland and with much fear fled     to london town  beowulf the old epic poem called after its hero beowulf is more than myth or legend more even than history it is a picture of a life and a world that once had real existence of that vanished life that world of ancient englishmen only a few material fragments remain a bit of linked armor a rusted sword with runic inscriptions the oaken ribs of a war galley buried with the viking who had sailed it on stormy seas and who was entombed in it because he loved it all these are silent witnesses they have no speech or language but this old poem is a living voice speaking with truth and sincerity of the daily habit of the fathers of modern england of their adventures by sea or land their stern courage and grave courtesy their ideals of manly honor their thoughts of life and death  let us hear then the story of beowulf picturing in our imagination the storyteller and his audience the scene opens in a great hall where a fire blazes on the hearth and flashes upon polished shields against the timbered walls down the long room stretches a table where men are feasting or passing a beaker from hand to hand and anon crying hal hal in answer to song or in greeting to a guest at the head of the hall sits the chief with his chosen ealdormen at a sign from the chief a gleeman rises and strikes a single clear note from his harp silence falls on the benches the story begins    hail we of the spear danes in days of old   have heard the glory of warriors sung   have cheered the deeds that our chieftains wrought   and the brave scylds triumph oer his foes      then because there are scyldings present and because brave men     revere their ancestors the gleeman tells a beautiful legend of how     king scyld came and went how he arrived as a little child in a     wargalley that no man sailed asleep amid jewels and weapons and     how when his life ended at the call of wyrd or fate they placed     him against the mast of a ship with treasures heaped around him     and a golden banner above his head gave ship and cargo to the     winds and sent their chief nobly back to the deep whence he came      so with picturesque words the gleeman thrills his hearers with a     vivid picture of a vikings seaburial it thrills us now when the     vikings are no more and when no other picture can be drawn by an     eyewitness of that splendid pagan rite      sidenote the story of heorot      one of scylds descendants was king hrothgar roger who built the     hall heorot where the king and his men used to gather nightly to     feast and to listen to the songs of scop or gleeman footnote     like agamemnon and the greek chieftains every saxon leader had his     gleeman or minstrel and had also his own poet his scop or     shaper whose duty it was to shape a glorious deed into more     glorious verse so did our pagan ancestors build their monuments     out of songs that should live in the hearts of men when granite or     earth mound had crumbled away there was joy of heroes but in     one night the joy was changed to mourning out on the lonely fens     dwelt the jotun giant or monster grendel who heard the sound of     mens mirth and quickly made an end of it one night as the thanes     slept in the hall he burst in the door and carried off thirty     warriors to devour them in his lair under the sea another and     another horrible raid followed till heorot was deserted and the     fear of grendel reigned among the spear danes there were brave men     among them but of what use was courage when their weapons were     powerless against the monster their swords would not bite on his     body      for twelve years this terror continued then the rumor of grendel     reached the land of the geats where beowulf lived at the court of     his uncle king hygelac no sooner did beowulf hear of a dragon to     be slain of a friendly king in need of a man than he selected     fourteen companions and launched his wargalley in search of     adventure      sidenote the sailing of beowulf      at this point the old epic becomes a remarkable portrayal of daily     life in its picturesque lines we see the galley set sail foam     flying from her prow we catch the first sight of the southern     headlands approach land hear the challenge of the warder of the     cliffs and beowulfs courteous answer we follow the march to     heorot in wargear spears flashing swords and byrnies clanking     and witness the exchange of greetings between hrothgar and the     young hero again is the feast spread in heorot once more is heard     the song of gleemen the joyous sound of warriors in comradeship     there is also a significant picture of hrothgars wife mindful of     courtesies honoring her guests by passing the meadcup with her     own hands she is received by these stern men with profound     respect      when the feast draws to an end the fear of grendel returns     hrothgar warns his guests that no weapon can harm the monster that     it is death to sleep in the hall then the spear danes retire     leaving beowulf and his companions to keep watch and ward with the     careless confidence of brave men forthwith they all fall asleep        forth from the fens from the misty moorlands       grendel came glidinggods wrath he bore       came under clouds until he saw clearly       glittering with gold plates the meadhall of men       down fell the door though hardened with firebands       open it sprang at the stroke of his paw       swollen with rage burst in the balebringer       flamed in his eyes a fierce light likest fire      sidenote the fight with grendel      throwing himself upon the nearest sleeper grendel crushes and     swallows him then he stretches out a paw towards beowulf only to     find it seized in such a grip as the fiend had never felt before     a desperate conflict begins and a mighty uproarcrashing of     benches shoutings of men the warsong of grendel who is trying     to break the grip of his foe as the monster struggles toward the     door dragging the hero with him a wide wound opens on his     shoulder the sinews snap and with a mighty wrench beowulf tears     off the whole limb while grendel rushes howling across the fens     beowulf hangs the grisly arm with its iron claws the whole     grapple of grendel over the door where all may see it      once more there is joy in heorot songs speeches the liberal     giving of gifts thinking all danger past the danes sleep in the     hall but at midnight comes the mother of grendel raging to avenge     her son seizing the kings bravest companion she carries him away     and he is never seen again      here is another adventure for beowulf to old hrothgar lamenting     his lost earl the hero says simply        wise chief sorrow not for a man it is meet       his friend to avenge not to mourn for his loss       for death comes to all but honor endures       let him win it who will ere wyrd to him calls       and fame be the fee of a warrior dead      following the trail of the brimwylf or merewif     seawolf or seawoman beowulf and his companions pass through     desolate regions to a wild cliff on the shore there a friend     offers his good sword hrunting for the combat and beowulf accepts     the weapon saying                     ic me mid hruntinge       dom gewyrce oththe mec death nimeth                          i with hrunting       honor will win or death shall me take      sidenote the dragons cave      then he plunges into the black water is attacked on all sides by     the grundwrygen or bottom monsters and as he stops to fight     them is seized by the merewif and dragged into a cave a     mighty seahall free from water and filled with a strange light     on its floor are vast treasures its walls are adorned with     weapons in a corner huddles the wounded grendel all this beowulf     sees in a glance as he turns to fight his new foe      follows then another terrific combat in which the brand hrunting     proves useless though it rings out its clanging warsong on the     monsters scales it will not bite on the charmed body beowulf     is down and at the point of death when his eye lights on a huge     sword forged by the jotuns of old struggling to his feet he seizes     the weapon whirls it around his head for a mighty blow and the     fight is won another blow cuts off the head of grendel but at the     touch of the poisonous blood the steel blade melts like ice before     the fire      leaving all the treasures beowulf takes only the golden hilt of     the magic sword and the head of grendel reënters the sea and     mounts up to his companions they welcome him as one returned from     the dead they relieve him of helmet and byrnie and swing away in     a triumphal procession to heorot the hero towers among them a     conspicuous figure and next to him comes the enormous head of     grendel carried on a spearshaft by four of the stoutest thanes      sidenote the firedrake      more feasting gifts noble speeches follow before the hero returns     to his own land laden with treasures so ends the first part of     the epic in the second part beowulf succeeds hygelac as chief of     the geats and rules them well for fifty years then a firedrake     guarding an immense hoard of treasure as in most of the old dragon     stories begins to ravage the land once more the aged beowulf     goes forth to champion his people but he feels that wyrd is close     to hand and the fatalism which pervades all the poem is finely     expressed in his speech to his companions in his last fight he     kills the dragon winning the dragons treasure for his people but     as he battles amid flame and smoke the fire enters his lungs and     he dies as dies a man paying for victory with his life among     his last words is a command which reminds us again of the old     greeks and of the word of elpenor to odysseus          bid my brave men raise a barrow for me on the headland         broad high to be seen far out at sea that hereafter         seafarers driving their foamy keels through oceans mist         may behold and say tis beowulfs mound      the heros last words and the closing scenes of the epic including     the funeral pyre the balefire and another viking burial to the     chant of armed men riding their war steeds are among the noblest     that have come down to us from beyond the dawn of history  such in brief outline is the story of beowulf it is recorded on a firemarked manuscript preserved as by a miracle from the torch of the danes which is now one of the priceless treasures of the british museum the handwriting indicates that the manuscript was copied about the year 1100 but the language points to the eighth or ninth century when the poem in its present form was probably composed on english soil footnote materials used in beowulf are very old and may have been brought to england during the anglosaxon invasion parts of the material such as the dragonfights are purely mythical they relate to beowa a superman of whom many legends were told by scandinavian minstrels the grendel legend for example appears in the icelandic saga of gretti who slays the dragon glam other parts of beowulf are old battle songs and still others relating to king hygelac and his nephew have some historical foundation so little is known about the epic that one cannot safely make any positive statement as to its origin it was written in crude uneven lines but a rhythmic martial effect as of marching men was produced by strong accent and alliteration and the effect was strengthened by the harp with which the gleeman always accompanied his recital  anglosaxon songs beside the epic of beowulf a few mutilated poems have been preserved and these are as fragments of a plate or film upon which the life of long ago left its impression one of the oldest of these poems is widsith the widegoer which describes the wanderings and rewards of the ancient gleeman it begins    widsith spake his wordhoard unlocked   he who farthest had fared among earthfolk and tribefolk  then follows a recital of the places he had visited and the gifts he had received for his singing some of the personages named are real others mythical and as the list covers half a world and several centuries of time it is certain that widsiths recital cannot be taken literally  sidenote meaning of widsith  two explanations offer themselves the first that the poem contains the work of many scops each of whom added his travels to those of his predecessor the second that widsith like other gleemen was both historian and poet a keeper of tribal legends as well as a shaper of songs and that he was ever ready to entertain his audience with things new or old thus he mentioned hrothgar as one whom he had visited and if a hearer called for a tale at this point the scop would recite that part of beowulf which tells of the monster grendel again he named sigard the volsung the siegfrid of the niebelungenlied and of wagners opera and this would recall the slaying of the dragon fafnir or some other  story of the old norse saga so every name or place which widsith mentioned was an invitation when he came to a hall and unlocked his wordhoard he offered his hearers a variety of poems and legends from which they made their own selection looked at in this way the old poem becomes an epitome of anglosaxon literature  sidenote types of saxon poetry  other fragments of the period are valuable as indicating that the anglosaxons were familiar with various types of poetry deors lament describing the sorrows of a scop who had lost his place beside his chief is a true lyric that is a poem which reflects the authors feeling rather than the deed of another man in his grief the scop comforts himself by recalling the afflictions of various heroes and he ends each stanza with the refrain    that sorrow he endured this also may i  among the best of the early poems are the ruined city reflecting the feeling of one who looks on crumbling walls that were once the abode of human ambition the seafarer a chantey of the deep which ends with an allegory comparing life to a sea voyage the wanderer which is the plaint of one who has lost home patron ambition and as the easiest way out of his difficulty turns eardstappa an earthhitter or tramp the husbands message which is the oldest love song in our literature and a few ballads and battle songs such as the battle of brunanburh familiar to us in tennysons translation and the fight at finnsburgh which was mentioned by the gleemen in beowulf and which was then probably as well known as the charge of the light brigade is to modern englishmen  another early war song the battle of maldon or byrhtnoths death has seldom been rivaled in savage vigor or in the expression of deathless loyalty to a chosen leader the climax of the poem is reached when the few survivors of an uneven battle make a ring of spears about their fallen chief shake their weapons in the face of an overwhelming horde of danes while byrhtwold the old comrade chants their defiance    the sterner shall thought be the bolder our hearts   the greater the mood as lessens our might  we know not when or by whom this stirring battle cry was written it was copied under date of 991 in the anglosaxon chronicle and is commonly called the swan song of anglosaxon poetry the lion song would be a better name for it  later prose and poetry the works we have just considered were wholly pagan in spirit but all reference to thor or other gods was excluded by the monks who first wrote down the scops poetry  with the coming of these monks a reform swept over pagan england and literature reflected the change in a variety of ways for example early anglosaxon poetry was mostly warlike for the reason that the various earldoms were in constant strife but now the peace of good will was preached and moral courage the triumph of selfcontrol was exalted above mere physical hardihood in the new literature the adventures of columb or aidan or brendan were quite as thrilling as any legends of beowulf or sigard but the climax of the adventure was spiritual and the emphasis was always on moral heroism  another result of the changed condition was that the unlettered scop who carried his whole stock of poetry in his head was replaced by the literary monk who had behind him the immense culture of the latin language and who was interested in world history or christian doctrine rather than in tribal fights or pagan mythology these monks were capable men they understood the appeal of pagan poetry and their motto was let nothing good be wasted so they made careful copy of the scops best songs else had not a shred of early poetry survived and so the pagans respect for womanhood his courage his loyalty to a chiefall his virtues were recognized and turned to religious account in the new literature even the beautiful pagan scrolls or dragon knots once etched on a warriors sword were reproduced in glowing colors in the initial letters of the monks illuminated gospel  a third result of the peaceful conquest of the missionaries was that many monasteries were established in britain each a center of learning and of writing so arose the famous northumbrian school of literature to which we owe the writings of bede cædmon cynewulf and others associated with certain old monasteries such as peterborough jarrow york and whitby all north of the river humber  bede the good work of the monks is finely exemplified in the life of the venerable bede or bæda cir 673735 who is well called the father of english learning as a boy he entered the benedictine monastery at jarrow the temper of his manhood may be judged from a single sentence of his own record      while attentive to the discipline of mine order and the daily care     of singing in the church my constant delight was in learning or     teaching or writing  it is hardly too much to say that this gentle scholar was for half a century the teacher of europe he collected a large library of manuscripts he was the author of some forty works covering the whole field of human knowledge in his day and to his school at jarrow came hundreds of pupils from all parts of the british isles and hundreds more from the continent of all his works the most notable is the socalled ecclesiastical history historia ecclesiastica gentis anglorum which should be named the history of the race of angles this book marks the beginning of our literature of knowledge and to it we are largely indebted for what we know of english history from the time of cæsars invasion to the early part of the eighth century  all the extant works of bede are in latin but we are told by his pupil cuthbert that he was skilled in our english songs that he made poems and translated the gospel of john into english these works which would now be of priceless value were all destroyed by the plundering danes  as an example of bedes style we translate a typical passage from his history the scene is the saxon witenagemôt or council of wise men called by king edward 625 to consider the doctrine of paulinus who had been sent from rome by pope gregory the first speaker is coifi a priest of the old religion      consider well o king this new doctrine which is preached to us     for i now declare what i have learned for certain that the old     religion has no virtue in it for none of your people has been more     diligent than i in the worship of our gods yet many receive more     favors from you and are preferred above me and are more     prosperous in their affairs if the old gods had any discernment     they would surely favor me since i have been most diligent in     their service it is expedient therefore if this new faith that     is preached is any more profitable than the old that we accept it     without delay  whereupon coifi who as a priest has hitherto been obliged to ride upon an ass with wagging ears calls loudly for a horse a prancing horse a stallion and cavorts off a crowd running at his heels to hurl a spear into the shrine where he lately worshiped he is a good type of the political demagogue who clamors for progress when he wants an office and whose spear is more likely to be hurled at the back of a friend than at the breast of an enemy  then a pagan chief rises to speak and we bow to a nobler motive his allegory of the mystery of life is like a strain of anglosaxon poetry it moves us deeply as it moved his hearers ten centuries ago      this present life of man o king in comparison with the time that     is hidden from us is as the flight of a sparrow through the room     where you sit at supper with companions around you and a good fire     on the hearth outside are the storms of wintry rain and snow the     sparrow flies in at one opening and instantly out at another     whilst he is within he is sheltered from the winter storms but     after a moment of pleasant weather he speeds from winter back to     winter again and vanishes from your sight into the darkness whence     he came even so the life of man appears for a little time but of     what went before and of what comes after we are wholly ignorant if     this new religion can teach us anything of greater certainty it     surely deserves to be followed footnote bede historia     book ii chap xiii a free translation  cÆdmon seventh century in a beautiful chapter of bedes history we may read how cædmon d 680 discovered his gift of poetry he was says the record a poor unlettered servant of the abbess hilda in her monastery at whitby at that time and here is an interesting commentary on monastic culture singing and poetry were so familiar that whenever a feast was given a harp would be brought in and each monk or guest would in turn entertain the company with a song or poem to his own musical accompaniment but cædmon could not sing and when he saw the harp coming down the table he would slip away ashamed to perform his humble duties in the monastery      now it happened once that he did this thing at a certain     festivity and went out to the stable to care for the horses this     duty being assigned him for that night as he slept at the usual     time one stood by him saying cædmon sing me something he     answered i cannot sing and that is why i came hither from the     feast but he who spake unto him said again cædmon sing to me     and he said what shall i sing and that one said sing the     beginning of created things thereupon cædmon began to sing verses     that he had never heard before of this import        nu scylun hergan hefaenriches ward        now shall we hallow the warden of heaven       he the creator he the allfather       deeds of his might and thoughts of his mind  illustration cÆdmon cross at whitby abbey  in the morning he remembered the words and came humbly to the monks to recite the first recorded christian hymn in our language and a very noble hymn it is the monks heard him in wonder and took him to the abbess hilda who gave order that cædmon should receive instruction and enter the monastery as one of the brethren then the monks expounded to him the scriptures he in turn reflecting on what he had heard echoed it back to the monks in such melodious words that his teachers became his pupils so says the record the whole course of bible history was turned into excellent poetry  about a thousand years later in the days of milton an anglosaxon manuscript was discovered containing a metrical paraphrase of the books of genesis exodus and daniel and these were supposed to be some of the poems mentioned in bedes narrative a study of the poems now known as the cædmonian cycle leads to the conclusion that they were probably the work of two or three writers and it has not been determined what part cædmon had in their composition the nobility of style in the genesis poem and the picturesque account of the fallen angels which reappears in paradise lost have won for cædmon his designation as the milton of the anglosaxon period footnote a friend of milton calling himself franciscus junius first printed the cædmon poems in antwerp cir 1655 during miltons lifetime the puritan poet was blind at the time and it is not certain that he ever saw or heard the poems yet there are many parallelisms in the earlier and later works which warrant the conclusion that milton was influenced by cædmons work  cynewulf eighth century there is a variety of poems belonging to the cynewulf cycle and of some of these cynewulf born cir 750 was certainly the author since he wove his name into the verses in the manner of an acrostic of cynewulfs life we know nothing with certainty but from various poems which are attributed to him and which undoubtedly reflect some personal experience scholars have constructed the following biographywhich may or may not be true  in his early life cynewulf was probably a wandering scop of the old pagan kind delighting in wild nature in adventure in the clamor of fighting men to this period belong his riddles footnote these riddles are ancient conundrums in which some familiar object such as a bow a ship a storm lashing the shore the moon riding the clouds like a vikings boat is described in poetic language and the last line usually calls on the hearer to name the object described see cook and tinker translations from old english poetry and his vigorous descriptions of the sea and of battle which show hardly a trace of christian influence then came trouble to cynewulf perhaps in the ravages of the danes and some deep spiritual experience of which he writes in a way to remind us of the puritan age      in the prison of the night i pondered with myself i was stained     with my own deeds bound fast in my sins hard smitten with     sorrows walled in by miseries  a wondrous vision of the cross brightest of beacons shone suddenly through his darkness and led him forth into light and joy then he wrote his vision of the rood and probably also juliana and the christ in the last period of his life a time of great serenity he wrote andreas a story of st andrew combining religious instruction with extraordinary adventure elene which describes the search for the cross on which christ died and which is a prototype of the search for the holy grail and other poems of the same general kind footnote there is little agreement among scholars as to who wrote most of these poems the only works to which cynewulf signs his name are the christ elene juliana and fates of the apostles all others are doubtful and our biography of cynewulf is largely a matter of pleasant speculation aside from the value of these works as a reflection of anglosaxon ideals they are our best picture of christianity as it appeared in england during the eighth and ninth centuries  alfred the great 848901 we shall understand the importance of alfreds work if we remember how his country fared when he became king of the west saxons in 871 at that time england lay at the mercy of the danish searovers soon after bedes death they fell upon northumbria hewed out with their swords a place of settlement and were soon lords of the whole north country being pagans thors men they called themselves they sacked the monasteries burned the libraries made a lurid end of the civilization which men like columb and bede had built up in northhumberland then they pushed southward and were in process of paganizing all england when they were turned back by the heroism of alfred how he accomplished his task and how from his capital at winchester he established law and order in england is recorded in the histories we are dealing here with literature and in this field alfred is distinguished in two ways first by his preservation of early english poetry and second by his own writing which earned for him the title of father of english prose finding that some fragments of poetry had escaped the fire of the danes he caused search to be made for old manuscripts and had copies made of all that were legible footnote these copies were made in alfreds dialect west saxon not in the northumbrian dialect in which they were first written but what gave alfred deepest concern was that in all his kingdom there were few priests and no laymen who could read or write their own language as he wrote sadly      king alfred sends greeting to bishop werfrith in words of love and     friendship let it be known to thee that it often comes to my mind     what wise men and what happy times were formerly in england  i     remember what i saw before england had been ravaged and burned how     churches throughout the whole land were filled with treasures of     books and there was also a multitude of gods servants but these     had no knowledge of the books they could not understand them     because they were not written in their own language it was as if     the books said our fathers who once occupied these places loved     wisdom and through it they obtained wealth and left it to us we     see here their footprints but we cannot follow them and therefore     have we lost both their wealth and their wisdom because we would     not incline our hearts to their example when i remember this i     marvel that good and wise men who were formerly in england and who     had learned these books did not translate them into their own     language then i answered myself and said they never thought that     their children would be so careless or that learning would so     decay footnote a free version of part of alfreds preface to     his translation of pope gregorys cura pastoralis which     appeared in english as the hirdeboc or shepherds book  to remedy the evil alfred ordered that every freeborn englishman should learn to read and write his own language but before he announced the order he followed it himself rather late in his boyhood he had learned to spell out an english book now with immense difficulty he took up latin and translated the best works for the benefit of his people his last notable work was the famous anglosaxon chronicle  sidenote anglosaxon chronicle  at that time it was customary in monasteries to keep a record of events which seemed to the monks of special importance such as the coming of a bishop the death of a king an eclipse of the moon a battle with the danes alfred found such a record at winchester rewrote it or else caused it to be rewritten with numerous additions from bedes history and other sources and so made a fairly complete chronicle of england this was sent to other monasteries where it was copied and enlarged so that several different versions have come down to us the work thus begun was continued after alfreds death until 1154 and is the oldest contemporary history possessed by any modern nation in its own language                                       anglonorman or middleenglish

ancren riwle rule of the anchoresses cir 1225 the second written about a century later is from the riming chronicle or verse history of robert manning or robert of brunne in it we note the appearance of rime a new thing in english poetry borrowed from the french and also a few words such as solace which are of foreign origin      hwoso hevide iseid to eve theo heo werp hire eien therone a     wend

disappeared from england as a river may sink into the earth to reappear elsewhere with added volume and new characteristics during all this time french was the language not only of literature but of society and business and if anyone had declared at the beginning of the twelfth century when norman institutions were firmly established in england that the time was approaching when the conquerors would forget their fatherland and their mother tongue he would surely have been called dreamer or madman yet the unexpected was precisely what happened and the norman conquest is remarkable alike for what it did and for what it failed to do  illustration domesday book from a facsimile edition published in 1862 the volumes two in number were kept in the chest here shown  it accomplished first the nationalization of england uniting the petty saxon earldoms into one powerful kingdom and second it brought into english life grown sad and stern like a man without hope the spirit of youth of enthusiasm of eager adventure after the unknownin a word the spirit of romance which is but another name for that quest of some holy grail in which youth is forever engaged  norman literature one who reads the literature that the conquerors brought to england must be struck by the contrast between the anglosaxon and the normanfrench spirit for example here is the death of a national hero as portrayed in the song of roland an old french epic which the normans first put into polished verse    li quens rollans se jut desuz un pin   envers espaigne en ad turnet son vis   de plusurs choscs a remembrer le prist      then roland placed himself beneath a pine tree towards spain he     turned his face of many things took he remembrance of various     lands where he had made conquests of sweet france and his kindred     of charlemagne his feudal lord who had nurtured him he could not     refrain from sighs and tears neither could he forget himself in     need he confessed his sins and besought the lords mercy he     raised his right glove and offered it to god saint gabriel from     his hand received the offering then upon his breast he bowed his     head he joined his hands and went to his end god sent down his     cherubim and saint michael who delivers from peril together with     saint gabriel they departed bearing the counts soul to paradise  we have not put rolands ceremonious exit into rime and meter neither do we offer any criticism of a scene in which the death of a national hero stirs no interest or emotion not even with the help of gabriel and the cherubim one is reminded by contrast of scyld who fares forth alone in his viking ship to meet the mystery of death or of that last scene of human grief and grandeur in beowulf where a few thanes bury their dead chief on a headland by the gray sea riding their war steeds around the memorial mound with a chant of sorrow and victory  the contrast is even more marked in the mass of norman literature in romances of the maidens that sink underground in autumn to reappear as flowers in spring of alexanders journey to the bottom of the sea in a crystal barrel to view the mermaids and monsters of guy of warwick who slew the giant colbrant and overthrew all the knights of europe just to win a smile from his felice of that other hero who had offended his lady by forgetting one of the commandments of love and who vowed to fill a barrel with his tears and did it the saxons were as serious in speech as in action and their poetry is a true reflection of their daily life but the normans brave and resourceful as they were in war and statesmanship turned to literature for amusement and indulged their lively fancy in fables satires garrulous romances like children reveling in the lore of elves and fairies as the prattle of a child was the power that awakened silas marner from his stupor of despair so this norman element of gayety of exuberant romanticism was precisely what was needed to rouse the sterner saxon mind from its gloom and lethargy  illustration the norman stair canterbury cathedral  the new nation so much then the normans accomplished they brought nationality into english life and romance into english literature without essentially changing the saxon spirit they enlarged its thought aroused its hope gave it wider horizons they bound england with their laws covered it with their feudal institutions filled it with their ideas and their language then as an anticlimax they disappeared from english history and their institutions were modified to suit the saxon temperament the race conquered in war became in peace the conquerors the normans speedily forgot france and even warred against it they began to speak english dropping its cumbersome teutonic inflections and adding to it the wealth of their own fine language they ended by adopting england as their country and glorifying it above all others there is no land in the world writes a poet of the thirteenth century where so many good kings and saints have lived as in the isle of the english some were holy martyrs who died cheerfully for god others had strength or courage like to that of arthur edmund and cnut  this poet who was a norman monk at westminster abbey wrote about the glories of england in the french language and celebrated as the national heroes a celt a saxon and a dane footnote the significance of this old poem was pointed out by jusserand literary history of the english people vol i p 112  so in the space of two centuries a new nation had arisen combining the best elements of the anglosaxon and normanfrench people with a considerable mixture of celtic and danish elements out of the union of these races and tongues came modern english life and letters  geoffrey and the legends of arthur geoffrey of monmouth was a welshman familiar from his youth with celtic legends also he was a monk who knew how to write latin and the combination was a fortunate one as we shall see  long before geoffrey produced his celebrated history cir 1150 many stories of the welsh hero arthur footnote who arthur was has never been determined there was probably a chieftain of that name who was active in opposing the anglosaxon invaders of britain about the year 500 but gildas who wrote a chronicle of britain only half a century later does not mention him neither does bede who made study of all available records before writing his history william of malmesbury a chronicler of the twelfth century refers to the warlike arthur of whom the britons tell so many extravagant fables a man to be celebrated not in idle tales but in true history he adds that there were two arthurs one a welsh warchief not a king and the other a myth or fairy creation this then may be the truth of the matter that a real arthur who made a deep impression on the celtic imagination was soon hidden in a mass of spurious legends that bede had heard these legends is almost certain that he did not mention them is probably due to the fact that he considered arthur to be wholly mythical were current in britain and on the continent but they were never written because of a custom of the middle ages which required that before a legend could be recorded it must have the authority of some latin manuscript geoffrey undertook to supply such authority in his historia regum britanniae or history of the kings of britain in which he proved arthurs descent from roman ancestors footnote after the landing of the romans in britain a curious mingling of traditions took place and in geoffreys time native britons considered themselves as children of brutus of rome and therefore as grandchildren of Æneas of troy he quoted liberally from an ancient manuscript which he alleged established arthurs lineage but which he did not show to others a storm instantly arose among the writers of that day most of whom denounced geoffreys latin manuscript as a myth and his history as a shameless invention but he had shrewdly anticipated such criticism and issued this warning to the historians which is solemn or humorous according to your point of view      i forbid william of malmesbury and henry of huntingdon to speak of     the kings of britain since they have not seen the book which     walter archdeacon of oxford who was dead of course brought out     of brittany  it is commonly believed that geoffrey was an impostor but in such matters one should be wary of passing judgment many records of men cities empires have suddenly arisen from the tombs to put to shame the scientists who had denied their existence and it is possible that geoffrey had seen one of the legion of lost manuscripts the one thing certain is that if he had any authority for his history he embellished the same freely from popular legends or from his own imagination as was customary at that time  sidenote arthurian romances  his work made a sensation a score of french poets seized upon his arthurian legends and wove them into romances each adding freely to geoffreys narrative the poet wace added the tale of the round table and another poet walter map perhaps began a cycle of stories concerning galahad and the quest of the holy grail footnote the holy grail or san graal or sancgreal was represented as the cup from which christ drank with his disciples at the last supper legend said that the sacred cup had been brought to england and arthurs knights undertook as the most compelling of all duties to search until they found it  the origin of these arthurian romances which reappear so often in english poetry is forever shrouded in mystery the point to remember is that we owe them all to the genius of the native celts that it was geoffrey of monmouth who first wrote them in latin prose and so preserved a treasure which else had been lost and that it was the french trouvères or poets who completed the various cycles of romances which were later collected in malorys morte d arthur  types of middleenglish literature it has long been customary to begin the study of english literature with chaucer but that does not mean that he invented any new form of poetry or prose to examine any collection of our early literature such as cooks middleenglish reader is to discover that many literary types were flourishing in chaucers day and that some of these had grown oldfashioned before he began to use them  sidenote metrical romances  in the thirteenth century for example the favorite type of literature in england was the metrical romance which was introduced by the french poets and written at first in the french language the typical romance was a rambling story dealing with the three subjects of love chivalry and religion it was filled with adventures among giants dragons enchanted castles and in that day romance was not romance unless liberally supplied with magic and miracle there were hundreds of such wonderstories arranged loosely in three main groups the socalled matter of rome dealt with the fall of troy in one part and with the marvelous adventures of alexander in the other the matter of france celebrated the heroism of charlemagne and his paladins and the matter of britain wove the magic web of romance around arthur and his knights of the round table  one of the best of the metrical romances is sir gawain and the green knight which may be read as a measure of all the rest if as is commonly believed the unknown author of sir gawain wrote also the pearl a beautiful old elegy or poem of grief which immortalizes a fathers love for his little girl he was the greatest poet of the early middleenglish period unfortunately for us he wrote not in the kings english or speech of london which became modern english but in a different dialect and his poems should be read in a presentday version else will the beauty of his work be lost in our effort to understand his language  other types of early literature are the riming chronicles or verse histories such as layamons brut a famous poem in which the arthurian legends appear as part of english history stories of travel translations religious poems books of devotion miracle plays fables satires ballads hymns lullabies lyrics of love and naturean astonishing collection for so ancient a time indicative at once of our changing standards of poetry and of our unchanging human nature for the feelings which inspired or gave welcome to these poems some five or six hundred years ago are precisely the same feelings which warm the heart of a poet and his readers today there is nothing ancient but the spelling in this exquisite lullaby for instance which was sung on christmas eve    he cam also stylle     ther his moder was   as dew in aprylle     that fallyt on the gras   he cam also stylle     to his moderes bowr   as dew in aprylle     that fallyt on the flour   he cam also stylle     ther his moder lay   as dew in aprylle     that fallyt on the spray  footnote in reading this beautiful old lullaby the e in stylle and aprylle should be lightly sounded like a in china  or witness this other fragment from an old love song which reflects the feeling of one who would fain make some mirth but who finds his heart sad within him    now wold i fayne som myrthis make   all oneli for my ladys sake     when i hir se   but now i am so ferre from hir     hit will nat be    thogh i

a time when the anglosaxon had assimilated the french element with its language and verse forms they were written probably in the age of chaucer or in what is now called the late middleenglish period                                           summary of beginnings the two main branches of our literature are     the anglosaxon and the normanfrench both of which received some     additions from celtic danish and roman sources the anglosaxon     literature came to england with the invasion of teutonic tribes     the angles saxons and jutes cir 449 the normanfrench     literature appeared after the norman conquest of england which     began with the battle of hastings in 1066      the anglosaxon literature is classified under two heads pagan and     christian the extant fragments of pagan literature include one     epic or heroic poem beowulf and several lyrics and battle     songs such as widsith deors lament the seafarer the     battle of brunanburh and the battle of maldon all these were     written at an unknown date and by unknown poets      the best christian literature of the period was written in the     northumbrian and the westsaxon schools the greatest names of the     northumbrian school are bede cædmon and cynewulf the most famous     of the wessex writers is alfred the great who is called the     father of english prose      the normans were originally northmen or sea rovers from     scandinavia who settled in northern france and adopted the     francolatin language and civilization with their conquest of     england in the eleventh century they brought nationality into     english life and the spirit of romance into english literature     their stories in prose or verse were extremely fanciful in marked     contrast with the stern somber poetry of the anglosaxons      the most notable works of the normanfrench period are geoffreys     history of the kings of britain which preserved in latin     prose the native legends of king arthur layamons brut a     riming chronicle or verse history in the native tongue many     metrical romances or stories of love chivalry magic and     religion and various popular songs and ballads the greatest poet     of the period is the unknown author of sir gawain and the green     knight a metrical romance and probably also of the pearl a     beautiful elegy which is our earliest in memoriam      selections

modern versions such as the following      beowulf garnetts beowulf ginn and company a literal     translation is useful to those who study anglosaxon but is not     very readable the same may be said

belling the cat the language is that of the common people and the verse is in the old saxon manner with accent and alliteration the scene is a council of rats and mice common people called to consider how best to deal with the cat court and it satirizes the popular agitators who declaim against the government the speaker is a rat a raton of renon most renable of tonge    i have yseen segges quod he

tennyson closely followed in his passing of arthur the poetry from the ballad of robin hood and the monk is probably a fifteenthcentury version of a much older english song      therefore sayd arthur

and confusion the struggle of the house     of commons against the despotism of kings the hundred years war     with france in which those whose fathers had been celts danes     saxons normans were now fighting shoulder to shoulder as     englishmen all the suffering of the common people resulting in     the peasant rebellion the barbarity of the nobles who were     destroying one another in the wars of the roses the beginning of     commerce and manufacturing following the lead of holland and the     rise of a powerful middle class the belated appearance of the     renaissance welcomed by a few scholars but unnoticed by the masses     of people who remained in dense ignoranceeven such a brief     catalogue suggests that many books must be read before we can enter     into the spirit of fourteenthcentury england we shall note here     only two circumstances which may help us to understand chaucer and     the age in which he lived      sidenote modern problems      the first is that the age of chaucer if examined carefully shows     many striking resemblances to our own it was for example an age     of warfare and as in our own age of hideous inventions military     methods were all upset by the discovery that the foot soldier with     his blunderbuss was more potent than the panoplied knight on     horseback while war raged abroad there was no end of labor     troubles at home strikes lockouts assaults on imported workmen     the flemish weavers brought in by edward iii and no end of     experimental laws to remedy the evil the turk came into europe     introducing the eastern and the balkan questions which have ever     since troubled us imperialism was rampant in edwards claim to     france for example or in john of gaunts attempt to annex     castile even feminism was in the air and its merits were     shrewdly debated by chaucers wife of bath and his clerk of     oxenford a dozen other modern examples might be given but the     sum of the matter is this that there is hardly a social or     political or economic problem of the past fifty years that was not     violently agitated in the latter half of the fourteenth century     footnote see kittredge chaucer and his poetry 1915 pp     25      sidenote realistic poetry      a second interesting circumstance is that this medieval age     produced two poets langland and chaucer who were more realistic     even than presentday writers in their portrayal of life and who     together gave us such a picture of english society as no other     poets have ever equaled langland wrote his piers plowman in     the familiar anglosaxon style for the common people and pictured     their life to the letter while chaucer wrote his canterbury     tales a poem shaped after italian and french models     portraying the holiday side of the middle and upper classes     langland drew a terrible picture of a degraded land desperately in     need of justice of education of reform in church and state     chaucer showed a gay company of pilgrims riding through a     prosperous country which he called his merrie england perhaps     the one thing in common with these two poets the early types of     puritan and cavalier was their attitude towards democracy     langland preached the gospel of labor far more powerfully than     carlyle ever preached it and exalted honest work as the patent of     nobility chaucer writing for the court mingled his characters in     the most democratic kind of fellowship and though a knight rode at     the head of his procession put into the mouth of the wife of bath     his definition of a gentleman        loke who that is most vertuous alway       privee and apert 1 and most entendeth aye       to do the gentle dedes that he can       and take him for the grettest gentilman      footnote 1 secretly and openly                                       geoffrey chaucer cir 13401400    of chaucer truly i know not whether to marvel more either that he in   that misty time could see so clearly or that we in this clear age walk   so stumblingly after him                                     philip sidney cir 1581  it was the habit of oldenglish chieftains to take their scops with them into battle to the end that the scops poem might be true to the outer world of fact as well as to the inner world of ideals the search for local color is therefore not the newest thing in fiction but the oldest thing in poetry chaucer the first in time of our great english poets was true to this old tradition he was page squire soldier statesman diplomat traveler and then he was a poet who portrayed in verse the manycolored life which he knew intimately at first hand  illustration chaucer  for example chaucer had to describe a tournament in the knights tale but instead of using his imagination as other romancers had always done he drew a vivid picture of one of those gorgeous pageants of decaying chivalry with which london diverted the french king who had been brought prisoner to the city after the victory of the black prince at poitiers so with his tabard inn which is a real english inn and with his pilgrims who are real pilgrims and so with every other scene or character he described his specialty was human nature his strong point observation his method essentially modern and by modern we mean that he portrayed the men and women of his own day so well with such sympathy and humor and wisdom that we recognize and welcome them as friends or neighbors who are the same in all ages from this viewpoint chaucer is more modern than tennyson or longfellow      life chaucers boyhood was spent in london near westminster     where the brilliant court of edward was visible to the favored     ones and near the thames where the worlds commerce then     beginning to ebb and flow with the tides might be seen of every     man his father was a vintner or wine merchant who had enough     influence at court to obtain for his son a place in the house of     the princess elizabeth behold then our future poet beginning his     knightly training as page to a highborn lady presently he     accompanied the black prince to the french wars was taken prisoner     and ransomed and on his return entered the second stage of     knighthood as esquire or personal attendant to the king he married     a maid of honor related to john of gaunt the famous duke of     lancaster and at thirty had passed from the rank of merchant into     official and aristocratic circles      sidenote periods of work      the literary work of chaucer is conveniently but not accurately     arranged in three different periods while attached to the court     one of his duties was to entertain the king and his visitors in     their leisure french poems of love and chivalry were then in     demand and of these chaucer had great store but english had     recently replaced french even at court and king edward and queen     philippa both patrons of art and letters encouraged chaucer to     write in his native language so he made translations of favorite     poems into english and wrote others in imitation of french models     these early works the least interesting of all belong to what is     called the period of french influence      then chaucer who had learned the art of silence as well as of     speech was sent abroad on a series of diplomatic missions in     italy he probably met the poet petrarch as we infer from the     prologue to the clerks tale and became familiar with the works of     dante and boccaccio his subsequent poetry shows a decided advance     in range and originality partly because of his own growth no     doubt and partly because of his better models this second period     of about fifteen years is called the time of italian influence      in the third or english period chaucer returned to london and was a     busy man of affairs for at the english court unlike those of     france and italy a poet was expected to earn his pension by some     useful work literature being regarded as a recreation he was in     turn comptroller of customs and superintendent of public works     also he was at times well supplied with money and again as the     political fortunes of his patron john of gaunt waned in sore need     of the comforts of life witness his complaint to his empty     purse the humor of which evidently touched the king and brought     chaucer another pension      two poems of this period are supposed to contain autobiographical     material in the legend of good women he says        and as for me though that my wit be lytë       on bokës for to rede i me delytë      again in the house of fame he speaks of finding his real     life in books after his daily work in the customhouse is ended     some of the rekeninges itemized accounts of goods and duties to     which he refers are still preserved in chaucers handwriting        for whan thy labour doon al is       and hast ymaad thy rekeninges       in stede of reste and newë thinges       thou gost hoom to thy hous anoon       and also domb as any stoon       thou sittest at another boke       til fully dawsëd is thy loke       and livest thus as an hermytë       although thine abstinence is lytë      such are the scanty facts concerning englands first great poet     the more elaborate biographies being made up chiefly of guesses or     doubtful inferences he died in the year 1400 and was buried in     st benets chapel in westminster abbey a place now revered by all     lovers of literature as the poets corner      on reading chaucer said caxton who was the first to print     chaucers poetry he writeth no void words but all his matter is     full of high and quick sentence caxton was right and the modern     readers first aim should be to get the sense of chaucer rather     than his pronunciation to understand him is not so difficult as     appears at first sight for most of the words that look strange     because of their spelling will reveal their meaning to the ear if     spoken aloud thus the word leefful becomes leveful or     leaveful or permissible      next the reader should remember that chaucer was a master of     versification and that every stanza of his is musical at the     beginning of a poem therefore read a few lines aloud emphasizing     the accented syllables until the rhythm is fixed then make every     line conform to it and every word keep step to the music to do     this it is necessary to slur certain words and run others together     also since the mistakes of chaucers copyists are repeated in     modern editions it is often necessary to add a helpful word or     syllable to a line or to omit others that are plainly superfluous      this way of reading chaucer musically as one would read any other     poet has three advantages it is easy it is pleasant and it is     far more effective than the learning of a hundred specifications     laid down by the grammarians      sidenote rules for reading      as for chaucers pronunciation you will not get that accurately     without much study which were better spent on more important     matters so be content with a few rules which aim simply to help     you enjoy the reading as a general principle the root vowel of a     word was broadly sounded and the rest slurred over the     characteristic sound of a was as in far e was     sounded like a i like e and all diphthongs     as broadly as possiblein floures flowers for example which     should be pronounced floorës      another rule relates to final syllables and these will appear more     interesting if we remember that they represent the dying     inflections of nouns and adjectives which were then declined as in     modern german final ed and es are variable but the     rhythm will always tell us whether they should be given an extra     syllable or not so also with final e which is often     sounded but not if the following word begins with a vowel or with     h in the latter case the two words may be run together as     in reading virgil if a final e occurs at the end of a line     it may be lightly pronounced like a in

dominated by french influence chaucer probably translated parts of the roman de la rose a dreary allegorical poem in which love is represented as a queenrose in a garden surrounded by her court and ministers in endeavoring to pluck this rose the lover learns the commandments and sacraments of love and meets with various adventures at the hands of virtue constancy and other shadowy personages of less repute such allegories were the delight of the middle ages now they are as dust and ashes other and better works of this period are the book of the duchess an elegy written on the death of blanche wife of chaucers patron and various minor poems such as compleynte unto pitee the dainty love song to rosemunde and truth or the ballad of good counsel  characteristic works of the second or italian period are the house of fame the legend of good women and especially troilus and criseyde the lastnamed though little known to modern readers is one of the most remarkable narrative poems in our literature it began as a retelling of a familiar romance it ended in an original poem which might easily be made into a drama or a modern novel  sidenote story of troilus      the scene opens in troy during the siege of the city by the     greeks the hero troilus is a son of priam and is second only to     the mighty hector in warlike deeds devoted as he is to glory he     scoffs at lovers until the moment when his eye lights on cressida     she is a beautiful young widow and is free to do as she pleases     for the moment her father calchas having gone over to the greeks     to escape the doom which he sees impending on troy troilus falls     desperately in love with cressida but she does not know or care     and he is ashamed to speak his mind after scoffing so long at love     then appears pandarus friend of troilus and uncle to cressida who     soon learns the secret and brings the young people together after     a long courtship with interminable speeches as in the old     romances troilus wins the lady and all goes happily until calchas     arranges to have his daughter brought to him in exchange for a     captured trojan warrior the lovers are separated with many tears     but cressida comforts the despairing troilus by promising to     hoodwink her doting father and return in a few days calchas     however loves his daughter too well to trust her in a city that     must soon be given over to plunder and keeps her safe in the greek     camp there the handsome young diomede wins her and presently     troilus is killed in battle by achilles  such is the old romance of feminine fickleness which had been written a hundred times before chaucer took it bodily from boccaccio moreover he humored the old romantic delusion which required that a lover should fall sick in the absence of his mistress and turn pale or swoon at the sight of her but he added to the tale many elements not found in the old romances such as real men and women humor pathos analysis of human motives and a sense of impending tragedy which comes not from the loss of wealth or happiness but of character cressidas final thought of her first lover is intensely pathetic and a whole chapter of psychology is summed up in the line in which she promises herself to be true to diomede at the very moment when she is false to troilus    allas of me unto the worldës ende   shal

his favorite story has been used by so many poets ancient and modern that it is idle to seek the origin of it like topsy it wasnt born it just grew up chaucers plan however is more comprehensive than any other in that it includes all classes of society it is also more original in that it does not invent heroic characters but takes such men and women as one might meet in any assembly and shows how typical they are of humanity in all ages as lowell says chaucer made use in his canterbury tales of two things that are everywhere regarded as symbols of human life namely the short journey and the inn we might add as an indication of chaucers philosophy that his inn is a comfortable one and that the journey is made in pleasant company and in fair weather      an outline of chaucers great work is as follows on an evening in     springtime the poet comes to tabard inn in southwark and finds it     filled with a merry company of men and women bent on a pilgrimage     to the shrine of thomas à becket in canterbury      after supper appears the jovial host harry bailey who finds the     company so attractive that he must join it on its pilgrimage he     proposes that as they shall be long on the way they shall furnish     their own entertainment by telling stories the best tale to be     rewarded by the best of suppers when the pilgrims return from     canterbury they assent joyfully and on the morrow begin their     journey cheered by the knights tale as they ride forth under the     sunrise the light of morning and of springtime is upon this work     which is commonly placed at the beginning of modern english     literature  as the journey proceeds we note two distinct parts to chaucers record one part made up of prologues and interludes portrays the characters and action of the present comedy the other part consisting of stories reflects the comedies and tragedies of long ago the one shows the perishable side of the men and women of chaucers day their habits dress conversation the other reveals an imperishable world of thought feeling ideals in which these same men and women discover their kinship to humanity it is possible since some of the stories are related to each other that chaucer meant to arrange the canterbury tales in dramatic unity so as to make a huge comedy of human society but the work as it comes down to us is fragmentary and no one has discovered the order in which the fragments should be fitted together  illustration pilgrims setting out from the tabard  sidenote the prologue  the prologue is perhaps the best single fragment of the canterbury tales in it chaucer introduces us to the characters of his drama to the grave knight and the gay squire the one a model of chivalry at its best a verray parfit gentil knight the other a young man so full of life and love that he slept namore than dooth a nightingale to the modest prioress also with her pretty clothes her exquisite manners her boardingschool accomplishments    and frensh she spak ful faire and fetisly   after the scole of stratford attë bowë   for frensh of paris was to hir unknowë  in contrast to this dainty figure is the coarse wife of bath as garrulous as the nurse in romeo and juliet so one character stands to another as shade to light as they appear in a typical novel of dickens the church the greatest factor in medieval life is misrepresented by the hunting monk and the begging friar and is well represented by the parson who practiced true religion before he preached it    but christës lore and his apostles twelvë   he taughte and first he folwëd it himselvë  trade is represented by the merchant scholarship by the poor clerk of oxenford the professions by the doctor and the manoflaw common folk by the yeoman frankelyn farmer miller and many others of low degree prominent among the latter was the shipman    hardy he was and wys to undertakë   with many a tempest hadde his berd been shakë  from this character whom stevenson might have borrowed for his treasure island we infer the barbarity that prevailed when commerce was new when the english sailor was by turns smuggler or pirate equally ready to sail or scuttle a ship and to silence any tongue that might tell tales by making its wretched owner walk the plank chaucers description of the latter process is a masterpiece of piratical humor    if that he faught and hadde the hyer hond   by water he sente hem hoom to every lond  sidenote variety of tales  some thirty pilgrims appear in the famous prologue and as each was to tell two stories on the way to canterbury and two more on the return it is probable that chaucer contemplated a work of more than a hundred tales only fourandtwenty were completed but these are enough to cover the field of light literature in that day from the romance of love to the humorous animal fable between these are wonderstories of giants and fairies satires on the monks parodies on literature and some examples of coarse horseplay for which chaucer offers an apology saying that he must let each pilgrim tell his tale in his own way  a round dozen of these tales may still be read with pleasure but as a suggestion of chaucers variety we name only three the knights romance of palamon and arcite the nuns priests fable of chanticleer and the clerks old ballad of patient griselda the lastnamed will be more interesting if we remember that the subject of womans rights had been hurled at the heads of the pilgrims by the wife of bath and that the clerk told his story to illustrate his different ideal of womanhood  the charm of chaucer the first of chaucers qualities is that he is an excellent storyteller which means that he has a tale to tell a good method of telling it and a philosophy of life which gives us something to think about aside from the narrative he had a profound insight of human nature and in telling the simplest story was sure to slip in some nugget of wisdom or humor what wol nat be mote need be left for three may keep counsel if twain be away the lyf so short the craft so long to lerne ful wys is he that can himselven knowe    the firste vertue sone if thou wilt lere   is to restreine and kepen wel thy tonge  there are literally hundreds of such good things which make chaucer a constant delight to those who by a very little practice can understand him almost as easily as shakespeare moreover he was a careful artist he knew the principles of poetry and of storytelling and before he wrote a song or a tale he considered both his subject and his audience repeating to himself his own rule    ther nis no werkman whatsoever he be   that may bothe werkë wel and hastily   this wol be doon at leysur parfitly  a second quality of chaucer is his power of observation a power so extraordinary that unlike other poets he did not need to invent scenes or characters but only to describe what he had seen and heard in this wonderful world as he makes one of his characters say    for certeynly he that me made   to comen hider seydë me   i shouldë bothë hear et see   in this place wonder thingës  in the canterbury tales alone he employs more than a score of characters and hardly a romantic hero among them rather does he delight in plain men and women who reveal their quality not so much in their action as in their dress manner or tricks of speech for chaucer has the glance of an indian which passes over all obvious matters to light upon one significant detail and that detail furnishes the name or the adjective of the object sometimes his descriptions of men or nature are microscopic in their accuracy and again in a single line he awakens the readers imaginationas when pandarus in troilus in order to make himself unobtrusive in a room where he is not wanted picks up a manuscript and makes a face that is he pretends to be absorbed in a story              and fand his countenance   as for to loke upon an old romance  a dozen striking examples might be given but we shall note only one in the book of the duchess the poet is in a forest when a chase sweeps by with whoop of huntsman and clamor of hounds after the hunt when the woods are all still comes a little lost dog    hit com and creep to me as lowë   right as hit haddë me yknowë   hild down his heed and jiyned his eres   and leyde al smouthë doun his heres   i wolde han caught hit and anoon   hit fleddë and was fro me goon  sidenote chaucers humor  next to his power of description chaucers best quality is his humor a humor which is hard to phrase since it runs from the keenest wit to the broadest farce yet is always kindly and human a mendicant friar comes in out of the cold glances about the snug kitchen for the best seat    and fro the bench he droof awey the cat  sometimes his humor is delicate as in touching up the foibles of the doctor or the manoflaw or in the priests translation of chanticleers evil remark about women                    in principio   mulier est hominis confusio   madame the sentence of this latin is   woman is mannes joye and al his blis  the humor broadens in the wife of bath who tells how she managed several husbands by making their lives miserable and occasionally it grows a little grim as when the maunciple tells the difference between a big and a little rascal the former does evil on a large scale and    lo therfor is he cleped a capitain   but for the outlawe hath but small meynee   and may not doon so gret an harm as he   ne bring a countree to so gret mischeef   men clepen him an outlawe or a theef  sidenote freedom from bias  a fourth quality of chaucer is his broad tolerance his absolute disinterestedness he leaves reforms to wyclif and langland and can laugh with the shipman who turns smuggler or with the worldly monk whose jingling bridle keeps others as well as himself from hearing the chapel bell he will not even criticize the fickle cressida for deserting troilus saying that men tell tales about her which is punishment enough for any woman in fine chaucer is content to picture a world in which the rain falleth alike upon the just and the unjust and in which the latter seem to have a liberal share of the umbrellas he enjoys it all and describes its inhabitants as they are not as he thinks they ought to be the reader may think that this or that character deserves to come to a bad end but not so chaucer who regards them all as kindly as impersonally as nature herself  so the canterbury pilgrims are not simply fourteenthcentury englishmen they are human types whom chaucer met at the tabard inn and whom later english writers discover on all of earths highways one appears unchanged in shakespeares drama another in a novel of jane austen a third lives over the way or down the street from century to century they change not save in name or dress the poet who described or created such enduring characters stands among the few who are called universal writers                                       chaucers contemporaries and successors  someone has compared a literary period to a wood in which a few giant oaks lift head and shoulders above many other trees all nourished by the same soil and air if we follow this figure langland and wyclif are the only growths that tower beside chaucer and wyclif was a reformer who belongs to english history rather than to literature  langland william langland cir 13321400 is a great figure in obscurity we are not certain even of his name and we must search his work to discover that he was probably a poor laypriest whose life was governed by two motives a passion for the poor which led him to plead their cause in poetry and a longing for all knowledge    all the sciences under sonnë and all the sotyle craftës   i wolde i knew and couthë kyndely in mynë hertë  his chief poem piers plowman cir 1362 is a series of visions in which are portrayed the shams and impostures of the age and the misery of the common people the poem is therefore as the heavy shadow which throws into relief the bright picture of the canterbury tales  for example while chaucer portrays the tabard inn with its good cheer and merry company langland goes to another inn on the next street there he looks with pure eyes upon sad or evilfaced men and women drinking gaming quarreling and pictures a scene of physical and moral degradation one must look on both pictures to know what an english inn was like in the fourteenth century  because of its crude form and dialect piers plowman is hard to follow but to the few who have read it and entered into langlands visionshared his passion for the poor his hatred of shams his belief in the gospel of honest work his humor and satire and philosophyit is one of the most powerful and original poems in english literature footnote the working classes were beginning to assert themselves in this age and to proclaim the rights of man witness the followers of john ball and his influence over the crowd when he chanted the lines    when adam delved and eve span   who was then the gentleman  langlands poem written in the midst of the labor agitation was the first glorification of labor to appear in english literature those who read it may make an interesting comparison between piers plowman and a modern labor poem such as hoods song of the shirt or markhams the man with the hoe  malory judged by its influence the greatest prose work of the fifteenth century was the morte darthur of thomas malory d 1471 of the english knight who compiled this work very little is known beyond this that he sought to preserve in literature the spirit of medieval knighthood and religion he tells us nothing of this purpose but caxton who received the only known copy of malorys manuscript and published it in 1485 seems to have reflected the authors spirit in these words      i according to my copy have set it in imprint to the intent that     noble men may see and learn the noble acts of chivalry the gentle     and virtuous deeds that some knyghts used in those days by which     they came to honour and how they that were vicious were punished     and put oft to shame and rebuke for herein may be seen noble     chivalry courtesy humanity hardness love friendship     cowardice murder hate virtue and sin do after the good and     leave the evil and it shall bring you to good fame and renommee  illustration a street in caerleon on usk the traditional home of king arthur  malorys spirit is further indicated by the fact that he passed over all extravagant tales of foreign heroes and used only the best of the arthurian romances footnote for the origin of the arthurian stories see above geoffrey and the legends of arthur in chapter ii an example of the way these stories were enlarged is given by lewis beginnings of english literature pp 7376 who records the story of arthurs death as told first by geoffrey then by layamon and finally by malory who copied the tale from french sources if we add tennysons passing of arthur we shall have the story as told from the twelfth to the nineteenth century these had been left in a chaotic state by poets and malory brought order out of the chaos by omitting tedious fables and arranging his material in something like dramatic unity under three heads the coming of arthur with its glorious promise the round table and the search for the holy grail      and thenne the kynge and al estates wente home unto camelot and     soo wente to evensonge to the grete mynster and soo after upon     that to souper and every knyght sette in his owne place as they     were to forehand

says of the figures of the iliad in tenderness and inexpiable sorrow  as the best of malorys work is now easily accessible we forbear further quotation these old arthurian legends the common inheritance of all englishspeaking people should be known to every reader as they appear in morte darthur they are notable as an example of fine old english prose as a reflection of the enduring ideals of chivalry and finally as a storehouse in which spenser tennyson and many others have found material for some of their noblest poems  caxton william caxton d 1491 is famous for having brought the printing press to england but he has other claims to literary renown he was editor as well as printer he translated more than a score of the books which came from his press and finally it was he who did more than any other man to fix a standard of english speech  in caxtons day several dialects were in use and as we infer from one of his prefaces he was doubtful which was most suitable for literature or most likely to become the common speech of england his doubt was dissolved by the time he had printed the canterbury tales and the morte darthur many other works followed in the same kings english his successor at the printing press wynkyn de worde continued in the same line and when less than sixty years after the first english book was printed tyndales translation of the new testament had found its way to every shire in england there was no longer room for doubt that the eastmidland dialect had become the standard of the english nation we have been speaking and writing that dialect ever since  illustration the almonry westminster caxtons printing office from an old print  sidenote story of the printing press  the story of how printing came to england not as a literary but as a business venture is a very interesting one caxton was an english merchant who had established himself at bruges then one of the trading centers of europe there his business prospered and he became governor of the domus angliae or house of the english guild of merchant adventurers there is romance in the very name with moderate wealth came leisure to caxton and he indulged his literary taste by writing his own version of some popular romances concerning the siege of troy being encouraged by the english princess margaret duchess of burgundy into whose service he had entered  copies of his work being in demand caxton consulted the professional copyists whose beautiful work we read about in a remarkable novel called the cloister and the hearth then suddenly came to bruges the rumor of gutenbergs discovery of printing from movable types and caxton hastened to germany to investigate the matter led by the desire to get copies of his own work as cheaply as possible the discovery fascinated him instead of a few copies of his manuscript he brought back to bruges a press from which he issued his recuyell of the historyes of troy 1474 which was probably the first book to appear in english print quick to see the commercial advantages of the new invention caxton moved his printing press to london near westminster abbey where he brought out in 1477 his dictes and sayinges of the philosophers the first book ever printed on english soil footnote another book of caxtons the game and playe of the chesse 1475 was long accorded this honor but it is fairly certain that the book on chessplaying was printed in bruges  sidenote the first printed books  from the very outset caxtons venture was successful and he was soon busy in supplying books that were most in demand he has been criticized for not printing the classics and other books of the new learning but he evidently knew his business and his audience and aimed to give people what they wanted not what he thought they ought to have chaucers canterbury tales malorys morte darthur mandevilles travels Æsops fables parts of the Æneid translations of french romances lives of the saints the golden legend cookbooks prayer books books of etiquettethe list of caxtons eightyodd publications becomes significant when we remember that he printed only popular books and that the titles indicate the taste of the age which first looked upon the marvel of printing  popular ballads if it be asked what is a ballad any positive answer will lead to disputation originally the ballad was probably a chant to accompany a dance and so it represents the earliest form of poetry in theory as various definitions indicate it is a short poem telling a story of some exploit usually of a valorous kind in common practice from chaucer to tennyson the ballad is almost any kind of short poem treating of any event grave or gay in any descriptive or dramatic way that appeals to the poet  for the origin of the ballad one must search far back among the social customs of primitive times that the anglosaxons were familiar with it appears from the record of tacitus who speaks of their carmina or narrative songs but with the exception of the fight at finnsburgh and a few other fragments all these have disappeared  during the middle ages ballads were constantly appearing among the common people footnote thus when sidney says i never heard the old song of percy and douglass that i found not my heart moved more than with a trumpet and when shakespeare shows autolycus at a country fair offering songs for men and women of all sizes both poets are referring to popular ballads even later as late as the american revolution history was first written for the people in the form of ballads but they were seldom written and found no standing in polite literature in the eighteenth century however certain men who had grown weary of the formal poetry of pope and his school turned for relief to the old vigorous ballads of the people and rescued them from oblivion the one book to which more than any other we owe the revival of interest in balladry is percys reliques of ancient english poetry 1765  sidenote the marks of a ballad  the best of our ballads date in their present form from the fifteenth or sixteenth century but the originals were much older and had been transmitted orally for years before they were recorded on manuscript as we study them we note as their first characteristic that they spring from the unlettered common people that they are by unknown authors and that they appear in different versions because they were changed by each minstrel to suit his own taste or that of his audience  a second characteristic is the objective quality of the ballad which deals not with a poets thought or feeling such subjective emotions give rise to the lyric but with a man or a deed see in the ballad of sir patrick spence or spens how the unknown author goes straight to his story    the king sits in dumferling towne     drinking the bludered wine   o whar will i get guid sailor     to sail this schip of mine    up and spak an eldern knicht     sat at the kings richt kne   sir patrick spence is the best sailor     that sails upon the se  there is a brief pause to tell us of sir patricks dismay when word comes that the king expects him to take out a ship at a time when she should be riding to anchor then on goes the narrative    mak hast mak haste my mirry men all     our guid schip sails the morne   o say na sae my master deir     for i feir a deadlie storme    late late yestreen i saw the new moone     wi the auld moone in hir arme   and i feir i feir my deir master     that we will cum to harme  at the end there is no wailing no moral no display of the poets feeling but just a picture    o lang lang may the ladies stand     wi thair gold kems in their hair   waiting for thair ain deir lords     for theyll se thame na mair    haf owre haf owre to aberdour     its fiftie fadom deip   and thair lies guid sir patrick spence     wi the scots lords at his feit  directness vigor dramatic action an ending that appeals to the imaginationmost of the good qualities of storytelling are found in this old scottish ballad if we compare it with longfellows wreck of the hesperus we may discover that the two poets though far apart in time and space have followed almost identical methods  other good ballads which take us out under the open sky among vigorous men are certain parts of the gest of robin hood mary hamilton the wife of ushers well the wee wee man fair helen hind horn bonnie george campbell johnnie ocockleys well catharine jaffray from which scott borrowed his lochinvar and especially the nutbrown mayde sweetest and most artistic of all the ballads which gives a popular and happy version of the tale that chaucer told in his patient griselda                                           summary the period included in the age of chaucer and the revival     of learning covers two centuries from 1350 to 1550 the chief     literary figure of the period and one of the greatest of english     poets is geoffrey chaucer who died in the year 1400 he was     greatly influenced by french and italian models he wrote for the     middle and upper classes his greatest work was the canterbury     tales      langland another poet contemporary with chaucer is famous for his     piers plowman a powerful poem aiming at social reform and     vividly portraying the life of the common people it is written in     the old saxon manner with accent and alliteration and is     difficult to read in its original form      after the death of chaucer a century and a half passed before     another great writer appeared in england the time was one of     general decline in literature and the most obvious causes were     the wars of the roses which destroyed many of the patrons of     literature the reformation which occupied the nation with     religious controversy and the renaissance or revival of learning     which turned scholars to the literature of greece and rome rather     than to english works      in our study of the latter part of the period we reviewed 1 the     rise of the popular ballad which was almost the only type of     literature known to the common people 2 the work of malory who     arranged the best of the arthurian

england                          shakespeare king richard ii       historical background in such triumphant lines falling from the     lips of that old imperialist john of gaunt did shakespeare     reflect not the rebellious spirit of the age of richard ii but     the boundless enthusiasm of his own times when the defeat of     spains mighty armada had left england in splendid isolation     unchallenged mistress of her own realm and of the encircling sea     for it was in the latter part of elizabeths reign that england     found herself as a nation and became conscious of her destiny as a     world empire      there is another and darker side to the political shield but the     student of literature is not concerned with it we are to remember     the patriotic enthusiasm of the age overlooking the frequent     despotism of good queen bess and entering into the spirit of     national pride and power that thrilled all classes of englishmen     during her reign if we are to understand the outburst of     elizabethan literature nearly two centuries of trouble and danger     had passed since chaucer died and no national poet had appeared in     england the renaissance came and the reformation but they     brought no great writers with them during the first thirty years     of elizabeths reign not a single important literary work was     produced then suddenly appeared the poetry of spenser and chapman     the prose of hooker sidney and bacon the dramas of marlowe     shakespeare ben jonson and a score of othersall voicing the     national feeling after the defeat of the armada and growing silent     as soon as the enthusiasm began to wane  literary characteristics next to the patriotic spirit of elizabethan literature its most notable qualities are its youthful freshness and vigor its romantic spirit its absorption in the theme of love its extravagance of speech its lively sense of the wonder of heaven and earth the ideal beauty of spensers poetry the bombast of marlowe the boundless zest of shakespeares historical plays the romantic love celebrated in unnumbered lyricsall these speak of youth of springtime of the joy and the heroic adventure of human living  this romantic enthusiasm of elizabethan poetry and prose may be explained by the fact that besides the national impulse three other inspiring influences were at work the first in point of time was the rediscovery of the classics of greece and romebeautiful old poems which were as new to the elizabethans as to keats when he wrote his immortal sonnet beginning    much have i travelld in the realms of gold  the second awakening factor was the widespread interest in nature and the physical sciences which spurred many another elizabethan besides bacon to take all knowledge for his province this new interest was generally romantic rather than scientific was more concerned with marvels like the philosophers stone that would transmute all things to gold than with the simple facts of nature bacons chemical changes which follow the instincts of metals are almost on a par with those other changes described in shakespeares song of ariel    full fathom five thy father lies        of his bones are coral made   those are pearls that were his eyes        nothing of him that doth fade   but doth suffer a seachange   into something rich and strange  the third factor which stimulated the elizabethan imagination was the discovery of the world beyond the atlantic a world of wealth of beauty of unmeasured opportunity for brave spirits in regions long supposed to be possessed of demons monsters othellos impossible            cannibals that each other eat   the anthropophagi and men whose heads   do grow beneath their shoulders  sidenote the new world  when drake returned from his voyage around the world he brought to england two things a tale of vast regions just over the worlds rim that awaited english explorers and a ship loaded to the hatches with gold and jewels that the latter treasure was little better than a pirates booty that it was stolen from the spaniards who had taken it from poor savages at the price of blood and tortureall this was not mentioned the queen and her favorites shared the treasure with drakes buccaneers and the new world seemed to them a place of barbaric splendor where the savages wattled hut was roofed with silver his garments beaded with all precious jewels as a popular play of the period declares      why man all their dripping pans are pure gold the prisoners     they take are fettered in gold and as for rubies and diamonds     they goe forth on holydayes and gather hem by the seashore to hang     on their childrens coates  before the american settlements opened englands eyes to the stern reality of things it was the romance of the new world that appealed most powerfully to the imagination and that influenced elizabethan literature to an extent which we have not yet begun to measure  foreign influence we shall understand the imitative quality of early elizabethan poetry if we read it in the light of these facts that in the sixteenth century england was far behind other european nations in culture that the renaissance had influenced italy and holland for a century before it crossed the channel that at a time when every dutch peasant read his bible the masses of english people remained in dense ignorance and the majority of the official classes were like shakespeares father and daughter in that they could neither read nor write so when the new national spirit began to express itself in literature englishmen turned to the more cultured nations and began to imitate them in poetry as in dress and manners shakespeare gives us a hint of the matter when he makes portia ridicule the apishness of the english in the merchant of venice act i scene 2 the maid nerissa is speaking of various princely suitors for portias hand she names them over frenchman italian scotsman german but portia makes fun of them all the maid tries again    nerissa what say you then to falconbridge the young baron of         england    portia  you know i say nothing to him for he understands not me         nor i him he hath neither latin french nor italian and you will         come into the court and swear that i have a poor pennyworth in the         english he is a proper mans picture but alas who can converse         with a dumb show how oddly he is suited i think he bought his         doublet in italy his round hose in france his bonnet in germany         and his behaviour every where  when wyatt and surrey brought the sonnet to england they brought also the habit of imitating the italian poets and this habit influenced spenser and other elizabethans even more than chaucer had been influenced by dante and petrarch it was the fashion at that time for italian gentlemen to write poetry they practiced the art as they practiced riding or fencing and presently scores of englishmen followed sidneys example in taking up this phase of foreign education it was also an italian custom to publish the works of amateur poets in the form of anthologies and soon there appeared in england the paradise of dainty devices a gorgeous gallery of gallant inventions and other such collections the best of which was englands helicon 1600 still another foreign fashion was that of writing a series of sonnets to some real or imaginary mistress and that the fashion was followed in england is evident from spensers amoretti sidneys astrophel and stella shakespeares sonnets and other lessfamous effusions                                       spenser and the lyric poets  illustration michael drayton  lyrics of love love was the subject of a very large part of the minor poems of the period the monotony being relieved by an occasional ballad such as draytons battle of agincourt and his ode to the virginian voyage the latter being one of the first poems inspired by the new world since love was still subject to literary rules as in the metrical romances it is not strange that most elizabethan lyrics seem to the modern reader artificial they deal largely with goddesses and airy shepherd folk they contain many references to classic characters and scenes to venus olympus and the rest they are nearly all characterized by extravagance of language a single selection apelles song by lyly may serve as typical of the more fantastic love lyrics    cupid and my campaspe played   at cards for kisses cupid paid   he stakes his quiver bow and arrows   his mothers doves and team of sparrows   loses them too then down he throws   the coral of his lip the rose   growing ons cheek but none knows how   with these the crystal of his brow   and then the dimple of his chin   all these did my campaspe win   at last he set her both his eyes   she won and cupid blind did rise   o love has she done this to thee   what shall alas become of me  music and poetry another reason for the outburst of lyric poetry in elizabethan times was that choral music began to be studied and there was great demand for new songs then appeared a theory of the close relation between poetry and music which was followed by the american poet lanier more than two centuries later footnote much of laniers verse seems more like a musical improvisation than like an ordinary poem his theory that music and poetry are subject to the same laws is developed in his science of english verse it is interesting to note that laniers ancestors were musical directors at the courts of elizabeth and of james i this interesting theory is foreshadowed in several minor works of the period for example in barnfields sonnet to r l beginning    if music and sweet poetry agree   as they must needs the sister and the brother   then must the love be great twixt thee and me   because thou lovst the one and i the other  the stage caught up the new fashion and hundreds of lyrics appeared in the elizabethan drama such as dekkers content from the play of patient grissell which almost sets itself to music as we read it    art thou poor yet hast thou golden slumbers          o sweet content   art thou rich yet is thy mind perplexed          o punishment   dost laugh to see how fools are vexed   to add to golden numbers golden numbers     o sweet content o sweet o sweet content    work apace apace apace apace   honest labour bears a lovely face   then hey noney noney hey noney noney    canst drink the waters of the crisped spring          o sweet content   swimst thou in wealth yet sinkst in thine own tears          o punishment   then he that patiently wants burden bears   no burden bears but is a king a king     o sweet content o sweet o sweet content  so many lyric poets appeared during this period that we cannot here classify them and it would be idle to list their names the best place to make acquaintance with theo is not in a dry history of literature but in such a pleasant little book as palgraves golden treasury where their best work is accessible to every reader                                       edmund spenser 15521599  spenser was the second of the great english poets and it is but natural to compare him with chaucer who was the first in respect of time nearly two centuries separate these elder poets in all other respects in aims ideals methods they are as far apart as two men of the same race can well be      life very little is known of spenser he appears in the light     then vanishes into the shadow like his arthur of the faery     queen we see him for a moment in the midst of rebellion in     ireland or engaged in the scramble for preferment among the     queens favorites he disappears and from his obscurity comes a     poem that is like the distant ringing of a chapel bell faintly     heard in the clatter of the city streets we shall try here to     understand this poet by dissolving some of the mystery that     envelops him      he was born in london and spent his youth amid the political and     religious dissensions of the times of mary and elizabeth for all     this turmoil spenser had no stomach he was a man of peace of     books of romantic dreams he was of noble family but poor his     only talent was to write poetry and as poetry would not buy much     bread in those days his pride of birth was humbled in seeking the     patronage of nobles        full little knowest thou that hast not tried       what hell it is in suing long to bide        to fawn to crouch to wait to ride to run       to spend to give to want to be undone      to the liberality of a patron he owed his education at cambridge     it was then the heyday of renaissance studies and spenser steeped     himself in greek latin and italian literatures everything that     was antique was then in favor at the universities there was a     revival of interest in oldenglish poetry which accounts largely     for spensers use of obsolete words and his imitation of chaucers     spelling      after graduation he spent some time in the north of england     probably as a tutor and had an unhappy love affair which he     celebrated in his poems to rosalind then he returned to london     lived by favor in the houses of sidney and leicester and through     these powerful patrons was appointed secretary to lord grey de     wilton the queens deputy in ireland      illustration edmund spenser      sidenote spensers exile      from this time on our poet is represented as a melancholy spensers     exile but that is a poetic fiction at that time ireland having     refused to follow the reformation was engaged in a desperate     struggle for civil and religious liberty every english army that     sailed to crush this rebellion was accompanied by a swarm of     parasites each inspired by the hope of getting one of the rich     estates that were confiscated from irish owners spenser seems to     have been one of these expectant adventurers who accompanied lord     grey in his campaign of brutality to the horrors of that campaign     the poet was blind footnote the barbarism of spensers view a     common one at that time is reflected in his view of the present     state of ireland honorable warfare on land or sea was unknown     in elizabeths day scores of pirate ships of all nations were then     openly preying on commerce drake frobisher and many other     elizabethan heroes were at times mere buccaneers who shared their     plunder with the queen in putting down the irish rebellion lords     grey and essex used some of the same horrible methods employed by     the notorious duke of alva in the netherlands his sympathies were     all for his patron grey who appears in the faery queen as sir     artegall the model of true justice      for his services spenser was awarded the castle of kilcolman and     3000 acres of land which had been taken from the earl of desmond     in the same way raleigh became an irish landlord with 40000 acres     to his credit and so these two famous elizabethans were thrown     together in exile as they termed it both longed to return to     england to enjoy london society and the revenues of irish land at     the same time but unfortunately one condition of their immense     grants was that they should occupy the land and keep the rightful     owners from possessing it      sidenote work in ireland      in ireland spenser began to write his masterpiece the faery     queen raleigh to whom the first three books were read was so     impressed by the beauty of the work that he hurried the poet off to     london and gained for him the royal favor in the poem colin     clouts come home again we may read spensers account of how the     court impressed him after his sojourn in ireland        illustration raleighs birthplace budleigh salterton       hayes devonshire      the publication of the first parts of the faery queen 1590     raised spenser to the foremost place in english letters he was     made poetlaureate and used every influence of patrons and of     literary success to the end that he be allowed to remain in london     but the queen was flinthearted insisting that he must give up his     estate or occupy it so he returned sorrowfully to exile and     wrote three more books of the faery queen to his other     offices was added that of sheriff of county cork an adventurous     office for any man even in times of peace and for a poet in a     time of turmoil an invitation to disaster presently another     rebellion broke out kilcolman castle was burned and the poets     family barely escaped with their lives it was said by ben jonson     that one of spensers children and some parts of the faery     queen perished in the fire but the truth of the saying has not     been established      soon after this experience which crushed the poets spirit he was     ordered on official business to london and died on the journey in     1599 as he was buried beside chaucer in westminster abbey poets     were seen casting memorial verses and the pens that had written     them into his tomb      sidenote character      in character spenser was unfitted either for the intrigues among     elizabeths favorites or for the more desperate scenes amid which     his lot was cast unlike his friend raleigh who was a man of     action spenser was essentially a dreamer and except in cambridge     he seems never to have felt at home his criticism of the age as     barren and hopeless and the melancholy of the greater part of his     work indicate that for him at least the great elizabethan times     were out of joint the world which thinks of spenser as a great     poet has forgotten that he thought of himself as a disappointed     man  works of spenser the poems of spenser may be conveniently grouped in three classes in the first are the pastorals of the shepherds calendar in which he reflects some of the poetical fashions of his age in the second are the allegories of the faery queen in which he pictures the state of england as a struggle between good and evil in the third class are his occasional poems of friendship and love such as the amoretti all his works are alike musical and all remote from ordinary life like the eerie music of a wind harp  sidenote shepherds calendar  the shepherds calendar 1579 is famous as the poem which announced that a successor to chaucer had at last appeared in england it is an amateurish work in which spenser tried various meters and to analyze it is to discover two discordant elements which we may call fashionable poetry and puritanic preaching let us understand these elements clearly for apart from them the calendar is a meaningless work  it was a fashion among italian poets to make eclogues or pastoral poems about shepherds their dancing piping lovemakingeverything except a shepherds proper business spenser followed this artificial fashion in his calendar by making twelve pastorals one for each month of the year these all take the form of conversations accompanied by music and dancing and the personages are cuddie diggon hobbinoll and other fantastic shepherds according to poetic custom these should sing only of love but in spensers day religious controversy was rampant and flattery might not be overlooked by a poet who aspired to royal favor so while the january pastoral tells of the unhappy love of colin clout spenser for rosalind the springtime of april calls for a song in praise of elizabeth    lo how finely the graces can it foot     to the instrument   they dancen deffly and singen soote     in their merriment   wants not a fourth grace to make the dance even   let that room to my lady be yeven     she shall be a grace     to fill the fourth place   and reign with the rest in heaven  in may the shepherds are rival pastors of the reformation who end their sermons with an animal fable in summer they discourse of puritan theology october brings them to contemplate the trials and disappointments of a poet and the series ends with a parable comparing life to the four seasons of the year  the moralizing of the shepherds calendar and the uncouth spelling which spenser affected detract from the interest of the poem but one who has patience to read it finds on almost every page some fine poetic line and occasionally a good song like the following from the august pastoral in which two shepherds alternately supply the lines of a roundelay    sitting upon a hill so high       hey ho the high hill   the while my flock did feed thereby       the while the shepherds self did spill   i saw the bouncing bellibone       hey ho bonnibell   tripping over the dale alone       she can trip it very well   well deckéd in a frock of gray       hey ho gray is greet   and in a kirtle of green say       the green is for maidens meet   a chaplet on her head she wore       hey ho chapelet   of sweet violets therein was store       she sweeter than the violet  the faery queen let us hear one of the stories of this celebrated poem and after the tale is told we may discover spensers purpose in writing all the others      sidenote sir guyon      from the court of gloriana queen of faery the gallant sir guyon     sets out on adventure bent and with him is a holy palmer or     pilgrim to protect him from the evil that lurks by every wayside     hardly have the two entered the first wood when they fall into the     hands of the wicked archimago who spends his time in devising     spells or enchantments for the purpose of leading honest folk     astray        for all he did was to deceive good knights       and draw them from pursuit of praise and fame      escaping from the snare guyon hears a lamentation and turns aside     to find a beautiful woman dying beside a dead knight her story is     that her man has been led astray by the lady acrasia who leads     many knights to her bower of bliss and there makes them forget     honor and knightly duty guyon vows to right this wrong and     proceeds on the adventure      with the palmer and a boatman he embarks in a skiff and crosses the     gulf of greediness deadly whirlpools on one side and on the other     the magnet mountain with wrecks of ships strewed about its foot     sighting the fair wandering isles he attempts to land attracted     here by a beautiful damsel there by a woman in distress but the     palmer tells him that these seeming women are evil shadows placed     there to lead men astray next he meets the monsters of the deep     seashouldering whales scolopendras grisly wassermans     mighty monoceroses with unmeasured tails escaping these he     meets a greater peril in the mermaids who sing to him alluringly        this is port of rest from troublous toil       the worlds sweet inn from pain and wearisome turmoil      many other seadangers are passed before guyon comes to land where     he is immediately charged by a bellowing herd of savage beasts     only the power of the palmers holy staff saves the knight from     annihilation      this is the last physical danger which guyon encounters as he goes     forward the country becomes an earthly paradise where pleasures     call to him from every side it is his soul not his body which is     now in peril here is the palace of pleasure its wondrous gates     carved with images representing jasons search for the golden     fleece beyond it are parks gardens fountains and the beautiful     lady excess who squeezes grapes into a golden cup and offers it to     guyon as an invitation to linger the scene grows ever more     entrancing as he rejects the cup of excess and pushes onward        eftsoones they heard a most melodious sound       of all that mote delight a dainty ear       such as at once might not on living ground       save in this paradise be heard elsewhere       right hard it was for wight which did it hear       to read what manner music that mote be       for all that pleasing is to living ear       was there consorted in one harmony       birds voices instruments winds waters all agree      amid such allurements guyon comes at last to where beautiful     acrasia lives with knights who forget their knighthood from the     open portal comes a melody the voice of an unseen singer lifting     up the old song of epicurus and of omar        gather the rose of love whilst yet is time      the following scenes in the bower of bliss were plainly suggested     by the palace of circe in the odyssey but where homer is     direct simple forceful spenser revels in luxuriant details he     charms all guyons senses with color perfume beauty harmony     then he remembers that he is writing a moral poem and suddenly his     delighted knight turns reformer he catches acrasia in a net woven     by the palmer and proceeds to smash her exquisite abode with     puritanic thoroughness        but all those pleasaunt bowers and palace brave       guyon brake down with rigour pitilesse      as they fare forth after the destruction the herd of horrible     beasts is again encountered and lo all these creatures are men     whom acrasia has transformed into brutal shapes the palmer     strooks them all with his holy staff and they resume their human     semblance some are glad others wroth at the change and one named     grylle who had been a hog reviles his rescuers for disturbing     him which gives the palmer a final chance to moralize        let grylle be grylle and have his hoggish mind       but let us hence depart while weather serves and wind  sidenote other stories  such is spensers story of sir guyon or temperance it is a long story drifting through eightyseven stanzas but it is only a final chapter or canto of the second book of the faery queen preceding it are eleven other cantos which serve as an introduction so leisurely is spenser in telling a tale one canto deals with the wiles of archimago and of the false witch duessa in another the varlet braggadocchio steals guyons horse and impersonates a knight until he is put to shame by the fair huntress belphoebe who is queen elizabeth in disguise now elizabeth had a hawk face which was far from comely but behold how it appeared to a poet    her face so fair as flesh it seemëd not   but heavenly portrait of bright angels hue   clear as the sky withouten blame or blot   through goodly mixture of complexions due   and in her cheek the vermeil red did shew   like roses in a bed of lilies shed   the which ambrosial odours from them threw   and gazers sense with double pleasure fed   able to heal the sick and to revive the dead  there are a dozen more stanzas devoted to her voice her eyes her hair her more than mortal beauty other cantos of the same book are devoted to guyons temptations to his victories over furor and mammon to his rescue of the lady alma besieged by a horde of villains in her fair castle of temperance in this castle was an aged man blind but forever doting over old records and this gives spenser the inspiration for another long canto devoted to the ancient kings of britain so all is fish that comes to this poets net but as one who is angling for trout is vexed by the nibbling of chubs the reader grows weary of spensers story before his story really begins  sidenote the first book  other books of the faery queen are so similar in character to the one just described that a canto from any one of them may be placed without change in any other in the first book for example the redcross knight holiness fares forth accompanied by the lady una religion straightway they meet the enchanter archimago who separates them by fraud and magic the redcross knight led to believe that his una is false comes after many adventures to queen lucifera in the house of pride meanwhile una wanders alone amidst perils and by her beauty subdues the lion and the satyrs of the wood the rest of the book recounts their adventures with paynims giants and monsters with error avarice falsehood and other allegorical figures  it is impossible to outline such a poem for the simple reason that it has no outlines it is a phantasmagoria of beautiful and grotesque shapes of romance morality and magic reading it is like watching cloud masses aloft and remote in which the imagination pictures men monsters landscapes which change as we view them without cause or consequence though the faery queen is overfilled with adventure it has no action as we ordinarily understand the term its continual motion is without force or direction like the vague motions of a dream  sidenote plan of the faery queen  what then was spensers object in writing the faery queen his professed object was to use poetry in the service of morality by portraying the political and religious affairs of england as emblematic of a worldwide conflict between good and evil according to his philosophy which he tells us he borrowed from aristotle there were twelve chief virtues and he planned twelve books to celebrate them footnote only six of these books are extant treating of the redcross knight or holiness sir guyon or temperance britomartis or chastity cambel and triamond or friendship sir artegall or justice and sir calidore or courtesy the rest of the allegory if written may have been destroyed in the fire of kilcolman in each book a knight or a lady representing a single virtue goes forth into the world to conquer evil in all the books arthur or magnificence the sum of all virtue is apt to appear in any crisis lady una represents religion archimago is another name for heresy and duessa for falsehood and in order to give point to spensers allegory the courtiers and statesmen of the age are all flattered as glorious virtues or condemned as ugly vices  sidenote the allegory  those who are fond of puzzles may delight in giving names and dates to these allegorical personages in recognizing elizabeth in belphoebe or britomart or marcella sidney in the redcross knight leicester in arthur raleigh in timias mary stuart in duessa and so on through the list of characters good or evil the beginner will wisely ignore all such interpretation and for two reasons first because spensers allegories are too shadowy to be taken seriously and second because as a chronicler of the times he is outrageously partisan and untrustworthy in short to search for any reality in the faery queen is to spoil the poem as a work of the imagination if you do not meddle with the allegory said hazlitt the allegory will not meddle with you  minor poems the minor poems of spenser are more interesting because more human than the famous work which we have just considered prominent among these poems are the amoretti a collection of sonnets written in honor of the irish girl elizabeth who became the poets wife they are artificial to be sure but no more so than other love poems of the period in connection with a few of these sonnets may be read spensers four hymns in honor of love beauty heavenly love and heavenly beauty and especially his epithalamium a marriage hymn which brooke calls with pardonable enthusiasm the most glorious love song in the english language  a criticism of spenser in reading the faery queen one must note the contrast between spensers matter and his manner his matter is religion chivalry mythology italian romance arthurian legends the struggles of spain and england on the continent the reformation the turmoil of political parties the appeal of the new worlda summary of all stirring matters that interested his own tumultuous age his manner is the reverse of what one might expect under the circumstances he writes no stirring epic of victory or defeat and never a downright word of a downright man but a dreamy shadowy narrative as soothing as the abode of morpheus    and more to lulle him in his slumber soft   a trickling stream from high rock tumbling downe   and everdrizzling rain upon the loft   mixt with a murmuring winde much like the sowne   of swarming bees did cast him in a swowne   no other noyse nor peoples troublous cryes   as still are wont t annoy the wallëd towne   might there be heard but careless quiet lyes   wrapt in eternal silence far from enemyes  such stanzas and they abound in every book of the faery queen are poems in themselves but unfortunately they distract attention from the story which soon loses all progression and becomes as the rocking of an idle boat on the swell of a placid sea the invention of this melodious stanza ever since called spenserian was in itself a notable achievement which influenced all subsequent english poetry footnote the spenserian was an improvement on the ottavarima or eightline stanza of the italians it has been used by burns in the cotters saturday night by shelley in the revolt of islam by byron in childe harold by keats in the eve of st agnes and by many other poets  sidenote spensers faults  as spensers faults cannot be ignored let us be rid of them as quickly as possible we record then the unreality of his great work its lack of human interest which causes most of us to drop the poem after a single canto its affected antique spelling its use of fone foes dan master teene trouble swink labor and of many more obsolete words its frequent torturing of the kings english to make a rime its utter lack of humor appearing in such absurd lines as    astond he stood and up his hair did hove  sidenote moral ideal  such defects are more than offset by spensers poetic virtues we note first the moral purpose which allies him with the medieval poets in aim but not in method by most medieval romancers virtue was regarded as a means to an end as in the morte d arthur where a knight made a vow of purity in order to obtain a sight of the holy grail with spenser virtue is not a means but an end beautiful and desirable for its own sake while sin is so pictured that men avoid it because of its intrinsic ugliness this is the moral secret of the faery queen in which virtues are personified as noble knights or winsome women while the vices appear in the repulsive guise of hags monsters and loathy beasts  sidenote sense of beauty  spensers sense of ideal beauty or as lanier expressed it the beauty of holiness and the holiness of beauty is perhaps his greatest poetic quality he is the poetpainter of the renaissance he fills his pages with descriptions of airy loveliness as italian artists covered the high ceilings of venice with the reflected splendor of earth and heaven moreover his sense of beauty found expression in such harmonious lines that one critic describes him as having set beautiful figures moving to exquisite music  in consequence of this beauty and melody spenser has been the inspiration of nearly all later english singers milton was one of the first to call him master and then in a long succession such diverse poets as dryden burns wordsworth scott shelley keats byron tennyson and swinburne the poet of faery has influenced all these and more so deeply that he has won the distinctive title of the poets poet                                       the dramatists  few events in our literary history are so startling as this sudden rise of the elizabethan drama says green in his history of the english people and his judgment is echoed by other writers who speak of the marvelous efflorescence of the english drama as a matter beyond explanation startling it may be with its frank expression of a nations life the glory and the shame of it but there is nothing sudden or inexplicable about it as we may see by reviewing the history of playwriting in england  the religious drama in its simplicity the drama is a familiar story retold to the eye by actors who make believe that they are the heroes of the action in this elemental form the play is almost as old as humanity indeed it seems to be a natural impulse of children to act a story which has given them pleasure of primitive men also who from time immemorial have kept alive the memory of tribal heroes by representing their deeds in play or pantomime thus certain parts of hiawatha are survivals of dramatic myths that were once acted at the spring assembly of the algonquin indians an interesting fact concerning these primitive dramas whether in india or greece or persia is that they were invariably associated with some religious belief or festival  sidenote the first miracles  a later example of this is found in the church which at an early age began to make its holyday services more impressive by means of miracle plays and mysteries footnote in france any play representing the life of a saint was called miracle and a play dealing with the life of christ was called mystère in england no such distinction was made the name miracle being given to any drama dealing with bible history or with the lives of the saints at christmas time for example the beautiful story of bethlehem would be made more vivid by placing in a corner of the parish church an image of a babe in a manger with shepherds and the magi at hand and the choir in white garments chanting the gloria in excelsis other festivals were celebrated in a similar way until a cycle of simple dramas had been prepared clustering around four cardinal points of christian teaching namely creation the fall redemption and doomsday or the last judgment  sidenote growth of the miracles  at first such plays were given in the church and were deeply religious in spirit they made a profound impression in england especially where people flocked in such numbers to see them that presently they overflowed to the churchyard and from there to the city squares or the town common once outside the church they were taken up by the guilds or tradesunions in whose hands they lost much of their religious character actors were trained for the stage rather than for the church and to please the crowds elements of comedy and buffoonery were introduced footnote in the shepherds play or play of the nativity for example the adoration of the magi is interrupted by mak who steals a sheep and carries it to his wife she hides the carcass in a cradle and sings a lullaby to it while the indignant shepherds are searching the house until the sacred drama degenerated into a farce here and there however a true miracle survived and kept its character unspotted even to our own day as in the famous passion play at oberammergau  sidenote cycles of plays  when and how these plays came to england is unknown by the year 1300 they were extremely popular and continued so until they were replaced by the elizabethan drama most of the important towns of england had each its own cycle of plays footnote at present only four good cycles of miracles are known to exist namely the chester york townley or wakefield and coventry plays the number of plays varies from twentyfive in the chester to fortyeight in the york cycle which were given once a year the performance lasting from three to eight days in a prolonged festival every guild responsible for a play had its own stage which was set on wheels and drawn about the town to appointed open places where a crowd was waiting for it when it passed on to repeat the play to a different audience another stage took its place the play of creation would be succeeded by the temptation of adam and eve and so on until the whole cycle of miracles from creation to doomsday had been performed it was the play not the audience that moved and in this trundling about of the stage van we are reminded of thespis the alleged founder of greek tragedy who went about with his cart and his play from one festival to another  sidenote moralities  two other dramatic types the morality and the interlude probably grew out of the religious drama in one of the old miracles we find two characters named truth and righteousness who are severe in their denunciation of adam while mercy and peace plead for his life other virtues appear in other miracles then death and the seven deadly sins until we have a play in which all the characters are personified virtues or vices such a play was called a morality and it aimed to teach right conduct as the miracles had at first aimed to teach right doctrine  sidenote interludes  the interlude was at first a crude sketch a kind of ancient side show introduced into the miracle plays after the latter had been taken up by the guilds a boy with a trained pig a quarrel between husband and wifeany farce was welcome so long as it amused the crowd or enlivened the miracle in time however the writing of interludes became a profession they improved rapidly in character were separated from the miracles and were performed at entertainments or revels by trade guilds by choir boys and by companies of strolling actors or minstrels at the close of such entertainments the minstrels would add a prayer for the king an inheritance from the religious drama and this impressive english custom still survives in the singing of god save the king at the end of a public assembly  the secular drama when the normans came to england they brought with them a love of pageants or spectacles that was destined to have an important influence on the drama these pageants representing scenes from history or mythology such as the bout between richard and saladin or the combat between st george and the dragon were staged to celebrate feasts royal weddings treaties or any other event that seemed of special importance from norman times they increased steadily in favor until elizabeth began her progresses through england when every castle or town must prepare a play or pageant to entertain the royal visitor  sidenote the masque  from simple pantomime the pageant developed into a masque that is a dramatic entertainment accompanied by poetry and music hundreds of such masques were written and acted before shakespeares day the taste for them survived long after the elizabethan drama had decayed and a few of them such as the sad shepherd of ben jonson and the comus of milton may still be read with pleasure  sidenote popular comedy  while the nobles were thus occupied with pageants and masques the common people were developing a crude drama in which comedy predominated such were the christmas plays or mummings introducing the characters of merry andrew and old king cole which began in england before the conquest and which survived in country places down to our own times footnote in hardys novel the return of the native may be found a description of these mummings from mum a mask in the nineteenth century in scotts novel the abbot we have a glimpse of other mummings such as were given to celebrate feast days of the church more widespread than the mummings were crude spectacles prepared in celebration of secular holidaysthe may day plays for example which represented the adventures of robin hood and his merry men to these popular comedies the church contributed liberally though unwillingly its holy days became holidays to the crowd and its solemn fasts were given over to merriment to the festa fatuorum or play of fools in which such characters as boy bishop lord of misrule and various clowns or jesters made a scandalous caricature of things ecclesiastical such plays prepared largely by clerks and choir boys were repeatedly denounced by priest or bishop but they increased rapidly from the twelfth to the sixteenth century  sidenote spread of the drama  by the latter date england seemed in danger of going spectaclemad and we may understand the symptoms if we remember that the play was then almost the only form of popular amusement that it took the place of the modern newspaper novel political election and ball game all combined the trade guilds having trained actors for the springtime miracles continued to give other plays throughout the year the servants of a nobleman having given a pageant to welcome the queen went out through the country in search of money or adventure and presented the same spectacle wherever they could find an audience when the renaissance came reviving interest in the classics latin plays were taken up eagerly and presented in modified form by every important school or university in england in this way our first regular comedy ralph royster doyster written by nicholas udall master of eton and acted by his schoolboys cir 1552 was adapted from an old latin comedy the miles gloriosus of plautus  sidenote boy actors  the awakened interest in music had also its influences on the english drama the choir boys of a church were frequently called upon to furnish music at a play and from this it was but a step to furnish both the play and the music so great was the demand to hear these boys that certain choir masters those of st pauls and the chapel royal obtained the right to take any poor boy with a good voice and train him ostensibly for the service of the church but in reality to make a profitable actor out of him this dangerous practice was stimulated by the fact that the feminine parts in all plays had to be taken by boys the stage being then deemed an unfit place for a woman and it certainly was if a boy took to his lines his services were sold from one company to another much as the popular ball player is now sold but with this difference that the poor boy had no voice or profit in the transaction some of these lads were cruelly treated all were in danger of moral degradation the abuse was finally suppressed by parliament but not until the choirboy players were rivals of the regular companies in which shakespeare and ben jonson played their parts  classical and english drama at the time of shakespeares birth two types of plays were represented in england the classic drama modeled upon greek or roman plays was constructed according to the dramatic unities which aristotle foreshadowed in his treatise on poetry according to this authority every play must be concerned with a single important and complete event in other words it must have unity of action a second rule relating to unity of time required that the events represented in a play must all occur within a single day a third provided that the action should take place in the same locality and this was known as the unity of place footnote the roman philosopher and dramatist seneca d 65 ad is supposed to have established this rule the influence of aristotle on the unities is a matter of dispute other rules of classic drama required that tragedy and comedy should not occur in the same play and that battles murders and all such violent affairs should never be represented on the stage but be announced at the proper time by a messenger  sidenote the native drama  the native plays ignored these classic unities the public demanded chronicle plays for example in which the action must cover years of time and jump from court to battlefield in following the hero tragedy and comedy instead of being separated were represented as meeting at every crossroad or entering the church door side by side so the most solemn miracles were scandalized by humorous interludes and into the most tragic of shakespeares scenes entered the fool and the jester a greek playwright might object to brutalizing scenes before a cultured audience but the crowds who came to an elizabethan play were of a temper to enjoy a mohawk scalp dance they were accustomed to violent scenes and sensations they had witnessed the rack and gibbet in constant operation they were familiar with the sight of human heads decorating the posts of london bridge or carried about on the pikes of soldiers after witnessing such horrors free of cost they would follow their queen and pay their money to see a chained bear torn to pieces by ferocious bulldogs then they would go to a play and throw stones or dead cats at the actors if their tastes were not gratified  to please such crowds no stage action could possibly be too rough hence the riotousness of the early theaters which for safety were placed outside the city limits hence also the blood and thunder of shakespeares adronicus and the atrocities represented in the plays of kyd and marlowe  sidenote the two schools  following such different ideals two schools of playwrights appeared in england one school the university wits to whom we owe our first real tragedy gorboduc footnote this play called also ferrex and porrex was written by sackville and norton and played in 1562 only two years before shakespeares birth it related how gorboduc divided his british kingdom between his two sons who quarreled and threw the whole country into rebelliona story much like that used by shakespeare in king lear the violent parts of this first tragedy were not represented on the stage but were announced by a messenger at the end of each act a chorus summed up the situation as in classic tragedy gorboduc differed from all earlier plays in that it was divided into acts and scenes and was written in blank verse it is generally regarded as the first in time of the elizabethan dramas a few comedies divided into acts and scenes were written before gorboduc but not in the blank verse with which we associate an elizabethan play aimed to make the english drama like that of greece and rome the other or native school aimed at a play which should represent life or please the crowd without regard to any rules ancient or modern the best elizabethan drama was a combination of classic and native elements with the latter predominating  shakespeares predecessors in a general way all unknown men who for three centuries had been producing miracle plays moralities interludes masques and pageants were shakespeares predecessors but we refer here to a small group of playwrights who rapidly developed what is now called the elizabethan drama the time was the last quarter of the sixteenth century  by that time england was as excited over the stage as a modern community over the movies plays were given on every important occasion by choir boys by noblemens servants by court players governed by the master of revels by grammar schools and universities by trade guilds in every shire of england actors were everywhere in training and audiences gathered as to a bullbaiting whenever a new spectacle was presented then came the awakening of the national consciousness the sense of english pride and power after the defeat of the armada and this new national spirit found expression in hundreds of chronicle plays representing the past glories of britain footnote over two hundred chronicle plays representing almost every important character in english history appeared within a few years shakespeare wrote thirteen plays founded on english history and three on the history of other countries  it was at this psychological moment when english patriotism was aroused and london was as the heart of england that a group of young actorsgreene lyly peele dekker nash kyd marlowe and others of less degreeseized upon the crude popular drama enlarged it to meet the needs of the time and within a single generation made it such a brilliant reflection of national thought and feeling as no other age has thus far produced  marlowe the best of these early playwrights each of whom contributed some element of value was christopher marlowe 15641593 who is sometimes called the father of the elizabethan drama he appeared in london sometime before 1587 when his first drama tamburlaine took the city by storm the prologue of this drama is at once a criticism and a promise    from jigging veins of rhyming motherwits   and such conceits as clownage keeps in pay   well lead you to the stately tent of war   where you shall hear the scythian tamburlaine   threatening the world with highastounding terms   and scourging kingdoms with his conquering sword  the jigging refers to the doggerel verse of the earlier drama and clownage to the crude horseplay intended to amuse the crowd for the doggerel is substituted blank verse marlowes mighty line as it has ever since been called since he was the first to use it with power and for the clownage he promises a play of human interest revolving around a man whose sole ambition is for world powersuch ambition as stirred the english nation when it called halt to the encroachments of spain and announced that henceforth it must be reckoned with in the councils of the continent though tamburlaine is largely rant and bombast there is something in it which fascinates us like the sight of a wild bull on a rampage for such was timur the hero of the first play to which we confidently give the name elizabethan in the latter part of the play the action grows more intense there is a sense of tragedy of impending doom in the vain attempt of the hero to oppose fate he can conquer a world but not his own griefs he ends his triumphant career with a pathetic admission of failure and tamburlaine the scourge of god must die  sidenote marlowes dramas  the succeeding plays of marlowe are all built on the same model that is they are oneman plays and the man is dominated by a passion for power doctor faustus the most poetical of marlowes works is a play representing a scholar who hungers for more knowledge especially the knowledge of magic in order to obtain it he makes a bargain with the devil selling his soul for twentyfour years of unlimited power and pleasure footnote the story is the same as that of goethes faust it was a favorite story or rather collection of stories of the middle ages and was first printed as the history of johann faust in frankfort in 1587 marlowes play was written probably in the same year the jew of malta deals with the lust for such power as wealth gives and the hero is the moneylender barabas a monster of avarice and hate who probably suggested to shakespeare the character of shylock in the merchant of venice the last play written by marlowe was edward ii which dealt with a man who might have been powerful since he was a king but who furnished a terrible example of weakness and petty tyranny that ended miserably in a dungeon  after writing these four plays with their extraordinary promise marlowe who led a wretched life was stabbed in a tavern brawl the splendid work which he only began for he died under thirty years of age was immediately taken up by the greatest of all dramatists shakespeare                                       william shakespeare 15641616      the name of shakespeare is the greatest in all literature no man     ever came near to him in the creative power of the mind no man     ever had such strength and such variety of imagination hallam      shakespeares mind is the horizon beyond which at present we do     not see emerson      i do not believe that any book or person or event in my life ever     made so great an impression on me as the plays of shakespeare they     appear to be the work of some heavenly genius goethe  shakespeares name has become a signal for enthusiasm the tributes quoted above are doubtless extravagant but they were written by men of mark in three different countries and they serve to indicate the tremendous impression which shakespeare has left upon the world he wrote in his day some thirtyseven plays and a few poems since then as many hundred volumes have been written in praise of his accomplishment he died three centuries ago without caring enough for his own work to print it at the present time unnumbered critics historians scholars are still explaining the mind and the art displayed in that same neglected work most of these eulogists begin or end their volumes with the remark that shakespeare is so great as to be above praise or criticism as taine writes before plunging into his own analysis lofty words eulogies are all used in vain shakespeare needs not praise but comprehension merely      life it is probably because so very little is known about     shakespeare that so many bulky biographies have been written of     him not a solitary letter of his is known to exist not a play     comes down to us as he wrote it a few documents written by other     men and sometimes ending in a sprawling signature by shakespeare     which looks as if made by a hand accustomed to almost any labor     except that of the penthese are all we have to build upon one     record in dribbling latin relates to the christening of     gulielmus filius johannes shakspere a second unreliable as a     village gossip tells an anecdote of the same persons boyhood a     third refers to shakespeare as one of his majestys poor players     a fourth records the burial of the poets son hamnet a fifth     speaks of willi shakspere gentleman a sixth is a bit of     wretched doggerel inscribed on the poets tombstone a seventh     tells us that in 1622 only six years after the poets death the     public had so little regard for his art that the council of his     native stratford bribed his old company of players to go away from     the town without giving a performance      it is from such dry and doubtful records that we must construct a     biography supplementing the meager facts by liberal use of our     imagination      sidenote early days      in the beautiful warwickshire village of stratford our poet was     born probably in the month of april in 1564 his mother mary     arden was a farmers daughter his father was a butcher and small     tradesman who at one time held the office of high bailiff of the     village there was a small grammar school in stratford and     shakespeare may have attended it for a few years when he was about     fourteen years old his father who was often in lawsuits was     imprisoned for debt and the boy probably left school and went to     work at eighteen he married anne hathaway a peasants daughter     eight years older than himself at twentythree with his father     still in debt and his own family of three children to provide for     shakespeare took the footpath that led to the world beyond his     native village footnote such is the prevalent opinion of     shakespeares early days but we are dealing here with surmises     not with established facts there are scholars who allege that     shakespeares poverty is a myth that his father was prosperous to     the end of his days that he probably took the full course in latin     and greek at the stratford school almost everything connected with     the poets youth is still a matter of dispute      sidenote in london      from stratford he went to london from solitude to crowds from     beautiful rural scenes to dirty streets from natural country     people to seekers after the bubble of fame or fortune why he went     is largely a matter of speculation that he was looking for work     that he followed a company of actors as a boy follows a circus     that he was driven out of stratford after poaching on the game     preserves of sir thomas lucy whom he ridiculed in the plays of     henry vi and merry wivesthese and other theories     are still debated the most probable explanation of his departure     is that the stage lured him away as the printing press called the     young franklin from whatever else he undertook for he seems to     have headed straight for the theater and to have found his place     not by chance or calculation but by unerring instinct england was     then as we have noted in danger of going stage mad and     shakespeare appeared to put method into the madness      sidenote actor and playwright      beginning undoubtedly as an actor of small parts he soon learned     the tricks of the stage and the humors of his audience his first     dramatic work was to revise old plays giving them some new twist     or setting to please the fickle public then he worked with other     playwrights with lyly and peele perhaps and the horrors of his     titus andronicus are sufficient evidence of his     collaboration with marlowe finally he walked alone having learned     his steps and romeo and juliet and midsummer nights     dream announced that a great poet and dramatist had suddenly     appeared in england      illustration the library stratford grammar school attended by     shakespeare      sidenote period of gloom      this experimental period of shakespeares life in london was     apparently a time of health of joyousness of enthusiasm which     comes with the successful use of ones powers it was followed by a     period of gloom and sorrow to which something of bitterness was     added what occasioned the change is again a matter of speculation     the first conjecture is that shakespeare was a man to whom the low     ideals of the elizabethan stage were intolerable and this opinion     is strengthened after reading certain of shakespeares sonnets     which reflect a loathing for the theaters and the mannerless crowds     that filled them another conjectural cause of his gloom was the     fate of certain noblemen with whom he was apparently on terms of     friendship to whom he dedicated his poems and from whom he     received substantial gifts of money of these powerful friends the     earl of essex was beheaded for treason pembroke was banished and     southampton had gone to that grave of so many high hopes the tower     of london shakespeare may have shared the sorrow of these men as     once he had shared their joy and there are critics who assume that     he was personally implicated in the crazy attempt of essex at     rebellion      whatever the cause of his grief shakespeare shows in his works     that he no longer looks on the world with the clear eyes of youth     the great tragedies of this period lear macbeth     hamlet othello and cæsar all portray man not     as a being of purpose and high destiny but as the sport of chance     the helpless victim who cries out as in henry iv for a     sight of the book of fate wherein is shown                             how chances mock       and changes fill the cup of alteration       with divers liquors o if this were seen       the happiest youth viewing his progress through       what perils past what crosses to ensue       would shut the book and sit him down and die      sidenote return to stratford      for such a terrible mood london offered no remedy for a time     shakespeare seems to have gloried in the city then he wearied of     it grew disgusted with the stage and finally after some     twentyfour years cir 15871611 sold his interest in the     theaters shook the dust of london from his feet and followed his     heart back to stratford there he adopted the ways of a country     gentleman and there peace and serenity returned to him he wrote     comparatively little after his retirement but the few plays of     this last period such as cymbeline winters tale     and the tempest are the mellowest of all his works      sidenote shakespeare the man      after a brief period of leisure shakespeare died at his prime in     1616 and was buried in the parish church of stratford of his     great works now the admiration of the world he thought so little     that he never collected or printed them from these works many     attempts are made to determine the poets character beliefs     philosophya difficult matter since the works portray many types     of character and philosophy equally well the testimony of a few     contemporaries is more to the point and from these we hear that     our poet was very good company of such civil demeanor of     such happy industry of such excellent fancy and brave notions     that he won in a somewhat brutal age the characteristic title of     the gentle shakespeare  the dramas of shakespeare in shakespeares day playwrights were producing various types of drama the chronicle play representing the glories of english history the domestic drama portraying homely scenes and common people the court comedy called also lylian comedy after the dramatist who developed it abounding in wit and repartee for the delight of the upper classes the melodrama made up of sensational elements thrown together without much plot the tragedy of blood centering in one character who struggles amidst woes and horrors romantic comedy and romantic tragedy in which men and women were more or less idealized and in which the elements of love poetry romance youthful imagination and enthusiasm predominated  illustration anne hathaways cottage  it is interesting to note that shakespeare essayed all these typesthe chronicle play in henry iv the domestic drama in merry wives the court comedy in loves labors lost the melodrama in richard iii the tragedy of blood in king lear romantic tragedy in romeo and juliet romantic comedy in as you like itand that in each he showed such a mastery as to raise him far above all his contemporaries  sidenote early dramas  in his experimental period of work cir 15901595 shakespeare began by revising old plays in conjunction with other actors henry vi is supposed to be an example of such tinkering work the first part of this play performed by shakespeares company in 1592 was in all probability an older work made over by shakespeare and some unknown dramatist from the fact that joan of arc appears in the play in two entirely different characters and is even made to do battle at rouen several years after her death it is almost certain that henry vi in its present form was composed at different times and by different authors  illustration the main room anne hathaways cottage  loves labors lost is an example of the poets first independent work in this play such characters as holofernes the schoolmaster costard the clown and adriano the fantastic spaniard are all plainly of the stock variety various rimes and meters are used experimentally blank verse is not mastered and some of the songs such as on a day are more or less artificial other plays of this early experimental period are two gentlemen of verona and richard iii the latter of which shows the influence and possibly the collaboration of marlowe  sidenote second period  in the second period cir 15951600 shakespeare constructed his plots with better skill showed a greater mastery of blank verse created some original characters and especially did he give free rein to his romantic imagination all doubt and experiment vanished in the confident enthusiasm of this period as if shakespeare felt within himself the coming of the sunrise in romeo and juliet    nights candles are burnt out and jocund day   stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops  though some of his later plays are more carefully finished in none of them are we so completely under the sway of poetry and romance as in these early works written when shakespeare first felt the thrill of mastery in his art  in midsummer nights dream for example the practical affairs of life seem to smother its poetic dreams but note how the dream abides with us after the play is over the spell of the enchanted forest is broken when the crowd invades its solitude the witchery of moonlight fades into the light of common day and then comes theseus with his dogs to drive not the foxes but the fairies out of the landscape as chesterton points out this masterful man who has seen no fairies proceeds to arrange matters in a practical way with a wedding a feast and a pantomime as if these were the chief things of life so he thinks the drama is ended but after he and his noisy followers have departed to slumber lo enter once more puck oberon titania and the whole train of fairies to repeople the ancient world and dance to the music of mendelssohn    hand in hand with fairy grace   while we sing and bless this place  so in the merchant of venice with its tragic figure of shylock who is hurried off the stage to make place for a final scene of love moonlight and music so in every other play of this period the poetic dream of life triumphs over its practical realities  sidenote third period  during the third period of maturity of power cir 16001610 shakespeare was overshadowed by some personal grief or disappointment he wrote his farewell to mirth in twelfth night and seems to have reflected his own perturbed state in the lines which he attributes to achilles in troilus and cressida    my mind is troubled like a fountain stirrd   and i myself see not the bottom of it  his great tragedies belong to this period tragedies which reveal increased dramatic power in shakespeare but also his loss of hope his horrible conviction that man is not a free being but a puppet blown about by every wind of fate or circumstance in hamlet great purposes wait upon a feeble will and the strongest purpose may be either wrecked or consummated by a trifle the whole conception of humanity in this play suggests a clock of which if but one small wheel is touched all the rest are thrown into confusion in macbeth a man of courage and vaulting ambition turns coward or traitor at the appearance of a ghost at the gibber of witches at the whisper of conscience at the taunts of his wife in king lear a monarch of high disposition drags himself and others down to destruction not at the stern command of fate but at the mere suggestion of foolishness in othello love faith duty the fidelity of a brave man the loyalty of a pure womanall are blasted wrecked dishonored by a mere breath of suspicion blown by a villain  sidenote last dramas  in his final period of leisurely experiment cir 16101616 shakespeare seems to have recovered in stratford the cheerfulness that he had lost in london he did little work during this period but that little is of rare charm and sweetness he no longer portrayed human life as a comedy of errors or a tragedy of weakness but as a glowing romance as if the mellow autumn of his own life had tinged all the world with its own golden hues with the exception of as you like it written in the second period in which brotherhood is pictured as the end of life and love as its unfailing guide it is doubtful if any of the earlier plays leaves such a wholesome impression as the winters tale or the tempest which were probably the last of the poets works  following is a list of shakespeares thirtyfour plays or thirtyseven counting the different parts of henry iv and henry vi arranged according to the periods in which they were probably written the dates are approximate not exact and the chronological order is open to question  first period early experiment 15901595 titus andronicus henry vi loves labors lost comedy of errors two gentlemen of verona richard iii richard ii king john  second period development 15951600 romeo and juliet midsummer nights dream merchant of venice henry iv henry v merry wives of windsor much ado about nothing as you like it  third period

timon of athens  fourth period later experiment 16101616 coriolanus pericles cymbeline the winters tale the tempest henry viii left unfinished completed probably by fletcher  sidenote tragedy and comedy  the most convenient arrangement of these plays appears in the first folio 1623 footnote this was the first edition of shakespeares plays it was prepared seven years after the poets death by two of his fellow actors heminge and condell it contained all the plays now attributed to shakespeare with the exception of pericles where they are grouped in three classes called tragedies comedies and historical plays the tragedy is a drama in which the characters are the victims of unhappy passions or are involved in desperate circumstances the style is grave and dignified the movement stately the ending is disastrous to individuals but illustrates the triumph of a moral principle these rules of true tragedy are repeatedly set aside by shakespeare who introduces elements of buffoonery and who contrives an ending that may stand for the triumph of a principle but that is quite likely to be the result of accident or madness his best tragedies are macbeth romeo and juliet hamlet king lear and othello  comedy is a type of drama in which the elements of fun and humor predominate the style is gay the action abounds in unexpected incidents the ending brings ridicule or punishment to the villains in the plot and satisfaction to all worthy characters among the best of shakespeares comedies in which he is apt to introduce serious or tragic elements are as you like it merchant of venice midsummer nights dream the winters tale and the tempest  illustration cawdor castle scotland associated with macbeth  strictly speaking there are only two dramatic types all others such as farce melodrama tragicomedy lyric drama or opera and chronicle play being modifications of comedy or tragedy the historical play to which elizabethans were devoted aimed to present great scenes or characters from a past age and were generally made up of both tragic and comic elements the best of shakespeares historical plays are julius cæsar henry iv henry v richard iii and coriolanus  sidenote what to read  there is no better way to feel the power of shakespeare than to read in succession three different types of plays such as the comedy of as you like it the tragedy of macbeth and the historical play of julius cæsar another excellent trio is the merchant of venice romeo and juliet and henry iv and the reading of these typical plays might well be concluded with the tempest which was probably shakespeares last word to his elizabethan audience  the quality of shakespeare as the thousand details of a gothic cathedral receive character and meaning from its towering spire so all the works of shakespeare are dominated by his imagination that imagination of his was both sympathetic and creative it was sympathetic in that it understood without conscious effort all kinds of men from clowns to kings and all human emotions that lie between the extremes of joy and sorrow it was creative in that from any given emotion or motive it could form a human character who should be completely governed by that motive ambition in macbeth pride in coriolanus wit in mercutio broad humor in falstaff indecision in hamlet pure fancy in ariel brutality in richard a passionate love in juliet a merry love in rosalind an ideal love in perditasuch characters reveal shakespeares power to create living men and women from a single motive or emotion  or take a single play othello and disregarding all minor characters fix attention on the pure devotion of desdemona the jealousy of othello the villainy of iago the genius that in a single hour can make us understand these contrasting characters as if we had met them in the flesh and make our hearts ache as we enter into their joy their anguish their dishonor is beyond all ordinary standards of measurement and othello must be multiplied many times before we reach the limit of shakespeares creative imagination he is like the genii of the arabian nights who produce new marvels while we wonder at the old  such an overpowering imagination must have created wildly fancifully had it not been guided by other qualities by an observation almost as keen as that of chaucer and by the saving grace of humor we need only mention the latter qualities for if the reader will examine any great play of shakespeare he will surely find them in evidence the observation keeping the characters of the poets imagination true to the world of men and women and the humor preventing some scene of terror or despair from overwhelming us by its terrible reality  sidenote his faults  in view of these and other qualities it has become almost a fashion to speak of the perfection of shakespeares art but in truth no word could be more out of place in such a connection as ben jonson wrote in his timber      i remember the players have often mentioned it as an honor to     shakespeare that in his writing whatever he penned he never     blotted out a line my answer hath been would he had blotted a     thousand  even in his best work shakespeare has more faults than any other poet of england he is in turn careless extravagant profuse tedious sensational his wit grows stale or coarse his patriotism turns to bombast he mars even such pathetic scenes as the burial of ophelia by buffoonery and brawling and all to please a public that was given to bullbaiting  these certainly are imperfections yet the astonishing thing is that they pass almost unnoticed in shakespeare he reflected his age the evil and the good of it just as it appeared to him and the splendor of his representation is such that even his faults have their proper place like shadows in a sunlit landscape  sidenote his view of life  of shakespeares philosophy we may say that it reflected equally well the views of his hearers and of the hundred characters whom he created for their pleasure of his personal views it is impossible to say more than this with truth that he seems to have been in full sympathy with the older writers whose stories he used as the sources of his drama footnote the chief sources of shakespeares plays are 1 older plays from which he made half of his dramas such as richard iii hamlet king john 2 holinsheds chronicles from which he obtained material for his english historical plays 3 plutarchs lives translated by north which furnished him material for caesar coriolanus antony and cleopatra 4 french italian and spanish romances in translations from which he obtained the stories of the merchant of venice othello twelfth night and as you like it now these stories commonly reflected three things besides the main narrative a problem its solution and the consequent moral or lesson the problem was a form of evil its solution depended on goodness in some form the moral was that goodness triumphs finally and inevitably over evil  many such stories were cherished by the elizabethans the old tale of gammelyn for example from which came as you like it and just as in our own day popular novels are dramatized so three centuries ago audiences demanded to see familiar stories in vigorous action that is why shakespeare held to the old tales and pleased his audience instead of inventing new plots but however much he changed the characters or the action of the story he remained always true to the old moral    that goodness is the rule of life   and its glory and its triumph  shakespeares women are his finest characters and he often portrays the love of a noble woman as triumphing over the sin or weakness of men he has little regard for abnormal or degenerate types such as appear in the later elizabethan drama he prefers vigorous men and pure women precisely as the old storytellers did and if richard or some other villain overruns his stage for an hour such men are finally overwhelmed by the very evil which they had planned for others if they drag the innocent down to a common destruction these pure characters never seem to us to perish they live forever in our thought as the true emblems of humanity  sidenote moral emphasis  it was charles lamb who referred to a copy of shakespeares plays as this manly book the expression is a good one and epitomizes the judgment of a world which has found that though shakespeare introduces evil or vulgar elements into his plays his emphasis is always upon the right man and the right action this may seem a trite thing to say in praise of a great genius but when you reflect that shakespeare is read throughout the civilized world the simple fact that the splendor of his poetry is balanced by the rightness of his message becomes significant and impressive it speaks not only for shakespeare but for the moral quality of the multitudes who acknowledge his mastery wherever his plays are read on land or sea in the crowded cities of men or the far silent places of the earth there the solitary man finds himself face to face with the unchanging ideals of his race with honor duty courtesy and the moral imperative    this above all to thine own self be true   and it must follow as the night the day   thou canst not then be false to any man                                       the elizabethan drama after shakespeare  the drama began to decline during shakespeares lifetime even before his retirement to stratford other popular dramatists appeared who catered to a vulgar taste by introducing more sensational elements into the stage spectacle in consequence the drama degenerated so rapidly that in 1642 only twentysix years after the master dramatist had passed away parliament closed the theaters as evil and degrading places this closing is charged to the zeal of the puritans who were rapidly rising into power and the charge is probably well founded so also was the puritan zeal one who was compelled to read the plays of the period to say nothing of witnessing them must thank these stern old roundheads for their insistence on public decency and morality in the drama of all ages there seems to be a terrible fatality which turns the stage first to levity then to wickedness and which sooner or later calls for reformation  illustration francis beaumont  among those who played their parts in the rise and fall of the drama the chief names are jonson beaumont fletcher middleton webster heywood dekker massinger ford and shirley concerning the work of these dramatists there is wide diversity of opinion lamb regards them beaumont and fletcher especially as an inferior sort of sidneys and shakespeares landor writes of them poetically                                they stood around   the throne of shakespeare sturdy but unclean  lowell finds some small things to praise in a large collection of their plays hazlitt regards them as a race of giants a common and noble brood of whom shakespeare was simply the tallest dyce who had an extraordinary knowledge of all these dramatists regards such praise as absurd saying that shakespeare is not only immeasurably superior to the dramatists of his time but is utterly unlike them in almost every respect  illustration john fletcher from the engraving by philip oudinet published 1811  we shall not attempt to decide where such doctors disagree it may not be amiss however to record this personal opinion that these playwrights added little to the drama and still less to literature and that it is hardly worth while to search out their good passages amid a welter of repulsive details if they are to be read at all the student will find enough of their work for comparison with the shakespearean drama in a book of selections such as lambs specimens of english dramatic poetry or thayers the best elizabethan plays  ben jonson 15731637 the greatest figure among these dramatists was jonsono rare ben jonson as his epitaph describes him o rough ben jonson as he was known to the playwrights with whom he waged literary warfare his first notable play every man in his humour satirizing the fads or humors of london was acted by shakespeares company and shakespeare played one of the parts then jonson fell out with his fellow actors and wrote the poetaster acted by a rival company to ridicule them and their work shakespeare was silent but the cudgels were taken up by marston and dekker the latter of whom wrote among other and better plays satiromastix which was played by shakespeares company as a counter attack on jonson  illustration ben jonson  the value of jonsons plays is that they give us vivid pictures of elizabethan society its speech fashions amusements such as no other dramatist has drawn shakespeare pictures men and women as they might be in any age but jonson is content to picture the men and women of london as they appeared superficially in the year 1600 his chief comedies which satirize the shams of his age are volpone or the fox a merciless exposure of greed and avarice the alchemist a study of quackery as it was practiced in elizabethan days bartholomew fair a riot of folly and epicoene or the silent woman which would now be called a roaring farce his chief tragedies are sejanus and catiline  in later life jonson was appointed poet laureate and wrote many masques such as the masque of beauty and the unfinished sad shepherd these and a few lyrics such as the triumph of charis and the song beginning drink to me only with thine eyes are the pleasantest of jonsons works at the end he abandoned the drama as shakespeare had done and lashed it as severely as any puritan in the ode beginning come leave the loathëd stage                                       the prose writers  unless one have antiquarian tastes there is little in elizabethan prose to reward the reader strange to say the most tedious part of it was written by literary men in what was supposed to be a very fine style while the small part that still attracts us such as bacons essays or hakluyts voyages was mostly written by practical men with no thought for literary effect  this curious result came about in the following way in the sixteenth century poetry was old but english prose was new for in the two centuries that had elapsed since mandeville wrote his travels malorys morte d arthur 1475 and aschams scholemaster 1563 are about the only two books that can be said to have a prose style then just as the elizabethans were turning to literature john lyly appeared with his euphues or the anatomy of wit 1578 an alleged novel made up of rambling conversations upon love education fashioneverything that came into the authors head the style was involved artificial tortured it was loaded with conceits antitheses and decorations      i perceive camilla that be your cloth never so bad it will take     some colour and your cause never so false it will bear some show     of probability wherein you manifest the right nature of a woman     who having no way to win thinketh to overcome with words take     heed camilla that seeking all the wood for a straight stick you     choose not at the last a crooked staff or prescribing a good     counsel to others thou thyself follow the worst much like to chius     who selling the best wine to others drank himself of the lees  sidenote the fad of euphuism  this high fantastical style ever since called euphuistic created a sensation the age was given over to extravagance and the artificial elegance of euphues seemed to match the other fashions just as elizabethan men and women began to wear grotesque ruffs about their necks as soon as they learned the art of starching from the dutch so now they began to decorate their writing with the conceits of lyly footnote lyly did not invent the fashion he carried to an extreme a tendency towards artificial writing which was prevalent in england and on the continent as is often the case it was the extreme of fashion that became fashionable only a year after euphues appeared spenser published the shepherds calendar and his prose notes show how quickly the style like a bad habit had taken possession of the literary world shakespeare ridicules the fashion in the character of holofernes in loves labors lost yet he follows it as slavishly as the rest he could write good prose when he would as is shown by a part of hamlets speech but as a rule he makes his characters speak as if the art of prose were like walking a tight rope which must be done with a balancing pole and some contortions the scholars who produced the translation of the scriptures known as the authorized version could certainly write well yet if you examine their dedication in which uninfluenced by the noble sincerity of the bibles style they were free to follow the fashion you may find there the two faults of elizabethan prose namely the habit of servile flattery and the sham of euphuism  among prose writers of the period the name that appears most frequently is that of philip sidney 15541586 he wrote one of our first critical essays an apologie for poetrie cir 1581 the spirit of which may be judged from the following      nowe therein of all sciences  is our poet the monarch for he     dooth not only show the way but giveth so sweete a prospect into     the way as will intice any man to enter into it nay he dooth as     if your journey should be through a faire vineyard at the first     give you a  cluster of grapes that full of that taste you may     long to passe further he beginneth not with obscure definitions     which must blur the margent with interpretations and load the     memory with doubtfulnesse but hee cometh to you with words set in     delightfull proportion either accompanied with or prepared for the     well enchaunting skill of musicke and with a tale forsooth he     cometh unto youwith a tale which holdeth children from play and     old men from the chimney corner  illustration sir philip sidney  sidney wrote also the pastoral romance arcadia which was famous in its day and in which the curious reader may find an occasional good passage such as the prayer to a heathen god o allseeing lighta prayer that became historic and deeply pathetic when king charles repeated it facing death on the scaffold that was in 1649 more than half a century after arcadia was written      o allseeing light and eternal life of all things to whom     nothing is either so great that it may resist or so small that it     is contemned look upon my miserie with thine eye of mercie and     let thine infinite power vouchsafe to limite out some proportion of     deliverance unto me as to thee shall seem most convenient let not     injurie o lord triumphe over me and let my faults by thy hands     be corrected and make not mine unjuste enemie the minister of thy     justice but yet my god if in thy wisdome this be the aptest     chastisement for my inexcusable follie if this low bondage be     fittest for my overhie desires if the pride of my notinough     humble hearte be thus to be broken o lord i yeeld unto thy will     and joyfully embrace what sorrow thou wilt have me suffer  sidenote the king james bible  the finest example of the prose of the period is the king james or authorized version of the bible which appeared in 1611 this translation was so much influenced by the earlier work of wyclif tyndale and many others that its style cannot properly be called elizabethan or jacobean it is rather an epitome of english at its best in the two centuries between chaucer and shakespeare the fortyseven scholars who prepared this translation aimed at a faithful rendering of the book which aside from its spiritual teaching contains some of the noblest examples of style in the whole range of human literature the elemental simplicity of the books of moses the glowing poetry of job and the psalms the sublime imagery of isaiah the exquisite tenderness of the parables the forged and tempered argument of the epistles the gorgeous coloring of the apocalypse all these elements entered in some degree into the translation of 1611 and the result was a work of such beauty strength and simplicity that it remained a standard of english prose for more than three centuries it has not only been a model for our best writers it has pervaded all the minor literature of the nation and profoundly influenced the thought and the expression of the whole englishspeaking world                                       francis bacon 15611626  my name and memory i leave to foreign nations and to mine own country after some time is passed over said bacon in his will that reference to the future meant not that england might learn to forget and forgive for bacon was not greatly troubled by his disgrace but that she might learn to appreciate his instauratio magna in the same document the philosopher left magnificent bequests for various purposes but when these were claimed by the beneficiaries it was learned that the debts of the estate were three times the assets this highsounding will is an epitome of bacons life and work      life bacon belongs with sidney and raleigh in that group of     elizabethans who aimed to be men of affairs politicians     reformers explorers rather than writers of prose or poetry he     was of noble birth and from an early age was attached to     elizabeths court there he expected rapid advancement but the     queen and his uncle lord burghley were both a little suspicious     of the young man who as he said had taken all knowledge for his     province      failing to advance by favor bacon studied law and entered     parliament where he rose rapidly to leadership ben jonson writes     of him in that not very reliable collection of opinions called     timber          there happened in my time one noble speaker who was full         of gravity in his speaking no man ever spake more         neatly more pressly more weightily or suffered less         emptiness less idleness in what he uttered the fear         of every man that heard him was lest he should make an         end      illustration francis bacon      sidenote his triumph      when elizabeth died bacon saw his way open he offered his     services to the royal favorite buckingham and was soon in the     good graces of king james he was made baron verulam and viscount     st albans he married a rich wife he rose rapidly from one     political honor to another until at sixty he was lord high     chancellor of england so his threefold ambition for position     wealth and power was realized it was while he held the highest     state office that he published his novum organum which     established his reputation as the first philosopher in europe     that was in 1620 the year when a handful of pilgrims sailed away     unnoticed on one of the worlds momentous voyages      sidenote his disgrace      after four years of power bacon who had been engaged with     buckingham in selling monopolies and in other schemes to be rich     at the public expense was brought to task by parliament he was     accused of receiving bribes confessed his guilt it is said to     shield the king and buckingham who had shared the booty was     fined imprisoned banished from court and forbidden to hold     public office again all these punishments except the last were     remitted by king james to whom bacon had been a useful tool his     last few years were spent in scientific study at gorhambury where     he lived proudly keeping up the appearance of his former grandeur     until his death in 1626      such a sketch seems a cold thing but there is little of divine     fire or human warmth in bacon to kindle ones enthusiasm his     obituary might well be the final word of his essay of wisdom for a     mans self          whereas they have all their time sacrificed to themselves         they become in the end sacrifices to the inconstancy of         fortune whose wings they thought by their selfwisdom to         have pinioned      ben jonson had a different and possibly a more just opinion in     the work from which we have quoted he says          my conceit of his person was never increased towards him         by his place or honours but i have and do reverence him         for his greatness that was only proper to himself in that         he seemed to me ever by his work one of the greatest men         and most worthy of admiration that had been in many ages         in his adversity i ever prayed that god would give him         strength for greatness he could not want  works of bacon the essays of bacon are so highly esteemed that the critic hallam declares it would be derogatory to a man of the slightest claim to polite letters to be unacquainted with them his first venture was a tiny volume called essays religious meditations places of persuasion and dissuasion 1597 this was modeled upon a french work by montaigne essais 1580 and was considered of small consequence by the author as time went on and his ambitious works were overlooked in favor of his sketches he paid more attention to the latter revising and enlarging his work until the final edition of fiftyeight essays appeared in 1625 then it was that bacon wrote i do now publish my essays which of all my works have been most current for that as it seems they come home to mens business and bosoms  sidenote quality of the essays  the spirit of these works may be judged by the essay of friendship this promises well for near the beginning we read a crowd is not company and faces are but a gallery of pictures and talking is but a tinkling cymbal where there is no love excellent as we read on however we find nothing of the love that beareth all things for a friends sake we are not even encouraged to be friendly but rather to cultivate the friendship of other men for the following advantages that a friend is useful in saving us from solitude that he may increase our joy or diminish our trouble that he gives us good counsel that he can finish our work or take care of our children if need be and finally that he can spare our modesty while trumpeting our virtues      how many things are there which a man cannot with any face or     comeliness say or do himself a man can scarce allege his own     merits with modesty much less extol them a man cannot sometimes     brook to supplicate or beg and a number of the like but all these     things are graceful in a friends mouth which are blushing in a     mans own  in old arabic manuscripts one frequently finds a record having the appearance of truth but at the very end in parenthesis one reads this is all a lie or this was my thought when i was sick or some other enlightening climax bacons essay of friendship might be more in accord with the verities if it had a final note to the effect that the man who cultivates friendship in the baconian way will never have or deserve a friend in the world  so with many other baconian essays with love for example in which we are told that it is impossible for a man to love and be wise or with negotiations which informs us that unless a man intends to use his letter to justify himself lo the politician it is better to deal by speech than by writing for a man can disavow or expound his speech but his written word may be used against him  sidenote bacons view of life  to some men to most men life offers a problem to be solved by standards that are eternally right to others life is a game the object is to win and the rules may be manipulated to ones own advantage bacons moral philosophy was that of the gamester his leading motive was selfinterest so when he wrote of love or friendship or any other noble sentiment he was dealing with matters of which he had no knowledge the best he could offer was a counsel of prudence and many will sympathize with john wesley who declared that worldly prudence is a quality from which an honest man should pray god to be delivered  sidenote what to read  it is only when bacon deals with practical matters leaving the high places of life where he is a stranger to write of discourse or gardens or seeming wise that his essays begin to strike home by their vigor and vitality though seldom profound or sympathetic they are notable for their keen observation and shrewd judgment of the ambitious world in which the author himself lived among those that are best worth reading are studies wisdom for a mans self riches great place atheism and travel  the style of these essays is in refreshing contrast to most elizabethan prose to the sonorous periods of hooker to the ramblings of sidney to the conceits of lyly and shakespeare the sentences are mostly short clear simple and so much meaning is crystallized in them that they overshadow even the poor richard maxims of franklin the man who had a genius for packing worldly wisdom into a convenient nutshell  sidenote ambitious works  other works of bacon are seldom read and may be passed over lightly we mention only as indicative of his wide range his history of henry vii his utopian romance the new atlantis his advancement of learning and his novum organum the last two works one in english the other in latin were parts of the instauratio magna or the great institution of true philosophy a colossal work which bacon did not finish which he never even outlined very clearly  the aim of the instauratio was first to sweep away ancient philosophy and the classic education of the universities and second to substitute a scheme of scientific study to the end of discovering and utilizing the powers of nature it gave bacon his reputation in germany especially of a great philosopher and scientist and it is true that his vision of vast discoveries has influenced the thought of the world but to read any part of his great work is to meet a mind that seems ingenious rather than philosophical and fanciful rather than scientific he had what his learned contemporary peter heylyn termed a chymical brain a brain that was forever busy with new theories and the leading theory was that some lucky man would discover a key or philosophers stone or magic sesame that must straightway unlock all the secrets of nature  meanwhile the real scientists of his age were discovering secrets in the only sure way of hard selfdenying work gilbert was studying magnetism harvey discovering the circulation of the blood kepler determining the laws that govern the planets motions napier inventing logarithms and galileo standing in ecstasy beneath the first telescope ever pointed at the stars of heaven  sidenote his vast plans  of the work of these scientific heroes bacon had little knowledge and for their plodding methods he had no sympathy he was viscount lord chancellor highbrowed verulam and his heavenscaling instauratio which as he said was for the glory of the creator and for the relief of mans estate must have something stupendous elizabethan about it like the victory over the armada in his plans there was always an impression of vastness his miscellaneous works were like the strange maps that geographers made when the wonders of a new world opened upon their vision though he never made an important discovery his conviction that knowledge is power and that there are no metes or bounds to knowledge his belief that the mighty forces of nature are waiting to do mans bidding his thought of ships that navigate the air as easily as the seaall this baconian dream of mental empire inspired the scientific world for three centuries it was as thoroughly elizabethan in its way as the voyage of drake or the plays of shakespeare                                           summary the most remarkable feature of the elizabethan age was its     patriotic enthusiasm this enthusiasm found its best expression on     the stage in the portrayal of life in vigorous action and dramas     were produced in such number and of such quality that the whole     period is sometimes called the age of the play it was a time of     poetry rather than of prose and nearly all of the poetry is     characterized by its emotional quality by youthful freshness of     feeling by quickened imagination and by an extravagance of     language which overflows even in shakespeare in a kind of     glorious bombast      our study of the literature of the age includes 1 the outburst     of lyric poetry 2 the life and works of spenser second in time     of the great english poets 3 a review of the long history of the     drama from the

on milton       historical outline the period from the accession of charles i in     1625 to the revolution of 1688 was filled with a mighty struggle     over the question whether king or commons should be supreme in     england on this question the english people were divided into two     main parties on one side were the royalists or cavaliers who     upheld the monarch with his theory of the divine right of kings on     the other were the puritans or independents who stood for the     rights of the individual man and for the liberties of parliament     and people the latter party was at first very small it had     appeared in the days of langland and wyclif and had been     persecuted by elizabeth but persecution served only to increase     its numbers and determination though the puritans were never a     majority in england they soon ruled the land with a firmness it     had not known since the days of william the conqueror they were     primarily men of conscience and no institution can stand before     strong men whose conscience says the institution is wrong that is     why the degenerate theaters were not reformed but abolished that     is why the theory of the divine right of kings was shattered as by     a thunderbolt when king charles was sent to the block for treason     against his country      the struggle reached a climax in the civil war of 1642 which ended     in a puritan victory as a result of that war england was for a     brief period a commonwealth disciplined at home and respected     abroad through the genius and vigor and tyranny of oliver     cromwell when cromwell died 1658 there was no man in england     strong enough to take his place and two years later prince     charlie who had long been an exile was recalled to the throne as     charles ii of england he had learned nothing from his fathers     fate or his own experience and proceeded by all evil ways to     warrant this epitaph which his favorite wilmot earl of     rochester pinned on the door of his bedchamber        here lies our sovereign lord the king         whose word no man relies on       who never said a foolish thing         nor ever did a wise one      the next twenty years are of such disgrace and national weakness     that the historian hesitates to write about them it was called the     period of the restoration which meant in effect the restoration     of all that was objectionable in monarchy another crisis came in     the revolution of 1688 when the country aroused by the attempt of     james ii to establish another despotism in church and state     invited prince william of orange husband of the kings daughter     mary to the english throne that revolution meant three things     the supremacy of parliament the beginning of modern england and     the final triumph of the principle of political liberty for which     the puritan had fought and suffered hardship for a hundred years  typical writers among the writers of the period three men stand out prominently and such was the confusion of the times that in the whole range of our literature it would be difficult to find three others who differ more widely in spirit or method milton represents the scholarship the culture of the renaissance combined with the moral earnestness of the puritan bunyan a poor tinker and lay preacher reflects the tremendous spiritual ferment among the common people and dryden the cool calculating author who made a business of writing regards the renaissance and puritanism as both things of the past he lives in the present aims to give readers what they like follows the french critics of the period who advocate writing by rule and popularizes that cold formal precise style which under the assumed name of classicism is to dominate english poetry during the following century                                       john milton 16081674    yet some there be that by due steps aspire   to lay their just hands on that golden key   that opes the palace of eternity   to such my errand is  in these words of the attendant spirit in comus we seem to hear milton speaking to his readers to such as regard poetry as the means of an hours pleasant recreation he brings no message his errand is to those who like sidney regard poetry as the handmaiden of virtue or like aristotle as the highest form of human history      life milton was born in london 1608 at a time when shakespeare     and his fellow dramatists were in their glory he grew up in a home     where the delights of poetry and music were added to the moral     discipline of the puritan before he was twelve years old he had     formed the habit of studying far into the night and his field     included not only greek latin hebrew and modern european     literatures but mathematics also and science and theology and     music his parents had devoted him in infancy to noble ends and he     joyously accepted their dedication saying he who would not be     frustrate of his hope to write well  ought himself to be a true     poem that is a composition and pattern of the best and     honorablest things      sidenote milton at horton      from st pauls school milton went to christs college cambridge     took his masters degree wrote a few poems in latin italian and     english and formed a plan for a great epic a poem that england     would not willingly let die then he retired to his fathers     countryplace at horton and for six years gave himself up to     music to untutored study and to that formal pleasure in nature     which is reflected in his work five short poems were the only     literary result of this retirement but these were the most perfect     of their kind that england had thus far produced      miltons next step intended like all others to cultivate his     talent took him to the continent for fifteen months he traveled     through france and italy and was about to visit greece when     hearing of the struggle between king and parliament he set his     face towards england again for i thought it base he said to     be traveling at my ease for culture when my countrymen at home were     fighting for liberty      sidenote home life      to find himself or to find the service to which he could devote     his great learning seems to have been miltons object after his     return to london 1639 while he waited he began to educate his     nephews and enlarged this work until he had a small private     school in which he tested some of the theories that appeared later     in his tractate on education also he married in haste it     seems and with deplorable consequences his wife mary powell the     daughter of a cavalier was a pleasureloving young woman and     after a brief experience of puritan discipline she wearied of it     and went home she has been amply criticized for her desertion but     miltons house must have been rather chilly for any ordinary human     being to find comfort in to him woman seemed to have been made for     obedience and man for rebellion his toplofty doctrine of     masculine superiority found expression in a line regarding adam and     eve he for god only she for god in himan old delusion which     had been seriously disturbed by the first woman      illustration john milton      sidenote period of controversy      for a period of near twenty years milton wrote but little poetry     his time being occupied with controversies that were then waged     even more fiercely in the press than in the field it was after the     execution of king charles 1649 when england was stunned and all     europe aghast at the puritans daring that he published his     tenure of kings and magistrates the argument of which was     that magistrates and people are equally subject to the law and     that the divine right of kings to rule is as nothing beside the     divine right of the people to defend their liberties that argument     established miltons position as the literary champion of     democracy he was chosen secretary of the commonwealth his duties     being to prepare the latin correspondence with foreign countries     and to confound all arguments of the royalists during the next     decade miltons pen and cromwells sword were the two outward     bulwarks of puritanism and one was quite as ready and almost as     potent as the other      sidenote his blindness      it was while milton was thus occupied that he lost his eyesight     his last sacrifice on the altar of english liberty his famous     sonnet on his blindness is a lament not for his lost sight but     for his lost talent for while serving the commonwealth he must     abandon the dream of a great poem that he had cherished all his     life        when i consider how my light is spent       ere half my days in this dark world and wide       and that one talent which is death to hide       lodged with me useless though my soul more bent       to serve therewith my maker and present       my true account lest he returning chide       doth god exact day labour light denied       i fondly ask but patience to prevent       that murmur soon replies god doth not need       either mans work or his own gifts who best       bear his mild yoke they serve him best his state       is kingly thousands at his bidding speed       and post oer land and ocean without rest       they also serve who only stand and wait      with the restoration 1660 came disaster to the blind puritan     poet who had written too harshly against charles i to be forgiven     by charles ii he was forced to hide his property was confiscated     his works were burned in public by the hangman had not his fame as     a writer raised up powerful friends he would have gone to the     scaffold when cromwells bones were taken from the grave and hanged     in impotent revenge he was finally allowed to settle in a modest     house and to be in peace so long as he remained in obscurity so     the pen was silenced that had long been a scourge to the enemies of     england      sidenote his loneliness      his home life for the remainder of his years impresses us by its     loneliness and grandeur he who had delighted as a poet in the     english country and more delighted as a puritan in the fierce     struggle for liberty was now confined to a small house going from     study to porch and finding both in equal darkness he who had     roamed as a master through the wide fields of literature was now     dependent on a chance reader his soul also was afflicted by the     apparent loss of all that puritanism had so hardly won by the     degradation of his country by family troubles for his daughters     often rebelled at the task of taking his dictation and left him     helpless saddest of all there was no love in the house for with     all his genius milton could not inspire affection in his own     people nor does he ever reach the heart of his readers      sidenote his masterpiece      in the midst of such scenes denied the pleasure of hope milton     seems to have lived largely in his memories he took up his early     dream of an immortal epic lived with it seven years in seclusion     and the result was paradise lost this epic is generally     considered the finest fruit of miltons genius but there are two     other poems that have a more personal and human significance in     the morning of his life he had written comus and the poem     is a reflection of a noble youth whose way lies open and smiling     before him almost forty years later or just before his death in     1674 he wrote samson agonistes and in this tragedy of a     blind giant bound captive but unconquerable we have a picture     of the agony and moral grandeur of the poet who takes leave of     life        i feel my genial spirits droop        my race of glory run and race of shame       and i shall shortly be with them that rest 1      footnote 1 from miltons samson for the comparison we     are indebted to henry reed lectures on english literature     1863 p 223        illustration cottage at chalfont st giles buckinghamshire       where milton lived during the plague and where paradise lost was       written  the early poems miltons first notable poem written in college days was the ode on the morning of christs nativity a chant of victory and praise such as pindar might have written had he known the meaning of christmas in this boyish work one may find the dominant characteristic of all miltons poetry namely a blending of learning with piety a devotion of all the treasures of classic culture to the service of religion  among the earliest of the horton poems socalled because they were written in the countryplace of that name are lallegro and il penseroso two of the most widely quoted works in our literature they should be read in order to understand what people have admired for nearly three hundred years if not for their own beauty lallegro from the italian meaning the cheerful man is the poetic expression of a happy state of mind and il penseroso footnote the name is generally translated into melancholy but the latter term is now commonly associated with sorrow or disease to milton melancholy meant pensiveness in writing il penseroso he was probably influenced by a famous book burtons anatomy of melancholy which appeared in 1621 and was very widely read of a quiet thoughtful mood that verges upon sadness like the mood that follows good music both poems are largely inspired by nature and seem to have been composed out of doors one in the morning and the other in the evening twilight  sidenote the masque of comus  comus 1634 another of the horton poems is to many readers the most interesting of miltons works in form it is a masque that is a dramatic poem intended to be staged to the accompaniment of music in execution it is the most perfect of all such poems inspired by the elizabethan love of pageants we may regard it therefore as a late echo of the elizabethan drama which like many another echo is sweeter though fainter than the original it was performed at ludlow castle before the earl of bridgewater and was suggested by an accident to the earls children a simple accident in which milton saw the possibility of turning the common dust of opportunity to gold      the story is that of a girl who becomes separated from her brothers     in a wood and is soon lost the magician comus footnote in     mythology comus the god of revelry was represented as the son of     dionysus bacchus god of wine and the witch circe in greek     poetry comus is the leader of any gay band of satyrs or dancers     miltons masque of comus was influenced by a similar story     in peeles old wives tale by spensers palace of     pleasure in the faery queen see above sir guyon in     chapter iv and by homers story of the witch circe in the     odyssey appears with his band of revelers and tries to     bewitch the girl to make her like one of his own brutish     followers she is protected by her own purity is watched over by     the attendant spirit and finally rescued by her brothers the     story is somewhat like that of the old ballad of the children in     the wood but it is here transformed into a kind of morality play  sidenote comus and the tempest  in this masque may everywhere be seen the influence of miltons predecessors and the stamp of his own independence his puritan spirit also which must add a moral to the old pagan tales thus miranda wandering about the enchanted isle in shakespeares the tempest hears strange harmonious echoes to which caliban gives expression                               the isle is full of noises   sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not   sometimes a thousand twangling instruments   will hum about mine ears and sometimes voices   that if i then had waked after long sleep   will make me sleep again and then in dreaming   the clouds methought would open and show riches   ready to drop upon me that when i waked   i cried to dream again  the bewildered girl in comus also hears mysterious voices and has glimpses of a world not her own but like sir guyon of the faery queen she is on moral guard against all such deceptions              a thousand phantasies   begin to throng into my memory   of calling shapes and beckoning shadows dire   and airy tongues that syllable mens names   on sands and shores and desert wildernesses   these thoughts may startle well but not astound   the virtuous mind that ever walks attended   by a strongsiding champion conscience  again in the tempest we meet the frisky spirit ariel who sings of his coming freedom from prosperos service    where the bee sucks there suck i   in a cowslips bell i lie   there i couch when owls do cry   on a bats back i do fly   after summer merrily   merrily merrily shall i live now   under the blossom that hangs on the bough  illustration ludlow castle  the attendant spirit in comus has something of ariels gayety but his joy is deeperseated he serves not the magician prospero but the almighty and comes gladly to earth in fulfilment of the divine promise he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways when his work is done he vanishes like ariel but with a song which shows the difference between the elizabethan or renaissance conception of sensuous beauty that is beauty which appeals to the physical senses and the puritans idea of moral beauty which appeals to the soul    now my task is smoothly done   i can fly or i can run   quickly to the green earths end   where the bowed welkin slow doth bend   and from thence can soar as soon   to the corners of the moon   mortals that would follow me   love virtue she alone is free   she can teach ye how to climb   higher than the sphery chime   or if virtue feeble were   heaven itself would stoop to her  sidenote lycidas  lycidas 1637 last of the horton poems is an elegy occasioned by the death of one who had been miltons fellow student at cambridge it was an old college custom to celebrate important events by publishing a collection of latin or english poems and lycidas may be regarded as miltons wreath which he offered to the memory of his classmate and to his university the poem is beautifully fashioned and is greatly admired for its classic form but it is cold as any monument without a touch of human grief or sympathy probably few modern readers will care for it as they care for tennysons in memoriam a less perfect elegy but one into which love enters as well as art other notable english elegies are the thyrsis of matthew arnold and the adonais of shelley  miltons left hand this expression was used by milton to designate certain prose works written in the middle period of his life at a time of turmoil and danger these works have magnificent passages which show the power and the harmony of our english speech but they are marred by other passages of bitter raillery and invective the most famous of all these works is the noble plea called areopagitica footnote from the areopagus or forum of athens the place of public appeal this was the mars hill from which st paul addressed the athenians as recorded in the book of acts a speech for the liberty of unlicensed printing 1644  there was a law in miltons day forbidding the printing of any work until it had been approved by the official licenser of books such a law may have been beneficial at times but during the seventeenth century it was another instrument of tyranny since no licenser would allow anything to be printed against his particular church or government when areopagitica was written the puritans of the long parliament were virtually rulers of england and milton pleaded with his own party for the free expression of every honest opinion for liberty in all wholesome pleasures and for tolerance in religious matters his stern confidence in truth that she will not be weakened but strengthened by attack is summarized in the famous sentence i cannot praise a fugitive and cloistered virtue  two interesting matters concerning areopagitica are first that this eloquent plea for the freedom of printing had to be issued in defiance of law without a license and second that milton was himself a few years later under cromwells iron government a censor of the press  sidenote the sonnets  miltons rare sonnets seem to belong to this middle period of strife though some of them were written earlier since wyatt and surrey had brought the italian sonnet to england this form of verse had been employed to sing of love but with milton it became a heroic utterance a trumpet wordsworth calls it summoning men to virtue to patriotism to stern action the most personal of these sonnets are on having arrived at the age of twentythree on his blindness and to cyriack skinner the most romantic is to the nightingale others that are especially noteworthy are on the late massacre on his deceased wife footnote this beautiful sonnet was written to his second wife not to mary powell and to cromwell the spirit of these sonnets in contrast with those of elizabethan times is finely expressed by landor in the lines    few his words but strong   and sounding through all ages and all climes   he caught the sonnet from the dainty hand   of love who cried to lose it and he gave the notes   to glory  miltons later poetry footnote the three poems of miltons later life are paradise lost paradise regained and samson agonistes the lastnamed has been referred to above under his masterpiece paradise regained contains some noble passages but is inferior to paradise lost on which the poets fame chiefly rests it was in 1658 the year of cromwells death when the political power of puritanism was tottering that milton in his blindness began to write paradise lost after stating his theme he begins his epic as virgil began the Æneid in the midst of the action so that in reading his first book it is well to have in mind an outline of the whole story which is as follows      sidenote plan of paradise lost      the scene opens in heaven and the time is before the creation of     the world the archangel lucifer rebels against the almighty and     gathers to his banner an immense company of the heavenly hosts of     angels and flaming cherubim a stupendous three days battle     follows between rebel and loyal legions the issue being in doubt     until the son goes forth in his chariot of victory lucifer and his     rebels are defeated and are hurled over the ramparts of heaven     down down through chaos they fall nine times the space that     measures day and night until they reach the hollow vaults of     hell      in the second act for paradise lost has some dramatic as     well as epic construction we follow the creation of the earth in     the midst of the universe and herein we have an echo of the old     belief that the earth was the center of the solar system adam and     eve are formed to take in the almightys affection the place of the     fallen angels they live happily in paradise watched over by     celestial guardians meanwhile lucifer and his followers are     plotting revenge in hell they first boast valiantly and talk of     mighty war but the revenge finally degenerates into a base plan to     tempt adam and eve and win them over to the fallen hosts      the third act shows lucifer now called satan or the adversary     with his infernal peers in pandemonium plotting the ruin of the     world he makes an astounding journey through chaos disguises     himself in various forms of bird or beast in order to watch adam     and eve is detected by ithuriel and the guardian angels and is     driven away thereupon he haunts vast space hiding in the shadow     of the earth until his chance comes when he creeps back into eden     by means of an underground river disguising himself as a serpent     he meets eve and tempts her with the fruit of a certain tree of     knowledge which she has been forbidden to touch she eats the     fruit and shares it with adam then the pair are discovered in     their disobedience and are banished from paradise footnote in     the above outline we have arranged the events in the order in which     they are supposed to have occurred milton tells the story in a     somewhat confused way the order of the twelve books of paradise     lost is not the natural or dramatic order of the story  sidenote miltons materials  it is evident from this outline that milton uses material from two different sources one an ancient legend which cædmon employed in his paraphrase the other the bible narrative of creation though the latter is but a small part of the epic it is as a fixed center about which all other interests are supposed to revolve in reading paradise lost therefore with its vast scenes and colossal figures one should keep in mind that every detail was planned by milton to be closely related to his central theme which is the fall of man  in using such diverse materials milton met with difficulties some of which the character of lucifer for example were too great for his limited dramatic powers in books i and ii lucifer is a magnificent figure the proudest in all literature a rebel with something of celestial grandeur about him    is this the region this the soil the clime   said then the lost archangel this the seat   that we must change for heaven this mournful gloom   for that celestial light be it so since he   who now is sovran can dispose and bid   what shall be right farthest from him is best   whom reason hath equalled force hath made supreme   above his equals farewell happy fields   where joy forever dwells hail horrors hail   infernal world and thou profoundest hell   receive thy new possessor one who brings   a mind not to be changed by place or time   the mind is its own place and in itself   can make a heaven of hell a hell of heaven   what matter where if i be still the same   and what i should be all but less than he   whom thunder hath made greater here at least   we shall be free the almighty hath not built   here for his envy will not drive us hence   here we may reign secure and in my choice   to reign is worth ambition though in hell   better to reign in hell than serve in heaven  in other books of paradise lost the same character appears not as the heroic rebel but as the sneaking father of lies all his grandeur gone creeping as a snake into paradise or sitting in the form of an ugly toad squat at eves ear whispering petty deceits to a woman while she sleeps it is probable that milton meant to show here the moral results of rebellion but there is little in his poem to explain the sudden degeneracy from lucifer to satan  sidenote matter and manner  the reader will note also the strong contrast between miltons matter and his manner his matter is largely mythical and the myth is not beautiful or even interesting but childish for the most part and frequently grotesque as when cannon are used in the battle of the angels or when the almighty makes plans                           lest unawares we lose   this our high place our sanctuary our hill  indeed all miltons celestial figures with the exception of the original lucifer are as banal as those of the old miracle plays and his adam and eve are dull wooden figures that serve merely to voice the poets theology or moral sentiments  in contrast with this unattractive matter miltons manner is always and unmistakably the grand manner his imagination is lofty his diction noble and the epic of paradise lost is so filled with memorable lines with gorgeous descriptions with passages of unexampled majesty or harmony or eloquence that the crude material which he injects into the bible narrative is lost sight of in our wonder at his superb style  the quality of milton if it be asked what is miltons adjective the word sublime rises to the lips as the best expression of his style this word from the latin sublimis meaning exalted above the ordinary is hard to define but may be illustrated from ones familiar experience      you stand on a hilltop overlooking a mighty landscape on which the     new snow has just fallen the forest bending beneath its soft     burden the fields all white and still the air scintillating with     light and color the whole world so clean and pure that it seems as     if god had blotted out its imperfections and adorned it for his own     pleasure that is a sublime spectacle and the soul of man is     exalted as he looks upon it or here in your own village you see a     woman who enters a room where a child is stricken with a deadly and     contagious disease she immolates herself for the suffering one     cares for him and saves him then lays down her own life that is a     sublime act or you hear of a young patriot captured and hanged by     the enemy and as they lead him forth to death he says i regret     that i have but one life to give to my country that is a sublime     expression and the feeling in your heart as you hear it is one of     moral sublimity  sidenote sublimity  the writer who lifts our thought and feeling above their ordinary level who gives us an impression of outward grandeur or of moral exaltation is a sublime writer has a sublime style and milton more than any other poet deserves the adjective his scenes are immeasurable mountain sea and forest are but his playthings his imagination hesitates not to paint chaos heaven hell the widespread universe in which our world hangs like a pendant star and across which stretches the milky way    a broad and ample road whose dust is gold   and pavement stars  no other poet could find suitable words for such vast themes but milton never falters read the assembly of the fallen hosts before lucifer in book i of paradise lost or the opening of hellgates in book ii or the invocation to light in book iii or satans invocation to the sun in book iv or the morning hymn of adam and eve in book v or open paradise lost anywhere and you shall soon find some passage which by the grandeur of its scene or by the exalted feeling of the poet as he describes it awakens in you the feeling of sublimity  sidenote harmony  the harmony of miltons verse is its second notable quality many of our poets use blank verse as many other people walk as if they had no sense of rhythm within them but milton by reason of his long study and practice of music seems to be always writing to melody in consequence it is easy to read his most prolix passages as it is easy to walk over almost any kind of ground if one but keeps step to outward or inward music not only is miltons verse stately and melodious but he is a perfect master of words choosing them for their sound as well as for their sense as a musician chooses different instruments to express different emotions note these contrasting descriptions of so simple a matter as the opening of gates                         heaven opened wide   her everduring gates harmonious sound   on golden hinges moving on a sudden open fly   with impetuous recoil and jarring sound   th infernal doors and on their hinges grate   harsh thunder  in dealing with a poet of such magnificent qualities one should be wary of criticism that miltons poetry has little human interest no humor and plenty of faults may be granted his paradise lost especially is overcrowded with mere learning or pedantry in one place and with pompous commonplaces in another but such faults appear trivial unworthy of mention in the presence of a poem that is as a storehouse from which the authors and statesmen of three hundred years have drawn their choicest images and expressions it stands forever as our supreme example of sublimity and harmonythat sublimity which reflects the human spirit standing awed and reverent before the grandeur of the universe that harmony of expression at which every great poet aims and which milton attained in such measure that he is called the organvoice of england                                         john bunyan 16281688  there is a striking contrast between the poet and the prose writer of the puritan age milton the poet is a man of culture familiar with the best literature of all ages bunyan the prose writer is a poor selftaught laborer who reads his bible with difficulty stumbling over the hard passages milton writes for the cultivated classes in harmonious verse adorned with classic figures bunyan speaks for common men in sinewy prose and makes his meaning clear by homely illustrations drawn from daily life milton is a solitary and austere figure admirable but not lovable bunyan is like a familiar acquaintance ruddyfaced cleareyed who wins us by his sympathy his friendliness his good sense and good humor he is known as the author of one book the pilgrims progress but that book has probably had more readers than any other that england has ever produced      life during bunyans lifetime england was in a state of religious     ferment or revival and his experience of it is vividly portrayed     in a remarkable autobiography called grace abounding to the     chief of inners in reading this book we find that his life is     naturally separated into two periods his youth was a time of     struggle with doubts and temptations his later years were     characterized by inward peace and tireless labor his peace meant     that he was saved his labor that he must save others here in a     word is the secret of all his works      illustration john bunyan      he was born 1628 in the village of elstow bedfordshire and was     the son of a poor tinker he was sent to school long enough to     learn elementary reading and writing then he followed the tinkers     trade but at the age of sixteen being offended at his fathers     second marriage he ran away and joined the army      as a boy bunyan had a vivid but morbid imagination which led him     to terrible doubts fears fits of despondency hallucinations on     such a nature the emotional religious revivals of the age made a     tremendous impression he followed them for years living in a     state of torment until he felt himself converted whereupon he     turned preacher and began to call other sinners to repentance such     were his native power and rude eloquence that wherever he went     the common people thronged to hear him      sidenote in bedford jail      after the restoration all this was changed public meetings were     forbidden unless authorized by bishops of the established church     and bunyan was one of the first to be called to account when     ordered to hold no more meetings he refused to obey saying that     when the lord called him to preach salvation he would listen only     to the lords voice then he was thrown into bedford jail during     his imprisonment he supported his family by making shoe laces and     wrote grace abounding and the pilgrims progress      after his release bunyan became the most popular writer and     preacher in england he wrote a large number of works and went     cheerfully up and down the land preaching the gospel to the poor     helping the afflicted doing an immense amount of good he died     1688 as the result of exposure while on an errand of mercy his     works were then known only to humble readers and not until long     years had passed did critics awaken to the fact that one of     englands most powerful and original writers had passed away with     the poor tinker of elstow  works of bunyan from the pen of this uneducated preacher came nearly sixty works great and small the most notable of which are grace abounding 1666 a kind of spiritual autobiography the holy war 1665 a prose allegory with a theme similar to that of miltons epic and the life and death of mr badman 1682 a character study which was a forerunner of the english novel these works are seldom read and bunyan is known to most readers as the author of the pilgrims progress 1678 this is the famous allegory footnote allegory is figurative writing in which some outward object or event is described in such a way that we apply the description to humanity to our mental or spiritual experiences the object of allegory as a rule is to teach moral lessons and in this it is like a drawnout fable and like a parable the two greatest allegories in our literature are spensers faery queen and bunyans pilgrims progress in which under guise of telling the story of a pilgrim in search of a city bunyan portrays the experiences of humanity in its journey from this world to the next here is an outline of the story      sidenote story of pilgrims progress      in the city of destruction lives a poor sinner called christian     when he learns that the city is doomed he is terrified and flees     out of it carrying a great burden on his back he is followed by     the jeers of his neighbors who have no fear he seeks a safe and     abiding city to dwell in but is ignorant how to find it until     evangelist shows him the road      as he goes on his journey mr worldly wiseman meets him and urges     him to return but he hastens on only to plunge into the slough of     despond his companion pliable is here discouraged and turns back     christian struggles on through the mud and reaches the wicket gate     where interpreter shows him the way to the celestial city as he     passes a cross beside the path the heavy burden which he carries     his load of sins falls off of itself then with many adventures     he climbs the steep hill difficulty where his eyes behold the     castle beautiful to reach this he must pass some fearful lions in     the way but he adventures on finds that the lions are chained is     welcomed by the porter watchful and is entertained in the castle     overnight      dangers thicken and difficulties multiply as he resumes his     journey his road is barred by the demon apollyon whom he fights     to the death the way now dips downward into the awful valley of     the shadow passing through this he enters the town of vanity     goes to vanity fair where he is abused and beaten and where his     companion faithful is condemned to death as he escapes from     vanity the giant despair seizes him and hurls him into the gloomy     dungeon of doubt again he escapes struggles onward and reaches     the delectable mountains there for the first time he sees the     celestial city but between him and his refuge is a river deep and     terrible without bridge or ford he crosses it and the journey     ends as angels come singing down the streets to welcome christian     into the city footnote this is the story of the first part of     pilgrims progress which was written in bedford jail but     not published till some years later in 1684 bunyan published the     second part of his story describing the adventures of christiana     and her children on their journey to the celestial city this     sequel like most others is of minor importance  illustration bunyan meetinghouse southwark  such an outline gives but a faint idea of bunyans great work of its realistic figures its living and speaking characters its knowledge of humanity its portrayal of the temptations and doubts that beset the ordinary man its picturesque style which of itself would make the book stand out above ten thousand ordinary stories pilgrims progress is still one of our best examples of clear forceful idiomatic english and our wonder increases when we remember that it was written by a man ignorant of literary models but he had read his bible daily until its style and imagery had taken possession of him also he had a vivid imagination a sincere purpose to help his fellows and his simple rule of rhetoric was to forget himself and deliver his message in one of his poems he gives us his rule of expression which is an excellent one for writers and speakers                           thine only way   before them all is to say out thy say   in thine own native language                                      john dryden 16311700  for fifty years dryden lived in the city of milton in the country of john bunyan but his works might indicate that he inhabited a different planet unlike his two great contemporaries his first object was to win favor he sold his talent to the highest bidder won the leading place among secondrate restoration writers and was content to reflect a generation which had neither the hearty enthusiasm of elizabethan times nor the moral earnestness of puritanism      life knowledge of drydens life is rather meager and as his     motives are open to question we shall state here only a few facts     he was born of a puritan and aristocratic family at aldwinkle in     1631 after an excellent education which included seven years at     trinity college cambridge he turned to literature as a means of     earning a livelihood taking a worldly view of his profession and     holding his pen ready to serve the winning side thus he wrote his     heroic stanzas which have a hearty puritan ring on the death of     cromwell but he turned royalist and wrote the more flattering     astræa redux to welcome charles ii back to power      sidenote his versatility      in literature dryden proved himself a man of remarkable     versatility because plays were in demand he produced many that     catered to the evil tastes of the restoration stageplays that he     afterwards condemned unsparingly he was equally ready to write     prose or verse songs criticisms political satires in 1670 he     was made poet laureate under charles ii his affairs prospered he     became a literary dictator in london holding forth nightly in     wills coffeehouse to an admiring circle of listeners after the     revolution of 1688 he lost his offices and with them most of his     income      illustration john dryden     from a picture by hudson in the hall of trinity college cambridge      in his old age being reduced to hackwork he wrote obituaries     epitaphs paraphrases of the tales of chaucer translations of     latin poetsanything to earn an honest living he died in 1700     and was buried beside chaucer in westminster abbey      such facts are not interesting nor do they give us a true idea of     the man dryden to understand him we should have to read his works     no easy or pleasant task and compare his prose prefaces in which     he is at his best with the comedies in which he is abominable     when not engaged with the degenerate stage or with political or     literary or religious controversies he appears sane     wellbalanced goodtempered manly but the impression is not a     lasting one he seems to have catered to the vicious element of his     own age to have regretted the misuse of his talent and to have     recorded his own judgment in two lines from his ode to the memory     of mrs killigrew        o gracious god how far have we       profaned thy heavenly grace of poesy  works of dryden the occasional poems written by dryden may be left in the obscurity into which they fell after they had been applauded the same may be said of his typical poem annus mirabilis which describes the wonderful events of the year 1666 a year which witnessed the taking of new amsterdam from the dutch and the great fire of london both events were celebrated in a way to contribute to the glory of king charles and to drydens political fortune of all his poetical works only the odes written in honor of st cecilia are now remembered the second ode alexanders feast is one of our best poems on the power of music  sidenote his plays  drydens numerous plays show considerable dramatic power and every one of them contains some memorable line or passage but they are spoiled by the authors insincerity in trying to satisfy the depraved taste of the restoration stage he wrote one play all for love to please himself he said and it is noticeable that this play is written in blank verse and shows the influence of shakespeare who was then out of fashion if any of the plays are to be read all for love should be selected though it is exceptional not typical and gives but a faint idea of drydens ordinary dramatic methods  sidenote satires  in the field of political satire dryden was a master and his work here is interesting as showing that unfortunate alliance between literature and politics which led many of the best english writers of the next century to sell their services to the whigs or tories dryden sided with the later party and in a kind of allegory of the bible story of absaloms revolt against david wrote absalom and achitophel to glorify the tories and to castigate the whigs this powerful political satire was followed by others in the same vein and by macflecknoe which satirized certain poets with whom dryden was at loggerheads as a rule such works are for a day having no enduring interest because they have no human kindness but occasionally dryden portrays a man of his own time so well that his picture applies to the vulgar politician of all ages as in this characterization of burnet    prompt to assail and careless of defence   invulnerable in his impudence   he dares the world and eager of a name   he thrusts about and justles into fame   so fond of loud report that not to miss   of being known his last and utmost bliss   he rather would be known for what he is  these satires of dryden were largely influential in establishing the heroic couplet footnote the heroic couplet consists of two iambic pentameter lines that rime by pentameter is meant that the line has five feet or measures by iambic that each foot contains two syllables the first short or unaccented the second long or accented which dominated the fashion of english poetry for the next century the couplet had been used by earlier poets chaucer for example but in his hands it was musical and unobtrusive a minor part of a complete work with dryden and with his contemporary waller the making of couplets was the main thing in their hands the couplet became closed that is it often contained a complete thought a criticism a nugget of common sense a poem in itself as in this aphorism from macflecknoe    all human things are subject to decay   and when fate summons monarchs must obey  sidenote prose works  in his prose works dryden proved himself the ablest critic of his time and the inventor of a neat serviceable style which with flattery to ourselves we are wont to call modern among his numerous critical works we note especially an essay of dramatic poesy of heroic plays discourse on satire and the preface to his fables these have not the vigor or picturesqueness of bunyans prose but they are written clearly in short sentences with the chief aim of being understood if we compare them with the sonorous periods of milton or with the pretty involutions of sidney we shall see why dryden is called the father of modern prose his sensible style appears in this criticism of chaucer      he must have been a man of a most wonderful comprehensive nature     because as it has been truly observed of him he has taken into     the compass of his canterbury tales the various manners and     humours as we now call them of the whole english nation in his     age not a single character has escaped him we have our fathers     and greatgranddames all before us as they were in chaucers days     their general characters are still remaining in mankind and even     in england though they are called by other names than those of     monks and friars and canons and lady abbesses and nuns for mankind     is ever the same and nothing lost out of nature though everything     is altered                                       secondary writers  puritan and cavalier verse the numerous minor poets of this period are often arranged in groups but any true classification is impossible since there was no unity among them each was a law unto himself and the result was to emphasize personal oddity or eccentricity it would seem that in writing of love the common theme of poets puritan and cavalier must alike speak the common language of the heart but that is precisely what they did not do with them love was no longer a passion or even a fashion but any fantastic conceit that might decorate a rime thus suckling habitually made love a joke    why so pale and wan fond lover     prithee why so pale   will when looking well wont move her     looking ill prevail     prithee why so pale  crashaw turned from his religious poems to sing of love in a way to appeal to the transcendentalists of a later age    whoeer she be   that not impossible she   that shall command my heart and me  and donne must search out some odd notion from natural or unnatural history making love a spider that turns the wine of life into poison or from mechanics comparing lovers to a pair of dividers    if they be two they are two so     as stiff twin compasses are two   thy soul the fixed foot makes no show     to move but doth if the other do   illustration george herbert from a rare print by white prefixed to his poems  several of these poets commonly grouped in a class which includes donne herbert cowley crashaw and others famous in their day received the name of metaphysical poets not because of their profound thought but because of their eccentric style and queer figures of speech of all this group george herbert 15931633 is the sanest and the sweetest his chief work the temple is a collection of poems celebrating the beauty of holiness the sacraments the church the experiences of the christian life some of these poems are ingenious conceits and deserve the derisive name of metaphysical which dr johnson flung at them but others such as virtue the pulley love and the collar are the expression of a beautiful and saintly soul speaking of the deep things of god and speaking so quietly withal that one is apt to miss the intensity that lurks even in his calmest verses note in these opening and closing stanzas of virtue the restraint of the one the hidden glow of the other    sweet day so cool so calm so bright     the bridal of the earth and sky   the dew shall weep thy fall tonight     for thou must die    only a sweet and virtuous soul     like seasoned timber never gives   but though the whole world turn to coal     then chiefly lives  sidenote cavalier poets  in contrast with the disciplined puritan spirit of herbert is the gayety of another group called the cavalier poets among whom are carew suckling and lovelace they reflect clearly the spirit of the royalists who followed king charles with a devotion worthy of a better master robert herrick 15911674 is the best known of this group and his only book hesperides and noble numbers 1648 reflects the two elements found in most of the minor poetry of the age namely cavalier gayety and puritan seriousness in the first part of the book are some graceful verses celebrating the light loves of the cavaliers and the fleeting joys of country life    i sing of brooks of blossoms birds and bowers   of april may of june and july flowers   i sing of maypoles hockcarts wassails wakes   of bridegrooms brides and of their bridal cakes  in noble numbers such poems as thanksgiving a true lent litany and the childs ode on the birth of our saviour reflect the better side of the cavalier who can be serious without pulling a long face who goes to his devotions cheerfully and who retains even in his religion what andrew lang calls a spirit of unregenerate happiness  sidenote butlers hudibras  samuel butler 16121680 may also be classed with the cavalier poets though in truth he stands alone in this age a master of doggerel rime and of ferocious satire his chief work hudibras a grotesque caricature of puritanism appeared in 1663 when the restored king and his favorites were shamelessly plundering the government the poem probably suggested by don quixote relates a rambling story of the adventures of sir hudibras a sniveling puritan knight and his squire ralpho its doggerel style may be inferred from the following    besides tis known he could speak greek   as naturally as pigs squeak   that latin was no more difficle   than to a blackbird tis to whistle   being rich in both he never scanted   his bounty unto such as wanted  such was the stuff that the royalists quoted to each other as wit and the wit was so dear to king and courtiers that they carried copies of hudibras around in their pockets the poem was enormously popular in its day and some of its best lines are still quoted but the selections we now meet give but a faint idea of the general scurrility of a work which amused england in the days when the puritans fanaticism was keenly remembered his struggle for liberty quite forgotten  prose writers of the hundreds of prose works that appeared in puritan times very few are now known even by name their controversial fires are sunk to ashes even the causes that produced or fanned them are forgotten meanwhile we cherish a few books that speak not of strife but of peace and charity  illustration sir thomas browne  thomas browne 16051682 was a physician vastly learned in a day when he and other doctors gravely prescribed herbs or bloodsuckers for witchcraft but he was less interested in his profession than in what was then called modern science his most famous work is religio medici religion of a physician 1642 a beautiful book cherished by those who know it as one of the greatest prose works in the language his urn burial is even more remarkable for its subtle thought and condensed expression but its charm like that of the silent places is for the few who can discover and appreciate it  illustration isaac walton  isaac walton 15931683 or isaak as he always wrote it was a modest linen merchant who in the midst of troublous times kept his serenity of spirit by attending strictly to his own affairs by reading good books and by going fishing his taste for literature is reflected with rare simplicity in his lives of donne wotton hooker george herbert and bishop sanderson a series of biographies which are among the earliest and sweetest in our language their charm lies partly in their refined style but more largely in their revelation of character for walton chose men of gentle spirit for his subjects men who were like himself in cherishing the still depths of life rather than its noisy shallows and wrote of them with the understanding of perfect sympathy wordsworth expressed his appreciation of the work in a noble sonnet beginning    there are no colours in the fairest sky   so fair as these the feather whence the pen   was shaped that traced the lives of these good men   dropped from an angels wing  waltons love of fishing and of all the lore of trout brooks and spring meadows that fishing implies found expression in the compleat angler or contemplative mans recreation 1653 this is a series of conversations in which an angler convinces his friends that fishing is not merely the sport of catching fish but an art that men are born to like the art of poetry even such a hardhearted matter as impaling a minnow for bait becomes poetical for this is the fashion of it put your hook in at his mouth and out at his gills and do it as if you loved him it is enough to say of this old work the classic of its kind that it deserves all the honor which the tribe of anglers have given it and that you could hardly find a better book to fall asleep over after a days fishing  sidenote evelyn and pepys  no such gentle human lovable books were produced in restoration times the most famous prose works of the period are the diaries of john evelyn and samuel pepys the former was a gentleman and his diary is an interesting chronicle of matters large and small from 1641 to 1697 pepys though he became secretary of the admiralty and president of the royal society was a gossip a chatterbox with an eye that loved to peek into closets and a tongue that ran to slander his diary covering the period from 1660 to 1669 is a keen but malicious exposition of private and public life during the restoration                                           summary the literary period just studied covers the last three     quarters of the seventeenth century its limits are very     indefinite merging into elizabethan romance on the one side and     into eighteenth century formalism on the other historically the     period was one of bitter conflict between two main political and     religious parties the royalists or cavaliers and the puritans     the literature of the age is extremely diverse in character and is     sadly lacking in the unity the joyousness the splendid enthusiasm     of elizabethan prose and poetry      the greatest writer of the period was john milton he is famous in     literature for his early or horton poems which are elizabethan in     spirit for his controversial prose works which reflect the strife     of the age for his epic of paradise lost and for his     tragedy of samson      another notable puritan or rather independent writer was john     bunyan whose works reflect the religious ferment of the     seventeenth century his chief works are grace abounding a     kind of spiritual biography and the pilgrims progress an     allegory of the christian life which has been more widely read than     any other english book      the chief writer of the restoration period was john dryden a     professional author who often catered to the coarser tastes of the     age there is no single work by which he is gratefully remembered     he is noted for his political satires for his vigorous use of the     heroic couplet for his modern prose style and for his literary     criticisms      among the numerous minor poets of the period robert herrick and     george herbert are especially noteworthy a few miscellaneous prose     works are the

constitutional and party government the     revolution of 1688 which banished the stuarts had settled the     king question by making parliament supreme in england but not all     englishmen were content with the settlement no sooner were the     people in control of the government than they divided into hostile     parties the liberal whigs who were determined to safeguard     popular liberty and the conservative tories with tender memories     of kingcraft who would leave as much authority as possible in the     royal hands on the extreme of toryism was a third party of     zealots called the jacobites who aimed to bring the stuarts back     to the throne and who for fifty years filled britain with plots     and rebellion the literature of the age was at times dominated by     the interests of these contending factions      the two main parties were so well balanced that power shifted     easily from one to the other to overturn a tory or a whig cabinet     only a few votes were necessary and to influence such votes london     was flooded with pamphlets even before the great newspapers     appeared the press had become a mighty power in england and any     writer with a talent for argument or satire was almost certain to     be hired by party leaders addison steele defoe swiftmost of     the great writers of the age were on occasion the willing     servants of the whigs or tories so the new politician replaced the     old nobleman as a patron of letters      sidenote social life      another feature of the age was the rapid development of social     life in earlier ages the typical englishman had lived much by     himself his home was his castle and in it he developed his     intense individualism  but in the first half of the eighteenth     century some three thousand public coffeehouses and a large number     of private clubs appeared in london alone and the sociability of     which these clubs were an expression was typical of all english     cities meanwhile country life was in sore need of refinement      the influence of this social life on literature was inevitable     nearly all writers frequented the coffeehouses and matters     discussed there became subjects of literature hence the enormous     amount of eighteenthcentury writing devoted to transient affairs     to politics fashions gossip moreover as the club leaders set     the fashion in manners or dress in the correct way of taking snuff     or of wearing wigs and ruffles so the literary leaders emphasized     formality or correctness of style and to write prose like addison     or verse like pope became the ambition of aspiring young authors      there are certain books of the period seldom studied amongst its     masterpieces which are the best possible expression of its thought     and manners the letters of lord chesterfield for example     especially those written to his son are more significant and more     readable than anything produced by johnson even better are the     memoirs of horace walpole and his gossipy letters of which     thackeray wrote          fiddles sing all through them wax lights fine dresses         fine jokes fine plate fine equipages glitter and sparkle         never was such a brilliant smirking vanity fair as that         through which he leads us      sidenote spread of empire      two other significant features of the age were the large part     played by england in continental wars and the rapid expansion of     the british empire these continental wars which have ever since     influenced british policy seem to have originated aside from the     important matter of selfinterest in a double motive to prevent     any one nation from gaining overwhelming superiority by force of     arms and to save the smaller buffer states from being absorbed     by their powerful neighbors thus the war of the spanish succession     1711 prevented the union of the french and spanish monarchies     and preserved the smaller states of holland and germany as addison     then wrote at least half truthfully        t is britains care to watch oer europes fate       and hold in balance each contending state       to threaten bold presumptuous kings with war       and answer her afflicted neighbors prayer 1      footnote 1 from addisons address to liberty in his poetical     letter to lord halifax      the expansion of the empire on the whole the most marvelous     feature of english history received a tremendous impetus in this     age when india australia and the greater part of north america     were added to the british dominions and when captain cook opened     the way for a belt of colonies around the whole world      the influence of the lastnamed movement hardly appears in the     books which we ordinarily read as typical of the age there are     other books however which one may well read for his own     unhampered enjoyment such expansive books as hawkesworths     voyages 1773 corresponding to hakluyts famous record of     elizabethan exploration and especially the voyages of captain     cook footnote the first of cooks fateful voyages appears in     hawkesworths collection the second was recorded by cook himself     1777 and the third by cook and captain king 1784 see synge     captain cooks voyages around the world london 1897     which take us from the drawingroom chatter of politics or fashion     or criticism into a world of adventure and great achievement in     such works which make no profession of literary style we feel the     lure of the sea and of lands beyond the horizon which is as the     mighty background of english literature from anglosaxon times to     the present day  it is difficult to summarize the literature of this age or to group such antagonistic writers as swift and addison pope and burns defoe and johnson goldsmith and fielding with any fine discrimination it is simply for convenience therefore that we study eighteenthcentury writings in three main divisions the reign of socalled classicism the revival of romantic poetry and the beginnings of the modern novel as a whole it is an age of prose rather than of poetry and in this respect it differs from all preceding ages of english literature                                      eighteenthcentury classicism  the above title is an unfortunate one but since it is widely used we must try to understand it as best we can yet when one begins to define classicism one is reminded of that old bore polonius who tells how hamlet is affected                        your noble son is mad   mad call i it for to define true madness   what ist but to be nothing else but mad  in our literature the word classic was probably first used in connection with the writers of greece and rome and any english work which showed the influence of such writers was said to have a classic style if we seek to the root of the word we shall find that it refers to the classici that is to the highest of the classes into which the census divided the roman people hence the proper use of classic to designate the writings that have won first rank in any nation as goethe said everything that is good in literature is classical  sidenote classic and pseudoclassic  gradually however the word classic came to have a different meaning a meaning now expressed by the word formal in the elizabethan age as we have seen critics insisted that english plays should conform to the rules or unities of the greek drama and plays written according to such rules were called classic again in the eighteenth century english poets took to studying ancient authors especially horace to find out how poetry should be written having discovered as they thought the rules of composition they insisted on following such rules rather than individual genius or inspiration it is largely because of this adherence to rules this slavery to a fashion of the time that so much of eighteenthcentury verse seems cold and artificial a thing made to order rather than the natural expression of human feeling the writers themselves were well satisfied with their formality however and called their own the classic or augustan age of english letters footnote though the eighteenth century was dominated by this formal spirit it had like every other age its classic and romantic movements the work of gray burns and other romantic poets will be considered later                                       alexander pope 16881744  it was in 1819 that a controversy arose over the question was pope a poet to have asked that in 1719 would have indicated that the questioner was ignorant to have asked it  a half century later might have raised a doubt as to his sanity for by that time pope was acclaimed as a master by the great majority of poets in england and america we judge now looking at him in perspective and comparing him with chaucer or burns that he was not a great poet but simply the kind of poet that the age demanded he belongs to eighteenthcentury london exclusively and herein he differs from the master poets who are at home in all places and expressive of all time  illustration alexander pope      life pope is an interesting but not a lovable figure against the     petty details of his life we should place as a background these     amazing achievements that this poor cripple weak of body and     spiteful of mind was the supreme literary figure of his age that     he demonstrated how an english poet could live by his pen instead     of depending on patrons that he won greater fame and fortune than     shakespeare or milton received from their contemporaries that he     dominated the fashion of english poetry during his lifetime and     for many years after his death      sidenote the writer      such are the important facts of popes career for the rest he was     born in london in the year of the revolution 1688 soon after     that date his father having gained a modest fortune in the linen     business retired to binfield on the fringe of windsor forest     there pope passed his boyhood studying a little under private     tutors forming a pleasurable acquaintance with latin and greek     poets from fourteen to twenty he tells us he read for amusement     but from twenty to twentyseven he read for improvement and     instruction the most significant traits of these early years were     his determination to be a poet and his talent for imitating any     writer who pleased him dryden was his first master from whom he     inherited the couplet then he imitated the french critic boileau     and the roman poet horace by the time he was twenty four the     publication of his essay on criticism and the rape of the     lock had made him the foremost poet of england by his     translation of homer he made a fortune with which he bought a     villa at twickenham there he lived in the pale sunshine of     literary success and there he quarreled with every writer who     failed to appreciate his verses his jealousy overflowing at last     in the dunciad iliad of dunces a witty but venomous     lampoon in which he took revenge on all who had angered him      illustration twickenham parish church where pope was buried     pope lived at twickenham for nearly thirty years      sidenote the man      next to his desire for glory and revenge pope loved to be     considered a man of high character a teacher of moral philosophy     his ethical teaching appears in his moral epistles his     desire for a good reputation is written large in his letters which     he secretly printed and then alleged that they had been made     public against his wish these letters might impress us as the     utterances of a man of noble ideals magnanimous with his friends     patient with his enemies until we reflect that they were published     by the author for the purpose of giving precisely that impression      another side of popes nature is revealed in this that to some of     his friends to swift and bolingbroke for example he showed     gratitude and that to his parents he was ever a dutiful son he     came perhaps as near as he could to a real rather than an     artificial sentiment when he wrote of his old mother        me let the tender office long engage       to rock the cradle of reposing age  works of pope popes first important work an essay on criticism 1711 is an echo of the rules which horace had formulated in his ars poetica more than seventeen centuries before pope was born the french critic boileau made an alleged improvement of horace in his lart poétique and pope imitated both writers with his rimed essay in which he attempted to sum up the rules by which poetry should be judged and he did it while still under the age of twentyfive so brilliantly that his characterization of the critic is unmatched in our literature a few selections will serve to show the character of the work    first follow nature and your judgment frame   by her just standard which is still the same   unerring nature still divinely bright   one clear unchanged and universal light   life force and beauty must to all impart   at once the source and end and test of art    poets like painters thus unskilled to trace   the naked nature and the living grace   with gold and jewels cover every part   and hide with ornaments their want of art   true wit is nature to advantage dressed   what oft was thought but neer so well expressed    expression is the dress of thought and still   appears more decent as more suitable  sidenote rape of the lock  popes next important poem the rape of the lock 1712 is his most original and readable work the occasion of the poem was that a fop stole a lock of hair from a young lady and the theft plunged two families into a quarrel which was taken up by the fashionable set of london pope made a mockheroic poem on the subject in which he satirized the fads and fashions of queen annes age ordinarily popes fancy is of small range and proceeds jerkily like the flight of a woodpecker from couplet to couplet but here he attempts to soar like the eagle he introduces dainty aerial creatures gnomes sprites sylphs to combat for the belles and fops in their trivial concerns and herein we see a clever burlesque of the old epic poems in which gods or goddesses entered into the serious affairs of mortals the craftsmanship of the poem is above praise it is not only a neatly pointed satire on eighteenthcentury fashions but is one of the most graceful works in english verse  sidenote essay of man  an excellent supplement to the rape of the lock which pictures the superficial elegance of the age is an essay on man which reflects its philosophy that philosophy under the general name of deism had fancied to abolish the church and all revealed religion and had set up a newold standard of natural faith and morals of this philosophy pope had small knowledge but he was well acquainted with the discredited bolingbroke his guide philosopher and friend who was a fluent exponent of the new doctrine and from bolingbroke came the general scheme of the essay on man  the poem appears in the form of four epistles dealing with mans place in the universe with his moral nature with social and political ethics and with the problem of happiness these were discussed from a commonsense viewpoint and with feet always on solid earth as pope declares    know then thyself presume not god to scan   the proper study of mankind is man   created half to rise and half to fall   great lord of all things yet a prey to all   sole judge of truth in endless error hurled   the glory jest and riddle of the world  throughout the poem these two doctrines of deism are kept in sight that there is a god a mystery who dwells apart from the world and that man ought to be contented even happy in his ignorance of matters beyond his horizon    all nature is but art unknown to thee   all chance direction which thou canst not see   all discord harmony not understood   all partial evil universal good   and spite of pride in erring reasons spite   one truth is clear whatever is is right  the result is rubbish so far as philosophy is concerned but in the heap of incongruous statements which pope brings together are a large number of quotable lines such as    honor and shame from no condition rise   act well your part there all the honor lies  it is because of such lines the care with which the whole poem is polished and the occasional appearance of real beauty such as the passage beginning lo the poor indian that the essay on man occupies such a high place in eighteenthcentury literature  sidenote the quality of pope  it is hardly necessary to examine other works of pope since the poems already named give us the full measure of his strength and weakness his talent is to formulate rules of poetry to satirize fashionable society to make brilliant epigrams in faultless couplets his failure to move or even to interest us greatly is due to his secondhand philosophy his inability to feel or express emotion his artificial life apart from nature and humanity when we read chaucer or shakespeare we have the impression that they would have been at home in any age or place since they deal with human interests that are the same yesterday today and forever but we can hardly imagine pope feeling at ease anywhere save in his own set and in his own generation he is the poet of one period which set great store by formality and in that period alone he is supreme                                       jonathan swift 16671745  in the history of literature swift occupies a large place as the most powerful of english satirists that is writers who search out the faults of society in order to hold them up to ridicule to most readers however he is known as the author of gullivers travels a book which young people still read with pleasure as they read robinson crusoe or any other story of adventure in the fate of that book which was intended to scourge humanity but which has become a source of innocent entertainment is a commentary on the colossal failure of swifts ambition  illustration jonathan swift      life little need be recorded of swifts life beyond the few facts     which help us to understand his satires he was born in dublin of     english parents and was so bantered by fortune that he was     compelled to spend the greater part of his life in ireland a     country which he detested he was very poor very proud and even     in youth he railed at a mocking fate which compelled him to accept     aid from others for his education he was dependent on a relative     who helped him grudgingly after leaving trinity college dublin     the only employment he could find was with another relative sir     william temple a retired statesman who hired swift as a secretary     and treated him as a servant galled by his position and by his     feeling of superiority for he was a man of physical and mental     power who longed to be a master of great affairs he took orders     in the anglican church but the only appointment he could obtain     was in a village buried as he said in a forsaken district of     ireland there his bitterness overflowed in a tale of a tub     and a few pamphlets of such satiric power that certain political     leaders recognized swifts value and summoned him to their     assistance      illustration trinity college dublin      sidenote swift in london      to understand his success in london one must remember the times     politics were rampant the city was the battleground of whigs and     tories whose best weapon was the printed pamphlet that justified     one party by heaping abuse or ridicule on the other swift was a     master of satire and he was soon the most feared author in     england he seems to have had no fixed principles for he was ready     to join the tories when that party came into power and to turn his     literary cannon on the whigs whom he had recently supported in     truth he despised both parties his chief object was to win for     himself the masterful position in church or state for which he     believed his talents had fitted him      for several years swift was the literary champion of the victorious     tories then when his keen eye detected signs of tottering in the     party he asked for his reward he obtained not the great     bishopric which he expected but an appointment as dean of st     patricks cathedral in dublin small and bitter fruit this seemed     to swift after his years of service but even so it was given     grudgingly footnote swifts pride and arrogance with his     official superiors worked against him also he had published a     tale of a tub a coarse satire against the churches which     scandalized the queen and her ministers who could have given him     preferment thackeray says i think the bishops who advised queen     anne not to appoint the author of the tale of a tub to a     bishopric gave perfectly good advice      sidenote life in ireland      when the tories went out of power swifts political occupation was     gone the last thirty years of his life were spent largely in     dublin there in a living grave as he regarded it the scorn which     he had hitherto felt for individuals or institutions widened until     it included humanity such is the meaning of his gullivers     travels his only pleasure during these years was to expose the     gullibility of men and a hundred good stories are current of his     practical jokessuch as his getting rid of a crowd which had     gathered to watch an eclipse by sending a solemn messenger to     announce that by the deans orders the eclipse was postponed till     the next day a brain disease fastened upon him gradually and his     last years were passed in a state of alternate stupor or madness     from which death was a blessed deliverance  works of swift the poems of swift though they show undoubted power every smallest thing he wrote bears that stamp may be passed over with the comment of his relative dryden who wrote cousin swift you will never be a poet the criticism was right but thereafter swift jeered at drydens poetry we may pass over also the battle of the books the drapiers letters and a score more of satires and lampoons of all these minor works the bickerstaff papers which record swifts practical joke on the astrologers are most amusing footnote almanacs were at that time published by pretender astrologers who read fortunes or made predictions from the stars against the most famous of these quacks partridge by name swift leveled his predictions for the year 1708 by isaac bickerstaff among the predictions of coming events was this trifle that partridge was doomed to die on march 29 following about eleven oclock at night of a raging fever on march 30 appeared in the newspapers a letter giving the details of partridges death and then a pamphlet called an elegy of mr partridge presently partridge who could not see the joke made london laugh by his frantic attempts to prove that he was alive then appeared an elaborate vindication of isaac bickerstaff which proved by the infallible stars that partridge was dead and that the astrologer now in his place was an impostor this joke was copied twentyfive years later by franklin in his poor richards almanac  sidenote gullivers travels  swifts fame now rests largely upon his gullivers travels which appeared in 1726 under the title travels into several remote nations of the world by lemuel gulliver first a surgeon and then a captain of several ships in the first voyage we are taken to lilliput a country inhabited by human beings about six inches tall with minds in proportion the capers of these midgets are a satire on human society as seen through swifts scornful eyes in the second voyage we go to brobdingnag where the people are of gigantic stature and by contrast we are reminded of the petty human insects whom gulliver represents the third voyage to the island of laputa is a burlesque of the scientists and philosophers of swifts day the fourth leads to the land of the houyhnhnms where intelligent horses are the ruling creatures and humanity is represented by the yahoos a horribly degraded race having the forms of men and the bestial habits of monkeys  such is the ferocious satire on the elegant society of queen annes day fortunately for our peace of mind we can read the book for its grim humor and adventurous action as we read any other good story indeed it surprises most readers of gulliver to be told that the work was intended to wreck our faith in humanity  sidenote quality of swift  in all his satires swifts power lies in his prose stylea convincing style clear graphic straightforwardand in his marvelous ability to make every scene however distant or grotesque as natural as life itself as emerson said he describes his characters as if for the police his weakness is twofold he has a fondness for coarse or malodorous references and he is so beclouded in his own soul that he cannot see his fellows in a true light in one of his early works he announced the purpose of all his writing    my hate whose lash just heaven has long decreed   shall on a day make sin and folly bleed  that was written at twentysix before he took orders in the church as a theological student it was certainly impressed upon the young man that heaven keeps its own prerogatives and that sin and folly have never been effectually reformed by lashing but swift had a scorn of all judgment except his own as the eyes of fishes are so arranged that they see only their prey and their enemies so swift had eyes only for the vices of men and for the lash that scourges them when he wrote therefore he was not an observer or even a judge he was a criminal lawyer prosecuting humanity on the charge of being a sham a tendency to insanity may possibly account both for his spleen against others and for the selftortures which made him as archbishop king said the most unhappy man on earth  sidenote journal to stella  there is one oasis in the bitter desert of swifts writings namely his journal to stella while in the employ of temple he was the daily companion of a young girl esther johnson who was an inmate of the same household her love for swift was pure and constant wherever he went she followed and lived near him bringing a ray of sunshine into his life in a spirit which reminds us of the sublime expression of another woman for whither thou goest i will go and where thou lodgest i will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy god my god she was probably married to swift but his pride kept him from openly acknowledging the union while he was at london he wrote a private journal for esther stella in which he recorded his impressions of the men and women he met and of the political battles in which he took part that journal filled with strange abbreviations to which only he and stella had the key can hardly be called literature but it is of profound interest it gives us glimpses of a woman who chose to live in the shadow it shows the better side of swifts nature in contrast with his arrogance toward men and his brutal treatment of women and finally it often takes us behind the scenes of a stage on which was played a mixed comedy of politics and society                                       joseph addison 16721719  in addison we have a pleasant reflection of the new social life of england select almost any feature of that life and you shall find some account of it in the papers of addison its party politics in his whig examiner its grand tour as part of a gentlemans education in his remarks on italy its adventure on foreign soil in such poems as the campaign its new drama of decency in his cato its classic delusions in his account of the greatest english poets its frills fashions and similar matters in his spectator essays he tried almost every type of literature from hymns to librettos and in each he succeeded well enough to be loudly applauded in his own day he was accounted a master poet but now he is remembered as a writer of prose essays  illustration joseph addison      life addisons career offers an interesting contrast to that of     swift who lived in the same age he was the son of an english     clergyman settled in the deanery of lichfield and his early     training left upon him the stamp of good taste and good breeding     in school he was always the model boy in oxford he wrote latin     verses on safe subjects in the approved fashion in politics he     was content to oil the machine as he found it in society he was     shy and silent though naturally a brilliant talker because he     feared to make some slip which might mar his prospects or the     dignity of his position      a very discreet man was addison and the only failure he made of     discretion was when he married the dowager countess of warwick     went to live in her elegant holland house and lived unhappily ever     afterwards the last is a mere formal expression addison had not     depth enough to be really unhappy from the cold comfort of the     dowagers palace he would slip off to his club or to wills coffee     house there with a pipe and a bottle he would loosen his     eloquent tongue and proceed to make discreetly merry with a few     old friends      illustration magdalen college oxford      his characteristic quality appears in the literary work which     followed his latin verses he began with a flattering address to     dryden which pleased the old poet and brought addison to the     attention of literary celebrities his next effort was the peace     of ryswick which flattered king williams statesmen and brought     the author a chance to serve the whig party also it brought a     pension with a suggestion that addison should travel abroad and     learn french and diplomacy which he did to his great content for     the space of three years      the death of the king brought addison back to england his pension     stopped and for a time he lived poorly in a garret as one may     read in thackerays henry esmond then came news of an     english victory on the continent marlboroughs victory at     blenheim and the whigs wanted to make political capital out of     the event addison was hunted up and engaged to write a poem he     responded with the campaign which made him famous patriots and     politicians ascribed to the poem undying glory and their judgment     was accepted by fashionable folk of london to read it now is to     meet a formal uninspired production containing a few stock     quotations and incidentally a sad commentary on the union of     whiggery and poetry      sidenote his path of roses      from that moment addisons success was assured he was given     various offices of increasing importance he entered parliament he     wrote a classic tragedy cato which took london by storm     his friend steele had carefully packed the house for the first     performance his essays in the spectator were discussed in     every fashionable club or drawingroom he married a rich countess     he was appointed secretary of state the path of politics which     others find so narrow and slippery was for addison a broad road     through pleasant gardens meanwhile swift who could not follow the     addisonian way of kindness and courtesy was eating bitter bread     and railing at humanity      after a brief experience as secretary of state finding that he     could not make the speeches expected of him addison retired on a     pension his unwavering allegiance to good form in all matters     appears even in his last remark see how a christian can die     that was in 1719 he had sought the easiest pleasantest way     through life and had found it thackeray who was in sympathy with     such a career summed it up in a glowing panegyric          a life prosperous and beautiful a calm death an immense         fame and affection afterwards for his happy and spotless         name  works of addison addisons great reputation was won chiefly by his poetry but with the exception of a few hymns simple and devout his poetical works no longer appeal to us he was not a poet but a versemaker his classic tragedy cato for example which met with such amazing success in london that it was taken over to the continent where it was acclaimed a masterpiece of regularity and elegance has some good passages but one who reads the context is apt to find the elegant lines running together somewhat drowsily nor need that reflect on our taste or intelligence even the cultured greeks as if in anticipation of classic poems built two adjoining temples one dedicated to the muses and the other to sleep  sidenote the essays  the essays of addison give us the full measure of his literary talent in his verse as in his political works he seems to be speaking to strangers he is on guard over his dignity as a poet as secretary of state as husband of a countess but in his essays we meet the man at his ease fluent witty lighthearted but not frivolousjust as he talked to his friends in wills coffeehouse the conversational quality of these essays has influenced all subsequent works of the same typea type hard to define but which leaves the impression of pleasant talk about a subject as distinct from any learned discussion  the essays cover a wide range fashions dress manners character sketches letters of travel ghost stories satires on common vices weekend sermons on moral subjects they are never profound but they are always pleasant and their graceful style made such a lasting impression that half a century later dr johnson summed up a general judgment when he said      whoever wishes to attain an english style familiar but not     coarse and elegant but not ostentatious must give his days and     nights to the volumes of addison  addison and steele of these two associates richard steele 16721729 had the more original mind and his writings reveal a warm human sympathy that is lacking in the work of his more famous contemporary but while addison cultivated his one talent of writing steele was like defoe in that he always had some new project in his head and some old debt urging him to put the project into immediate execution he was in turn poet political pamphleteer soldier dramatist member of parliament publisher manager of a theater following each occupation eagerly for a brief season then abandoning it cheerfully for anothermuch like a boy picking blueberries in a good place who moves on and on to find a better bush eats his berries on the way and comes home at last with an empty pail  illustration sir richard steele from the engraving by freeman after original by j richardson  sidenote the tatler and the spectator  while holding the political office of gazetteer one who had a monopoly of official news the idea came to steele of publishing a literary magazine the inventive defoe had already issued the review 1704 but that had a political origin with the first number of the tatler 1709 the modern magazine made its bow to the public this little sheet published thrice a week and sold at a penny a copy contained more or less politics to be sure but the fact that it reflected the gossip of coffeehouses made it instantly popular after less than two years of triumph steele lost his official position and the tatler was discontinued the idea remained however and a few months later appeared the spectator 1711 a daily magazine which eschewed politics and devoted itself to essays reviews letters criticismsin short to polite literature addison who had been a contributor to the tatler entered heartily into the new venture which had a brief but glorious career he became known as mr spectator and the famous spectator essays are still commonly attributed to him though in truth steele furnished a large part of them footnote of the tatler essays addison contributed 42 steele about 180 and some 36 were the work of the two authors in collaboration of the spectator essays addison furnished 274 steele 236 and about 45 were the work of other writers in some of the best essays sir roger de coverley for example the two men worked together steele is supposed to have furnished the original ideas the humor and overflowing kindness of such essays while the work of polishing and perfecting the style fell to the more skillful addison  sidenote addisonian style  because of their cultivated prose style steele and addison were long regarded as models and we are still influenced by them in the direction of clearness and grace of expression how wide their influence extended may be seen in american literature hardly had the spectator appeared when it crossed the atlantic and began to dominate our english style on both sides of the ocean franklin in boston studied it by night in order to imitate it in the essay which he slipped under the printinghouse door next morning and boyd in virginia reflects its influence in his charming journal of exploration half a century later the hartford wits were writing clever sketches that seemed like the work of a new spectator another half century and irving the greatest master of english prose in his day was still writing in the addisonian manner and regretting as he wrote that the leisurely style showed signs in a bustling age of becoming a little oldfashioned                                       dr johnson and his circle  since caxton established the kings english as a literary language our prose style has often followed the changing fashion of london thus lyly made it fantastic dryden simplified it addison gave it grace and each leader set a fashion which was followed by a host of young writers hardly had the addisonian style crossed the atlantic to be the model for american writers for a century when london acclaimed a new prose fashiona ponderous grandiloquent fashion characterized by mouthfilling words antithetical sentences rounded periods sonorous commonplaceswhich was eagerly adopted by orators and historians especially the man who did more than any other to set this new oratorical fashion in motion was the same dr samuel johnson who advised young writers to study addison as a model and that was only one of his amusing inconsistencies  johnson was a man of power who won a commanding place in english letters by his hard work and his downright sincerity he won his name of the great lexicographer by his dictionary which we no longer consult but which we remember as the first attempt at a complete english lexicon if one asks what else he wrote with the idea of going to the library and getting a book for pleasure the answer must be that johnsons voluminous works are now as dead as his dictionary one student of literature may be interested in such a melancholy poem as the vanity of human wishes another will be entertained by the anecdotes or blunt criticisms of the lives of the poets a third may be uplifted by the rambler essays which are well called majestically moral productions but we shall content ourselves here by recording johnsons own refreshing criticism of certain ancient authors that it is idle to criticize what nobody reads perhaps the best thing he wrote was a minor work which he did not know would ever be published this was his manly letter to lord chesterfield a nobleman who had treated johnson with discourtesy when the poor author was making a heroic struggle but who offered his patronage when the dictionary was announced as an epochmaking work in his noble refusal of all extraneous help johnson unconsciously voiced literatures declaration of independence that henceforth a book must stand or fall on its own merits and that the day of the literary patron was gone forever  illustration dr samuel johnson from the portrait by sir joshua reynolds      life the story of johnsons life 17091784 has been so well told     that one is loath to attempt a summary of it we note therefore a     few plain facts that he was the son of a poor bookseller that     despite poverty and disease he obtained his classic education that     at twentysix he came to london and after an experience with     patrons rebelled against them that he did every kind of hackwork     to earn his bread honestly living in the very cellar of grub     street where he was often cold and more often hungry that after     nearly thirty years of labor his services to literature were     rewarded by a pension which he shared with the poor that he then     formed the literary club including reynolds pitt gibbon     goldsmith burke and almost every other prominent man in london     and indulged nightly in his famous conversations which were     either monologues or knockdown arguments and that in his old age     he was regarded as the king of letters the oracle of literary     taste in england        illustration dr johnsons house bolt court fleet st       from the print by charles j smith      such is the bare outline of johnsons career to his character his     rough exterior and his kind heart his vast learning and his tory     prejudices his piety his melancholy his virtues his frailty     his mass of genuine manhood only a volume could do justice     happily that volume is at hand it is boswells life of     johnson a famous book that deserves its fame  boswells johnson boswell was an inquisitive barrister who came from edinburgh to london and thrust himself into the company of great men to johnson then at the summit of his fame bozzy was devotion itself following his master about by day or night refusing to be rebuffed jotting down notes of what he saw and heard after johnsons death he gathered these notes together and after seven years of labor produced his incomparable life of johnson 1791  the greatness of boswells work may be traced to two causes first he had a great subject the story of any human life is interesting if truthfully told and johnsons heroic life of labor and pain and reward was passed in a capital city among famous men at a time which witnessed the rapid expansion of a mighty empire second boswell was as faithful as a man could be to his subject for whom he had such admiration that even the dictators frailties seemed more impressive than the virtues of ordinary humanity so boswell concealed nothing and felt no necessity to distribute either praise or blame he portrayed a man just as that man was recorded the word just as the word was spoken and facing the man we may see his enraptured audienceat a distance indeed but marvelously clear as when we look through the larger end of a field glass at a landscape dominated by a mountain one who reads this matchless biography will know johnson better than he knows his own neighbor he will gain moreover a better understanding of humanity to reflect which clearly and truthfully is the prime object of all good literature  illustration james boswell  edmund burke 17291797 this brilliant irishman came up to london as a young man of twentyone within a few yearssuch was his character his education his geniushe had won a reputation among old statesmen as a political philosopher then he entered parliament where for twenty years the house listened with growing amazement to his rhythmic periods and he was acclaimed the most eloquent of orators  among burkes numerous works those on america india and france are deservedly the most famous of his orations on american subjects a student of literature or history may profitably read on taxation 1774 and on conciliation 1775 in which burke presents the whig argument in favor of a liberal colonial policy the tory view of the same question was bluntly presented by johnson in his essay taxation no tyranny while like a reverberation from america powerful enough to carry across the atlantic came thomas paines common sense which was a ringing plea for colonial independence  illustration edmund burke from the print by john jones after romney  of burkes works pertaining to india the nabob of arcots debts 1785 and the impeachment of warren hastings 1786 are interesting to those who can enjoy a long flight of sustained eloquence here again burke presents the liberal the humane view of what was then largely a political question but in his reflections on the french revolution 1790 he goes over to the tories thunders against the revolutionists or their english sympathizers and exalts the undying glories of the british constitution the reflections is the most brilliant of all burkes works and is admired for its superb rhetorical style  sidenote burkes method  to examine any of these works is to discover the authors characteristic method first his framework or argument is carefully constructed so as to appeal to reason then this framework is buried out of sight and memory by a mass of description digression emotional appeal allusions illustrative matter from the authors wide reading or from his prolific imagination note this passage from the french revolution      it is now sixteen or seventeen years since i saw the queen of     france then the dauphiness at versailles and surely never     lighted on this orb which she hardly seemed to touch a more     delightful vision i saw her just above the horizon decorating and     cheering the elevated sphere she had just begun to move in     glittering like the morning star full of life and splendor and     joy oh what a revolution and what a heart must i have to     contemplate without emotion that elevation and that fall little     did i dream when she added titles of veneration to those of     distant enthusiastic respectful love that she should ever be     obliged to carry the sharp antidote against disgrace concealed in     that bosom little did i dream that i should have lived to see such     disasters fallen upon her in a nation of gallant men in a nation     of men of honour and of cavaliers i thought ten thousand swords     must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look that     threatened her with insult but the age of chivalry is gone that     of sophisters economists and calculators has succeeded and the     glory of europe is extinguished for ever never never more shall     we behold that generous loyalty to rank and sex that proud     submission that dignified obedience that subordination of the     heart which kept alive even in servitude itself the spirit of an     exalted freedom the unbought grace of life the cheap defence of     nations the nurse of manly sentiment and heroic enterprise is     gone it is gone that sensibility of principle that chastity of     honour which felt a stain like a wound which inspired courage     whilst it mitigated ferocity which ennobled whatever it touched     and under which vice itself lost half its evil by losing all its     grossness  that is finely expressed but it has no bearing on the political matter in question namely whether the sympathy of england should be extended to the french revolutionists in their struggle for liberty this irrelevancy of burke suggests our first criticism that he is always eloquent and usually right but he is seldom convincing and his eloquence is a hindrance rather than a help to his main purpose so we are not surprised to hear that his eloquent speech on conciliation emptied the benches or that after his supreme effort in the impeachment of hastingsan effort so tremendously dramatic that spectators sobbed screamed were carried out in fitsthe object of all this invective was acquitted by his judges reading the works now they seem to us praiseworthy not for their sustained eloquence which is wearisome but for the brilliancy of certain detached passages which catch the eye like sparkling raindrops after a drenching shower it was the splendor of such passages their vivid imagery and harmonious rhythm which led matthew arnold to assert that burke was the greatest master of prose style in our literature anybody can make such an assertion nobody can prove or disprove it  the historians perhaps it was the rapid expansion of the empire in the latter part of the eighteenth century which aroused such interest in historical subjects that works of history were then more eagerly welcomed than poetry or fiction gibbon says in his memoirs that in his day history was the most popular species of composition it was also the best rewarded for while johnson the most renowned author of his time wrote a romance rasselas hoping to sell it for enough to pay for his mothers funeral robertson easily disposed of his history of the emperor charles v for £4500 and there were others who were even better paid for popular histories the very titles of which are now forgotten  sidenote gibbon  of all the historical works of the age and their name was legion only one survives with something of its original vitality standing the double test of time and scholarship this is the decline and fall of the roman empire 1776 a work which remained famous for a century and which still has its admiring readers it was written by edward gibbon 17371794 who belonged to the literary club that gathered about johnson and who cultivated his style he tells us first by adopting the dictators rounded periods and then practicing them till they moved to flutes and hautboys  the scope of gibbons work is enormous it begins with the emperor trajan ad 98 and carries us through the convulsions of a dying civilization the descent of the barbarians on rome the spread of christianity the crusades the rise of mohammedanismthrough all the confused history of thirteen centuries ending with the capture of constantinople by the turks in 1453 the mind that could grasp such vast and chaotic materials arrange them in orderly sequence and resent them as in a gorgeous panorama moves us to wonder to be sure there are many things to criticize in gibbons masterpiecethe authors love of mere pageants his materialism his inability to understand religious movements or even religious motives his lifeless figures which move as if by mechanical springsbut one who reads the decline and fall may be too much impressed by the evidences of scholarship of vast labor of genius even to linger over faults it is a monumental work most interesting to those who admire monuments and its style is the perfection of that oratorical johnsonese style which was popular in england in 1776 and which half a century later found its best american mouthpiece in daniel webster the influence of gibbon may still be seen in the orators and historians who lacking the charm of simplicity clothe even their platitudes in highsounding phrases  illustration edward gibbon from an enamel by h bone ra after sir joshua reynolds                                       the revival of romantic poetry  every age has had its romantic poetsthat is poets who sing the dreams and ideals of life and whose songs seem to be written naturally spontaneously as from a full heart footnote for specific examples of formal and romantic poetry see the comparison between addison and wordsworth below under natural vs formal poetry chapter viibut in the eighteenth century they were completely overshadowed by formal versifiers who made poetry by rule at that time the imaginative verse which had delighted an earlier age was regarded much as we now regard an old beaver hat shakespeare and milton were neglected spenser was but a name chaucer was clean forgotten if a poet aspired to fame he imitated the couplets of dryden or pope who as cowper said    made poetry a mere mechanic art   and every warbler has his tune by heart  illustration thomas gray from a portrait by benjamin wilson in the possession of john murray  among those who made vigorous protest against the precise and dreary formalism of the age were collins and gray whose names are commonly associated in poetry as are the names of addison and steele in prose they had the same tastes the same gentle melancholy the same freedom from the bondage of literary fashion of the two william collins 17211759 was perhaps the more gifted poet his exquisite ode to evening is without a rival in its own field and his brief elegy beginning how sleep the brave is a worthy commemoration of a soldiers death and a nations gratitude it has says andrew lang the magic of an elder day and of all time  thomas gray 17161771 is more widely known than his fellow poet largely because of one fortunate poem which returned to mens bosoms as if sure of its place and welcome this is the elegy written in a country churchyard 1750 which has been translated into all civilized tongues and which is known loved quoted wherever english is spoken  illustration stoke poges churchyard showing part of the church and grays tomb  sidenote grays elegy  to criticize this favorite of a million readers seems almost ruthless as if one were pulling a flower to pieces for the sake of giving it a botanical name a pleasanter task is to explain if one can the immense popularity of the elegy the theme is of profound interest to every man who reveres the last resting place of his parents to the nation which cherishes every monument of its founders and even to primitive peoples like the indians who refuse to leave the place where their fathers are buried and who make the grave a symbol of patriotism with this great theme our poet is in perfect sympathy his attitude is simple and reverent he treads softly as if on holy ground the natural setting or atmosphere of his poem the peace of evening falling on the old churchyard at stoke poges the curfew bell the cessation of daily toil the hush which falls upon the twilight landscape like a summons to prayerall this is exactly as it should be finally grays craftsmanship his choice of words his simple figures his careful fitting of every line to its place and context is as near perfection as human skill could make it  other poems of gray which make his little book precious are the four odes to spring on a distant prospect of eton college the progress of poesy and the bard the last named being a description of the dramatic end of an old welsh minstrel who chants a wild prophecy as he goes to his death these romantic odes together with certain translations which gray made from norse mythology mark the end of classic domination in english poetry                                       oliver goldsmith 17281774  most versatile of eighteenthcentury writers was poor noll a most improvident kind of man in all worldly ways but so skillful with his pen that johnson wrote a sincere epitaph to the effect that goldsmith attempted every form of literature and adorned everything which he attempted the form of his verse suggests the formal school and his polished couplets rival those of pope but there the resemblance ceases in his tenderness and humor in his homely subjects and the warm human sympathy with which he describes them goldsmith belongs to the new romantic school of poetry      life the life of goldsmith has inspired many pens but the     subject far from being exhausted is still awaiting the right     biographer the poets youthful escapades in the irish country his     classical education at trinity college dublin and his vagabond     studies among gypsies and peddlers his childish attempts at     various professions his wanderings over europe his shifts and     makeshifts to earn a living in london his tilts with johnson at     the literary club his love of gorgeous raiment his indiscriminate     charity his poverty his simplicity his success in the art of     writing and his total failure in the art of livingsuch     kaleidoscopic elements make a brief biography impossible the     character of the man appears in a single incident      landing one day on the continent with a flute a spare shirt and a     guinea as his sole outward possessions the guinea went for a feast     and a game of cards at the nearest inn and the shirt to the first     beggar that asked for it there remained only the flute and with     that goldsmith fared forth confidently like the gleeman of old     with his harp delighted at seeing the world utterly forgetful of     the fact that he had crossed the channel in search of a medical     education      that aimless happygolucky journey was typical of goldsmiths     whole life of fortyodd years those who knew him loved but     despaired of him when he passed away 1774 johnson summed up the     feeling of the english literary world in the sentence he was a     very great man let not his frailties be remembered  illustration oliver goldsmith after the portrait by sir joshua reynolds  goldsmiths prose and verse among the forgotten works of goldsmith we note with interest several that he wrote for children a fanciful history of england an entertaining but most unreliable animated nature and probably also the tale of little goody twoshoes these were written as were all his other works to satisfy the demands of his landlady or to pay an old debt or to buy a new cloaka plumcolored velvet cloak wherewith to appear at the opera or to dazzle the literary club from among his works we select four as illustrative of goldsmiths versatility  the citizen of the world a series of letters from an alleged chinese visitor invites comparison with the essays of addison or steele all three writers are satirical all have a high moral purpose all are masters of a graceful style but where the spectator touches the surface of life goldsmith often goes deeper and probes the very spirit of the eighteenth century here is a paragraph from the first letter in which the alleged visitor who has heard much of the wealth and culture of london sets down his first impressions      from these circumstances in their buildings and from the dismal     looks of the inhabitants i am induced to conclude that the nation     is actually poor and that like the persians they make a splendid     figure everywhere but at home the proverb of xixofou is that a     mans riches may be seen in his eyes if we judge of the english by     this rule there is not a poorer nation under the sun  illustration the cheshire cheese london showing dr johnsons favorite seat the tavern which still stands was the favorite haunt of both johnson and goldsmith  sidenote the deserted village  the deserted village 1770 is the best remembered of goldsmiths poems or perhaps one should say verses in deference to critics like matthew arnold who classify the work with popes essay on man as a rimed dissertation rather than a true poem  to compare the two works just mentioned is to discover how far goldsmith is from his formal model in popes essay we find common sense moral maxims and some alleged philosophy but no emotion no romance no men or women the village on the other hand is romantic even in desolation it awakens our interest our sympathy and it gives us two characters the parson and the schoolmaster who live in our memories with the best of chaucers creations moreover it makes the commonplace life of man ideal and beautiful and so appeals to readers of widely different tastes or nationalities of the many ambitious poems written in the eighteenth century the two most widely read aside from the songs of burns are goldsmiths village which portrays the life of simple country people and grays elegy which laments their death  illustration canonbury tower london goldsmith lived here when he wrote the vicar of wakefield  sidenote vicar of wakefield  goldsmiths one novel the vicar of wakefield 1766 has been well called the prince charming of our early works of fiction this work has a threefold distinction its style alone is enough to make it pleasant reading as a story it retains much of its original charm after a century and a half of proving by its moral purity it offered the best kind of rebuke to the vulgar tendency of the early english novel and influenced subsequent fiction in the direction of cleanness and decency  the story is that of a certain vicar or clergyman dr primrose and his family who pass through heavy trials and misfortunes these might crush or embitter an ordinary man but they only serve to make the vicars love for his children his trust in god his tenderness for humanity shine out more clearly like stars after a tempest mingled with these affecting trials are many droll situations which probably reflect something of the authors personal escapades for goldsmith was the son of a clergyman and brought himself and his father into his tale as a novel that is a reflection of human life in the form of a story it contains many weaknesses but despite its faults of moralizing and sentimentality the impression which the story leaves is one of sweetness and light swinburne says that of all novels he had seen rise and fall in three generations the vicar of wakefield alone had retained the same high level in the opinion of its readers  sidenote she stoops to conquer  another notable work is goldsmiths comedy she stoops to conquer the date of that comedy 1773 recalls the fact that though it has been played for nearly a century and a half during which a thousand popular plays have been forgotten it is still a prime favorite on the amateur stage perhaps the only other comedies of which the same can be said with approximate truth are the rivals 1775 and the school for scandal 1777 of richard brinsley sheridan  the plot of she stoops to conquer is said to have been suggested by one of goldsmiths queer adventures he arrived one day at a village riding a borrowed nag and with the air of a lordly traveler asked a stranger to direct him to the best house in the place the stranger misunderstood or else was a rare wag for he showed the way to the abode of a wealthy gentleman there goldsmith made himself at home ordered the servants about invited his host to share a bottle of winein short made a great fool of himself evidently the host was also a wag for he let the joke run on till the victim was ready to ride away footnote there is some doubt as to the source of goldsmiths plot it may have been suggested by an earlier french comedy by marivaux  from some such crazy escapade goldsmith made his comedy of manners a lively rollicking comedy of topsyturvy scenes all hinging upon the incident of mistaking a private house for a public inn we have called she stoops to conquer a comedy of eighteenthcentury manners but our continued interest in its absurdities would seem to indicate that it is a comedy of human nature in all ages                                       robert burns 17591796  burns is everywhere acclaimed the poet of scotland and for two good reasons because he reflects better than any other the emotions of the scottish people and because his book is a summary of the best verse of his native land practically all his songs such as bonnie boon and auld lang syne are late echoes of much older verses his more ambitious poems borrow their ideas their satire or sentiment their form even from ferguson allan ramsay and other poets all of whom aimed as scott aimed in lochinvar to preserve the work of unnamed minstrels whose lines had been repeated in highlands or lowlands for two centuries burns may be regarded therefore as a treasury of all that is best in scottish song his genius was to take this old material dear to the heart of the native and give it final expression  illustration robert burns after alexander nasmyth      life the life of burns is one to discourage a biographer who does     not relish the alternative of either concealing the facts or     apologizing for his subject we shall record here only a few     personal matters which may help us to understand burnss poetry      perhaps the most potent influence in his life was that which came     from his labor in the field he was born in a clay biggin or     cottage in the parish of alloway near the little town of ayr        auld ayr wham neer a town surpasses       for honest men and bonnie lasses      his father was a poor crofter a hard working god fearing man of     the covenanter type who labored unceasingly to earn a living from     the soil of a rented farm the children went barefoot in all     seasons almost from the time they could walk they were expected to     labor and at thirteen bobbie was doing a mans work at the plow or     the reaping the toil was severe the reward at best was to     escape dire poverty or disgraceful debt but there was yet a     nobility in the life which is finely reflected in the cotters     saturday night a poem which ranks with whittiers snow bound     among the best that labor has ever inspired      illustration ellisland     the hundred acre farm near dumfries where burns worked as a farmer     the happiest days of his life were spent here 17871791      sidenote the element of nature      as a farmers boy burns worked in the open in close contact with     nature and the result is evident in all his verse sunshine or     storm bird song or winter wind the flowers the stars the dew of     the morningopen burns where you will and you are face to face     with these elemental realities sometimes his reflection of nature     is exquisitely tender as in to a mouse or to a mountain daisy     but for the most part he regards nature not sentimentally like     gray or religiously like wordsworth and bryant but in a breezy     companionable way which suggests the song of under the greenwood     tree in as you like it      sidenote his education      another influence in burnss life came from his elementary     education there were no ancient classics studied in the school     which he attendedfortunately perhaps for his best work is free     from the outworn classical allusions which decorate the bulk of     eighteenthcentury verse in the evening he listened to tales from     scottish history which stirred him deeply and made him live in a     present world rather than in the misty region of greek mythology     one result of this education was the downright honesty of burnss     poems here is no echo from a vanished world of gods and goddesses     but the voice of a man living working feeling joy or sorrow in     the presence of everyday nature and humanity      for another formative influence burns was indebted to betty     davidson a relative and an inmate of the household who carried     such a stock of old wives tales as would scare any child into fits     on a dark night hear burns speak of her          she had i suppose the largest collection in the country         of tales and songs concerning devils ghosts fairies         brownies witches warlocks spunkies kelpies         elfcandles deadlights wraiths apparitions cantrips         giants enchanted towers dragons and other trumpery this         cultivated the latent seeds of poetry but had so strong an         effect upon my imagination that to this hour in my         nocturnal rambles i sometimes keep a sharp lookout in         suspicious places      reflections of these grotesque superstitions appear in such poems     as the address to the deil and tam o shanter the latter is     commonly named as one of the few original works of burns but it is     probably a retelling of some old witchtale of betty davidson      sidenote evil elements      the evil influence in burnss life may be only suggested it leads     first to the tavern to roistering and dissipation to     entanglements in vulgar love affairs then swiftly to the loss of a     splendid poetic gift to hopeless debts to degrading poverty to     an untimely death burns had his chance if ever poet had it after     the publication of his first book the famous kilmarnock edition of     1786 when he was called in triumph to edinburgh there he sold     another edition of his poems for a sum that seemed fabulous to a     poor crofter whereupon he bought a farm and married his jean     armour he was acclaimed throughout the length and breadth of his     native land his poems were read by the wise and by the ignorant     he was the poet of scotland and the nation proud of its gifted     son stood ready to honor and follow him but the old habits were     too strong and burns took the downhill road to this element of     dissipation we owe his occasional bitterness railing and     coarseness which make an expurgated edition of his poems essential     to one who would enjoy the reading      illustration the village of tarbolton near which burns lived     when about nineteen years old      there is another element often emphasized for its alleged     influence on burnss poetry during his lifetime the political     world was shaken by the american and french revolutions democracy     was in the air and the watchwords liberty equality fraternity     inspired many a song besides the marseillaise and many a     document besides the declaration of independence that burns was     aware of this political commotion is true but he was not much     influenced by it he was at home only in his own scottish field     and even there his interests were limitednot to be compared with     those of walter scott for example when the bastille was stormed     and the world stood aghast burns was too much engrossed in     personal matters to be greatly moved by distant affairs in france     not to the revolution therefore but to his scottish blood do we     owe the thrilling scots wha hae one of the worlds best battle     songs not to the new spirit of democracy abroad but to the old     covenanter spirit at home do we owe a mans a man for a that     with its assertion of elemental manhood  the songs of burns from such an analysis of burnss life one may forecast his subject and his method living intensely in a small field he must discover that there are just two poetic subjects of abiding interest these are nature and humanity and of these burns must write from firsthand knowledge simply straightforwardly and with sincerity moreover as burns lives in an intense way reading himself rather than books he must discover that the ordinary man is more swayed by strong feeling than by logical reasons he will write therefore of the common emotions that lie between the extremes of laughter and tears and his appeal will be to the heart rather than to the head of his reader  illustration auld alloway kirk made famous by the poem of tam oshanter  this emotional power of burns his masterful touch upon human heartstrings is the first of his poetic qualities and he has others which fairly force themselves upon the attention for example many of his lyrics auld lang syne banks o doon flow gently sweet afton o wert thou in the cauld blast have been repeatedly set to music and the reason is that they were written to music that in such poems burns was refashioning some old material to the tune of a scottish song there is a singing quality in his poetry which not only makes it pleasant reading but which is apt to set the words tripping to melody for a specific example take this stanza from of a the airts a lyric which one can hardly read without making a tune to match it    i see her in the dewy flowrs     i see her sweet and fair   i hear her in the tunefu birds     i hear her charm the air   theres not a bonie flowr that springs     by fountain shaw or green   theres not a bonie bird that sings     but minds me o my jean  sympathy is another marked characteristic of burns a wide allembracing sympathy that knows no limit save for hypocrites at whom he pointed his keenest satire his feeling for nature is reflected in to a mouse and to a daisy his comradeship with noble men appears in the cotters saturday night with riotous and bibulous men in the jolly beggars with smugglers and their ilk in the deils awa with the exciseman footnote burns was himself an exciseman that is a collector of taxes on alcoholic liquors he wrote this song while watching a smugglers craft and waiting in the storm for officers to come and make an arrest with patriots in bannockburn with men who mourn in to mary in heaven and with all lovers in a score of famous lyrics side by side with burnss sympathy for smiles live next door to tears appears his keen sense of humor a humor that is sometimes rollicking as in contented wi little and again too broad for decency for the most part however burns contents himself with dry quiet sarcasm delivered with an air of great seriousness    ah gentle dames it gars me greet   to think how mony counsels sweet   how mony lengthened sage advices   the husband frae the wife despises  why burns is read such qualities appearing on almost every page of burnss little book of poetry show how widely he differs from the formal school of pope and dryden they labor to compose poetry while burns gives the impression of singing as naturally as a child sings from a full heart again most eighteenthcentury poets wrote for the favored few but burns wrote for all his neighbors his first book was bought farmers plowboys milkmaidsby every lowlander who could scrape together three shillings to buy a treasure then scholars got hold of it taking it from humble hands and burns was called to edinburgh to prepare a larger edition of his songs for a half century scotland kept him to herself footnote up to 1850 burns was rarely mentioned in treatises on english literature one reason for his late recognition was that the lowland vocabulary employed in most of his poems was only half intelligible to the ordinary english reader then his work went wide in the world to be read again by plain men and women by sailors on the sea by soldiers round the campfire by farmers mechanics tradesmen who in their new homes in australia or america warmed themselves at the divine fire which was kindled long ago in the little clay biggin at alloway  illustration burnss mausoleum  sidenote the genius of burns  if one should ask why this world wide welcome to burns the while pope remains a mark for literary criticism the answer is that burns has a most extraordinary power of touching the hearts of common men he is one of the most democratic of poets he takes for his subject a simple experiencea family gathering at eventide a fair a merrymaking a joy a grief the finding of a flower the love of a lad for a lassand with rare simplicity reflects the emotion that such an experience awakens seen through the poets eyes this simple emotion becomes radiant and lovely a thing not of earth but of heaven that is the genius of burns to ennoble human feeling to reveal some hidden beauty in a commonplace experience the luminous world of fine thought and fine emotion which we associate with the name of poetry he opened not to scholars alone but to all humble folk who toil and endure as a shoemaker critic once said burns confirms my former suspicion that the world was made for me as well as for cæsar                                       minor poets of romanticism  there were other poets who aided in the romantic revival and among them william cowper 17311800 is one of the most notable his most ambitious works such as the task and the translation of homer into blank verse have fallen into neglect and he is known to modern readers chiefly by a few familiar hymns and by the ballad of john gilpin  illustration william cowper from the rare engraving by w blake 1802 after the painting by t lawrence r a 1793  less gifted but more popular than cowper was james macpherson 17361796 who made a sensation that spread rapidly over europe and america with his fingal 1762 and other works of the same kindwildly heroic poems which he alleged were translations from celtic manuscripts written by an ancient bard named ossian another and better literary forgery appeared in a series of ballads called the rowley papers dealing with medieval themes these were written by the marvelous boy thomas chatterton 17521770 who professed to have found the poems in a chest of old manuscripts the success of these forgeries especially of the ossian poems is an indication of the awakened interest in medieval poetry and legend which characterized the whole romantic movement  in this connection thomas percy 17291811 did a notable work when he published after years of research his reliques of ancient english poetry 1765 this was a collection of old ballads which profoundly influenced walter scott and which established a foundation for all later works of balladry  another interesting figure in the romantic revival is william blake 17571827 a strange mystic child a veritable john o dreams whom some call madman because of his huge chaotic unintelligible poems but whom others regard as the supreme poetical genius of the eighteenth century his only readable works are the boyish poetical sketches 1783 and two later volumes called songs of innocence and songs of experience 1794 even these contain much to make us question blakes sanity but they contain also a few lyrics that might have been written by an elf rather than a manbeautiful elusive lyrics that haunt us like a strain of gypsy music a memory of childhood a bird song in the night    can the eagle see what is in the pit     or wilt thou go ask the mole   can wisdom be put in a silver rod     or love in a golden bowl  in the witchery of these lyrics eighteenthcentury poetry appears commonplace but they attracted no attention even holy thursday the sweetest song of poor children ever written passing unnoticed that did not trouble blake however who cared nothing for rewards he was a childlike soul well content    to see the world in a grain of sand     and a heaven in a wild flower   hold infinity in the palm of your hand     and eternity in an hour                                       the early english novel  an important literary event of the eighteenth century was the appearance of the modern novel this invention generally credited to the english differs radically from the old romance which was known to all civilized peoples walter scott made the following distinction between the two types of fiction the romance is a story in which our interest centers in marvelous incidents brought to pass by extraordinary or superhuman characters the novel is a story which is more natural more in harmony with our experience of life such a definition though faulty is valuable in that it points to the element of imagination as the distinguishing mark between the romance and the true novel  sidenote the romance  take for example the romances of arthur or sindbad or the green knight here are heroes of more than human endurance ladies of surpassing loveliness giants dragons enchanters marvelous adventures in the land of imagination such fanciful stories valuable as a reflection of the ideals of different races reached their highest point in the middle ages when they were used to convey the ideals of chivalry and knightly duty they grew more fantastic as they ran to seed till in the elizabethan age they had degenerated into picaresque stories from picaro a rogue which recounted the adventures not of a noble knight but of some scoundrel or outcast they were finally laughed out of literature in numerous burlesques of which the most famous is don quixote 1605 in the humor of this story in the heros fighting windmills and meeting so many adventures that he had no time to breathe we have an excellent criticism not of chivalry as is sometimes alleged but of extravagant popular romances on the subject footnote don quixote is commonly named as a type of extravagant humor but from another viewpoint it is a sad book intensely sad for it recounts the experience of a man who had a knightly heart and who believed the world to be governed by knightly ideals but who went forth to find a world filled with vulgarity and villainy  sidenote the novel  compare now these old romances with ivanhoe or robinson crusoe or lorna doone or a tale of two cities in each of the lastnamed novels one may find three elements a story a study and an exercise of the creative imagination a modern work of fiction must still have a good story if anybody is to read it must contain also a study or observation of humanity not of superhuman heroes but of men and women who work or play or worship in close relationship to their fellows finally the story and the study must be fused by the imagination which selects or creates various scenes characters incidents and which orders or arranges its materials so as to make a harmonious work that appeals to our sense of truth and beauty in other words a work of art  such is the real novel a welltold story in tune with human experience holding true to life exercising fancy but keeping it under control arousing thought as well as feeling and appealing to our intellect as well as to our imagination footnote this convenient division of prose fiction into romances and novels is open to challenge some critics use the name novel for any work of prose fiction they divide novels into two classes stories or short stories and romances the story relates simple or detached incidents the romance deals with life in complex relations dominated by strong emotions especially by the emotion of love  other critics arrange prose fiction in the following classes novels of adventure robinson crusoe the last of the mohicans historical novels ivanhoe the spy romantic novels lorna doone the heart of midlothian novels of manners cranford pride and prejudice novels of personality silas marner the scarlet letter novels of purpose oliver twist uncle toms cabin  still another classification arranges fiction under two heads romance and realism in the romance which portrays unusual incidents or characters we see the ideal the poetic side of humanity in the realistic novel dealing with ordinary men and women the prosaic element of life is emphasized  defoe 16611731 among the forerunners of the modern novel is daniel foe author of robinson crusoe who began to call himself defoe after he attained fame he produced an amazing variety of wares newspapers magazines ghost stories biographies journals memoirs satires picaresque romances essays on religion reform trade projectsin all more than two hundred works these were written in a picturesque style and with such a wealth of detail that though barefaced inventions for the most part they passed for veracious chronicles one critic thinking of the vividly realistic journal of the plague year and memoirs of a cavalier says that defoe wrote history but invented the facts another declares that the one little art of which defoe was past master was the art of forging a story and imposing it on the world as truth the long list of his works ends with a history of the devil in 1726  illustration daniel defoe      foes career was an extraordinary one by nature and training he     seems to have preferred devious ways to straight and to have     concealed his chief motive whether he appeared as reformer or     politician tradesman or writer policespy or friend of outcasts     his education which he picked up from men and circumstance was     more varied than any university could have given him perhaps the     chief factor in this practical education was his ability to turn     every experience to profitable account as a journalist he invented     the modern magazine his review appeared in 1704 five years     before steeles tatler also he projected the interview     the editorial the scoop and other features which still figure     in our newspapers as a hired pamphleteer writing satires against     whigs or tories he learned so many political secrets that when one     party fell he was the best possible man to be employed by the     other while sitting in the stocks in punishment for writing a     satirical pamphlet that set tories and churchmen by the ears he     made such a hit with his doggerel verses against the authorities     that crowds came to the pillory to cheer him and to buy his poem     while in durance vile in the old newgate prison he mingled freely     with all sorts of criminals there were no separate cells in those     days won their secrets and used them to advantage in his     picaresque romances he learned also so much of the shady side of     london life that no sooner was he released than he was employed as     a secret service agent or spy by the government which had jailed     him      illustration cupola house defoes residence at bury      it is as difficult to find the real foe amidst such devious trails     as to determine where a caribou is from the maze of footprints     which he leaves behind him he seems to have been untiring in his     effort to secure better treatment of outcast folk he speaks of     himself with apparent sincerity as having received his message     from the divine spirit but the impression which he made upon the     upper classes was reflected by swift who called him a grave     dogmatical rogue for many years he was a popular hero trusted     not only by the poor but by the criminal classes ordinarily keen     judges of honesty in other men until his secret connection with     the government became known then suspicion fell upon him his     popularity was destroyed and he fled from london the last few     years of his life were spent in hiding from real or imaginary     enemies  sidenote robinson crusoe  defoe was approaching his sixtieth year when he wrote robinson crusoe 1719 a story which has been read through out the civilized world and which after two centuries of life is still young and vigorous the first charm of the book is in its moving adventures which are surprising enough to carry us through the moralizing passages these also have their value for who ever read them without asking what would i have done or thought or felt under such circumstances the work of society is now so comfortably divided that one seldom dreams of being his own mechanic farmer hunter herdsman cook and tailor as crusoe was thinking of his experience we are brought face to face with our dependence on others with our debt to the countless unnamed men whose labor made civilization possible we understand also the pioneers who in the far lonely places of the earth have won a home and country from the wilderness  when the adventures are duly appreciated we discover another charm of robinson crusoe namely its intense reality defoe had that experience of many projects and that vivid imagination which enabled him to put himself in the place of his hero footnote the basis of robinson crusoe was the experience of an english sailor alexander selkirk or selcraig who was marooned on the lonely island of juan fernandez off the coast of chile there he lived in solitude for the space of five years before he was rescued when selkirk returned to england 1709 an account of his adventures appeared in the public press to anticipate his needs his feelings his labors and triumph that crusoe was heroic none will deny yet his heroism was of a different kind from that which we meet in the old romances here was no knight without fear and without reproach but a plain man with his strength and weakness he despaired like other men but instead of giving way to despair he drew up a list of his blessings and afflictions like debtor and creditor found a reasonable balance in his favor and straightway conquered himselfwhich is the first task of all real heroes again he had horrible fears he beat his breast cried out as one in mortal terror then i thought that would do little good so i began to make a raft so he overcame his fears as he overcame the difficulties of the place by setting himself to do alone what a whole race of men had done before him robinson crusoe is therefore history as well as fiction its subject is not alexander selkirk but homo sapiens its lesson is the everlasting triumph of will and work  richardson one morning in 1740 the readers of london found a new work for sale in the bookshops it was made up of alleged letters from a girl to her parents a sentimental girl who opened her heart freely explaining its hopes fears griefs temptations and especially its moral sensibilities such a work of fiction was unique at that time delighted readers waited for another and yet another volume of the same story till more than a year had passed and pamela or virtue rewarded reached its happy ending  sidenote the first novel  the book made a sensation in england it was speedily translated and repeated its triumph on the other side of the channel comparatively few people could read it now without being bored but it is famous in the history of literature as the first english novel that is a story of a human life under stress of emotion told by one who understood the tastes of his own age and who strove to keep his work true to human nature in all ages  the author of pamela samuel richardson 16891761 was a very proper person well satisfied with himself who conducted a modest business as printer and bookseller for years he had practiced writing and had often been employed by sentimental young women who came to him for model love letters hence the extraordinary knowledge of feminine feelings which richardson displayed hence also the epistolary form in which his novels were written his aim in all his work was to teach morality and correct deportment his strength was in his power to analyze and portray emotions his weakness lay in his vanity which led him to shun masculine society and to foregather at tea tables with women who flattered him  led by the success of pamela which portrayed the feelings of a servant girl the author began another series of letters which ended in the eightvolume novel clarissa or the history of a young lady 1748 the story appeared in installments which were awaited with feverish impatience till the agony drew to an end and the heroine died amid the sobs of ten thousand readers yet the story had power and the central figure of clarissa was impressive in its pathos and tragedy the novel would still be readable if it were stripped of the stilted conversations and sentimental gush in which richardson delighted but that would leave precious little of the story  fielding in vigorous contrast with the prim and priggish richardson is henry fielding 17071754 a big jovial reckless man full of animal spirits who was ready to mitigate any mans troubles or forget his own by means of a punch bowl or a venison potpie he was noble born but seems to have been thrown on the world to shift for himself after an excellent education he studied law and was for some years a police magistrate in which position he increased his large knowledge of the seamy side of life he had a pen for vigorous writing and after squandering two modest fortunes his own and his wifes he proceeded to earn his living by writing buffooneries for the stage then appeared richardsons pamela or virtue rewarded and in ridiculing its sentimental heroine fielding found his vocation as a novelist  sidenote burlesque of richardson  he began joseph andrews 1742 as a joke by taking for his hero an alleged brother of pamela who was also virtuous but whose reward was to be kicked out of doors then the story took to the open road among the inns and highways of an age when traveling in rural england was almost as adventurous as campaigning in flanders in the joy of his story fielding soon forgot his burlesque of richardson and attempted what he called a realistic novel that is a story of real life the morality and decorum which richardson exalted appeared to fielding as hypocrisy so he devoted himself to a portrayal of men and manners as he found them  undoubtedly there were plenty of good men and manners at that time but fielding had a vagabond taste that delighted in rough scenes and of these also eighteenthcentury england could furnish an abundance hence his joseph andrews is a picture not of english society as is often alleged but only of the least significant part of society the same is true of tom jones 1749 which is the authors most vigorous work and of amelia 1751 in which though he portrays one good woman he repeats many of the questionable incidents of his earlier works  there is power in all these novels the power of keen observation of rough humor of downright sincerity but unhappily the power often runs to waste in long speeches to the reader in descriptions of brutal or degrading scenes and in a wholly unnecessary coarseness of expression  influence of the early novels the idea of the modern novel seems to have been developed by several english authors each of whom like pioneers in a new country left his stamp on subsequent works in the same field richardsons governing motive may be summed up in the word sensibility which means delicacy of feeling and which was a fashion almost a fetish in eighteenthcentury society because it was deemed essential to display proper or decorous feeling on all occasions richardsons heroines were always analyzing their emotions they talked like a book of etiquette they indulged in tears fainting transports of joy paroxysms of grief apparently striving to make themselves as unlike a real woman as possible it is astonishing how far and wide this fad of sensibility spread through the literary world and how many gushing heroines of english and american fiction during the next seventyfive years were modeled on pamela or clarissa  in view of this artificial fashion the influence of fielding was like the rush of crisp air into a hot house his aim was realistic that is to portray real people in their accustomed ways unfortunately his aim was spoiled by the idea that to be realistic one must go to the gutter for material and then appeared goldsmith too much influenced by the fad of sensibility but aiming to depict human life as governed by high ideals and helping to cleanse the english novel from brutality and indecency  sidenote threefold influence  there were other early novelists a host of them but in richardson fielding and goldsmith we have enough richardson emphasized the analysis of human feeling or motive and that of itself was excellent but his exaggerated sentimentality set a bad fashion which our novelists were almost a century in overcoming fielding laid stress on realism and that his influence was effective is shown in the work of his disciple thackeray who could be realistic without being coarse and goldsmith made all subsequent novelists his debtors by exalting that purity of domestic life to which every home worthy of the name forever strives or aspires  if it be asked what novels of the early type ought one to read the answer is simple unless you want to curdle your blood by a tale of mystery and horror in which case mrs radcliffes mysteries of udolpho will serve the purpose there are only two that young readers will find satisfactory the realistic robinson crusoe by defoe and the romantic vicar of wakefield by goldsmith                                           summary what we call eighteenthcentury literature appeared     between two great political upheavals the english revolution of     1688 and the french revolution of 1789 some of the chief     characteristics of that literaturesuch as the emphasis on form     the union of poetry with politics the prevalence of satire the     interest in historical subjectshave been accounted for in part     at least in our summary of the history of the period      the writings of the century are here arranged in three main     divisions the reign of formalism miscalled classicism the     revival of romantic poetry and the

includes 1 the meaning of the modern     novel as distinct from the ancient romance 2 a study of defoe     author of robinson crusoe who was a forerunner of the     modern realistic novelist 3 the works of richardson and of     fielding contrasting types of eighteenthcentury storytellers     4 the influence of richardsons sentimentality of fieldings     realism and of goldsmiths moral purity on

didst rejoice   they were thy chosen music liberty               wordsworth sonnet to switzerland   the many changes recorded in the political and literary history of nineteenthcentury england may be grouped under two heads the progress of democracy in government and the triumph of romanticism in literature by democracy we mean the assumption by common men of the responsibilities of government with a consequent enlargement of human liberty romanticism as we use the term here means simply that literature like politics has become liberalized that it is concerned with the common life of men and that the delights of literature like the powers of government are no longer the possession of the few but of the many      historical outline to study either democracy or romanticism the     whig party or the poetry of wordsworth is to discover how greatly     england was influenced by matters that appeared beyond her borders     the famous reform bill 1832 which established manhood suffrage     the emancipation of the slaves in all british colonies the     hardwon freedom of the press the plan of popular     educationthese and numberless other reforms of the age may be     regarded as part of a general movement as the attempt to fulfill     in england a promise made to the world by two events which occurred     earlier and on foreign soil these two events which profoundly     influenced english politics and literature were the declaration of     independence and the french revolution      sidenote two revolutions      in the declaration we read we hold these truths to be     selfevident that all men are created equal that they are endowed     by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these     are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness glorious words     but they were not new they were old and familiar when jefferson     wrote them the american revolution which led up to the     declaration is especially significant in this that it began as a     struggle not for new privileges but for old rights so the     constructive character of that revolution which ended with a     democracy and a noble constitution was due largely to the fact     that brave men stood ready to defend the old freedom the old     manhood the old charters the good old cause for which other     brave men had lived or died through a thousand years      a little later and influenced by the american triumph came     another uprising of a different kind in france the unalienable     rights of man had been forgotten during ages of tyranny and class     privilege so the french revolution shouting its watchwords of     liberty equality fraternity had no conception of that liberty     and equality which were as ancient as the hills leaders and     followers of the revolution were clamoring for new privileges new     rights new morals new creeds they acclaimed an age of reason     as a modern and marvelous discovery they dreamed not simply of a     new society but of a new man a multitude of clubs or parties     some political some literary or educational some with a pretense     of philosophy sprang up as if by magic all believing that they     must soon enter the kingdom of heaven but nearly all forgetful of     the fact that to enter the kingdom one must accept the old     conditions and pay the same old price partly because of this     strange conception of liberty as a new thing to be established by     fiat the terrible struggle in france ended in the ignoble military     despotism of napoleon      sidenote effect of the revolutions      these two revolutions one establishing and the other clamoring for     the dignity of manhood created a mighty stir throughout the     civilized world following the french revolution most european     nations were thrown into political ferment and the object of all     their agitation rebellion upheaval was to obtain a greater     measure of democracy by overturning every form of class or caste     government thrones seemed to be tottering and in terror of their     houses continental sovereigns entered into their holy alliance     1815 with the unholy object of joining forces to crush democracy     wherever it appeared  the revolution and literature the young writers of libertyloving england felt the stir the sursum of the age wordsworth most sedate of men saw in the french revolution a glorious prophecy and wrote with unwonted enthusiasm    bliss was it in that dawn to be alive   but to be young was very heaven  coleridge and southey formed their grand scheme of a pantisocracy a government of perfect equality on the banks of the susquehanna scott always a tory and therefore distrustful of change reflected the democratic enthusiasm in a score of romances the chief point of which was this that almost every character was at heart a king and spake right kingly fashion byron won his popularity largely because he was an uncompromising rebel and appealed to young rebels who were proclaiming the necessity of a new human society and shelley after himself rebelling at almost every social law of his day wrote his prometheus unbound which is a vague but beautiful vision of humanity redeemed in some magical way from all oppression and sorrow  all these and other writers of the age give the impression as we read them now that they were gloriously expectant of a new day of liberty that was about to dawn on the world their romantic enthusiasm so different from the cold formality of the age preceding is a reflection like a rosy sunset glow of the stirring scenes of revolution through which the world had just passed                                       william wordsworth 17701850  there is but one way to know wordsworth and that way leads to his nature poems though he lived in a revolutionary age his life was singularly uneventful his letters are terribly prosaic and his excursion in which he attempted an autobiography has so many dull lines that few have patience to read it though he asserted finely that there is but one great society on earth the noble living and the noble dead he held no communion with the great minds of the past or of the present he lived in his own solitary world and his only real companion was nature to know nature at first hand and to reflect human thought or feeling in natures pure presencethis was his chief object his field therefore is a small one but in that field he is the greatest master that england has thus far produced  illustration william wordsworth      life wordsworth is as inseparably connected with the english lake     district as burns with the lowlands or scott with the border a     large part of the formative period of his life was spent out of     doors amid beautiful scenery where he felt the abounding life of     nature streaming upon him in the sunshine or booming in his ears     with the steady roar of the march winds he felt also what     sensitive spirits still feel a living presence that met him in the     loneliest wood or spoke to him in the flowers or preceded him     over the windswept hills he was one of those favored mortals who     are surest of the unseen from school he would hurry away to his     skating or birdnesting or aimless roaming and every new day     afield was to him one of those heavenly days that cannot die      sidenote wordsworth and the revolution      from the lake region he went to cambridge but found little in     college life to attract or hold him then stirred by the promise     of the revolution he went to france where his help was eagerly     sought by rival parties for in that day every traveler from     america or england whether an astute jefferson or a lamblike     wordsworth was supposed to be by virtue of his country a master     politician wordsworth threw himself rather blindly into the     revolution joined the girondists the ruling faction in 1792 and     might have gone to the guillotine with the leaders of that party     had not his friends brought him home by the simple expedient of     cutting off his supply of money thus ended ingloriously the only     adventure that ever quickened his placid life      for a time wordsworth mourned over the failure of his plans but     his grief turned to bitterness when the revolution passed over into     the reign of terror and ended in the despotism of napoleon his     country was now at war with france and he followed his country     giving mild support to burke and the tory party after a few     uncertain years during which he debated his calling in life he     resolved on two things to be a poet and to bring back to english     poetry the romantic spirit and the naturalness of expression which     had been displaced by the formal elegance of the age of pope and     johnson      illustration wordsworths desk in hawkshead school      for that resolution we are indebted partly to coleridge who had     been attracted by some of wordsworths early poems and who     encouraged him to write more from the association of these two men     came the famous lyrical ballads 1798 a book which marks     the beginning of a new era in english poetry      to wordsworths sister dorothy we are even more indebted it was     she who soothed wordsworths disappointment reminded him of the     world of nature in which alone he was at home and quietly showed     him where his power lay as he says in the prelude        she whispered still that brightness would return       she in the midst of all preserved me still       a poet made me seek beneath that name       and that alone my office upon earth      sidenote personal traits      the latter half of wordsworths life was passed in the lake region     at grasmere and rydal mount for the most part the continuity being     broken by walking trips in britain or on the continent a very     quiet uneventful life it was but it revealed two qualities which     are of interest to wordsworths readers the first was his devotion     to his art the second was his granite steadfastness his work was     at first neglected while the poems of scott byron and tennyson in     succession attained immense popularity the critics were nearly all     against him misunderstanding his best work and ridiculing the     rest the ground of their opposition was that his theory of the     utmost simplicity in poetry was wrong their ridicule was made     easier by the fact that wordsworth produced as much bad work as     good moreover he took himself very seriously had no humor and     as visitors like emerson found to their disappointment was     interested chiefly in himself and his own work for was he not     engaged in the greatest of all projects an immense poem the     recluse which should reflect the universe in the life of one     man and that man william wordsworth such selfsatisfaction     invited attack even lamb the gentlest of critics could hardly     refrain from poking fun at it          wordsworth the great poet is coming to town he is to         have apartments in the mansion house he says he does not         see much difficulty in writing like shakespeare if he had         a mind to try it it is clear that nothing is wanting but         the mind      sidenote his triumph      slowly but surely wordsworth won recognition not simply in being     made laureate but in having his ideal of poetry vindicated poets     in england and america began to follow him the critics were     silenced if not convinced while the popularity of scott and byron     waned the readers of wordsworth increased steadily finding him a     poet not of the hour but of all time if a single man plant     himself indomitably on his instincts and there abide says     emerson the huge world will come around to him if the reading     world has not yet come around to wordsworth that is perhaps not     the poets fault  wordsworth his theme and theory the theory which wordsworth and coleridge formulated was simply this that poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful human feeling its only subjects are nature and human nature its only object is to reflect the emotions awakened by our contemplation of the world or of humanity its language must be as direct and simple as possible such language as rises unbidden to the lips whenever the heart is touched though some of the worlds best poets have taken a different view wordsworth maintained steadily that poetry must deal with common subjects in the plainest language that it must not attempt to describe in elegant phrases what a poet is supposed to feel about art or some other subject selected for its poetic possibilities  sidenote natural vs formal poetry  in the last contention wordsworth was aiming at the formal school of poetry and we may better understand him by a comparison read for example his exquisite early spring i heard a thousand blended notes here in twentyfour lines are more naturalness more real feeling finely expressed than you can find in the poems of dryden johnson and addison combined or take the best part of the campaign which made addisons fortune and which was acclaimed the finest thing ever written    so when an angel by divine command   with rising tempests shakes a guilty land   such as of late oer pale britannia past   calm and serene he drives the furious blast   and pleased th almightys orders to perform   rides in the whirlwind and directs the storm  to know how artificial that famous simile is read a few lines from wordsworths on the seashore which lingers in our mind like a strain of handels music    it is a beauteous evening calm and free     the holy time is quiet as a nun     breathless with adoration the broad sun   is sinking down in its tranquillity   the gentleness of heaven broods oer the sea     listen the mighty being is awake     and doth with his eternal motion make   a sound like thundereverlastingly  if such comparisons interest the student let him read addisons letter to lord halifax with its apostrophe to liberty which was considered sublime in its day    o liberty thou goddess heavenly bright   profuse of bliss and pregnant with delight   eternal pleasures in thy presence reign   and smiling plenty leads thy wanton train   eased of her load subjection grows more light   and poverty looks cheerful in thy sight   thou makst the gloomy face of nature gay   givst beauty to the sun and pleasure to the day  place beside that the first four lines of wordsworths sonnet to switzerland quoted at the head of this chapter or a stanza from his ode to duty    stern lawgiver yet thou dost wear     the godheads most benignant grace   nor know we anything so fair     as is the smile upon thy face   flowers laugh before thee on their beds   and fragrance in thy footing treads     thou dost preserve the stars from wrong     and the most ancient heavens through thee are fresh and strong  to follow such a comparison is to understand wordsworth by sympathy it is to understand also the difference between poetry and formal verse  the poems of wordsworth as the reading of literature is the main thing the only word of criticism which remains is to direct the beginner and direction is especially necessary in dealing with wordsworth who wrote voluminously and who lacked both the critical judgment and the sense of humor to tell him what parts of his work were inferior or ridiculous    theres something in a flying horse   theres something in a huge balloon  to be sure springs in the one gas in the other but if there were anything more poetic in horse or balloon wordsworth did not discover it there is something also in a cuckoo clock or even in    a household tub one such as those   which women use to wash their clothes  such banalities are to be found in the work of a poet who could produce the exquisite sonnet on westminster bridge the finely simple i wandered lonely as a cloud the stirring ode to duty the tenderly reflective tintern abbey and the magnificent intimations of immortality which emerson who was not a very safe judge called the high water mark of poetry in the nineteenth century these five poems may serve as the first measure of wordsworths genius  sidenote poems of nature  a few of wordsworths best nature poems are early spring three years she grew the fountain my heart leaps up the tables turned to a cuckoo to a skylark the second poem beginning ethereal minstrel and yarrow revisited the spirit of all his nature poems is reflected in tintern abbey which gives us two complementary views of nature corresponding to wordsworths earlier and later experience the first is that of the boy roaming footloose over the face of nature finding as coleridge said rhythm in all thought and joyance everywhere the second is that of the man who returns to the scenes of his boyhood finds them as beautiful as ever but pervaded now by a spiritual qualitysomething which defies analysis undefined and ineffable which must be felt and perceived by the soul  it was this spiritual view of nature as a reflection of the divine which profoundly influenced bryant emerson and other american writers the essence of wordsworths teaching in his nature poems appears in the last two lines of his skylark a bird that soars the more gladly to heaven because he must soon return with joy to his own nest    type of the wise who soar but never roam   true to the kindred points of heaven and home  sidenote poems of humble life  of the poems more closely associated with human life a few the best are michael the highland reaper the leech gatherers margaret in the excursion brougham castle the happy warrior peel castle in a storm three years she grew she dwelt among the untrodden ways and she was a phantom of delight in such poems we note two significant characteristics that wordsworth does not seek extraordinary characters but is content to show the hidden beauty in the lives of plain men and women and that his heroes and heroines dwell as he said where labor still preserves his rosy face they are natural men and women and are therefore simple and strong the quiet light in their faces is reflected from the face of the fields in his emphasis on natural simplicity virtue beauty wordsworth has again been as he desired a teacher of multitudes his moral teaching may be summed up in three lines from the excursion    the primal duties shine aloft like stars   the charities that soothe and heal and bless   are scattered at the feet of man like flowers  sidenote the sonnets  in the number and fine quality of his sonnets wordsworth has no superior in english poetry simplicity strength deep thought fine feeling careful workmanshipthese qualities are present in measure more abundant than can be found elsewhere in the poets work          bees that soar for bloom   high as the highest peak of furnessfells   will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells  in these three lines from on the sonnet which should be read entire is the explanation why wordsworth who was often diffuse found joy in compressing his whole poem into fourteen lines a few other sonnets which can be heartily recommended are westminster bridge the seashore the world venetian republic to sleep toussaint louverture afterthoughts to milton sometimes called london 1802 and the farewell to scott when he sailed in search of health beginning a trouble not of clouds or weeping rain  not until one has learned to appreciate wordsworth at his best will it be safe to attempt the prelude or the growth of a poets mind most people grow weary of this poem which is too long but a few read it with pleasure for its portrayal of wordsworths education at the hand of nature or for occasional good lines which lure us on like miners in search of gold the prelude though written at thirtyfive was not published till after wordsworths death and for this reason he had planned an immense poem dealing with nature man and society which he called the recluse and which he likened to a gothic cathedral his prelude was the antechapel of this work his miscellaneous odes sonnets and narrative poems were to be as so many cells and oratories other parts of the structure were the home at grasmere and the excursion which he may have intended as transepts or as chapels  illustration st oswalds church grasmere wordsworths body was buried in the churchyard see the excursion book v  this great work was left unfinished and one may say of it as of spensers faery queen that it is better so like other poets of venerable years wordsworth wrote many verses that were better left in the inkpot and it is a pity in dealing with so beautiful and necessary a thing as poetry that one should ever reach the point of saying sadly but truthfully enough is too much                                       coleridge and southey  the story of these two men is a commentary on the uncertainties of literary fortune both won greater reward and reputation than fell to the lot of wordsworth but while the fame of the latter poet mounts steadily with the years the former have become as it were footnotes to the great contemporary with whom they were associated under the name of lake poets for half a glorious century  illustration samuel taylor coleridge  samuel taylor coleridge 17721834 the tragedy remorse which coleridge wrote is as nothing compared with the tragedy of his own life he was a man of superb natural gifts of vast literary culture to whose genius the writers of that agewordsworth hazlitt lamb de quincey shelley landor southeynearly all bear witness he might well have been a great poet or critic or philosopher or teacher but he lacked the will power to direct his gifts to any definite end his irresolution became pitiful weakness when he began to indulge in the drug habit which soon made a slave of him thereafter he impressed all who met him with a sense of loss and inexpressible sorrow      sidenote life of coleridge      coleridge began to read at three years of age at five he had gone     through the bible and the arabian nights at thirty he was perhaps     the most widely read man of his generation in the fields of     literature and philosophy he was a student in a famous charity     school in london when he met charles lamb who records his memories     of the boy and the place in his charming essay of christs     hospital at college he was one of a band of enthusiasts inspired     by the french revolution and with southey he formed a plan to     establish in america a worldreforming pantisocracy or communistic     settlement where all should be brothers and equals and where a     little manual work was to be tempered by much play poetry and     culture europeans had queer ideas of america in those days this     beautiful plan failed because the reformers did not have money     enough to cross the ocean and stake out their paradise      illustration the coleridge cottage nether stowey in     somersetshire      the next important association of coleridge was with wordsworth and     his sister dorothy in somerset where the three friends planned     and published the lyrical ballads of 1798 in this work     wordsworth attempted to portray the charm of common things and     coleridge to give reality to a world of dreams and fantasies     witness the two most original poems in the book tintern abbey     and the ancient mariner      during the latter part of his life coleridge won fame by his     lectures on english poetry and german philosophy and still greater     fame by his conversationsbrilliant heavenscaling monologues     which brought together a company of young enthusiasts and     presently these disciples of coleridge were spreading abroad a new     idealistic philosophy which crossed the ocean was welcomed by     emerson and a host of young writers or reformers and appeared in     american literature as transcendentalism           sidenote stories of coleridge          others who heard the conversations were impressed in a         somewhat different way keats met coleridge on the road         one day and listened dumbfounded to an ecstatic discourse         on poetry nightingales the origin of sensation dreams         four kinds consciousness creeds ghost storieshe         broached a thousand matters while the poets were walking a         space of two miles          walter scott meeting coleridge at a dinner listened with         his head in a whirl to a monologue on fairies the         classics ancient mysteries visions ecstasies the         psychology of poetry the poetry of metaphysics zounds         says scott i was never so bethumped with words          charles lamb hurrying to his work encountered coleridge         and was drawn aside to a quiet garden there the poet took         lamb by a button of his coat closed his eyes and began to         discourse his right hand waving to the rhythm of the         flowing words no sooner was coleridge well started than         lamb slyly took out his penknife cut off the button and         escaped unobserved some hours later as he passed the         garden on his return lamb heard a voice speaking most         musically he turned aside in wonder and there stood         coleridge his eyes closed his left hand holding the         button his right hand waving still talking like an         angel      such are the stories true or apocryphal of coleridges     conversations their bewildering quality appears somewhat dimmed     in his prose works which have been finely compared with the flight     of an eagle on set wings sweeping in wide circles balancing     soaring mounting on the winds but we must note this difference     that the eagle keeps his keen eye on the distant earth and always     knows just where he is while coleridge sees only the wonders of     cloudland and appears to be hopelessly lost  sidenote his prose and poetry  the chief prose works of coleridge are his biographia literaria a brilliant patchwork of poetry and metaphysics aids to reflection letters and table talk the most readable of his works and lectures and notes on shakespeare these all contain fine gold but the treasure is for those doughty miners the critics rather than for readers who go to literature for recreation among the best of his miscellaneous poems and coleridge at his best has few superiors are youth and age love poems hymn before sunrise ode to the departing year and the pathetic ode to dejection which is a reflection of the poets saddened but ever hopeful life  two other poems highly recommended by most critics are the fragments kubla khan and christabel but in dealing with these the reader may do well to form his own judgment both fragments contain beautiful lines but as a whole they are wandering disjointed inconsequentmere sketches they seem of some weird dream of mystery or terror which coleridge is trying in vain to remember  sidenote the ancient mariner  the most popular of coleridges works is his imperishable rime of the ancient mariner a wildly improbable poem of icebound or tropic seas of thirstkilled sailors of a phantom ship sailed by a crew of ghostsall portrayed in the vivid picturesque style of the old ballad when the mariner first appeared it was dismissed as a cockandbull story yet somehow readers went back to it again and again as if fascinated it was passed on to the next generation and still we read it and pass it on for this grotesque tale differs from all others of its kind in that its lines have been quoted for over a hundred years as a reflection of some profound human experience that is the genius of the work it takes the most fantastic illusions and makes them appear as real as any sober journey recorded in a sailors log book footnote in connection with the ancient mariner one should read the legends of the flying dutchman and the wandering jew poes story a manuscript found in a bottle is based on these legends and on coleridges poem  at the present time our enjoyment of the mariner is somewhat hampered by the critical commentaries which have fastened upon the poem like barnacles on an old ship it has been studied as a type of the romantic ballad as a moral lesson as a tract against cruelty to animals as a model of college english but that is no way to abuse a poets fancy to appreciate the mariner as the author intended one should carry it off to the hammock or orchard there to have freedom of soul to enjoy a wellspun yarn a gorgeous flight of imagination a poem which illustrates coleridges definition of poetry as the bloom and the fragrance of all human knowledge thoughts emotions language it broadens ones sympathy as well as ones horizon to accompany this ancient sailor through scenes of terror and desolation    o weddingguest this soul hath been   alone on a wide wide sea   so lonely t was that god himself   scarce seemed there to be  in the midst of such scenes come blessed memories of a real world of the beauty of unappreciated things such as the sweet jargoning of birds    and now twas like all instruments   now like a lonely flute   and now it is an angels song   that makes the heavens be mute    it ceased yet still the sails made on   a pleasant noise till noon   a noise like of a hidden brook   in the leafy month of june   that to the sleeping woods all night   singeth a quiet tune  whoever is not satisfied with that for its own sake without moral or analysis has missed the chief interest of all good poetry  robert southey in contrast with the irresolution of coleridge is the steadfastness of southey 17741843 a man of strong character of enormous industry for fifty years he worked steadily day and half the night turning out lyrics ballads epics histories biographies translations reviewsan immense amount of stuff filling endless volumes kind nature made up for southeys small talent by giving him a great opinion of it and he believed firmly that his work was as immortal as the iliad  illustration robert southey  with the exception of a few short poems such as the battle of blenheim lodore the inchcape rock and father william parodied in the nonsense of alice in wonderland the mass of southeys work is already forgotten deserving of mention however are his peninsular war and his life of nelson both written in a straightforward style portraying patriotism without the usual sham and a firstclass fighting man without brag or bluster curious readers may also be attracted by the epics of southey such as madoc the story of a welsh prince who anticipated columbus which contain plenty of the marvelous adventures that give interest to the romances of jules verne and the yarns of rider haggard  it as southeys habit to work by the clock turning out chapters as another man might dig potatoes one day as he plodded along a fairy must have whispered in his car for he suddenly produced a little story a gem a treasure of a story and hid it away in a jungle of chapters in a book called the doctor somebody soon discovered the treasure indeed one might as well try to conceal a lighted candle as to hide a good story and now it is the most famous work to be found in southeys hundred volumes of prose and verse few professors could give you any information concerning the doctor but almost any child will tell you all about the three bears the happy fate of this little nursery tale might indicate that the final judges of literature are not always or often the learned critics                                       the revolutionary poets  the above title is often applied to byron and shelley and for two reasons because they were themselves rebellious of heart and because they voiced the rebellion of numerous other young enthusiasts who disappointed by the failure of the french revolution to bring in the promised age of happiness were ready to cry out against the existing humdrum order of society both poets were sadly lacking in mental or moral balance and finding no chance in england to wage heroic warfare against political tyranny as the french had done they proceeded in rather head long fashion to an attack on well established customs in society and especially did they strike out wildly against the monster public opinion because the monster was stronger than they were and more nearly right their rebellion ended in tragedy  illustration greta hall in the lake region where southey lived 18031839      life of byron in the life of george gordon lord byron     17881824 is so much that call for apology or silence that one     is glad to review his career in briefest outline      of his family noble in name but in nothing else the least said     the better he was born in london but spent his childhood in     aberdeen under the alternate care or negligence of his erratic     mother at ten he fell heir to a title to the family seat of     newstead abbey and to estates yielding an income of some £1400 per     yeara large income for a poet but as nothing to a lord     accustomed to make ducks and drakes of his money in school and     college his conduct was rather wild and his taste fantastic for     example he kept a bulldog and a bear in his rooms and read     romances instead of books recommended by the faculty he tells us     that he detested poetry yet he wrote numerous poems which show     plainly that he not only read but copied some of the poets     footnote these poems revised and published as hours of     idleness were savagely criticized in the edinburgh     review byron answered with his satiric english bards and     scotch reviewers which ridiculed not only his scottish critics     but also wordsworth scottin fact most of the english poets     with the exception of pope whom he praised as the only poet     ancient or modern who was not a barbarian      sidenote a literary lion      at twentyone byron entered the house of lords and almost     immediately thereafter set sail for lisbon and the levant on his     return he published the first two cantos of childe harolds     pilgrimage which made him famous though he affected to     despise his triumph he followed it up shrewdly by publishing     the giaour the corsair and lara in which the     same mysterious hero of his first work reappears under different     disguises amid romantic surroundings the vigor of these poems     attracted many readers and when it was whispered about that the     author was recounting his own adventures byron became the center     of literary interest at home he was a social lion abroad he was     acclaimed the greatest of british poets but his life tended more     and more to shock the english sense of decency and when his wife     whom he had married for her money abruptly left him public     opinion made its power felt byrons popularity waned his vanity     was wounded he left his country vowing never to return also he     railed against what he called british hypocrisy      illustration lord byron after the portrait by t phillips      in geneva he first met shelley admired him was greatly helped by     him and then grossly abused his hospitality after a scandalous     career in italy he went to help the greeks in their fight for     independence but died of fever before he reached the battle line  the poetry of byron there is one little song of byron which serves well as the measure of his poetic talent it is found in don juan and it begins as follows    t is sweet to hear     at midnight on the blue and moonlit deep   the song and oar of adrias gondolier     by distance mellowd oer the waters sweep   t is sweet to see the evening star appear     t is sweet to listen as the nightwinds creep   from leaf to leaf t is sweet to view on high   the rainbow based on ocean span the sky    t is sweet to hear the watchdogs honest bark     bay deepmouthed welcome as we draw near home   t is sweet to know there is an eye will mark     our coming and look brighter when we come   t is sweet to be awakend by the lark     or lulled by falling waters sweet the hum   of bees the voice of girls the song of birds   the lisp of children and their earliest words  that is not great poetry and may not be compared with a sonnet of wordsworth but it is good honest sentiment expressed in such a melodious way that we like to read it and feel better after the reading in the next stanza however byron grows commonplace and ends with    sweet is revenge especially to women   pillage to soldiers prizemoney to seamen  and that is bad sentiment and worse rime without any resemblance to poetry the remaining stanzas are mere drivel unworthy of the poets talent or of the readers patience  it is so with a large part of byrons work it often begins well and usually has some vivid description of nature or some gallant passage in swinging verse which stirs us like martial music then the poem falls to earth like a stone and presently appears some wretched pun or jest or scurrility our present remedy lies in a book of selections in which we can enjoy the poetry without being unpleasantly reminded of the authors besetting sins of flippancy and bad taste  sidenote manfred  of the longer poems of byron which took all europe by storm only three or four are memorable manfred 1817 is a dramatic poem in which the authors pride his theatric posing his talent for rhythmic expression are all seen at their worst or best the mysterious hero of the poem lives in a gloomy castle under the high alps but he is seldom found under roof instead he wanders amidst storms and glaciers holding communion with powers of darkness forever voicing his rebellion his boundless pride his bottomless remorse nobody knows what the rebellion and the remorse are all about some readers may tire of the shadowy heros egoism but few will fail to be impressed by the vigor of the verse or by the splendid reflection of picturesque scenes and here and there is a lyric that seems to set itself to music    mont blanc is the monarch of mountains     they crowned him long ago   on a throne of rocks in a robe of clouds     with a diadem of snow  illustration newstead abbey and byron oak  cain 1821 is another dramatic poem reflecting the rebellion of another hero or rather the same hero who appears this time as the elder son of adam after murdering his brother the hero takes guidance of lucifer and explores hell where instead of repentance he finds occasion to hate almost everything that is dear to god or man the drama is a kind of gloomy parody of miltons paradise lost as manfred is a parody of goethes faust both dramas are interesting aside from their poetic passages as examples of the socalled titan literature to which we shall presently refer in our study of shelleys prometheus  sidenote childe harold  the most readable work of byron is childe harolds pilgrimage a brilliant narrative poem which reflects the impressions of another misanthropic hero in presence of the romantic scenery of the continent it was the publication of the first two cantos of this poem in 1812 that made byron the leading figure in english poetry and these cantos are still widely read as a kind of poetic guidebook to many readers however the third and fourth cantos are more sincere and more pleasurable the most memorable parts of childe harold are the farewell in the first canto waterloo in the third and lake leman venice rome the coliseum the dying gladiator and the ocean in the fourth when one has read these magnificent passages he has the best of which byron was capable we have called childe harold the most readable of byrons works but those who like a story will probably be more interested in mazeppa and the prisoner of chillon  illustration the castle of chillon  sidenote the byronic hero  one significant quality of these long poems is that they are intensely personal voicing one mans remorse or rebellion and perpetually repeating his vanity of vanities all is vanity they are concerned with the same hero who is byron under various disguises and they picture him as a proud mysterious stranger carelessly generous fiendishly wicked profoundly melancholy irresistibly fascinating to women byron is credited with the invention of this hero ever since called byronic but in truth the melodramatic outcast was a popular character in fiction long before byron adopted him gave him a new dress and called him manfred or don juan a score of romances such as mrs radcliffes the italian in england and charles brockden browns wieland in america had used the same hero to add horror to a grotesque tale scott modified him somewhat as the templar in ivanhoe for example and byron made him more real by giving him the revolutionary spirit by employing him to voice the rebellion against social customs which many young enthusiasts felt so strongly in the early part of the nineteenth century  sidenote two views of byron  the vigor of this stage hero his rebellious spirit his picturesque adventures the gaudy tinsel mistaken for gold in which he was dressedall this made a tremendous impression in that romantic age goethe called byron the prince of modern poetry the most talented and impressive figure which the literary world has ever produced and this unbalanced judgment was shared by other critics on the continent where byron is still regarded as one of the greatest of english poets  swinburne on the other hand can hardly find words strong enough to express his contempt for the blare and brassiness of byron but that also is an exaggeration though byron is no longer a popular hero and though his work is more rhetorical than poetical we may still gladly acknowledge the swinging rhythm the martial dash and vigor of his best verse also remembering the revolution we may understand the dazzling impression which he made upon the poets of his day when the news came from greece that his meteoric career was ended the young tennyson wept passionately and went out to carve on a stone byron is dead as if poetry had perished with him even the coldly critical matthew arnold was deeply moved to write    when byrons eyes were closed in death      we bowed our head and held our breath   he taught us little but our soul      had felt him like the thunder roll      life of shelley the career of percy bysshe shelley 17921822 is     in comparison with that of byron as a willothewisp to a     meteor byron was of the earth earthy he fed upon coarse food     shady adventures scandal the limelight but shelley        seemed nourished upon starbeams and the stuff       of rainbows and the tempest and the foam      he was a delicate child shy sensitive elflike who wandered     through the woods near his home in sussex on the lookout for     sprites and hobgoblins his reading was of the wildest kind and     when he began the study of chemistry he was forever putting     together things that made horrible smells or explosions in     expectation that the genii of the arabian nights would rise     from the smoke of his test tube      sidenote a young rebel      at eton the boy promptly rebelled against the brutal fagging     system then tolerated in all english schools he was presently in     hot water and the name mad shelley which the boys gave him     followed him through life he had been in the university oxford     hardly two years when his head was turned by some book of shallow     philosophy and he printed a rattlebrained tract called the     necessity of atheism this got him into such trouble with the dons     that he was expelled for insubordination      sidenote the wind and the whirlwind      forthwith shelley published more tracts of a more rebellious kind     his sister helen put them into the hands of her girl friend     harriet westbrook who showed her belief in revolutionary theories     by running away from school and parental discipline and coming to     shelley for protection these two social rebels both in the     greenapple stage their combined age was thirtyfive were     presently married not that either of them believed in marriage     but because they were compelled by anarch custom      after some two years of a wandering willothewisp life shelley     and his wife were estranged and separated the young poet then met     a certain william godwin known at that time as a novelist and     evolutionary philosopher and showed his appreciation of godwins     radical teaching by running away with his daughter mary aged     seventeen the first wife tired of liberalism drowned herself     and shelley was plunged into remorse at the tragedy the right to     care for his children was denied him as an improper person and he     was practically driven out of england by force of that public     opinion which he had so frequently outraged or defied      illustration percy bysshe shelley      life is a good teacher though stern in its reckoning and in italy     life taught shelley that the rights and beliefs of other men were     no less sacred than his own he was a strange combination of hot     head and kind heart the one filled with wild social theories the     other with compassion for humanity he was immensely generous with     his friends and tender to the point of tears at the thought of     suffering mennot real men such as he met in the streets even     the beggars in italy are cheerful but idealized men with     mysterious sorrows whom he met in the clouds while in england his     weak head had its foolish way and his early poems such as     queen mab are violent declamations in italy his heart had     its day and his later poems such as adonais and     prometheus unbound are rhapsodies ennobled by shelleys     love of beauty and by his unquenchable hope that a bright day of     justice must soon dawn upon the world he was drowned 1822 while     sailing his boat off the italian coast before he had reached the     age of thirty years  the poetry of shelley in the longer poems of shelley there are two prominent elements and two others less conspicuous but more important the first element is revolt the poet was violently opposed to the existing order of society and lost no opportunity to express his hatred of tyranny which was shelleys name for what sober men called law and order feeding his spirit of revolution were numerous anarchistic theories called the new philosophy which had this curious quality that they hotly denied the old faith law morality as other men formulated such matters and fervently believed any quack who appeared with a new nostrum warranted to cure all social disorders  the second obvious element in shelleys poetry is his love of beauty not the common beauty of nature or humanity which wordsworth celebrated but a strange supernal beauty with no earthly quality or reality his best lines leave a vague impression of something beautiful and lovely but we know not what it is  less conspicuous in shelleys poems are the sense of personal loss or grief which pervades them and the exquisite melody of certain words which he used for their emotional effect rather than to convey any definite meaning like byron he sang chiefly of his own feelings his rage or despair his sorrow or loneliness he reflected his idea of the origin and motive of lyric poesy in the lines                   most wretched men   are cradled into poetry by wrong   they learn in suffering what they teach in song  an idea which poe adopted in its entirety and which heine expressed in a sentimental lyric telling how from his great grief he made his little songs    aus meinen groszen schmerzen   mach ich die kleinen lieder  hardly another english poet uses words so musically as shelley witness the cloud and the skylark and here again his idea of verbal melody was carried to an extreme by poe in whose poetry words are used not so much to express ideas as to awaken vague emotions  sidenote alastor  all the abovenamed qualities appear in alastor the spirit of solitude which is less interesting as a poem than as a study of shelley in this poem we may skip the revolt which is of no consequence and follow the poet in his search for a supernally lovely maiden who shall satisfy his love for ideal beauty to find her he goes not among human habitations but to gloomy forests dizzy cliffs raging torrents tempestblown seashoreto every place where a maiden in her senses would not be such places terrible or picturesque are but symbols of the poets soul in its suffering and loneliness he does not find his maiden and herein we read the poets first confession that he has failed in life that the world is too strong for him but he sees the setting moon and somehow that pale comforter brings him peace with death  sidenote prometheus  in prometheus unbound shelley uses the old myth of the titan who rebelled against the tyranny of the gods and who was punished by being chained to a rock footnote the original tragedy of prometheus bound was written by Æschylus a famous old greek dramatist the same poet wrote also prometheus unbound but the latter drama has been lost shelley borrowed the idea of his poem from this lost drama in this poem prometheus man is represented as being tortured by jove law or custom until he is released by demogorgon progress or necessity whereupon he marries asia love or goodness and stars and moon break out into a happy song of redemption  obviously there is no reality or human interest in such a fantasy the only pleasurable parts of the poem are its detached passages of great melody or beauty and the chief value of the work is as a modern example of titan literature many poets have at various times represented mankind in the person of a titan that is a man written large colossal in his courage or power or suffering Æschylus in prometheus marlowe in tamburlaine milton in lucifer of paradise lost goethe in faust byron in manfred shelley in prometheus unbound the greek titan is resigned uncomplaining knowing himself to be a victim of fate which may not be opposed marlowes titan is bombastic and violent miltons is ambitious proud revengeful goethes is cultured and philosophical byrons is gloomy rebellious theatrical so all these poets portray each his own bent of mind and something also of the temper of the age in the character of his titan the significance of shelleys poem is in this that his titan is patient and hopeful trusting in the spirit of love to redeem mankind from all evil herein shelley is far removed from the caviling temper of his fellow rebel byron he celebrates a golden age not of the past but of the future when the dream of justice inspired by the french revolution shall have become a glorious reality  sidenote his best poems  these longer poems of shelley are read by the few they are too vague with too little meaning or message for ordinary readers who like to understand as well as to enjoy poetry to such readers the only interesting works of shelley are a few shorter poems the cloud to a skylark ode to the west wind indian serenade a lament when the lamp is lighted and some parts of adonais a beautiful elegy in memory of keats such as the passage beginning go thou to rome for splendor of imagination and for melody of expression these poems have few peers and no superiors in english literature to read them is to discover that shelley was at times so sensitive so responsive to every harmony of nature that he seemed like the poet of alastor    a fragile lute on whose harmonious strings   the breath of heaven did wander  the breath of heaven is constant but lutes and strings are variable matters of human arrangement when shelleys lute was tuned to nature it brought forth aerial melody when he strained its strings to voice some social rebellion or anarchistic theory it produced wild discord                                       john keats 17951821    a thing of beauty is a joy forever   its loveliness increases it will never   pass into nothingness but still will keep   a bower quiet for us and a sleep   full of sweet dreams and health and quiet breathing  the above lines from endymion reflect the ideal of the young singer whom we rank with the best poets of the nineteenth century unlike other romanticists of that day he seems to have lived for poetry alone and to have loved it for its own sake as we love the first spring flowers his work was shamefully treated by reviewers it was neglected by the public but still he wrote trying to make each line perfect in the spirit of those medieval workmen who put their hearts into a carving that would rest on some lofty spire far above the eyes of men to reverence beauty wherever he found it and then in gratitude to produce a new work of beauty which should live foreverthat was keatss only aim it is the more wonderful in view of his humble origin his painful experience his tragic end      life only twentyfive years of life which included seven years of     uncongenial tasks and three of writing and three of wandering in     search of healththat sums up the story of keats he was born in     london he was the son of a hostler his home was over the stable     his playground was the dirty street the family prospered moved to     a better locality and the children were sent to a good school     then the parents died and at fifteen keats was bound out to a     surgeon and apothecary for four years he worked as an apprentice     and for three years more in a hospital then for his heart was     never in the work he laid aside his surgeons kit resolving never     to touch it again      sidenote two poetic ideals      since childhood he had been a reader a dreamer but not till a     volume of spensers faery queen was put into his hands did     he turn with intense eagerness to poetry the influence of that     volume is seen in the somewhat monotonous sweetness of his early     work next he explored the classics he had read virgil in the     original but he knew no greek and the joy he found in chapmans     translation of homer is reflected in a noble sonnet from that time     on he was influenced by two ideals which he found in greek and     medieval literature the one with its emphasis on form the other     with its rich and varied coloring      illustration john keats      during the next three years keats published three small volumes     his entire lifes work these were brutally criticized by literary     magazines they met with ridicule at the hands of byron with     indifference on the part of scott and wordsworth the pathetic     legend that the poets life was shortened by this abuse is still     repeated but there is little truth in it keats held manfully to     his course having more weighty things than criticism to think     about he was conscious that his time was short he was in love     with his fannie brawne but separated from her by illness and     poverty and like the american poet lanier he faced death across     the table as he wrote to throw off the consumption which had     fastened upon him he tried to live in the open making walking     trips in the lake region but he met with rough fare and returned     from each trip weaker than before he turned at last to italy     dreading the voyage and what lay beyond night fell as the ship put     to sea the evening star shone clear through the storm clouds and     keats sent his farewell to life and love and poetry in the sonnet     beginning        bright star would i were steadfast as thou art      he died soon after his arrival in rome in 1821 shelley who had     hailed keats as a genius and who had sent a generous invitation to     come and share his home commemorated the poets death and the     worlds loss in adonais which ranks with miltons     lycidas tennysons in memoriam and emersons     threnody among the great elegiac poems of our literature  the work of keats the first small volume of keats poems 1817 seems now like an experiment the part of that experiment which we cherish above all others is the sonnet on chapmans homer which should be read entire for its note of joy and for its fine expression of the influence of classic poetry the second volume endymion may be regarded as a promise there is little reality in the rambling poem which gives title to the volume the story of a shepherd beloved of a moongoddess but the bold imagery of the work its spenserian melody its passages of rare beautyall these speak of a true poet who has not yet quite found himself or his subject a third volume lamia isabella the eve of st agnes and other poems 1820 is in every sense a fulfillment for it contains a large proportion of excellent poetry fresh vital melodious which improves with years and which carries on its face the stamp of permanency  sidenote his best poems  the contents of this little volume may be arranged not very accurately in three classes in the first are certain poems that by their perfection of form show the greek or classic spirit best known of these poems are the fragment hyperion with its miltonlike nobility of style and lamia which is the story of an enchantress whom love transforms into a beautiful woman but who quickly vanishes because of her lovers too great curiositya parable perhaps of the futility of science and philosophy as keats regarded them  of the poems of the second class which reflect old medieval legends the pot of basil the eve of st agnes and la belle dame sans merci are praised by poets and critics alike st agnes which reflects a vague longing rather than a story is the best known but la belle dame may appeal to some readers as the most moving of keatss poems the essence of all old metrical romances is preserved in a few lines which have an added personal interest from the fact that they may reveal something of the poets sad love story  in the third class are a few sonnets and miscellaneous poems all permeated by the sense of beauty showing in every line the genius of keats and his exquisite workmanship the sonnets on the sea when i have fears on the grasshopper and cricket and to sleep the fragment beginning in a drearnighted december the marvelous odes on a grecian urn to a nightingale and to autumn in which he combines the simplicity of the old classics with the romance and magic of medieval writersthere are no works in english of a similar kind that make stronger appeal to our ideal of poetry and of verbal melody into the three stanzas of autumn for example keats has compressed the vague feelings of beauty of melancholy of immortal aspiration which come to sensitive souls in the season of mists and mellow fruitfulness it may be compared or rather contrasted with another poem on the same subject which voices the despair in the heart of the french poet verlaine who hears the sobbing of the violins of autumn    les sanglots longs   des violons       de lautomne   blessent mon coeur   dune langueur       monotone  keats an essay of criticism beyond recommending a few of his poems for their beauty there is really so little to be said of keats that critics are at their wits end to express their appreciation so we read of keatss pure aestheticism his copious perfection his idyllic visualization his haunting poignancy of feeling his subtle felicities of diction his tone color and more to the same effect such criticisms are doubtless well meant but they are harder to follow than keatss endymion and that is no short or easy road of poesy perhaps by trying more familiar ways we may better understand keats why he appeals so strongly to poets and why he is so seldom read by other people  sidenote the sense of beauty  the first characteristic of the man was his love for every beautiful thing he saw or heard sometimes the object which fascinated him was the widespread sea or a solitary star sometimes it was the work of man the product of his heart and brain attuned such as a passage from homer a legend of the middle ages a vase of pure lines amid the rubbish of a museum like a bird call or the scent of violets in a city street whatever the object that aroused his sense of beauty he turned aside to stay with it a while as on the byways of europe you will sometimes see a man lay down his burden and bare his head before a shrine that beckons him to pray with this reverence for beauty keats had other and rarer qualities the power to express what he felt the imagination which gave him beautiful figures and the taste which enabled him to choose the finest words the most melodious phrases wherewith to reflect his thought or mood or emotion  such was the power of keats to be simple and reverent in the presence of beauty and to give his feeling poetic or imaginative expression in respect of such power he probably had no peer in english literature his limitations were twofold he looked too exclusively on the physical side of beauty and he lived too far removed from the common wholesome life of men  sidenote sense and soul  to illustrate our criticism that man whom we saw by the wayside shrine acknowledged the presence of some spiritual beauty and truth the beauty of holiness the ineffable loveliness of god so the man who trains a child or gives thanks for a friend or remembers his mother is always at heart a lover of beautythe moral beauty of character of comradeship of selfsacrifice but the poetry of keats deals largely with outward matters with form color melody odors with what is called sensuous beauty because it delights our human senses such beauty is good but it is not supreme moreover the artist who would appeal widely to men must by sympathy understand their whole life their mirth as well as their sorrow their days of labor their hours of play their moments of worship but keats living apart with his ideal of beauty like a hermit in his cell was able to understand and to voice only one of the profound interests of humanity for this reason and because of the deep note of sadness which sounds through all his work like the monotone of the sea his exquisite poems have never had any general appreciation like spenser who was his first master he is a poets poet                                       minor poets of romanticism  in the early nineteenth century the literary annuals appeared took root and flourished mightily in england and america these annuals such a vigorous crop should have been called hardy annuals were collections of contemporary prose or verse that appeared once a year under such sentimental names as friendships offering the token and the garland that they were sold in large numbers on both sides of the atlantic speaks of the growing popular interest in literature moreover they served an excellent purpose at a time when books and libraries were less accessible than they are now they satisfied the need of ordinary readers for poetry and romance they often made known to the world a talented author who found in public approval that sweet encouragement which critics denied him they made it unlikely that henceforth some mute inglorious milton should remain either mute or inglorious and they not only preserved the best work of minor poets but what is much better they gave it a wide reading  thanks to such collections from which every newspaper filled its poets corner good poems which else might have hid their little light under a bushelcampbells hohenlinden mrs hemans landing of the pilgrim fathers hunts abou ben adhem hoods the song of the shirt and many othersare now as widely known as are the best works of wordsworth or byron  illustration leigh hunt  we can name only a few poets of the age leaving the reader to form acquaintance with their songs in an anthology especially worthy of remembrance are thomas campbell who greatly influenced the american poets halleck and drake thomas moore whose irish melodies have an attractive singing quality james hogg the ettrick shepherd john keble author of the christian year thomas hood felicia hemans and leigh hunt whose encouragement of keats is as memorable as his abou ben adhem or the glove and the lions there are other poets of equal rank with those we have ventured to name and their melodious quality is such that a modern critic has spoken of them in terms commonly applied to the elizabethans as a nest of singing birds which would be an excellent figure if we could forget the fact that birds in a nest never sing their work is perhaps less imaginative and certainly less fantastic than that of elizabethan singers but it comes nearer to present life and reality  one of the least known of these minor poets thomas beddoes was gifted in a way to remind us of the strange genius of blake he wrote not much his life being too broken and disappointed but running through his scanty verse is a thread of the pure gold of poetry in a single stanza of his dream pedlary he has reflected the spirit of the whole romantic movement    if there were dreams to sell        what would you buy   some cost a passing bell        some a light sigh   that shakes from lifes fresh crown   only a rose leaf down   if there were dreams to sell   merry and sad to tell   and the crier rang the bell       what would you buy                                       the work of walter scott 17711832  to read scott is to read scotland of no other modern author can it so freely be said that he gave to literature a whole country its scenery its people its history and traditions its ideals of faith and courage and loyalty  that is a large achievement but that is not all it was scott more than any other author who brought poetry and romance home to ordinary readers and with romance came pleasure wholesome and refreshing as a drink from a living spring when he began to write the novel was in a sad statesentimental sensational fantastic devoted to what charles lamb described as wildly improbable events and to characters that belong neither to this world nor to any other conceivable one when his work was done the novel had been raised to its present position as the most powerful literary influence that bears upon the human mind among novelists therefore scott deserves his title of the first of the modern race of giants      life to his family descendants of the old borderers scott owed     that intensely patriotic quality which glows in all his work he is     said to have borne strong resemblance to his grandfather old     bardie scott an unbending clansman who vowed never to cut his     beard till a stuart prince came back to the throne the clansmen     were now citizens of the empire but their loyalty to hereditary     chiefs is reflected in scotts reverence for everything pertaining     to rank or royalty      sidenote first impressions      he was born 1771 in edinburgh but his early associations were     all of the open country some illness had left him lame of foot     and with the hope of a cure he was sent to relatives at sandy     knowe there in the heart of the border he spent his days on the     hills with the shepherds listening to scottish legends at bedtime     his grandmother told him tales of the clans and when he could read     for himself he learned by heart percys reliques of ancient     poetry so the scenes which he loved because of their wild     beauty became sacred because of their historical association even     in that early day his heart had framed the sentiment which found     expression in his lay of the last minstrel        breathes there the man with soul so dead       who never to himself hath said             this is my own my native land      sidenote work and play      at school and at college at edinburgh the boys heart was never     in his books unless perchance they contained something of the     tradition of scotland after college he worked in his fathers law     office became an advocate and for twenty years followed the law     his vacations were spent making raids as he said into the     highlands adding to his enormous store of old tales and ballads a     companion on one of these trips gives us a picture of the man          eh me sic an endless fund o humour and drollery as he         had wi him never ten yards but we were either laughing or         roaring and singing whenever we stopped how brawlie he         suited himsel to everybody he aye did as the lave did         never made himsel the great man or took ony airs in the         company      this boyish delight in roaming in new scenes in new people met     frankly under the open sky is characteristic of scotts poems and     novels which never move freely until they are out of doors the     vigor of these works may be partially accounted for by the fact     that scott was a hard worker and a hearty playera capital     combination      sidenote his poems      he was past thirty when he began to write footnote this refers     to original composition in 1796 scott published some translations     of german romantic ballads and in 1802 his minstrelsy of the     scottish border the latter was a collection of old ballads to     some of which scott gave a more modern form by that time he had     been appointed clerk of sessions and also sheriff of selkirkshire     he took that hangmans job and kept it even after he had won     fame just for the money there was in it and these offices     together with his wifes dowry provided a comfortable income when     his first poem the lay of the last minstrel 1805 met     with immense success he gladly gave up the law and wrote     marmion 1808 and the lady of the lake 1810 these     increased his good fortune but his later poems were of inferior     quality and met with a cool reception meanwhile byron had     appeared to dazzle the reading public scott recognized the greater     poetic genius of the author of childe harold and sought     another field where he was safe from all rivals      illustration walter scott      sidenote first romances      rummaging in a cabinet one day after some fishing tackle he found     a manuscript long neglected and forgotten instead of going fishing     scott read his manuscript was fascinated by it and presently     began to write in headlong fashion in three weeks he added     sixtyfive chapters to his old romance and published it as     waverley 1814 without signing his name then he went away     on another raid to the highlands when he returned at the end of     the summer he learned that his book had made a tremendous     sensation and that fame hat in hand had been waiting at his door     for some weeks      in the next ten years scott won his name of the wizard of the     north for it seemed that only magic could produce stories of such     quality in such numbers guy mannering rob roy     old mortality redgauntlet heart of     midlothian portraying the deathless romance of scotland and     ivanhoe kenilworth the talisman and other     novels which changed dull history to a drama of fascinating     characters not only england but the continent hailed this     magnificent work with delight money and fame poured in upon the     author fortune appeared for once with both hands full then the     crash came      to understand the calamity one must remember that scott regarded     literature not as an art but as a profitable business that he     aimed to be not a great writer but a lord of high degree he had     been made a baronet and was childishly proud of the title his     work and his vast earnings were devoted to the dream of a feudal     house which should endure through the centuries and look back to     sir walter as its noble founder while living modestly on his     income at ashestiel he had used the earnings of his poems to buy a     rough farm at clarty hole on the tweed and had changed its     unromantic name to abbotsford more land was rapidly added and     improved to make a lordly estate then came the building of a     castle where scott entertained lavishly as lavishly as any laird     or chieftain of the olden time offering to all visitors the     honors of scotland      illustration abbotsford      enormous sums were spent on this bubble and still more money was     needed to increase his income scott went into secret partnership     with his publishers indulged in speculative ventures ran the firm     upon the shoals drew large sums in advance of his earnings     suddenly came a business panic the publishing firm failed     miserably and at fifty five scott having too much honest pride to     take advantage of the bankruptcy laws found himself facing a debt     of more than a hundred thousand pounds      sidenote his last years      his last years were spent in an heroic struggle to retrieve his     lost fortunes he wrote more novels but without much zest or     inspiration he undertook other works such as the voluminous     life of napoleon for which he was hardly fitted but which     brought him money in large measure in four years he had repaid the     greater part of his debt but mind and body were breaking under the     strain when the end came in 1832 he had literally worked himself     to death the murmur of the tweed over its shallows music that he     had loved since childhood was the last earthly sound of which he     was conscious the house of abbotsford for which he had planned     and toiled went into strange hands and the noble family which he     had hoped to found died out within a few years only his work     remains and that endures the wear of time and the tooth of     criticism  the poems of scott three good poems of scott are marmion the lay of the last minstrel and the lady of the lake three others not so good are rokeby vision of don roderick and lord of the isles among these the lady of the lake is such a favorite that if one were to question the tourists who annually visit the trossachs a surprisingly large number of them would probably confess that they were led not so much by love of natural beauty as by desire to visit fair ellens isle and other scenes which scott has immortalized in verse  we may as well admit frankly that even the best of these poems is not firstclass that it shows careless workmanship and is lacking in the finer elements of beauty and imagination but scott did not aim to create a work of beauty his purpose was to tell a good story and in that he succeeded his lady of the lake for example has at least two virtues it holds the readers attention and it fulfills the first law of poetry which is to give pleasure  sidenote quality of the poems  another charm of the poems for young readers especially is that they are simple vigorous easily understood their rapid action and flying verse show hardly a trace of conscious effort reading them is like sweeping downstream with a good current no labor required save for steering and attention free for what awaits us around the next bend when the bend is passed scott has always something new and interesting charming scenery heroic adventure picturesque incidents such as the flight of the fiery cross to summon the clans interesting fragments of folklore and occasionally a ballad like lochinvar or a song like bonnie dundee which stays with us as a happy memory long after the poem is forgotten  a secondary reason for the success of these poems was that they satisfied a fashion very popular in scotts day which we have not yet outgrown that fashion was to attribute chivalrous virtues to outlaws and other merry men who in their own day and generation were imprisoned or hanged and who deserved their fate robin hoods gang for example or the raiders of the border were in fact a tough lot of thieves and cutthroats but when they appeared in romantic literature they must of course appeal to ladies so scott made them fine dashing manly fellows sacrificing to the fashion of the hour the truth of history and humanity as andrew lang says      in their own days the border riders were regarded as public     nuisances by statesmen who attempted to educate them by means of     the gibbet but now they were the delight of fine ladies     contending who should be most extravagant in encomium a blessing     on such fine ladies who know what is good when they see it     footnote quoted in nicoll and seccombe a history of english     literature vol ill p 957  scotts novels to appreciate the value of scotts work one should read some of the novels that were fashionable in his daysilly sentimental novels portraying the sensibilities of imaginary ladies footnote in america coopers first romance precaution 1820 was of this artificial type after scotts outdoor romances appeared cooper discovered his talent and wrote the spy and the leatherstocking tales maria edgeworth and jane austen began to improve or naturalize the english novel before scott attempted it that scott was influenced by this inane fashion appears plainly in some of his characters his fine ladies especially who pose and sentimentalize till we are mortally weary of them but this influence passed when he discovered his real power which was to portray men and women in vigorous action waverley rob roy ivanhoe redgauntletsuch stories of brave adventure were like the winds of the north bringing to novelreaders the tang of the sea and the earth and the heather they braced their readers for life made them feel their kinship with nature and humanity incidentally they announced that two new types of fiction the outdoor romance and the historical novel had appeared with power to influence the work of cooper thackeray dickens and a host of minor novelists  illustration the great window melrose abbey      sidenote groups of stories      the most convenient way of dealing with scotts works is to arrange     them in three groups in the first are the novels of scotland     waverley dealing with the loyalty of the clans to the     pretender old mortality with the faith and struggles of     the covenanters redgauntlet with the plots of the     jacobites the abbot and the monastery with the     traditions concerning mary queen of scots guy mannering the     antiquary and the heart of midlothian with private life     and humble scottish characters      in the second group are the novels which reveal the romance of     english history ivanhoe dealing with saxon and norman in     the stormy days when richard lionheart returned to his kingdom     kenilworth with the intrigues of elizabeths court the     fortunes of nigel with london life in the days of charles     first woodstock with cromwells iron age peveril of     the peak with the conflict between puritan and cavalier during     the restoration period      in the third group are the novels which take us to foreign lands     quentin durward showing us the french court as dominated by     the cunning of louis eleventh and the talisman dealing     with the third crusade      in the above list we have named not all but only the best of     scotts novels they differ superficially in scenes or incidents     they are all alike in motive which is to tell a tale of adventure     that shall be true to human nature no matter what liberties it may     take with the facts of history  sidenote quality of the novels  in all these novels the faults are almost as numerous as the virtues but while the faults appear small having little influence on the final result the virtues are big manly wholesomesuch virtues as only the greatest writers of fiction possess probably all scotts faults spring from one fundamental weakness he never had a high ideal of his own art he wrote to make money and was inclined to regard his days labor as so much scribbling hence his style is frequently slovenly lacking vigor and concentration his characters talk too much apparently to fill space he caters to the romantic fashion and at the same time indulges his tory prejudice by enlarging on the somewhat imaginary virtues of knights nobles feudal or royal institutions and so presents a onesided view of history  on the other hand scott strove to be true to the great movements of history and to the moral forces which in the end prevail in all human activity his sympathies were broad he mingled in comradeship with all classes of society saw the best in each and from his observation and sympathy came an enormous number of characters high or low good or bad grave or ridiculous but nearly all natural and human because drawn from life and experience  sidenote scene and incident  another of scotts literary virtues is his love of wild nature which led him to depict many grand or gloomy scenes partly for their own sake but largely because they formed a fitting background for human action thus the talisman opens with a pen picture of a solitary crusader moving across a sunscorched desert towards a distant island of green every line in that description points to action to the rush of a horseman from the oasis to the fierce trial of arms before the enemies speak truce and drink together from the same spring many another of scotts descriptions of wild nature is followed by some gallant adventure which we enjoy the more because we imagine that adventures ought to occur though they seldom do amid romantic surroundings  illustration scotts tomb in dryburgh abbey  what to read at least one novel in each group should be read but if it be asked which one the answer is as much a matter of taste as of judgment of the novels dealing with scottish life waverley which was scotts first attempt is still an excellent measure of his storytelling genius but there is more adventurous interest in old mortality or rob roy and in the heart of midlothian regarded by many as the finest of scotts works one feels closer to nature and human nature and especially to the heart of scotland ivanhoe is perhaps the best of the romances of english history and of stories dealing with adventure in strange lands the talisman will probably appeal strongest to young readers and quentin durward to their elders to these may be added the antiquary which is a good story and which has an element of personal interest in that it gives us glimpses of scott himself surrounded by old armor old legends old costumesmute testimonies to the dreams and deeds of yesterdays men and women  such novels should be read once for the story as scott intended and then if one should grow weary of modernproblem novels they may be read again for their wholesome bracing atmosphere for their tenderness and wisdom for their wide horizons for their joy of climbing to heights where we look out upon a glorious present and a yet more glorious past that is not dead but living                                       other fiction writers  of the work of walter scott we have already spoken when such a genius appears dominating his age we think of him as a great inventor and so he was but like most other inventors his trail had been blazed his way prepared by others who had gone before him his first romance waverley shows the influence of earlier historical romances such as jane porters thaddeus of warsaw and scottish chiefs in his later work he acknowledged his indebtedness to maria edgeworth whose castle rackrent had aroused enthusiasm at the beginning of the nineteenth century in brief the romantic movement greatly encouraged fiction writing and scott did excellently what many others were doing well  two things are noticeable as we review the fiction of this period the first that nearly all the successful writers were women footnote the list includes fanny burney ann radcliffe jane porter maria edgeworth susan ferrier sydney owenson lady morgan mary brunton hannah more mary russell mitfordall of whom were famous in their day and each of whom produced at least one best seller the second that of these writers only one the most neglected by her own generation holds a secure place in the hearts of presentday readers if it be asked why jane austens works endure while others are forgotten the answer is that almost any trained writer can produce a modern romance but it takes a genius to write a novel footnote the difference between the modern romance and the novel is evident in the works of scott and miss austen scott takes an unusual subject he calls up kings nobles chieftains clansmen robber baronsa host of picturesque characters he uses his imagination freely and makes a story for the storys sake miss austen takes an ordinary country village observes its people as through a microscope and portrays them to the life she is not interested in making a thrilling story but in showing us men and women as they are and our interest is held by the verity of her portrayal for a different distinction between romance and novel see the early english novel above chapter vi  illustration mrs hannah more  jane austen the rare genius of miss austen 17751817 was as a forest flower during her lifetime while fanny burney jane porter and maria edgeworth were widely acclaimed this little woman remained almost unknown following no school of fiction writing for her own pleasure and destroying whatever did not satisfy her own sense of fitness if she had any theory of fiction it was simply this to use no incident but such as had occurred before her eyes to describe no scene that was not familiar and to portray only such characters as she knew intimately their speech dress manner and the motives that governed their action if unconsciously she followed any rule of expression it was that of cowper who said that to touch and retouch is the secret of almost all good writing to her theory and rule she added personal charm intelligence wit genius of a high order neglected by her own generation she has now an everwidening circle of readers and is ranked by critics among the five or six greatest writers of english fiction      sidenote her life      jane austens life was short and extremely placid she was born     1775 in a little hampshire village she spent her entire life in     one country parish or another varying the scene by an occasional     summer at the wateringplace of bath which was not very exciting     her father was an easygoing clergyman who read pope avoided     politics and left preaching to his curate she was one of a large     family of children who were brought up to regard elegance of     manner as a cardinal virtue and vulgarity of any kind as the     epitome of the seven deadly sins her two brothers entered the     navy hence the flutter in her books whenever a naval officer comes     on a furlough to his native village she spent her life in homely     pleasant duties and did her writing while the chatter of family     life went on around her her only characters were visitors who came     to the rectory or who gathered around the teatable in a     neighbors house they were absolutely unconscious of the keen     scrutiny to which they were subjected no one whispered to them a     chiels amang ye takin notes and so they had no suspicion that     they were being transferred into books      the first three of miss austens novels were written at steventon     among her innocent subjects but her precious manuscripts went     begging in vain for a publisher footnote northanger     abbey pride and prejudice and sense and     sensibility were written between 1796 and 1799 when jane     austen had just passed her twentyfirst year her first novel was     bought by a publisher who neglected to print it the second could     not be sold till after the third was published in 1811 the last     three reflecting as in a glass the manners of another parish were     written at chawton near winchester then the good work suddenly     began to flag the same disease that a little later was to call     halt to keatss poetry of beauty now made an end of miss austens     portrayal of everyday life when she died 1817 she was only     fortytwo years old and her heart was still that of a young girl     a stainedglass window in beautiful old winchester cathedral speaks     eloquently of her life and work  sidenote novels and characters  if we must recommend one of miss austens novels perhaps pride and prejudice is the most typical but there is very little to justify this choice when the alternative is northanger abbey or emma or sense and sensibility or persuasion or mansfield park all are good the most definite stricture that one can safely make is that mansfield park is not so good as the others four of the novels are confined to country parishes but in northanger abbey and persuasion the horizon is broadened to include a watering place whither genteel folk went to take the air  the characters of all these novels are first the members of five or six families with their relatives who try to escape individual boredom by gregariousness and second more of the same kind assembled at a local fair or sociable here you meet a dull country squire or two a feebleminded baronet a curate laboriously upholding the burden of his dignity a doctor trying to hide his emptiness of mind by looking occupied an uncomfortable male person in tow of his wife maiden aunts fond mammas with their awkward daughters chatterboxes poor relations spoiled childrena characteristic gathering all these except the spoiled children talk with perfect propriety about the weather if in the course of a long day anything witty is said it is an accident a phenomenon conversation halts and everybody looks at the speaker as if he must have had a rush of brains to the head  sidenote her small field  such is jane austens little field an eddy of life revolving endlessly around small parish interests her subjects are not even the whole parish but only the quality whom the favored ones may meet at mrs bs afternoon at home they read proper novels knit wristlets discuss fevers and their remedies raise their eyebrows at gossip connive at matrimony and take tea the workers of the world enter not here neither do men of ideas nor social rebels nor the wicked nor the happily unworthy poor and the parish is blessed in having no reformers  in this barren field hopeless to romancers like scott there never was such another explorer as jane austen her demure observation is marvelously keen sometimes it is mischievous or even a bit malicious but always sparkling with wit or running over with good humor almost alone in that romantic age she had no story to tell and needed none she had never met any heroes or heroines plots adventures villains persecuted innocence skeletons in closetsall the ordinary machinery of fiction seemed to her absurd and unnecessary she was content to portray the life that she knew best and found it so interesting that a century later we share her enthusiasm and that is the genius of miss austen to interest us not by a romantic story but by the truth of her observation and by the fidelity of her portrayal of human nature especially of feminine nature  sidenote influence on english fiction  there is one more thing to note in connection with miss austens work namely her wholesome influence on the english novel in northanger abbey and in sense and sensibility she satirizes the popular romances of the period with their byronic heroes melodramatic horrors and perpetual harping on some pale heroines sensibilities her satire is perhaps the best that has been written on the subject so delicate so flashing so keen that a critic compares it to the exploit of saladin in the talisman who could not with his sword hack through an iron mace as richard did but who accomplished the more difficult feat of slicing a gossamer veil as it floated in the air  such satire was not lost yet it was miss austens example rather than her precept which put to shame the sentimental romances of her day and which influenced subsequent english fiction in the direction of truth and naturalness young people still prefer romance and adventure as portrayed by scott and his followers and that is as it should be but an increasingly large number of mature readers especially those who are interested in human nature find a greater charm in the novel of characters and manners as exemplified by jane austen                                       the critics and essayists  from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century or from shakespeare to wordsworth england was preparing a great literature and then appeared writers whose business or pleasure it was to appreciate that literature to point out its virtues or its defects to explain by what principle this or that work was permanent and to share their enjoyment of good prose and poetry with othersin a word the critics  in the list of such writers who give us literature at second hand the names of leigh hunt william hazlitt walter savage landor charles lamb and thomas de quincey are written large the two lastnamed are selected for special study not because of their superior critical ability for hazlitt was probably a better critic than either but because of a few essays in which these men left us an appreciation of life as they saw it for themselves at first hand  charles lamb 17751834 there is a little book called essays of elia which stands out from all other prose works of the age if we examine this book to discover the source of its charm we find it pervaded by a winsome human quality which makes us want to know the man who wrote it in this respect charles lamb differs from certain of his contemporaries wordsworth was too solitary coleridge and de quincey too unbalanced shelley too visionary and keats too aloof to awaken a feeling of personal allegiance but the essays of lamb reveal two qualities which like fine gold are current among readers of all ages these are sympathy and humor by the one we enter understandingly into life while the other keeps us from taking life too tragically  illustration charles lamb from the engraving by s aslent edwards      sidenote his life      lamb was born 1775 in the midst of london and never felt at home     anywhere else london is a world in itself and of all its corners     there were only three that lamb found comfortable the first was     the modest little home where he lived with his gifted sister mary     reading with her through the long evenings or tenderly caring for     her during a period of insanity the second was the commercial     house where he toiled as a clerk the third was the busy street     which lay between home and worka street forever ebbing and     flowing with a great tide of human life that affected lamb     profoundly mysteriously as wordsworth was affected by the hills     or the sea      the boys education began at christs hospital where he met     coleridge and entered with him into a lifelong friendship at     fifteen he left school to help support his family and for the next     thirtythree years he was a clerk first in the south sea house     then in the east india company rather late in life he began to     write his prime object being to earn a little extra money which     he sadly needed then the company influenced partly by his     faithful service and partly by his growing reputation retired him     on a pension most eagerly like a boy out of school he welcomed     his release intending to do great things with his pen but     curiously enough he wrote less and less excellently than before     his decline began with his hour of liberty for a time in order     that his invalid sister might have quiet he lived outside the     city at islington and enfield but he missed the work the street     the crowd and especially did he miss his old habits he had no     feeling for nature nor for any art except that which he found in     old books i hate the country he wrote and the cause of his     dislike was that not knowing what to do with himself he grew     weary of a day that was all day long  illustration east india house london where charles lamb worked for many years from an engraving by m tombleson after a drawing made by thomas h shepherd in 1829  the earlier works of lamb some poems a romance and a drama are of little interest except to critics the first book that brought him any considerable recognition was the tales from shakespeare this was a summary of the stories used by shakespeare in his plays and was largely the work of mary lamb who had a talent for writing childrens books the charm of the tales lies in the fact that the lambs were so familiar with old literature that they reproduced the stories in a style which might have done credit to a writer in the days of elizabeth the book is still widely read and is as good as any other if one wants that kind of book but the chief thing in macbeth or the tempest is the poetry not the tale or the plot and even if one wants only the story why not get it from shakespeare himself another and better book by lamb of the same general kind is specimens of english dramatic poets contemporary with shakespeare in this book he saves us a deal of unprofitable reading by gathering together the best of the elizabethan dramas to which he adds some admirable notes of criticism or interpretation  illustration mary lamb after the portrait by f s cary  sidenote essays of elia  most memorable of lambs works are the essays which he contributed for many years to the london magazines and which he collected under the titles essays of elia 1823 and last essays of elia 1830 footnote the name elia pronounced eeliä was a pseudonym taken from an old italian clerk ellia in the south sea house when elia appears in the essays he is charles lamb himself cousin bridget is sister mary and john elia is a brother the lastnamed was a selfish kind of person who seems to have lived for himself letting charles take all the care of the family to the question which of these essays should be read the answer given must depend largely upon personal taste they are all good they all contain both a reflection and a criticism of life as lamb viewed it by light of his personal experience a good way to read the essays therefore is to consider them as somewhat autobiographical and to use them for making acquaintance with the author at various periods of his life  for example my relations and mackery end acquaint us with lambs family and descent old benchers of the inner temple with his early surroundings witches and other nightfears with his sensitive childhood recollections of christs hospital and christs hospital fiveandthirty years ago with his school days and comradeship with coleridge the south sea house with his daily work old china with his home life the superannuated man with his feelings when he was retired on a pension and finally character of the late elia in which lamb whimsically writes his own obituary  if these call for too much reading at first then one may select three or four typical essays dream children notable for its exquisite pathos dissertation on roast pig famous for its peculiar humor and praise of chimney sweepers of which it is enough to say that it is just like charles lamb to these one other should be added imperfect sympathies or a chapter on ears or mrs battles opinions on whist in order to appreciate how pleasantly lamb could write on small matters of no consequence still another good way of reading which need not be emphasized since everybody favors it is to open the essays here or there till we find something that interests usa method which allows every reader the explorers joy of discovery  to read such essays is to understand the spell they have cast on successive generations of readers they are first of all very personal they begin as a rule with some pleasant trifle that interests the author then almost before we are aware they broaden into an essay of life itself an essay illuminated by the steady light of lambs sympathy or by the flashes of his whimsical humor next we note in the essays their air of literary culture which is due to lambs wide reading and to the excellent taste with which he selected his old authorssidney brown burton fuller walton and jeremy taylor often it was the quaintness of these authors their conceits or oddities that charmed him these oddities reappear in his own style to such an extent that even when he speaks a large truth as he often does he is apt to give the impression of being a little harebrained yet if you examine his queer idea or his merry jest you may find that it contains more cardinal virtue than many a sober moral treatise  illustration the lamb building inner temple london  on the whole elia is the quintessence of modern essaywriting from addison to stevenson there are probably no better works of the same kind in our literature some critics aver that there are none others so good  thomas de quincey 17851859 it used to be said in a college classroom that what de quincey wrote was seldom important and always doubtful but that we ought to read him for his style which means as you might say that caviar is a stomachupsetting food but we ought to eat a little of it because it comes in a pretty box  to this criticism which reflects a prevalent opinion we may take some exceptions for example what de quincey has to say of style though it were written in styledefying german is of value to everyone who would teach that impossible subject what he says or implies in levana the goddess who performed the earliest office of ennobling kindness for a newborn child lifting him from the ground where he was first laid and presenting his forehead to the stars of heaven has potency to awaken two of the great faculties of humanity the power to think and the power to imagine again many people are fascinated by dreams those mysterious fantasies which carry us away on swift wings to meet strange experiences and what de quincey has to say of dreams though doubtful as a dream itself has never been rivaled to a few mature minds therefore de quincey is interesting entirely apart from his dazzling style and inimitable rhetoric  illustration thomas de quincey from an engraving by c h jeens      to do justice to de quinceys erratic stormtossed life to record     his precocious youth his marvelous achievements in school or     college his wanderings amid lonely mountains or more lonely city     streets his drug habits with their gorgeous dreams and terrible     depressions his timidity his courtesy his soulsolitude his     uncanny geniusall that is impossible in a brief summary let it     suffice then to record that he resembled his friend coleridge     both in his character and in his vast learning that he studied in     profound seclusion for twenty years then for forty years more     during which time his brain was more or less beclouded by opium he     poured out a flood of magazine articles which he collected later     in fourteen chaotic volumes these deal with an astonishing variety     of subjects and cover almost every phase of mental activity from     portraying a nightmare to building a philosophical system if he     had any dominating interest in his strange life it was the study     of literature  sidenote typical works  the historian can but name a few characteristic works of de quincey without recommending any of them to readers to those interested in de quinceys personality his confessions of an english opiumeater will be illuminating this book astonished londoners in 1821 and may well astonish a bushman in the year 2000 it records his wandering life and the alternate transport or suffering which resulted from his drug habits this may be followed by his suspiria de profundis sighs from the depths which describes as well as such a thing could be done the phantoms born of opium dreams there are too many of the latter and the reader may well be satisfied with the wonderful dream fugue in the english mail coach  illustration dove cottage grasmere here both wordsworth and de quincey resided  as an illustration of de quinceys review of history one should try joan of arc or the revolt of the tartars which are not historical studies but romantic dreams inspired by reading history in the critical field the knocking at the gate in macbeth wordsworths poetry and the essay on style are immensely suggestive as an example of ingenious humor murder considered as one of the fine arts is often recommended but it has this serious fault that it is not humorous for a concrete example of de quinceys matter and manner there is nothing better than levana or our ladies of sorrow from the suspiria with its mater lachrymarum our lady of tears mater suspiriorum our lady of sighs and that strange phantom forbidding and terrible mater tenebrarum our lady of darkness  sidenote de quinceys style  the style of all these works is indescribable one may exhaust the whole list of adjectiveschanting rhythmic cadenced harmonious impassionedthat have been applied to it and yet leave much to say therefore we note only these prosaic elements that the style reflects de quinceys powers of logical analysis and of brilliant imagination that it is pervaded by a tremendous mental excitement though one does not know what the stir is all about and that the impression produced by this nervous impassioned style is usually spoiled by digressions by hairsplitting and by something elusive intangible to which we can give no name but which blurs the authors vision as a drifting fog obscures a familiar landscape  notwithstanding such strictures de quinceys style is still as when it first appeared a thing to marvel at revealing as it does the grace the harmony the wide range and the minute precision of our english speech                                           summary the early nineteenth century is notable for the rapid     progress of democracy in english government and for the triumph of     romanticism in english literature the most influential factor of     the age was the french revolution with its watchwords of liberty     equality fraternity english writers felt the stir of the times     and were inspired by the dream of a new human society ruled by     justice and love in their writing they revolted from the formal     standards of the age of pope followed their own genius rather than     set rules and wrote with feeling and imagination of the two great     subjects of nature and humanity such was the contrast in politics     and literature with the preceding century that the whole period is     sometimes called the age of revolution      our study of the literature of the period includes 1 the poets     wordsworth and coleridge who did not so much originate as give     direction to the romantic revival 2 byron and shelley often     called revolutionary poets 3 the poet keats whose works are     famous for their sense of beauty and for their almost perfect     workmanship 4 a review of the minor poets of romanticism     campbell moore hood beddoes hunt and felicia hemans 5 the     life and works of walter scott romantic poet and novelist 6 a     glance at the fiction writers of the period and a study of the     works of jane austen 7 the critics and essayists of whom we     selected these two as the most typical charles lamb famous

glow   ere thou hast sailed them through                         kingsley a myth       historical outline amid the many changes which make the reign of     victoria the most progressive in english history one may discover     three tendencies which have profoundly affected our present life     and literature the first is political and democratic it may be     said to have begun with the reform bill of 1832 it is still in     progress and its evident end is to deliver the government of     england into the hands of the common people in earlier ages we     witnessed a government which laid stress on royalty and class     privilege the spirit of which was clarioned by shakespeare in the     lines        not all the water in the rough rude sea       can wash the balm from an anointed king      in the victorian or modern age the divine right of kings is as     obsolete as a suit of armor the privileges of royalty and nobility     are either curbed or abolished and ordinary men by their     representatives in the house of commons are the real rulers of     england      with a change in government comes a corresponding change in     literature in former ages literature was almost as exclusive as     politics it was largely in the hands of the few it was supported     by princely patrons it reflected the taste of the upper classes     now the masses of men begin to be educated begin to think for     themselves and a host of periodicals appear in answer to their     demand for reading matter poets novelists essayists     historiansall serious writers feel the inspiration of a great     audience and their works have a thousand readers where formerly     they had but one in a word english government society and     literature have all become more democratic this is the most     significant feature of modern history      sidenote the scientific spirit      the second tendency may be summed up in the word scientific at     the basis of this tendency is mans desire to know the truth if     possible the whole truth of life and it sets no limits to the     exploring spirit whether in the heavens above or the earth beneath     or the waters under the earth from stardust in infinite space     which we hope to measure to fossils on the bed of an ocean which     is no longer unfathomed nothing is too great or too small to     attract man to fascinate him to influence his thought his life     his literature darwins origin of species 1859 which     laid the foundation for a general theory of evolution is one of     the most famous books of the age and of the world associated with     darwin were wallace lyell huxley tyndall and many others whose     essays are in their own way quite as significant as the poems of     tennyson or the novels of dickens      it would be quite as erroneous to allege that modern science began     with these men as to assume that it began with the chinese or with     roger bacon the most that can be said truthfully is that the     scientific spirit which they reflected began to dominate our     thought to influence even our poetry and fiction even as the     voyages of drake and magellan furnished a mighty and mysterious     background for the play of human life on the elizabethan stage the     elizabethans looked upon an enlarging visible world and the wonder     of it is reflected in their prose and poetry the victorians     overran that world almost from pole to pole then turned their     attention to an unexplored world of invisible forces and their     best literature thrills again with the grandeur of the universe in     which men live      sidenote imperialism      a third tendency of the victorian age in england is expressed by     the word imperialism in earlier ages the work of planting     english colonies had been well done in the victorian age the     scattered colonies increased mightily in wealth and power and were     closely federated into a worldwide empire of people speaking the     same noble speech following the same high ideals of justice and     liberty      the literature of the period reflects the wide horizons of the     empire among historical writers parkman the american was one of     the first and best to reflect the imperial spirit in such works as     a halfcentury of conflict and montcalm and wolfe he     portrayed the conflict not of one nation against another but rather     of two antagonistic types of civilization the military and feudal     system of france against the democratic institutions of the     anglosaxons among the explorers mungo park had anticipated the     victorians in his travels in the interior of africa 1799     a wonderful book which set england to dreaming great dreams but     not until the heroic livingstones missionary travels and     research in south africa the zambesi and its tributaries and     last journals footnote in connection with livingstones     works stanleys how i found livingstone 1872 should also     be read livingstone died in africa in 1873 and his     journals were edited by another hand for a summary of his     work and its continuation see livingstone and the exploration of     central africa london 1897 appeared was the veil lifted     from the dark continent beside such works should be placed     numerous stirring journals of exploration in canada in india in     australia in tropical or frozen seaswherever in the round world     the colonizing genius of england saw opportunity to extend the     boundaries and institutions of the empire macaulays warren     hastings edwin arnolds indian idylls kiplings     soldiers threea few such works must be read if we are to     appreciate the imperial spirit of modern english history and     literature                                       i poets of the victorian age  alfred tennyson 18091892  though the victorian age is notable for the quality and variety of its prose works its dominant figure for years was the poet tennyson he alone of all that brilliant group of victorian writers seemed to speak not for himself but for his age and nation and the nation grown weary of byronic rebellion and finding its joy or sorrow expressed with almost faultless taste by one whose life was noble gave to tennyson a wholesouled allegiance such as few poets have ever won in 1850 he was made laureate to succeed wordsworth receiving as he said    this laurel greener from the brow   of him that uttered nothing base  and from that time on he steadily adhered to his purpose which was to know his people and to be their spokesman of all the poets who have been called to the laureateship he is probably the only one of whom it can truthfully be said that he understood his high office and was worthy of it      life when we attempt a biography of a person we assume     unconsciously that he was a public man but that is precisely what     tennyson refused to be he lived a retired life of thoughtfulness     of communion with nature of friendships too sacred for the worlds     gaze a life blameless in conduct unswerving in its loyalty to     noble ideals from boyhood to old age he wrote poetry and in that     poetry alone not in biography or letters or essays of criticism     do we ever touch the real man      illustration tennysons birthplace somersby rectory     lincolnshire      tennyson was the son of a cultured clergyman and was born in the     rectory of somersby lincolnshire in 1809 the same year that saw     the birth of lincoln and darwin like milton he devoted himself to     poetry at an early age in his resolve he was strengthened by his     mother and from it he never departed the influences of his early     life the quiet beauty of the english landscape the surge and     mystery of the surrounding sea the emphasis on domestic virtues     the pride and love of an englishman for his country and his     countrys historythese are everywhere reflected in the poets     work      his education was largely a matter of reading under his fathers     direction he had a short experience of the grammar school at     louth which he hated forever after he entered cambridge and     formed a circle of rare friends apostles they called themselves     who afterwards became famous but he left college without taking a     degree probably because he was too poor to continue his course     not till 1850 did he earn enough by his work to establish a home of     his own then he leased a house at farringford isle of wight     which we have ever since associated with tennysons name but his     real place is the heart of england      sidenote a poet and his critics      his first book a boyish piece of work undertaken with his brother     charles appeared under the title poems by two brothers     1827 in 1830 and again in 1832 he published a small volume     containing such poems as the palace of art the lotoseaters     the lady of shalott and the millers daughter but the critics     of the age overlooking the poets youth and its promise treated     the volumes unmercifully tennyson always sensitive to criticism     was sensible enough to see that the critics had ground for their     opinions if not for their harshness and for ten long years while     he labored to perfect his art his name did not again appear in     print      there was another reason for his silence in 1833 his dearest     friend arthur hallam died suddenly in vienna and it was years     before tennyson began to recover from the blow his first     expression of grief is seen in the lyric beginning break break     break which contains the memorable stanza        and the stately ships go on         to their haven under the hill       but o for the touch of a vanished hand        and the sound of a voice that is still      then he began that series of elegies for his friend which appeared     seventeen years later as in memoriam      sidenote he wins and holds his place      influenced by his friends tennyson broke his long silence with a     volume containing morte darthur locksley hall sir galahad     lady clare and a few more poems which have never lost their power     over readers but it must have commanded attention had it contained     only ulysses that magnificent appeal to manhood reflecting the     indomitable spirit of all those restless explorers who dared     unknown lands or seas to make wide the foundations of imperial     england it was a wonderful volume and almost its first effect was     to raise the hidden tennyson to the foremost place in english     letters      whatever he wrote thereafter was sure of a wide reading critics     workingmen scientists reformers theologiansall recognized the     power of the poet to give melodious expression to their thought or     feeling yet he remained averse to everything that savored of     popularity devoting himself as in earlier days to poetry alone as     a critic writes tennyson never forgot that the poets work was to     convince the world of love and beauty that he was born to do that     work and do it worthily      there are two poems which are especially significant in view of     this steadfast purpose the first is merlin and the gleam which     reflects tennysons lifelong devotion to his art the other is     crossing the bar which was his farewell and hail to life when     the end came in 1892  works of tennyson there is a wide variety in tennysons work legend romance battle song nature classic and medieval heroes problems of society questions of science the answer of faithalmost everything that could interest an alert victorian mind found some expression in his poetry it ranges in subject from a thrush song to a religious philosophy in form from the simplest love lyric to the labored historical drama  sidenote typical short poems  of the shorter poems of tennyson there are a few which should be known to every student first because they are typical of the man who stands for modern english poetry and second because one is constantly meeting references to these poems in books or magazines or even newspapers among such representative poems are the lotoseaters a dream picture characterized by a beauty and verbal melody that recall spensers work locksley hall and locksley hall sixty years after the one a romance throbbing with youth and hope the other representing the same hero grown old despondent and a little carping but still holding fast to his ideals sir galahad a medieval romance of purity ulysses an epitome of exploration in all ages the revenge a stirring war song rizpah a dramatic portrayal of a mothers grief for a wayward son romneys remorse a character study of tennysons later years and a few shorter poems such as the higher pantheism flower in the crannied wall wages and the making of man which reflect the poets mood before the problems of science and of faith  illustration alfred tennyson  to these should be added a few typical patriotic pieces which show tennyson speaking as poet laureate for his country ode on the death of wellington charge of the light brigade defense of lucknow hands all round and the imperial appeal of britons hold your own or as it is tamely called opening of the indian and colonial exposition the beginner may also be reminded of certain famous little melodies such as the bugle song sweet and low tears the brook far far away and crossing the bar which are among the most perfect that england has produced and as showing tennysons extraordinary power of youthful feeling at least one lyric of his old age should be read such as the throstle a song that will appeal especially to all bird lovers beginning    summer is coming summer is coming      i know it i know it i know it   light again leaf again life again love again      yes my wild little poet  here tennyson is so merged in his subject as to produce the impression that the lyric must have been written not by an aged poet but by the bird himself reading the poem one seems to hear the brown thrasher on a twig of the wildapple tree pouring his heart out over the thicket which his mate has just chosen for a nesting place  sidenote idylls of the king  of the longer works of tennyson the most notable is the idylls of the king a series of twelve poems retelling part of the story of arthur and his knights tennyson seems to have worked at this poem in haphazard fashion writing the end first then a fragment here or there at intervals during half a century finally he welded his material into its present form making it a kind of allegory of human life in which mans animal nature fights with his spiritual aspirations as tennyson wrote in his finale to queen victoria          accept this old imperfect tale   newold and shadowing sense at war with soul  the beginner will do well to forget the allegory and read the poem for its sustained beauty of expression and for its reflection of the modern ideal of honor for though malory and tennyson tell the same story there is this significant difference between the morte d arthur and the idylls of the king one is thoroughly medieval and the other almost as thoroughly modern malory in simple prose makes his story the expression of chivalry in the middle ages his heroes are true to their own time and place tennyson in melodious blank verse changes his material freely so as to make it a reflection of a nineteenthcentury gentleman disguised in a suit of armor and some old knightly raiment  one may add that some readers cleave to tennyson while others greatly prefer malory there is little or no comparison between the two and selections from both should be read if only to understand how this old romance of arthur has appealed to writers of different times in making a selection from the idylls the length of the poem is rather forbidding it is well to begin with the twelfth book the passing of arthur which was first to be written and which reflects the noble spirit of the entire work  in the princess a medley the poet attempts the difficult task of combining an old romantic story with a modern social problem and he does not succeed very well in harmonizing his incongruous materials      sidenote the princess      the story is briefly of a princess who in youth is betrothed to a     prince when she reaches what is called the age of discretion     doubtless because that age is so frequently marked by     indiscretions she rebels against the idea of marriage and founds     a college herself the principal devoted to the higher education     of women the prince a gallant blade and a few of his followers     disguise themselves as girls and enter the school when an unruly     masculine tongue betrays him he is cast out with maledictions on     his head his father comes with an army and makes war against the     father of the princess the prince joins blithely in the fight is     sore wounded and is carried to the womans college as to a     hospital the princess nurses him listens to his love tale and     the story ends in the good oldfashioned way  there are many beautiful passages in the princess and had tennyson been content to tell the romantic story his work would have had some pleasant suggestion of shakespeares as you like it but the social problem spoils the work as a moralizing intruder spoils a bit of innocent fun tennyson is either too serious or not serious enough he does not know the answer to his own problem and is not quite sincere in dealing with it or in coming to his lame and impotent conclusion few readers now attempt the three thousand lines of the princess but content themselves with a few lyrics such as ask me no more o swallow flying south tears bugle song and sweet and low which are familiar songs in many households that remember not whence they came footnote the above criticism of the princess applies in some measure to tennysons maud a monodrama a story of passionate love and loss and sorrow tennyson wrote also several dramatic works such as harold becket and queen mary in which he attempted to fill some of the gaps in shakespeares list of chronicle plays  sidenote english idyls  more consistent than the princess is a group of poems reflecting the life and ideals of simple people to which tennyson gave the general name of english idyls the longest and in some respects the best of these is enoch arden a romance which was once very popular but which is now in danger of being shelved because the modern reader prefers his romance in prose form certain of the famous poems which we have already named are classed among these english idyls but more typical of tennysons purpose in writing them are dora the gardeners daughter and aylmers field in which he turns from ancient heroes to sing the romance of presentday life  illustration summerhouse at farringford here tennyson wrote enoch arden  among mature readers who have met the sorrows of life or pondered its problems the most admired of tennysons work is in memoriam 1850 an elegy inspired by the death of arthur hallam as a memorial poem it invites comparison with others with miltons lycidas or shelleys adonais or grays elegy in a country churchyard without going deeply into the comparison we may note this difference that tennysons work is more personal and sympathetic than any of the others milton had only a slight acquaintance with his human subject edward king and wrote his poem as a memorial for the college rather than for the man shelley had never met keats whose early death he commemorates gray voiced an impersonal melancholy in the presence of the unknown dead but tennyson had lost his dearest friend and wrote to solace his own grief and to keep alive a beautiful memory then as he wrote came the thought of other men and women mourning their dead his view broadened with his sympathy and he wrote other lyrics in the same strain to reflect the doubt or fear of humanity and its deathless faith even in the shadow of death  it is this combination of personal and universal elements which makes in memoriam remarkable the only other elegy to which we may liken it is emersons threnody written after the death of his little boy but where tennyson offers an elaborate wreath and a polished monument emerson is content with a rugged block of granite and a spray of natures evergreen      sidenote plan of the poem      in memoriam occupied tennyson at intervals for many years     and though he attempted to give it unity before its publication in     1850 it is still rather fragmentary moreover it is too long for     the poet never lived who could write a hundred and thirtyone     lyrics upon the same subject in the same manner without growing     monotonous      there are three more or less distinct parts of the work footnote     tennyson divided in memoriam into nine sections various     attempts have recently been made to organize the poem and to make a     philosophy of it but these are ingenious rather than convincing     corresponding to three successive christmas seasons the first part     extending to poem 30 is concerned with grief and doubt the     second to poem 78 exhibits a calm serious questioning of the     problem of faith the third introduces a great hope amid tender     memories or regrets and ends poem 106 with that splendid outlook     on a new year and a new life ring out wild bells this was     followed by a few more lyrics of mounting faith inspired by the     thought that divine love rules the world and that our human love is     immortal and cannot die the work ends rather incongruously with     a marriage hymn for tennysons sister      the spirit of in memoriam is well reflected in the proem     or introductory hymn strong son of god immortal love its     message is epitomized in the last three lines          one god one law one element         and one faroff divine event       to which the whole creation moves  the quality of tennyson the charm of tennyson is twofold as the voice of the victorian age reflecting its thought or feeling or culture its intellectual quest its moral endeavor its passion for social justice he represents to us the spirit of modern poetry that is poetry which comes close to our own life to the aims hopes endeavors of the men and women of today with this modern quality tennyson has the secret of all old poetry which is to be eternally young he looked out upon a world from which the first wonder of creation had not vanished where the sunrise was still a glorious birth and where love truth beauty all inspiring realities were still waiting with divine patience to reveal themselves to human eyes  there are other charms in tennyson his romantic spirit his love of nature his sense of verbal melody his almost perfect workmanship but these the reader must find and appreciate for himself the sum of our criticism is that tennyson is a poet to have handy on the table for the pleasure of an idle hour he is also and this is a better test an excellent poet to put in your pocket when you go on a journey so shall you be sure of traveling in good company                                       robert browning 18121889  in their lifelong devotion to a single purpose the two chief poets of the victorian age are much alike in most other respects they are men of contrasts tennyson looked like a poet browning like a business man tennyson was a solitary singer never in better company than when alone browning was a city man who must have the excitement of society tennysons field was the nation its traditions heroes problems ideals but browning seldom went beyond the individual man and his purpose was to play columbus to some obscure human soul tennyson was at times rather narrowly british browning was a cosmopolitan who dealt broadly with humanity tennyson was the poet of youth and will always be read by the young in heart browning was the philosopher the psychologist the poet of mature years and of a few cultivated readers      life browning portrays so many different human types as to make us     marvel but we may partly understand his wide range of     characterstudies by remembering he was an englishman with some     celtic and german ancestors and with a trace of creole     spanishnegro blood he was born and grew up at camberwell a     suburb of london and the early home of ruskin his father was a     bankofengland clerk a prosperous man and fond of books who     encouraged his boy to read and to let education follow the lead of     fancy before browning was twenty years old father and son had a     serious talk which ended in a kind of bargain the boy was to live     a life of culture and the father was to take care of all financial     mattersan arrangement which suited them both very well      illustration robert browning      since boyhood browning had been writing romantic verses influenced     first by byron then by shelley then by keats his first published     works pauline and paracelsus were what he called     soulstudies the one of a visionary a startreader its hero     was shelley the other of a medieval astrologer somewhat like     faust these two works if one had the patience of a puzzleworker     to read them would be found typical of all the longer poems that     browning produced in his sixty years of writing      these early works were not read were not even criticized and it     was not till 1846 that browning became famous not because of his     books but because he eloped with elizabeth barrett who was then     the most popular poet in england footnote the fame of miss     barrett in mid century was above that of tennyson or browning she     had been for a long time an invalid her father a tyrannical kind     of person insisted on her keeping her room and expected her to     die properly there he had no personal objection to browning but     flouted the idea of his famous daughter marrying with anybody the     two went to florence discovered that they were made for each     other and in mutual helpfulness did their best work they lived     at casa guidi a house made famous by the fact that brownings     men and women and mrs brownings sonnets from the     portuguese were written there      illustration mrs brownings tomb in the protestant cemetery at     florence      sidenote the browning cult      this happy period of work was broken by mrs brownings death in     1861 browning returned to england with his son and to forget his     loss he labored with unusual care on the ring and the book     1868 his bulkiest work the rest of his life was spent largely     in london and in venice fame came to him tardily and with some     unfortunate results he became known as a poet to be likened unto     shakespeare but more analytical calling for a superior     intelligence on the part of his readers and presently a multitude     of browning clubs sprang up in england and america delighted with     his popularity among the elect browning seems to have cultivated     his talent for obscurity or it may be that his natural     eccentricity of style increased with age as did wordsworths     prosiness whatever the cause his work grew steadily worse until a     succession of grammar defying volumes threatened to separate all     but a few devotees from their love of browning he died in venice     in 1889 on the day of his death appeared in london his last book     asolando the epilogue to that volume is a splendid finale     to a robust life        one who never turned his back but marched breast forward       never doubted clouds would break       never dreamed though right were worsted wrong would triumph       held we fall to rise are baffled to fight better       sleep to wake      tennysons crossing the bar is a beautiful swan song but     brownings last poem is a bugle call and it sounds not taps but     the reveille  brownings dramatic quality nearly all the works of browning are dramatic in spirit and are commonly dramatic also in form sometimes he writes a drama for the stage such as a blot in the scutcheon colombes birthday and in a balconydramas without much action but packed with thought in a way that would have delighted the schoolmen more often his work takes the form of a dramatic monologue such as my last duchess and the bishop orders his tomb in which one person speaks and like peter his speech bewrayeth him for he reveals very plainly the kind of man he is occasionally browning tries to sing like another poet but even here his dramatic instinct is strong he takes some crisis some unexpected meeting or parting of the ways of life and proceeds to show the heros character by the way he faces the situation or talks about it so when he attempts even a love song such as the last ride together or a ballad such as the pied piper he regards his subject from an unusual viewpoint and produces what he calls a dramatic lyric  sidenote action vs thought  there are at least two ways in which brownings work differs from that of other dramatists when a trained playwright produces a drama his rule is action more action and still more action moreover he stands aside in order to permit his characters to reveal their quality by their own speech or action for example shakespeares plays are filled with movement and he never tells you what he thinks of portia or rosalind or macbeth or what ought to become of them he does not need to tell but browning often halts his story to inform you how this or that situation should be met or what must come out of it his theory is that it is not action but thought which determines human character for a man may be doing what appears to be a brave or generous deed yet be craven or selfish at heart or he may be engaged in some apparently sinful proceeding in obedience to a motive that we would acclaim as noble if the whole truth were known it is the soul and its thoughts that make the man says browning little else is worthy of study so he calls most of his works soul studies if we label them now dramas or dramatic monologues or dramatic lyrics the three classifications of his works we are to remember that browning is the one dramatist who deals with thoughts or motives rather than with action  illustration the palazzo rezzonico brownings home in venice  what to read one should begin with the simplest of brownings works and preferably with those in which he shows some regard for verbal melody as romantic love is his favorite theme it is perhaps well to begin with a few of the love lyrics my star by the fireside evelyn hope and especially the last ride together to these may be added some of the songs that brighten the obscurity of his longer pieces such as i send my heart oh loveno love and theres a woman like a dewdrop next in order are the ballads the pied piper hervé riel and how they brought the good news and then a few miscellaneous short poems such as home thoughts from abroad prospice the boy and the angel and up at a villadown in the city  sidenote dramatic monologues  the above poems are named not because they are particularly fine examples of their kind but by way of introduction to a poet who is rather hard to read when these are known and are found not so obscure as we feared then will be the time to attempt some of brownings dramatic monologues of these there is a large variety portraying many different types of character but we shall name only a few andrea del sarto is a study of the great italian painter the perfect painter whose love for a pretty but shallow woman was as a millstone about his neck my last duchess is a powerfully drawn outline of a vain and selfish nobleman abt vogler is a study of the soul of a musician rabbi ben ezra one of the most typical of brownings works is the word of an old man who faces death as he had faced life with magnificent courage an epistle relates the strange experience of karshish an arab physician as recorded in a letter to his master abib karshish meets lazarus him who was raised from the dead and regarding him as a patient describes his symptomssuch symptoms as a man might have who must live on earth after having looked on heaven the physicians halfscoffing words show how his habitual skepticism is shaken by a glimpse of the unseen world he concludes but his doubt is stronger than his conclusion that lazarus must be a madman    and thou must love me who have died for thee   the madman saith he said so it is strange  sidenote saul  another poem belonging to the same group published under the general title of men and women is saul which finely illustrates the method that makes browning different from other poets he would select some familiar event the brief record of which is preserved in history and say here we see merely the deed the outward act or circumstance of life now let us get acquainted with these men or women by showing that they thought and felt precisely as we do under similar conditions in saul he reproduces the scene recorded in the sixteenth chapter of the first book of samuel where the king is troubled by an evil spirit and the young david comes to play the harp before him saul is represented as the disillusioned the despairing man who has lost all interest in life and david as the embodiment of youthful enthusiasm the poem is a remarkable portrayal of the ancient scene and characters but it is something greater than that it is a splendid song of the fullness and joy of a brave forwardlooking life inspired by noble ideals it is also one of the best answers ever given to the question is life worth living the length of the poem however and its many difficult or digressive passages are apt to repel the beginner unless he have the advantage of an abridged version  sidenote pippa passes  of the longer works of browning only pippa passes can be recommended with any confidence that it will give pleasure to the reader other works such as the ring and the book footnote the ring and the book is remarkable for other things than its inordinate length in it browning tells how he found an old book containing the record of a murder trial in romea horrible story of a certain count guido who in a jealous rage killed his beautiful young wife that is the only story element of the poem and it is told with many irritating digressions at the beginning the rest of the work is devoted to soul studies the subjects being nine different characters who rehearse the same story each for his own justification thus guido gives his view of the matter and pompilia the wife gives hers half rome siding with guido is personified to tell one tale and then the other half has its say final judgment rests with the pope an impressive figure who upholds the decision of the civil judges altogether it is a remarkable piece of work but it would have been more remarkable better in every way if fifteen thousand of its twenty thousand lines had been left in the inkpot are doubtless more famous but reading them is like solving a puzzle a few enjoy the matter and therefore count it pleasure but to the majority it is a task to be undertaken as mental discipline      pippa is the story of a working girl a silk weaver of     asolo who has a precious holiday and goes forth to enjoy it     wishing she could share her happiness with others especially with     the great people of her town but the great live in another world     she thinks a world far removed from that of the poor little     working girl so she puts the wish out of her head and goes on her     way singing        the years at the spring       and days at the morn       mornings at seven       the hillsides dewpearled       the larks on the wing       the snails on the thorn       gods in his heaven       alls right with the world      it happens that her songs come in succession to the ears of the     four greatest people in asolo at moments when they are facing a     terrible crisis when a straw may turn them one way or the other     to do evil or to do good in each case the song and the pure heart     of the singer turn the scale in the right direction but pippa     knows nothing of her influence she enjoys her holiday and goes to     bed still happy still singing quite ignorant of the wonder she     has accomplished  illustration piazza of san lorenzo florence where browning bought the book in which he found the story of the ring and the book  a mere storyteller would have brought pippa and the rescued ones together making an affecting scene with rewards in the romantic manner but browning is content to depict a bit of ordinary human life which is daily filled with deeds worthy to be written in a book of gold but of which only the recording angel takes any notice  a criticism of browning comparatively few people appreciate the force the daring the vitality of browning and those who know him best are least inclined to formulate a favorable criticism they know too well the faults of their hero his whims crotchets digressions garrulity his disjointed ideas like rich plums in a poor pudding his ejaculatory style as of a man of second thoughts his wingbound fancy which hops around his subject like a grasshopper instead of soaring steadily over it like an eagle many of his lines are rather gritty    irks care the cropfull bird frets doubt the mawcrammed beast  and half his blank verse is neither prose nor poetry    what you sir come too just the man id meet   be ruled by me and have a care o the crowd   this way while fresh folk go and get their gaze   ill tell you like a book and save your shins   fie what a roaring day weve had whose fault   lorenzo in lucinaheres a church  instead of criticism therefore his admirers offer this word of advice try to like browning in other words try to understand him he is not easy he is not to be read for relaxation after dinner but in the morning and in a straightbacked chair with eyes clear and intellect at attention if you so read him you must soon discover that he has something of courage and cheer which no other poet can give you in such full measure if you read nothing else try at least rabbi ben ezra and after the reading reflect that the optimism of this poem colors everything that the author wrote for browning differs from all other poets in this that they have their moods of doubt or despondency but he has no weary days or melancholy hours they sing at times in the twilight but browning is the herald of the sunrise always and everywhere he represents the will to live to live bravely confidently here then forward still with cheerful hearts to immortality    grow old along with me   the best is yet to be   the last of life for which the first was made   our times are in his hand   who saith a whole i planned   youth shows but half trust god see all nor be afraid                                       other victorian poets  elizabeth barrett browning 18061861 among the lesser poets of the age the most famous was elizabeth barrett who eloped in romantic fashion with browning in 1846 her early volumes written while she was an invalid seem now a little feverish but a few of her poems of childhood such as hector and little ellie have still their admirers later she became interested in social problems and reflected the passion of the age for reform in such poems as the cry of the children a protest against child labor which once vied in interest with hoods famous song of the shirt also she wrote aurora leigh a popular novel in verse having for its subject a hero who was a social reformer then miss barrett married robert browning after a rather emotional and sentimental courtship as reflected in certain extravagant pages of the browning letters  illustration elizabeth barrett browning  sidenote sonnets  in her newfound happiness she produced her most enduring work the sonnets from the portuguese 1850 this is a collection of love songs so personal and intimate that the author thought perhaps to disguise them by calling them from the portuguese in reality their source was no further distant than her own heart and their hero was seen across the breakfast table every morning they reflect mrs brownings love for her husband and those who read them should read also brownings answer in one word more some of the sonnets i thought how once and how do i love thee for example are very fine and deserve their high place among love poems but others being too intimate raise a question of taste in showing ones heart throbs to the public some readers may question whether many of the sonnets and most of the letters had not better been left exclusively to those for whom they were intended  matthew arnold 18221888 the work of this poet a son of dr arnold of rugby made famous by tom browns schooldays is in strong contrast to that of the brownings to the robust optimism of the one and to the emotionalism of the other he was a man of two distinct moods in his poetry he reflected the doubt or despair of those whose faith had been shaken by the alleged discoveries of science in prose he became almost lighthearted as he bantered middleclass englishmen for their oldfogy prejudices or tried to awaken them to the joys of culture in both moods he was coldly intellectual appealing to the head rather than to the heart of his readers and it is still a question whether his poetry or his criticism will be longest remembered  sidenote the poet of oxford  arnold is called the poet of oxford as holmes is of harvard and those who know the beautiful old college town will best appreciate certain verses in which he reflects the quiet loveliness of a scene that has impressed so many students century after century to general readers one may safely recommend arnolds elegies written in memory of the poet clough such as thyrsis and the scholar gypsy certain poems reflecting the religious doubts of the age such as dover beach morality and the future the love lyrics entitled switzerland and a few miscellaneous poems such as resignation the forsaken merman the last word and geists grave  to these some critics would add the long narrative poem sohrab and rustum which is one of the models set before students of college english the reasons for the choice are not quite obvious for the story which is taken from the persian shah namah or book of kings is rather coldly told and the blank verse is far from melodious  in reading these poems of arnold his own motives should be borne in mind he tried to write on classic lines repressing the emotions holding to a severe unimpassioned style and he proceeded on the assumption that poetry is a criticism of life it is not quite clear what he meant by his definition but he was certainly on the wrong trail poetry is the natural language of man in moments of strong or deep feeling it is the expression of life of life at high tide or low tide when it turns to criticism it loses its chief charm as a flower loses its beauty and fragrance in the hands of a botanist some poets however lucretius among the ancients pope among the moderns for example have taken a different view of the matter  illustration matthew arnold  sidenote the literary critic  arnolds chief prose works were written curiously enough after he was appointed professor of poetry at oxford there he proceeded in a sincere but somewhat toplofty way to enlighten the british public on the subject of culture for years he was a kind of dictator of literary taste and he is still known as a master of criticism but to examine his prose is to discover that it is notable for its even style and occasional good expressions such as sweetness and light rather than for its illuminating ideas  for example in literature and dogma and other books in which arnold attempted to solve the problems of the age he was apt to make large theories from a small knowledge of his subject so in his study of celtic literature an interesting book by the way he wrote with surprising confidence for one who had no firsthand acquaintance with his material and led his readers pleasantly astray in the flowery fields of celtic poetry moreover he had one favorite method of criticism which was to take the bad lines of one poet and compare them with the good lines of anothera method which would make shakespeare a sorry figure if he happened to be on the wrong side of the comparison  sidenote what to read  in brief arnold is always a stimulating and at times a provoking critic he stirs our thought disturbs our pet prejudices challenges our opposition but he is not a very reliable guide in any field what one should read of his prose depends largely on ones personal taste the essay on translating homer is perhaps his most famous work but few readers are really interested in the question of hexameters culture and anarchy is his best plea for a combination of the moral and intellectual or as he calls them the hebrew and greek elements in our human education among the best of the shorter works are emerson in discourses in america and wordsworth byron and the study of poetry in essays in criticism  the preraphaelites in the middle of the nineteenth century or in 1848 to be specific a number of english poets and painters banded themselves together as a preraphaelite brotherhood footnote the name was used earlier by some german artists who worked together in rome with the purpose of restoring art to the medieval simplicity and purity which as was alleged it possessed before the time of the italian painter raphael the most famous artists of the english brotherhood were john everett millais and william holman hunt they aimed to make all art more simple sincere religious and to restore the sense of wonder reverence and awe which they believed had been lost since medieval times their sincerity was unquestioned their influence though small was almost wholly good but unfortunately they were as morris said like men born out of due season they lived too much apart from their own age and from the great stream of common life out of which superior art proceeds for there was never a great book or a great picture that was not in the best sense representative that did not draw its greatness from the common ideals of the age in which it was produced  illustration the manor house of william morris  sidenote rossetti  the first poet among the preraphaelites was dante gabriel rossetti 18281882 the son of an exiled italian writer like others of the group he was both painter and poet and seemed to be always trying to put into his verse the rich coloring which belonged on canvas perhaps the most romantic episode of his life was that upon the death of his wife the beautiful model lizzie siddal who appears in millais picture ophelia he buried his poetry with her after some years his friends persuaded him that his poems belonged to the living and he exhumed and published them poems 1870 his most notable volume ballads and sonnets appeared eleven years later the ballads are nearly all weird uncanny but with something in them of the witchery of coleridges ancient mariner the sonnets under the general title of the house of life are devoted to the poets lost love and rank with mrs brownings from the portuguese  illustration william morris from a photograph by walker and cockerell  william morris 18341896 has been called by his admirers the most homeric of english poets the phrase was probably applied to him because of his sigurd the volsung in which he uses the material of an old icelandic saga there is a captivating vigor and swing in this poem but it lacks the poetic imagination of an earlier work the defence of guenevere in which morris retells in a new way some of the fading medieval romances his bestknown work in poetry footnote some readers will be more interested in morriss prose romances the house of the wolfings the roots of the mountains and the story of the glittering plain is the earthly paradise a collection of twentyfour stories strung together on a plan somewhat resembling that of the canterbury tales a band of mariners are cast away on an island inhabited by a superior race of men and to while away the time the seamen and their hosts exchange stories some of these are from classic sources others from norse legends or hero tales the stories are gracefully told in very good verse but in reading them one has the impression that something essential is lacking some touch it may be of present life and reality for the island is but another cloudland and the characters are shadowy creatures having souls but no bodies or else as some may find having the appearance of bodies and no souls whatever indeed in reading the greater part of preraphaelite literature one is reminded of morriss estimate of himself in the prelude to the earthly paradise    dreamer of dreams born out of my due time   why should i strive to set the crooked straight   let it suffice me that my murmuring rhyme   beats with light wing against the ivory gate   telling a tale not too importunate   to those who in the sleepy region stay   lulled by the singer of an empty day  algernon charles swinburne 18371909 this voluminous writer born in the year of victorias accession is yet so close to our own day that it is difficult to think of him as part of an age that is gone as a poet he was a master of verbal melody and had such a command of verse forms that he won his title of inventor of harmonies as a critic he showed a wide knowledge of english and french literature a discriminating taste and an enthusiasm which bubbled over in eulogy of those whom he liked and which emptied vials of wrath upon byron carlyle and others who fell under his displeasure his criticisms are written in an extravagant almost a torrential style at times his prose falls into a chanting rhythm so attractive in itself as to make us overlook the fact that the praise and censure which he dispenses with prodigal liberality are too personal to be quite trustworthy  sidenote his poetry  we are still too near swinburne to judge him accurately and his place in the long history of english poetry is yet to be determined we note here only two characteristics which may or may not be evident to other readers in the first place with his marvelous command of meter and melody swinburne has a fatal fluency of speech which tends to bury his thought in a mass of jingling verbiage as we read we seem to hear the question what readest thou hamlet and again the dane makes answer words words words again like the preraphaelites with whom he was at one time associated swinburne lived too much apart from the tide of common life he wrote for the chosen few and in the mass of his verse one must search long for a passage of which one may say this goes home to the hearts of men and abides there in the treasurehouse of all good poetry  among the longer works of swinburne his masterpiece is the lyrical drama atalanta in calydon if one would merely sample the flavor of the poet such minor works as itylus and the fine sea pieces off shore by the north sea and a forsaken garden may be recommended nor should we overlook what to many is swinburnes best quality namely his love of children as reflected in such poems as the salt of the earth and a childs laughter among the best of his prose works are his william blake essays and studies miscellanies and studies in prose and verse  songs in many keys in calling attention to the abovenamed poets we have merely indicated a few who seem to be chief but the judgment is a personal one and subject to challenge the american critic stedman in his victorian anthology recognizes two hundred and fifty singers of these eighty are represented by five or more poems and of the eighty a few are given higher places than those we have selected as typical there are many readers who prefer the goblin market of christina rossetti to anything produced by her gifted brother who place jean ingelow above elizabeth barrett who find more pleasure in edwin arnolds light of asia than in all the poems of matthew arnold and who cannot be interested in even the best of preraphaelite verse because of its unreality many men many minds time has not yet recorded its verdict on the victorians and until there is some settled criticism which shall express the judgment of several generations of men the best plan for the beginner is to make acquaintance with all the minor poets in an anthology or book of selections it may even be a mistake to call any of these poets minor for he who has written one song that lives in the hearts of men has produced a work more enduring than the pyramids                                       ii the victorian novelists  charles dickens 18121870  illustration charles dickens  among the victorian novelists were two men who were frequent rivals in the race for fame and fortune thackeray well born and well bred with artistic tastes and literary culture looked doubtfully at the bustling life around him found his inspiration in a past age and tried to uphold the best traditions of english literature dickens with little education and less interest in literary culture looked with joy upon the struggle for democracy and with an observation that was almost microscopic saw all its picturesque details of speech and character and incident he was the eye of the mighty victorian age as tennyson was its ear and browning its psychologist and carlyle its chronic grumbler      life in the childhood of dickens one may see a forecast of his     entire career his father a goodnatured but shiftless man     caricatured as mr micawber in david copperfield was a     clerk in the navy pay office at portsmouth there dickens was born     in 1812 the fathers salary was £80 per year enough at that time     to warrant living in middleclass comfort rather than in the     poverty of the lower classes with whom dickens is commonly     associated the mother was a sentimental woman whom dickens with     questionable taste has caricatured as mrs micawber and again as     mrs nickleby both parents were somewhat neglectful of their     children and uncommonly fond of creature comforts especially of     good dinners and a bowl of punch though there is nothing in such a     family to explain dickenss character there is much to throw light     on the characters that appear in his novels      sidenote the stage      the boy himself was far from robust having no taste for sports he     amused himself by reading romances or by listening to his nurses     talesbeautiful tales he thought which almost scared him into     fits his elfish fancy in childhood is probably reflected in pip     of great expectations he had a strong dramatic instinct to     act a story or sing a song or imitate a neighbors speech and     the father used to amuse his friends by putting little charles on a     chair and encouraging him to mimicrya dangerous proceeding     though it happened to turn out well in the case of dickens      this stagey tendency increased as the boy grew older he had a     passion for private theatricals and when he wrote a good story was     not satisfied till he had read it in public when pickwick     appeared 1837 the young man till then an unknown reporter was     brought before an immense audience which included a large part of     england and america thereafter he was never satisfied unless he     was in the public eye his career was a succession of theatrical     incidents of big successes big lecture tours big     audiencesalways the footlights till he lay at last between the     pale wax tapers but we are far ahead of our story      sidenote the london streets      when dickens was nine years old his family moved to london there     the father fell into debt and by the brutal laws of the period was     thrown into prison the boy went to work in the cellar of a     blacking factory and there began that intimate acquaintance with     lowly characters which he used later to such advantage he has     described his bitter experience so often in david     copperfield for instance that the biographer may well pass     over it we note only this significant fact that wherever dickens     went he had an instinct for exploration like that of a farm dog     which will not rest in a place till he has first examined all the     neighborhood putting his nose into every likely or unlikely spot     that may shelter friend or enemy so dickens used his spare hours     in roaming the byways of london by night so he gained his     marvelous knowledge of that foreign land called the street with     its flitting life of gamins and nondescripts through which we pass     daily as through an unknown country      sidenote the scramble for place      a small inheritance brought the father from prison the family was     again united and for two years the boy attended the academy which     he has held up to the laughter and scorn of two continents there     the genius of dickens seemed suddenly to awaken he studied little     being given to pranks and theatricals but he discovered within him     an immense ambition an imperious will to win a place and a name in     the great world and a hopeful temper that must carry him over or     under all obstacles      illustration gadshill place near rochester     the last residence of dickens      no sooner was his discovery made than he left school and entered a     law office where he picked up enough knowledge to make court     practices forever ridiculous in bleak house and other     stories he studied shorthand and quickly mastered it then     undertook to report parliamentary speeches a good training in     oratory and presently began a prosperous career as a reporter     this had two advantages it developed his natural taste for odd     people and picturesque incidents and it brought him close to the     great reading public to please that public to humor its whims and     prejudices its love for fun and tears and sentimentality was     thereafter the ruling motive in dickenss life      sidenote literary ventures      his first literary success came with some short stories contributed     to the magazines which appeared in book form as sketches by     boz 1835 a publisher marked these sketches engaged dickens     to write the text or letterpress for some comic pictures and the     result was pickwick which took england and america by     storm then followed oliver twist nicholas nickleby     old curiosity shopa flood of works that made readers rub     their eyes wondering if such a fountain of laughter and tears were     inexhaustible      there is little else to record except this that from the time of     his first triumph dickens held his place as the most popular writer     in english with his novels he was not satisfied but wrote a     history of england and edited various popular magazines such as     household words also he gave public readings reveling in     the applause the lionizing which greeted him wherever he went he     earned much money he bought the place gadshill near rochester     which he had coveted since childhood but he was a free spender     and his great income was less than his fancied need to increase     his revenue he toured the states in a series of readings from his     own works and capitalized his experience in american notes     and parts of martin chuzzlewit      a question of taste must arise even now in connection with these     works dickens had gone to a foreign country for just two things     money and applause he received both in full measure then he bit     the friendly hand which had given him what he wanted footnote     the chief source of dickenss irritation was the money loss     resulting from the pirating of his stories there was no     international copyright in those days the works of any popular     writer were freely appropriated by foreign publishers this custom     was wrong undoubtedly but it had been in use for centuries     scotts novels had been pirated the same way and until cooper got     to windward of the pirates by arranging for foreign copyrights     his work was stolen freely in england and on the continent but     dickens saw only his own grievance and even at public dinners was     apt to make his hosts uncomfortable by proclaiming his rights or     denouncing their moral standards moreover he had a vast conceit     of himself and like most visitors of a week thought he knew     america like a book it was as if he looked once at the welter cast     ashore by mighty lake superior in a storm and said what a dirty     sea thackeray who followed him to america had a finer sense of     the laws of hospitality and good breeding      sidenote the price of popularity      in 1844 dickens resolved to make both ends meet and carried out     his resolve with promptness and precision to decrease expenses he     went to the continent and lived there hungry for the footlights     till a series of stories ending with dombey and son put his     finances on a secure basis then he returned to london wrote more     novels and saved a fortune for his descendants who promptly spent     it evidently it was a family trait more and more he lived on his     nerves grew imperious exacting till he separated from his wife     and made wreck of domestic happiness the selfesteem of which he     made comedy in his novels was for him a tragedy also he resumed     the public readings with their false glory and nervous wear and     tear which finally brought him to the grave      illustration dickens birthplace landport portsea      he died worn out by his own exertions in 1870 he had steadily     refused titles and decorations but a grateful nation laid his body     to rest in the poets corner at westminster abbey it is doubtful     whether he would have accepted this honor which was forced upon     him for he had declared proudly that by his works alone he would     live in the memory of his countrymen  works of dickens in the early stories of dickens is a promise of all the rest his first work was called sketches by boz and boz was invented by some little girl was it in the vicar of wakefield who could not say moses also it was a pet name for a small brother of dickens there was therefore something childlike in this first title and childhood was to enter very largely into the novelists work he could hardly finish a story without bringing a child into it not an ordinary child to make us smile  but a wistful or pathetic child whose sorrows since we cannot help them are apt to make our hearts ache  sidenote the pathetic element  dickens is charged with exaggerating the woes of his children and the charge is true but he had a very human reason for his method in the first place the pathetic quality of his children is due to this simple fact that they bear the burden and the care of age and burdens which men or women accept for themselves without complaint seem all wrong and are wrong when laid upon a childs innocent shoulders again dickens sought to show us our error in thinking as most grownups do that childish troubles are of small account so they are to us but to the child they are desperately real later in life we learn that troubles are not permanent and so give them their proper place but in childhood a trouble is the whole world and a very hopeless world it is while it lasts dickens knew and loved children as he knew the public whom he made to cry with his little nell and tiny tim and he had discovered that tears are the key to many a heart at which reason knocks in vain  sidenote pickwickian humor  the second work pickwick written in a harumscarum way is even more typical of dickens in its spirit of fun and laughter he had been engaged as we have noted to furnish a text for some comic drawings thus reversing the usual order of illustration the pictures were intended to poke fun at a club of sportsmen and dickens who knew nothing of sport bravely set out with mr winkle on his rookshooting then while the story was appearing in monthly numbers the illustrator committed suicide dickens was left with mr pickwick on his hands and that innocent old gentleman promptly ran away with the author not being in the least adventurous mr pickwick was precisely the person for whom adventures were lying in wait but with his chivalrous heart within him and sam weller on guard outside he was not to be trifled with by cabman or constable so these two took to the open road and to the inns where punch good cheer and the unexpected were awaiting them never was such another book it is not a novel it is a medley of fun and drollery resulting from high animal spirits  sidenote the motive of horror  in his next novel oliver twist the author makes a new departure by using the motive of horror one of his heroes is an unfortunate child but when our sympathies for the little fellow are stretched to the point of tears dickens turns over a page and relieves us by pickwickian laughter also he has his usual medley of picturesque characters and incidents but the shadow of fagin is over them all one cannot go into any house in the book and lock the door and draw the shades without feeling that somewhere in the outer darkness this horrible creature is prowling the horror which fagin inspires is never morbid for dickens with his healthy spirit could not err in this direction it is a boyish melodramatic horror such as immature minds seek in movies dime novels secret societies detective stories and thrillers at the circus  in the fourth work nicholas nickleby dickens shows that he is nearing the limit of his invention so far as plot is concerned in this novel he seems to rest a bit by writing an oldfashioned romance with its hero and villain and moral ending but if you study this or any subsequent work of dickens you are apt to find the four elements already noted namely an unfortunate child humorous interludes a grotesque or horrible creature who serves as a foil to virtue or innocence and a medley of characters good or bad that might be transferred without change to any other story the most interesting thing about dickenss men and women is that they are human enough to make themselves at home anywhere  what to read whether one wants to study the method of dickens or to enjoy his works there is hardly a better plan for the beginner than to read in succession pickwick oliver twist and nicholas nickleby which are as the seed plot out of which grow all his stories for the rest the reader must follow his own fancy if one must choose a single work perhaps copperfield is the most typical of all my books said dickens i like this the best like many parents i have my favorite child and his name is david copperfield some of the heroines of this book are rather stagey but the peggotys betsy trotwood mrs gummidge the micawbersall these are unrivaled there is no writing against such power said thackeray who was himself writing pendennis while dickens was at work on his masterpiece  illustration yard of reindeer inn danbury the scene of the races in old curiosity shop  sidenote tale of two cities  opinion is divided on the matter of a tale of two cities some critics regard it as the finest of dickenss work revealing as it does his powers of description and of characterdrawing without his usual exaggeration other critics who regard the exaggeration of dickens as his most characteristic quality see in two cities only an evidence of his weakening power it has perhaps this advantage over other works of the author that of them we remember only the extraordinary scenes or characters while the entire story of two cities remains with us as a finished and impressive thing but there is also this disadvantage that the story ends and is done with while pickwick goes on forever we may lose sight of the heroes but we have the conviction as chesterton says that they are still on the road of adventure that mr pickwick is somewhere drinking punch or making a speech and that sam weller may step out from behind the next stable and ask with a droll wink what we are up to now  it is hardly necessary to add that our reading of dickens must not end until we are familiar with some of his yuletide stories in which he gladly followed the lead of washington irving the best of all his short stories is a christmas carol which one must read but not criticize at best it is a farce but a glorious carelifting heartwarming farce would there were more of the same kind  a criticism of dickens the first quality of dickens is his extravagant humor this was due to the fact that he was alive so thoroughly consciously alive that his vitality overflowed like a spring here in a word is the secret of that bubbling spirit of prodigality which occasions the criticism that dickens produced not characters but caricatures  sidenote his exaggeration  the criticism is true but it proclaims the strength of the novelist rather than his weakness indeed it is in the very exaggeration of dickens that his astonishing creative power is most clearly manifest there is something primal stupendous in his grotesque characters which reminds us of the uncouth monsters that nature created in her sportive moods some readers meeting with bunsby are reminded of a walrus and who ever saw a walrus without thinking of the creature as natures bunsby so with quilp toots squeers pumblechook so with giraffes baboons dodoes dromedariesall are freaks from the æsthetic viewpoint but think of the overflowing energy implied in creating them  the same sense of prodigality characterized dickens even in his sober moods when he portrayed hundreds of human characters and not a dead or dull person among them to be sure they are all exaggerated they weep too copiously eat or drink too intemperately laugh too uproariously for normal men but to criticize their superabundant vitality is to criticize beowulf or ulysses or hiawatha nay it is to criticize life itself which at high tide is wont to overflow in heroics or absurdity the exuberance of pickwick micawber pecksniff sairey gamp sam weller and a host of others is perhaps the most normal thing about them it is as the rattling of a safety valve which speaks not of stagnant water but of a full head of steam for dickens deals with life and you can exaggerate life as much as you please since there is no end to either its wisdom or foolishness nothing but a question can be added to the silent simplicity of death  illustration the gatehouse at rochester near dickenss home  sidenote his motive and method  aside from his purpose of portraying life as he saw it in all its strange complexity dickens had a twofold object in writing he was a radical democrat and he aimed to show the immense hopefulness and compassion of democracy on its upward way to liberty he was also a reformer with a profound respect for the poor but no respect whatever for ancient laws or institutions that stood in the way of justice the influence of his novels in establishing better schools prisons workhouses is beyond measure but we are not so much interested in his reforms as in his method which was unique he aimed to make men understand the oppressed and to make a laughing stock of the oppressors and he succeeded as no other had ever done in making literature a power in the land thus the man or the law that stands defiantly against public opinion is beaten the moment you make that man or that law look like a joke and dickens made a huge joke of the parish beadle as mr bumble and of many another meddlesome british institution moreover he was master of this paradox that to cure misery you must meet it with a merry heartthis is on the principle that what the poor need is not charity but comradeship by showing that humble folk might be as poor as the cratchits and yet have the medicine of mirth the divine gift of laughter he made men rejoice with the poor even while they relieved the poverty  sidenote his faults  as for the shortcomings of dickens they are so apparent that he who runs may read we may say of him as of shakespeare that his taste is questionable that he is too fond of a mere show that his style is often melodramatic that there is hardly a fault in the whole critical category of which he is not habitually guilty but we may say of him also that he is never petty or mean or morbid or unclean and he could not be dull if he tried his faults if you analyze them spring from precisely the same source as his virtues that is from his abundant vitality from his excess of life and animal spirits so we pardon nay we rejoice over him as over a boy who must throw a handspring or raise a whillilew when he breaks loose from school for dickens when he started his triumphal progress with pickwick had a glorious sense of taking his cue from life and of breaking loose from literary traditions in comparison with ruskin or thackeray he is not a good writer but something morea splendidly great writer if you would limit or define his greatness try first to marshal his array of characters characters so vital and human that we can hardly think of them as fictitious or imaginary creatures then remember the millions of men and women to whom he has given pure and lasting pleasure                                       william makepeace thackeray 18111863  illustration william makepeace thackeray from a drawing by samuel laurence  in fiction thackeray stands to dickens as hamilton to jefferson in the field of politics the radical difference between the novelists is exemplified in their attitude toward the public thackeray who lived among the privileged classes spoke of this great stupid public and thought that the only way to get a hearing from the common people was to take them by the ears he was a true hamiltonian dickens had an immense sympathy for the common people a profound respect for their elemental virtues and in writing for them he was as it were the jefferson the triumphant democrat of english letters thackeray was intellectual he looked at men with critical eyes and was a realist and a pessimist dickens was emotional he looked at men with kindled imagination judged them by the dreams they cherished in their hearts and was a romanticist and an optimist both men were humorists but where thackeray was delicately satirical causing us a momentary smile dickens was broadly comic or farcical winning us by hearty laughter      life to one who has been trained like dickens in the school of     hardship it seems the most natural thing in the world to pass over     into a state of affluence it is another matter to fare sumptuously     every day till luxurious habits are formed and then be cast     suddenly on ones own resources face to face with the unexpected     monster of bread and butter this was thackerays experience and     it colored all his work      a second important matter is that thackeray had a great tenderness     for children a longing for home and homely comforts but as a     child he was sent far from his home in india and was thrown among     young barbarians in various schools one of which the     charterhouse was called the slaughterhouse in the boys     letters to his mother there are three hundred and seventy boys in     this school wrote i wish there were only three hundred and     sixtynine he married for love and with great joy began     housekeeping then a terrible accident happened his wife was taken     to an insane asylum and for the rest of his life thackeray was a     wanderer amid the empty splendors of clubs and hotels      these two experiences did not break thackeray but they bowed him     they help to explain the languor the melancholy the gentle     pessimism as if life had no more sunrises of which we are vaguely     conscious in reading the virginians or the newcomes      sidenote early years      thackeray was born 1811 in calcutta of a family of english     nabobs who had accumulated wealth and influence as factors or     civil officers at the death of his father who was a judge in     bengal the child was sent to england to be educated here is a     significant incident of the journey          our ship touched at an island where my black servant took         me a walk over rocks and hills till we passed a garden         where we saw a man walking that is bonaparte said the         black he eats three sheep every day and all the children         he can lay hands on      napoleon was then safely imprisoned at st helena but his shadow     as of a terrible ogre was still dark over europe      thackerays education at the charterhouse school and at cambridge     was neither a happy nor a profitable experience as we judge from     his unflattering picture of english school life in     pendennis he had a strongly artistic bent and after     leaving college studied art in germany and france presently he     lost his fortune by gambling and bad investments and was     confronted by the necessity of earning his living he tried the     law but gave it up because as he said it had no soul he tried     illustrating having a small talent for comic drawings and sought     various civil appointments in vain as a last resource he turned to     the magazines wrote satires sketches of travel burlesques of     popular novelists and fighting all the time against his habit of     idleness slowly but surely won his way      sidenote literary labor      his first notable work vanity fair 1847 won a few     readers and the critics judgment that it was a book written by a     gentleman for gentlemen was the foundation of thackerays     reputation as a writer for the upper classes other notable novels     followed henry esmond pendennis the     newcomes the virginians and two series of literary and     historical essays called english humorists and the four     georges the latter were delivered as lectures in a successful     tour of england and america needless to say thackeray hated     lecturing and publicity he was driven to his dollarhunting by     necessity      in 1860 his fame was firmly established and he won his first     financial success by taking charge of the cornhill magazine     which prospered greatly in his hands he did not long enjoy his     newfound comfort for he died in 1863 his early sketches had been     satirical in spirit his first novels largely so but his last     novels and his cornhill essays were written in a different     spiritnot kinder for thackerays heart was always right but     broader wiser more patient of human nature and more hopeful      in view of these later works some critics declare that thackerays     best novel was never written his stories were produced not     joyously but laboriously to earn his living and when leisure came     at last then came death also and the work was over  works of thackeray it would be flying in the face of all the critics to suggest that the beginner might do well to postpone the famous novels of thackeray and to meet the author at his best or cheerfulest in such forgotten works as the book of ballads and the rose and the ring the latter is a kind of fairy story with a poor little good princess a rich little bad princess a witch of a godmother and such villainous characters as hedzoff and gruffanuff it was written for some children whom thackeray loved and is almost the only book of his which leaves the impression that the author found any real pleasure in writing it  sidenote henry esmond  if one must begin with a novel then henry esmond 1852 is the book this is an historical novel the scene is laid in the eighteenth century during the reign of queen anne and it differs from most other historical novels in this important respect the author knows his ground thoroughly is familiar not only with political events but with the thoughts ideals books even the literary style of the age which he describes the hero of the novel colonel esmond is represented as telling his own story he speaks as a gentleman spoke in those days telling us about the politicians soldiers ladies and literary men of his time with frank exposure of their manners or morals as a realistic portrayal of an age gone by not only of its thoughts but of the very language in which those thoughts were expressed esmond is the most remarkable novel of its kind in our language it is a prodigy of realism and it is written in a charming prose style  one must add frankly that esmond is not an inspiring work that the atmosphere is gloomy and the plot a disappointment the hero after ten years of devotion to a woman ends his romance by happily marrying with her mother any reader could have told him that this is what he ought to have done or tried to do in the beginning but thackerays heroes will never take the readers good advice in this respect they are quite human  sidenote vanity fair  the two social satires of thackeray are vanity fair 1847 and the history of arthur pendennis 1849 the former takes its title from that fair described in pilgrims progress where all sorts of cheats are exposed for sale and thackeray makes his novel a moralizing exposition of the shams of society the slight action of the story revolves about two unlovely heroines the unprincipled becky sharp and the spineless amelia we call them both unlovely though thackeray tries hard to make us admire his tearful amelia and to detest his more interesting becky meeting these two contrasting characters is a variety of fools and snobs mostly welldrawn all carefully analyzed to show the weakness or villainy that is in them  one interesting but unnoticed thing about these minor characters is that they all have their lifesize prototypes in the novels of dickens thackerays characters as he explains in his preface are mere puppets who must move when he pulls the strings dickens does not have to explain that his characters are men and women who do very much as they please that is perhaps the chief difference between the two novelists  sidenote pendennis  pendennis is a more readable novel than vanity fair in this respect that its interest centers in one character rather than in a variety of knaves or fools thackeray takes a youthful hero follows him through school and later life and shows the steady degeneration of a man who is governed not by vicious but by selfish impulses from beginning to end pendennis is a penetrating ethical study like george eliots romola and the story is often interrupted while we listen to the authors moralizing to some readers this is an offense to others it is a pleasure since it makes them better acquainted with the mind and heart of thackeray the gentlest of victorian moralists  sidenote afterthoughts  the last notable works of thackeray are like afterthoughts the virginians continues the story of colonel esmond and the newcomes recounts the later fortunes of arthur pendennis the virginians has two or three splendid scenes and some critics regard the newcomes as the finest expression of the authors genius but both works which appeared in the leisurely form of monthly instalments are too languid in action for sustained interest we grow acquainted with certain characters and are heartily glad when they make their exit perhaps someone else will come some adventurer from the road or the inn to relieve the dullness the door opens and in comes the bore again to take another leave that is realism undoubtedly and laura pendennis is as realistic as the mumps which one may catch a second time the atmosphere of both novelsindeed of all thackerays greater works with the exception of english humorists and the four georgesis rather depressing one gets the impression that life among the quality is a dreary experience hardly worth the effort of living    illustration charterhouse school   after a rare engraving by j rogers from the drawing made by thomas h   shepherd at the time thackeray was a student there  thackeray a criticism it is significant that thackerays first work appeared in a college leaflet called the snob and that it showed a talent for satire in his earlier stories he plainly followed his natural bent for his vanity fair barry lyndon a story of a scoundrelly adventurer and several minor works are all satires on the general snobbery of society this tendency of the author reached a climax in 1848 when he wrote the book of snobs it is still an entertaining book witty and with a kind of merciless fairness about its cruel passages yet some readers will remember what the author himself said later that he was something of a snob himself to write such a book the chief trouble with the half of his work is that he was so obsessed with the idea of snobbery that he did injustice to humanity or rather to his countrymen for thackeray was very english and interest in his characters depends largely on familiarity with the life he describes his pictures of english servants for instance are wonderfully deft though one might wish that he had drawn them with a more sympathetic pencil  sidenote the personal element  in the later part of his life the essential kindness of the man came to the surface but still was he hampered by his experience and his philosophy his experience was that life is too big to be grasped too mysterious to be understood therefore he faced life doubtfully with a mixture of timidity and respect as in henry esmond his philosophy was that every person is at heart an egoist is selfish in spite of himself therefore is every man or woman unhappy because selfishness is the eternal enemy of happiness this is the lesson written large in pendennis he lived in the small world of his own class while the great world of dickensthe world of the common people with their sympathy their eternal hopefulness their enjoyment of whatever good they find in lifepassed unnoticed outside his club windows he conceived it to be the business of a novelist to view the world with his own eyes to describe it as he saw it and it was not his fault that his world was a small one fate was answerable for that so far as he went thackeray did his work admirably portraying the few virtues and the many shams of his set with candor and sincerity though he used satire freely and satire is a twoedged weapon his object was never malicious or vindictive but corrective he aimed to win or drive men to virtue by exposing the native ugliness of vice  the result of his effort may be summed up as follows thackeray is a novelist for the few who can enjoy his accurate but petty views of society and his cultivated prose style he is not very cheerful he does not seek the blue flower that grows in every field or the gold that is at every rainbows end or the romance that hides in every human heart whether of rich or poor therefore are the young not conspicuous among his followers                                       mary ann evans george eliot 18191880  more than other victorian storytellers george eliot regarded her work with great seriousness as a means of public instruction her purpose was to show that human life is effective only as it follows its sense of duty and that society is as much in need of the moral law as of daily bread other novelists moralized more or less thackeray especially but george eliot made the teaching of morality her chief business      life in the work as in the face of george eliot there is a certain     masculine quality which is apt to mislead one who reads adam     bede or studies a portrait of the author even those who knew     her well and who tried to express the charm of her personality     seem to have overlooked the fact that they were describing a woman     for example a friend wrote          everything in her aspect and presence was in keeping with         the bent of her soul the deeply lined face the too marked         and massive features were united with an air of delicate         refinement which in one way was the more impressive         because it seemed to proceed so entirely from within nay         the inward beauty would sometimes quite transform the         outward harshness there would be moments when the thin         hands that entwined themselves in their eagerness the         earnest figure that bowed forward to speak and hear the         deep gaze moving from one face to another with a grave         appealall these seemed the transparent symbols that         showed the presence of a wise benignant soul      sidenote a clinging vine      that is very good but somehow it is not feminine so the     impression has gone forth that george eliot was a strongminded     woman but that is far from the truth one might emphasize her     affectionate nature her timidity her lack of confidence in her     own judgment but the essence of the matter is this that so     dependent was she on masculine support that she was always     idealizing some man and looking up to him as a superior being in     short she was one of the clinging kind though some may regard     this as traditional nonsense it was nevertheless the most     characteristic quality of the woman with whom we are dealing      sidenote her girlhood      mary ann evans or marian as she was called was born 1819 and     spent her childhood in shakespeares county of warwickshire her     father whose portrait she has faintly drawn in the characters of     adam bede and caleb garth was a strong quiet man a farmer and     land agent who made a companion of his daughter rather than of his     son the two being described more or less faithfully in the     characters of maggie and tom tulliver in the mill on the     floss at twelve years of age she was sent to a boarding     school at fifteen her mother died and she was brought home to     manage her fathers house the rest of her educationwhich     included music and a reading knowledge of german italian and     greekwas obtained by solitary study at intervals of rest from     domestic work that the intervals were neither long nor frequent     may be inferred from the fact that her work included not only her     fathers accounts and the thousand duties of housekeeping but also     the managing of a poultry yard the making of butter and other     farm or dairy matters which at that time were left wholly to women      illustration george eliot     from a portrait painted in rome by m dalbert durade and now in     geneva      the first marked change in her life came at the age of twentytwo     when the household removed to coventry and miss evans was there     brought in contact with the family of a wealthy ribbonmaker named     bray he was a man of some culture and the atmosphere of his     house with its numerous guests was decidedly skeptical to miss     evans brought up in a home ruled by early methodist ideals of     piety the change was a little startling soon she was listening to     glib evolutionary theories that settled everything from an     earthworm to a cosmos next she was eagerly reading such unbaked     works as brays philosophy of necessity and the essays of     certain young scientists who without knowledge of either     philosophy or religion were cocksure of their ability to provide     modern substitutes for both at an hours notice      miss evans went over rather impulsively to the crude skepticism of     her friends then finding no soul or comfort in their theories     she invented for herself a creed of duty and morality without     however tracing either to its origin she was naturally a religious     woman and there is no evidence that she found her new creed very     satisfactory indeed her melancholy and the gloom of her novels     are both traceable to the loss of her early religious ideals      sidenote her union with lewes      a trip abroad 1849 was followed by some editorial work on the     westminster review then the organ of the freethinkers this in     turn led to her association with herbert spencer john stuart mill     and other liberals and to her union with george henry lewes in     1854 of that union little need be said except this though it     lacked the law and the sacrament it seems to have been in other     respects a fair covenant which was honestly kept by both parties     footnote lewes was separated from his first wife from whom he     was unable to obtain a legal divorce this was the only obstacle to     a regular marriage and after facing the obstacle for a time the     couple decided to ignore it the moral element in george eliots     works is due largely no doubt to her own moral sense but it was     greatly influenced by the fact that in her union with lewes she     had placed herself in a false position and was morally on the     defensive against society      encouraged by lewes she began to write fiction her first attempt     amos barton was an excellent short story and in 1859 she     produced her first novel adam bede being then about forty     years old the great success of this work had the unusual effect of     discouraging the author she despaired of her ability and began to     agonize as she said over her work but her material was not yet     exhausted and in the mill on the floss and silas     marner she repeated her triumph      sidenote on a pedestal      the rest of her life seems a matter of growth or of atrophy     according to your point of view she grew more scientific as she     fancied but she lost the freshness and inspiration of her earlier     novels the reason seems to be that her head was turned by her fame     as a moralist and exponent of culture so she forgot that she was     born to please and attempted something else for which she had no     particular ability an historical novel in romola a drama     in the spanish gypsy a theory of social reform in felix     holt a study of the hebrew race in daniel deronda a     book of elephantine gambols in the opinions of theophrastus     such more and more she agonized over these works and though     each of them contained some scene or passage of rare power it was     evident even to her admirers that the pleasing novelist of the     earlier days had been sacrificed to the moral philosopher      sidenote she renews her youth      the death of lewes 1878 made an end as she believed of all     earthly happiness for twentyfour years he had been husband     friend and literary adviser encouraging her talent shielding her     from every hostile criticism left suddenly alone in the world she     felt like an abandoned child her writing stopped and her letters     echoed the old gleemans song all is gone both life and light     then she surprised everybody by marrying an american banker many     years her junior who had been an intimate friend of the lewes     household once more she found the world intensely interesting     for at sixty she was the same clinging vine the same     heroworshiper as at sixteen the marriage occurred in 1880 and     her death the same year an elaborate biography interesting but     too fulsome was written by her husband john walter cross  works george eliots first works in fiction were the magazine stories which she published later as scenes of clerical life 1858 these were produced comparatively late in life and they indicate both originality and maturity as if the author had a message of her own and had pondered it well before writing it that message as reflected in amos barton and janets repentance may be summarized in four cardinal principles that duty is the supreme law of life that the humblest life is as interesting as the most exalted since both are subject to the same law that our daily choices have deep moral significance since they all react on character and their total result is either happiness or misery and that there is no possible escape from the reward or punishment that is due to ones individual action  such is the message of the authors first work in its stern insistence on the moral quality of life and of every human action it distinguishes george eliot from all other fiction writers of the period  sidenote her best novels  in her first three novels she repeats the same message with more detail and with a gleam of humor here and there to light up the gloomy places adam bede 1859 has been called a story of early methodism but in reality it is a story of moral principles which work their inevitable ends among simple country people the same may be said of the mill on the floss 1860 and of silas marner 1861 the former is as interesting to readers of george eliot as copperfield is to readers of dickens because much of it is a reflection of a personal experience but the latter work having more unity more story interest and more cheerfulness is a better novel with which to begin our acquaintance with the author  illustration griff house george eliots early home in warwickshire  the scene of all these novels is laid in the country the characters are true to life and move naturally in an almost perfect setting one secret of their success is that they deal with people whom the author knew well and with scenes in which she was as much at home as dickens was in the london streets each of the novels notwithstanding its faulty or melancholy conclusion leaves an impression so powerful that we gladly and perhaps uncritically place it among the great literary works of the victorian era  sidenote later works  of the later novels one cannot speak so confidently they move some critics to enthusiasm and put others to sleep thus daniel deronda has some excellent passages and gwendolen is perhaps the bestdrawn of all george eliots characters but for many readers the novel is spoiled by scientific jargon by essay writing on the jews and other matters of which the author knew little or nothing at first hand in middlemarch she returned to the scenes with which she was familiar and produced a novel which some critics rank very high while others point to its superfluous essays and its proneness to moralizing instead of telling a story  sidenote romola  romola is another labored novel a study of italy during the renaissance and a profound ethical lesson if you can read this work without criticizing its italian views you may find in the characters of tito and romola one selfish and the other generous the best example of george eliots moral method which is to show the cumulative effect on character of everyday choices or actions you will find also a good story one of the best that the author told but if you read romola as an historical novel with some knowledge of italy and the renaissance you may decide that george eliotthough she slaved at this novel until as she said it made an old woman of herdid not understand the people or the country which she tried to describe she portrayed life not as she had seen and known and loved it but as she found it reflected at second hand in the works of other writers  the quality of george eliot of the moral quality of george eliot we have already said enough to our summary of her method this should be added that she tried to make each of her characters not individual but typical in other words if tito came finally to grief and adam arrived at a state of gloomy satisfaction there is no real happiness in george eliots world it was not because tito and adam lived in different times or circumstances but because both were subject to the same eternal laws each must have gone to his own place whether he lived in wealth or poverty in florence or england in the fifteenth or the nineteenth century the moral law is universal and unchanging it has no favorites and makes no exceptions it is more like the old greek conception of nemesis or the anglosaxon conception of wyrd or fate than anything else you will find in modern fiction  sidenote fate and selfsacrifice  in this last respect george eliot again differs radically from her contemporaries in her gloomy view of life as an unanswerable puzzle she is like thackeray but where thackeray offers a cultured resignation a gentlemanly making the best of a bad case george eliot advocates selfsacrifice for the good of others in her portrayal of weak or sinful characters she is quite as compassionate as dickens and more thoughtfully charitable for where dickens sometimes makes light of misery and relieves it by the easy expedient of good dinners and allaround comfort for saints and sinners george eliot remembers the broken moral law and the suffering of the innocent for the guilty behind every one of her characters that does wrong follows an avenging fate waiting the moment to exact the full penalty and before every character that does right hovers a vision of sacrifice and redemption  her real philosophy therefore was quite different from that which her scientific friends formulated for her and was not modern but ancient as the hills on the one hand she never quite freed herself from the old pagan conception of nemesis or fate on the other her early methodist training entered deep into her soul and made her mindful of the cross that forever towers above humanity                                       other victorian novelists  we have followed literary custom rather than individual judgment in studying dickens thackeray and george eliot as the typical victorian novelists on dickens as the most original genius of the age most people are agreed but the rank of the other two is open to question there are critics besides swinburne who regard charlotte brontë as a greater genius than george eliot and many uncritical readers find more pleasure or profit in the barchester novels of anthony trollope than in anything written by thackeray it may even be that the three or four leading novels of the age were none of them written by the novelists in question but it is still essential to know their works if only for these reasons that they greatly influenced other storytellers of the period and that they furnish us a standard by which to judge all modern fiction  to treat the many victorian novelists adequately would in itself require a volume we shall note here only a few leading figures naming in each case a novel or two which may serve as an invitation to a better acquaintance with their authors  illustration charlotte brontË  the brontë sisters charlotte and emily made a tremendous sensation in england when from their retirement they sent out certain works of such passionate intensity that readers who had long been familiar with novels were startled into renewed attention reading these works now we recognize the genius of the writers but we recognize also a morbid unwholesome quality which is a reflection not of english life but of the personal and unhappy temperament of two girls who looked on life first as a gorgeous romance and then as a gloomy tragedy  charlotte brontë 18161855 was perhaps the more gifted of the two sisters and her bestknown works are jane eyre and villette the date of the latter novel 1853 was made noteworthy by the masterpiece of another woman novelist mrs elizabeth gaskell 18101865 who was the exact opposite of the brontë sistersserene wellbalanced and with a fund of delicious humor all these qualities and more appeared in cranford 1853 a series of sketches of country life first contributed to dickenss household words which together form one of the most charming stories produced during the victorian era the same author wrote a few other novels and an admirable life of charlotte brontë  sidenote charles reade  charles reade 18141884 was a follower of dickens in his earlier novels such as peg woffington but he made one notable departure when he wrote the cloister and the hearth 1861 this is a story of student life and vagabond life in europe in the stirring times that followed the invention of printing the action moves rapidly many different characters appear the scene shifts from holland across europe to italy and back again adventures of a startling kind meet the hero at every stage of his foot journey it is a stirring tale remarkably well told so much will every uncritical reader gladly acknowledge moreover there are critics who after studying the cloister and the hearth rank it with the best historical novels in all literature  illustration mrs elizabeth gaskell from the portrait by george richmond ra  sidenote trollope  anthony trollope 18151882 began as a follower of thackeray but in the immense range of his characters and incidents he soon outstripped his master perhaps his best work is barchester towers 1857 one of a series of novels which picture with marvelous fidelity the life of a cathedral town in england  another novelist who followed thackeray and then changed his allegiance to dickens was bulwer lytton 18031873 he was essentially an imitator a follower of the market and before thackeray and dickens were famous he had followed almost every important english novelist from mrs radcliffe to walter scott two of his historical novels rienzi and the last days of pompeii may be mildly recommended the rest are of the popular and somewhat trashy kind critics jeer at them and the public buys them in large numbers  one of the most charming books of the victorian age was produced by richard blackmore 18251900 he wrote several novels some of them of excellent quality but they were all overshadowed by his beautiful old romance of lorna doone 1869 it is hard to overpraise such a story wholesome and sweet as a breath from the moors and the critics praise will be unnecessary if the reader only opens the book it should be read with cranford if one reads nothing else of victorian fiction  illustration richard doddridge blackmore  two other notable romances of a vanished age came from the hand of charles kingsley 18191875 he produced many works in poetry and prose but his fame now rests upon hypatia westward ho and a few stories for children hypatia 1853 is an interesting novel dealing with the conflict of pagan and christian ideals in the early centuries westward ho 1855 is a stirring narrative of seafaring and adventure in the days of elizabeth it has been described as a stunning boys book and it would prove an absorbing story for any reader who likes adventure were it not marred by one serious fault the authors personal beliefs and his desire to glorify certain elizabethan adventurers lead him to pronounce judgment of a somewhat wholesale kind he treats one religious party of the period to a golden halo and the other to a lash of scorpions and this is apt to alienate many readers who else would gladly follow sir amyas leigh on his gallant ventures in the new world or on the spanish main kingsley had a rare talent for writing for children his heart never grew old and his heroes and water babies are still widely read as bedtime stories  of the later victorian novelists chief among them being meredith hardy and stevenson little may be said here as they are much too near us to judge of their true place in the long perspective of english literature meredith with the analytical temper and the disconnected style of browning is for mature readers not for young people hardy has decided power but is too hopelessly pessimistic for anybodys comfortexcept in his earlier works which have a romantic charm that brightens the obscurity of his later philosophy  illustration robert louis stevenson from a photograph  sidenote stevenson  in robert louis stevenson 18501894 we have the spirit of romance personified his novels such as kidnapped and david balfour are stories of adventure written in a very attractive style but he is more widely known among young people at least by his charming childs garden of verses and his treasure island 1883 this last is a kind of dimenovel of pirates and buried treasure if one is to read stories of that kind there is no better place to begin than with this masterpiece of stevenson other works by the same versatile author are the novels master of ballantrae weir of hermiston and dr jekyll and mr hyde various collections of essays such as virginibus puerisque and familiar studies of men and books and some rather thin sketches of journeying called an inland voyage and travels with a donkey  the cheery spirit of stevenson who bravely fought a losing battle with disease is evident in everything he wrote and it was the authors spirit quite as much as his romantic tales or fine prose style that won for him a large and enthusiastic following of all the later victorians he seems at the present time to have the widest circle of cultivated readers and to exercise the strongest influence on our writers of fiction                                       iii victorian essayists and historians  there is rich reading in victorian essays which reflect not only the practical affairs of the age but also the ideals that inspire every great movement whether in history or literature for example the intense religious interests of the period the growth of the nonconformists or independents the oxford movement which aimed to define the historic position of the english church the chill of doubt and the glow of renewed faith in face of the apparent conflict between the old religion and the new scienceall these were brilliantly reflected by excellent writers among whom martineau newman and maurice stand out prominently the deep thought the serene spirit and the fine style of these men are unsurpassed in victorian prose  somewhat apart from their age stood a remarkable group of historianshallam freeman green gardiner symonds and others no less praiseworthywho changed the whole conception of history from a record of political or military events to a profound study of human society in all its activities in another typical group were the critics pater bagehot hutton leslie stephen who have given deeper meaning and enlarged pleasure to the study of literature in a fourth group were the scientistsdarwin wallace lyell mivart tyndall mill spencer huxley and their followerssome of whom aimed not simply to increase our knowledge but to use the essay as others used the novel to portray some new scene in the old comedy of human life darwin was a great and therefore a modest man but some of his disciples were sadly lacking in humor spencer and mill especially wrote with colossal selfconfidence as if the world no longer wore its veil of mystery they remind us curiously that while poetry endures forever nothing on earth is more subject to change and error than socalled scientific truth  sidenote typical writers  it is impossible in a small volume to do justice to so many writers reflecting nature or humanity from various angles and sometimes insisting that a particular angle was the only one from which a true view could be obtained some rigorous selection is necessary and we name here for special study macaulay carlyle ruskin who are commonly regarded as the typical victorian essayists this selection does not mean however that some other group might not be quite as representative of their age and nation our chosen authors stand not for victorian thought but only for certain interesting phases thereof macaulay the busy man of affairs voiced the pride of his generation in british traditions carlyle lived aloof grumbling at democracy denouncing its shams calling it to repentance ruskin a child of fortune was absorbed in art till the burden of the world oppressed him whereupon he gave his money to the cause of social reform and went himself among the poor to share with them whatever wealth of spirit he possessed these three men utterly unlike in character were as one in their endeavor to make modern literature a power wherewith to uplift humanity they illustrate better even than poets or novelists the characteristic moral earnestness of the victorian era                                       thomas babington macaulay 18001859  to many readers the life of macaulay is more interesting than any of his books for the details of that brilliantly successful life which fairly won and richly deserved its success the student is referred to trevelyans fine biography we record here only such personal matters as may help to explain the exuberant spirit of macaulays literary work  illustration thomas babington macaulay      life one notes first of all the mans inheritance the norse     element predominated in him for the name macaulay son of aulay     is a late form of the scandinavian olafson his mother was a     brilliant woman of quaker descent his father at one time governor     of the sierra leone colony in africa was a business man who gained     a fortune in trade and who spent the whole of it in helping to     free the slaves in consequence when macaulay left college he     faced the immediate problem of supporting himself and his family a     hard matter which he handled not only with his customary success     but also with characteristic enthusiasm      next we note macaulays personal endowment his gift of rapid     reading his marvelous memory which suggests coleridge and cotton     mather he read everything from plato to the trashiest novel and     after reading a book could recall practically the whole of it after     a lapse of twenty years to this photographic memory we are     indebted for the wealth of quotation allusion and anecdote which     brightens almost every page of his writings      sidenote his brilliant career      after a brilliant career at college macaulay began the study of     law at twentyfive he jumped into prominence by a magazine essay     on milton and after that his progress was uninterrupted he was     repeatedly elected to parliament he was appointed legal adviser to     the supreme council of india in which position he acquired the     knowledge that appears in his essays on clive and hastings he     became secretary for war and was elevated to the peerage as baron     macaulay of rothley it was said of him at that time that he was     the only man whom england ever made a lord for the power of his     pen      sidenote his recreation      the last thing we note because it was to macaulay of least moment     is his literary work with the exception of the history of     england his writing was done at spare moments as a relaxation     from what he considered more important labors in this respect of     writing for pleasure in the midst of practical affairs he     resembles the elizabethan rather than the victorian authors      while at work on his masterpiece macaulay suddenly faltered worn     out by too much work he died on christmas day 1859 and was     buried in the place which he liked best to visit the poets corner     of westminster abbey from the day on which he attracted notice by     his milton essay he had never once lost his hold on the attention     of england gladstone summed up the matter in oratorical fashion     when he said fullorbed macaulay was seen above the horizon and     fullorbed after thirtyfive years of constantly emitted splendor     he sank below it but macaulays final comment well i have had     a happy life is more suggestive of the man and his work  works of macaulay macaulays poems which he regarded as of no consequence are practically all in the ballad style among them are various narratives from french or english history such as the battle of ivry and the armada and a few others which made a popular little book when they were published as lays of ancient rome 1842 the prime favorite not only of the lays but of all macaulays works is horatius cocles or horatius at the bridge those who read its stirring lines should know that macaulay intended it not as a modern ballad but as an example of ancient methods of teaching history according to niebuhr the early history of rome was written in the form of popular ballads and macaulay attempted to reproduce a few of these historical documents in the heroic style that roused a roman audience of long ago to pride and love of country  sidenote the essays  the essays of macaulay appeared in the magazines of that day but though official england acclaimed their brilliancy and flooded their author with invitations to dine nobody seemed to think of them as food for ordinary readers till a philadelphia publisher collected a few of them into a book which sold in america like a good novel that was in 1841 and not till two years had passed did a london publisher gain courage to issue the critical and historical essays a book which vindicated the taste of readers of that day by becoming immensely popular  the charm of such a book is evident in the very first essay on milton here is no critic airing his rules or making his dry talk palatable by a few quotations here is a live man pleading for another man whom he considers one of the greatest figures in history macaulay may be mistaken possibly but he is going to make you doff your hat to a hero before he is done so he speaks eloquently not only of milton but of the classics on which milton fed of the ideals and struggles of his age of the commonwealth and the restorationof everything which may catch your attention and then focus it on one titanic figure battling like samson among the philistines it may be that your sympathies are with the philistines rather than with samson but presently you stop objecting and are carried along by the authors eloquence as by a torrent his style is the combined style of novelist and public speaker the one striving to make his characters real the other bound to make his subject interesting  that is macaulays way in all his essays they are seldom wholly right in their judgments they are so often onesided that the author declared in later life he would burn them all if he could but they are all splendid all worth reading not simply for their matter but for their style and for the wealth of allusion with which macaulay makes his subject vital and interesting among the best of the literary essays are those on bunyan addison bacon johnson goldsmith and byron among the historical essays one may sample macaulays variety in lord clive frederick the great machiavelli and mirabeau  careful readers may note a difference between these literary and historical essays those on bunyan johnson and goldsmith for example written originally for the encyclopaedia britannica are more finished and more careful of statement than others in which the author talks freely sharing without measure or restraint the heapedup treasures of his memory  sidenote history of england  macaulay began to write his history of england with the declaration that he would cover the century and a half following the accession of james ii 1685 and that he would make his story as interesting as any novel only the latter promise was fulfilled his five volumes the labor of more than a decade cover only sixteen years of english history but these are pictured with such minuteness and such splendor that we can hardly imagine anyone brave enough to attempt to finish the record in a single lifetime  of this masterpiece of macaulay we may confidently say three things that for many years it was the most popular historical work in our language that by its brilliant style and absorbing interest it deserved its popularity as literature if not as history and that though it contains its share of error and more than its share of whig partisanship it has probably as few serious faults as any other history which attempts to cover the immense field of the political social and intellectual life of a nation read for example one of the introductory chapters the third is excellent which draws such a picture of england in the days of the stuarts as no other historian has ever attempted when you have finished that chapter with its wealth of picturesque detail you may be content to read macaulay simply for the pleasure he gives you and go to some other historian for accurate information                                       thomas carlyle 17951881  there is little harmony of opinion concerning carlyle criticism of the man being divided between praise and disparagement if you are to read only one of his works it is perhaps advisable to avoid all biographies at first and to let the essay on burns or heroes and hero worship make its own impression but if you intend to read more widely some knowledge of carlyles personal history is essential in order to furnish the grain of salt with which most of his opinions must be taken  illustration thomas carlyle from engraving by sartain from a daguerrotype      life in the village of ecclefechan carlyle was born in 1795 the     year before burnss death his father was a stonemason an honest     man of caustic tongue his mother judged by her sons account was     one of natures noblewomen the love of his mother and a proud     respect for his father were the two sentiments in carlyle that went     with him unchanged through a troubled and oftcomplaining life      sidenote his wrestlings      of his tearful school days in annandale and of his wretched years     at edinburgh university we have glimpses in sartor resartus     in the chapters of the same book entitled the everlasting nay and     the everlasting yea is a picture of the conflict between doubt     and faith in the stormy years when carlyle was finding himself he     taught school and hated it he abandoned the ministry for which     his parents had intended him he resolved on a literary life and     did hack work to earn his bread all the while he wrestled with his     gloomy temper or with the petty demons of dyspepsia which he was     wont to magnify into giant doubts and despairs      sidenote carlyle and emerson      in 1826 he married jane welsh and went to live in a house she had     inherited at craigenputtock or hill of the hawks there on a     lonely moorland farm he spent six or seven years writing books     which few cared to read and there emerson appeared one day he     came and went like an angel said the carlyles with the     heartening news that the neglected writings were winning a great     audience in america the letters of carlyle and emerson as edited     by charles eliot norton are among the pleasantest results of     carlyles whole career      sidenote mrs carlyle      carlyles wife was a brilliant but nervous woman with literary     gifts of her own she had always received attention she expected     and probably deserved admiration but so did carlyle who expected     also to be made the center of all solicitude when he called heaven     and earth to witness against democracy crowing roosters weak tea     and other grievous afflictions after her death in london 1866     he was plunged into deepest grief in his reminiscences and     letters he fairly deifies his wife calling her his queen     his star his light and joy of life and portrays a companionship     as of two mortals in a paradise without a serpent all that is     doubtless as it should be in a romance but the unfortunate     publication of mrs carlyles letters and journals introduced a     jarring note of reality a jungle of controversial writings has     since grown up around the domestic relations of the     carlylesimpertinent deplorable writings which serve no purpose     but to make us cry enough let them rest in peace both had     sharp tongues and probably both were often sorry      sidenote work in london      from the moors the carlyles went to london and settled for the     remainder of their lives in a house in cheyne row in the suburb of     chelsea there carlyle slowly won recognition his success being     founded on his french revolution invitations began to pour     in upon him great men visited and praised him and his fame spread     as the sage of chelsea then followed his cromwell and     frederick the great the latter completed after years of     complaining labor which made wreck of home happiness and then came     a period of unusual irritation to which we owe in part at least     carlyles railings against progress and his deplorable criticism of     englands great men and womenpoor little browning animalcular     de quincey rabbitbrained newman sawdustish mill chattering     george eliot ghastlyshrieky shelley onceenough lamb     stintedscanty wordsworth poor thin fool darwin and his book     the origin of species of which carlyle confessed he never     read a page which was wonderful as an example of the stupidity of     mankind      such criticisms were reserved for carlyles private memoirs the     world knew him only by his books and revered him as a great and     good man he died in 1881 and of the thousand notices which     appeared in english or american periodicals of that year there is     hardly one that does not overflow with praise      illustration carlyles house cheyne row chelsea london      in the home at chelsea were numerous letters and journals which     carlyle committed to his friend froude the historian the     publication of these private papers raised a storm of protest     admirers of carlyle shocked at the revelation of another side to     their hero denounced froude for his disloyalty and malice     whereupon the literary world divided into two camps the jane     carlyleists and the thomas carlyleists as they are still called     that froude showed poor taste is evident but we must acquit him of     all malice private papers had been given him with the charge to     publish them if he saw fit and from them he attempted to draw not     a flattering but a truthful portrait of carlyle who had always     preached the doctrine that a man must speak truth as he sees it     nor will carlyle suffer in the long run from being deprived of a     halo which he never deserved already the crustiness of the man     begins to grow dim in the distance it is his rugged earnestness     that will be longest remembered  works of carlyle the beginner will do well to make acquaintance with carlyle in some of the minor essays which are less original but more pleasing than his labored works among the best essays are those on goethe who was carlyles first master signs of the times novalis and especially scott and burns with scott he was not in sympathy and though he tried as a scotsman to be loyal to kith and clan a strong touch of prejudice mars his work with burns he succeeded better and his picture of the plowboy genius in misfortune is one of the best we have on the subject this essay on burns is also notable as the best example of carlyles early style before he compounded the strange mixture which appeared in his later books  sidenote heroes and hero worship  the most readable of carlyles longer works is heroes and hero worship 1840 which deals with certain leaders in the fields of religion poetry war and politics it is an interesting study to compare this work with the representative men of emerson the latter looks upon the world as governed by ideals which belong not to individuals but to humanity when some man appears in whom the common ideal is written large other men follow him because they see in him a truth which they revere in their own souls so the leader is always in the highest sense a representative of his race but carlyle will have nothing of such democracy to him common men are stupid or helpless and must be governed from without occasionally when humanity is in the slough of despond appears a hero a superman and proceeds by his own force to drag or drive his subjects to a higher level when the hero dies humanity must halt and pray heaven to send another master  it is evident before one has read much of heroes that carlyle is at heart a forceworshiper to him history means the biography of a few heroes and heroism is a matter of power not of physical or moral courage the hero may have the rugged courage of a cromwell or he may be an easyliving poet like shakespeare or a ruthless despot like napoleon or an epitome of all meanness like rousseau but if he shows superior force of any kind that is the hallmark of his heroism and before such an one humanity should bow down of real history therefore you will learn nothing from heroes neither will you get any trustworthy information concerning odin mahomet and the rest of carlyles oddly consorted characters one does not read the book for facts but for a new view of old matters with heroworshipers especially it ranks very high among the thoughtprovoking books of the past century  sidenote the french revolution  of the historical works footnote these include oliver cromwells letters and speeches 1850 and history of frederick the great 1858 of carlyle the most famous is the french revolution 1837 on this work carlyle spent much heartbreaking labor and the story of the first volume shows that the author who made himself miserable over petty matters could be patient in face of a real misfortune footnote the manuscript of the first volume was submitted to carlyles friend mill him of the sawdustish mind for criticism mill lent it to a lady who lost it when he appeared white as a ghost to confess his carelessness the carlyles did their best to make light of it yet it was a terrible blow to them for aside from the wearisome labor of doing the work over again they were counting on the sale of the book to pay for their daily bread moreover it furnishes a striking example of carlyles method which was not historical in the modern sense but essentially pictorial or dramatic he selected a few dramatic scenes such as the storming of the bastille and painted them in flaming colors also he was strong in drawing portraits and his portrayal of robespierre danton and other actors in the terrible drama is astonishingly vigorous though seldom accurate his chief purpose in drawing all these pictures and portraits was to prove that order can never come out of chaos save by the iron grip of a governing hand hence if you want to learn the real history of the french revolution you must seek elsewhere but if you want an impression of it an impression that burns its way into the mind you will hardly find the equal of carlyles book in any language  of carlyles miscellaneous works one must speak with some hesitation as an expression of what some call his prophetic mood and others his ranting one who has patience might try shooting niagara or the latter day pamphlets a reflection of his doctrine of honest work as the cure for social ills is found in past and present and for a summary of his philosophy there is nothing quite so good as his early sartor resartus 1834  sidenote sartor resartus  the lastnamed work is called philosophy only by courtesy the title means the tailor retailored or the patcher repatched and the book professed to be a complete resartus philosophy of clothes since everything wears clothes of some kind the soul wears a body and the body garments earth puts forth grass and the firmament stars ideas clothe themselves in words society puts on fashions and habits it can be seen that carlyle felt free to bring in any subject he pleased and so he did moreover in order to have liberty of style he represented himself to be the editor not the author of sartor the alleged author was a german professor diogenes teufelsdroeckh an odd stick half genius half madman whose chaotic notes carlyle professed to arrange with a running commentary of his own  in consequence of this overlabored plan sartor has no plan at all it is a jumble of thoughts notions attacks on shams scraps of german philosophyeverything that carlyle wrote about during his sevenyears sojourn on his moorland farm the only valuable things in sartor are a few autobiographical chapters such as the everlasting yea and certain passages dealing with night the stars the yearnings of humanity the splendors of earth and heaven note this picture of teufelsdroeckh standing alone at the north cape looking like a little belfry      silence as of death for midnight even in the arctic latitudes     has its character nothing but the granite cliffs ruddytinged the     peaceable gurgle of that slowheaving polar ocean over which in     the utmost north the great sun hangs low and lazy as if he too     were slumbering yet is his cloudcouch wrought of crimson and     clothofgold yet does his light stream over the mirror of waters     like a tremulous firepillar shooting downwards to the abyss and     hide itself under my feet in such moments solitude also is     invaluable for who would speak or be looked on when behind him     lies all europe and africa fast asleep except the watchmen and     before him the silent immensity and palace of the eternal whereof     our sun is but a porchlamp  the book has several such passages written in a psalmodic style appealing to elemental feeling to our sense of wonder or reverence before the mystery of life and death it is a pity that we have no edition of sartor which does justice to its golden nuggets by the simple expedient of sifting out the mass of rubbish in which the gold is hidden the central doctrines of the book are the suppression of self or selfishness and the value of honest work in contrast with the evil of mammonworship  a criticism of carlyle except in his literary essays carlyles rumfustianish growlery of style as he called it is so uneven that no description will apply to it in moments of emotion he uses a chanting prose that is like primitive poetry sometimes he forgets thomas carlyle keeps his eye on his subject and describes it in vivid picturesque words then when he has nothing to say he thinks of himself and tries to hold you by his manner by his ranting or dogmatism in one mood he is a poet in another a painter in a third a stump speaker in all moods he must have your ear but he succeeds better in getting than in holding it it has been said that his prose is on a level with brownings verse but a better comparison may be drawn between carlyle and walt whitman of each of these writers the best that can be said is that his style was his own that it served his purpose and that it is not to be imitated  sidenote his two sides  in formulating any summary of carlyle the critic must remember that he is dealing with a man of two sides one prejudiced dogmatic jealous of rivals the other roughly sincere on either side carlyle is a man of contradictions for an odious dead despot like frederick who happens to please him he turns criticism into eulogy and for a living poet like wordsworth he tempers praise by spiteful criticism footnote carlyles praise of wordsworths fine wholesome rusticity is often quoted but only in part if you read the whole passage in reminiscences you will find the effect of carlyles praise wholly spoiled by a heartless dissection of a poet with whom as carlyle confessed he had very slight acquaintance he writes a score of letters to show that his grief is too deep for words he is voluble on the infinite virtue of silence he proclaims today that he will write no word on any subject till he has studied it to the bottom and tomorrow will pronounce judgment on america or science or some other matter of which he knows nothing in all this carlyle sees no inconsistency he is sincere in either role of prophet or stump speaker and even thinks that humor is one of his prime qualities  illustration arch home ecclefechan the birthplace of carlyle  another matter to remember is carlyles constant motive rather than his constant mistakes he had the gloomy conviction that he was ordained to cry out against the shams of society and as most modern things appeared to him as shams he had to be very busy moreover he had an eye like a hawk for the small failings of men especially of living men but was almost blind to their large virtues this hawklike vision which ignores all large matters in a swoop on some petty object accounts for two things for the marvelous detail of carlyles portraits and for his merciless criticism of the faults of society in general and of the victorian age in particular  such a writer invites both applause and opposition and in carlyles case the one is as hearty as the other the only point on which critics are fairly well agreed is that his rugged independence of mind and his picturesque style appealed powerfully to a small circle of readers in england and to a large circle in america it is doubtful whether any other essayist with the possible exception of the serene and hopeful emerson had a more stimulating influence on the thought of the latter half of the nineteenth century                                       john ruskin 18191900  the prose of ruskin is a treasure house nature portrayed as everymans holy land descriptions of mountain or landscape and more beautiful descriptions of leaf or lichen or the glint of light on a breaking wave appreciations of literature and finer appreciations of life itself startling views of art and more revolutionary views of that frightful waste of human life and labor which we call political economyall these and many more impressions of nature art and human society are eloquently recorded in the ten thousand pages which are the work of ruskins hand  if you would know the secret that binds all his work together it may be expressed in two words sensitiveness and sincerity from childhood ruskin was extremely sensitive to both beauty and ugliness the beauty of the world and of all noble things that ever were accomplished in the world affected him like music but he shrank as if from a blow from all sordidness and evil from the mammonworship of trade from the cloud of smoke that hung over a factory district as if trying to shield from the eye of heaven so much needless poverty and aimless toil below so ruskin was a man halting between two opinions the artist in him was forever troubled by the reformer seeking to make the crooked places of life straight and its rough places plain he made as many mistakes as another man in his pages you may light upon error or vagary but you will find nothing to make you doubt his entire sincerity his desire to speak truth his passion for helping his fellow men      life the early training of ruskin may explain both the strength     and the weakness of his work his father was a wealthy wine     merchant his mother a devout woman with puritanic ideas of duty     both parents were of scottish and as ruskin boasted of plebeian     descent they had but one child and in training him they used a     strange mixture of severity and coddling of wisdom and nonsense      the young ruskin was kept apart from other boys and from the sports     which breed a modesty of ones own opinion his time work and     lonely play were minutely regulated the slightest infringement of     rules brought the stern discipline of rod or reproof on the other     hand he was given the best pictures and the best books he was     taken on luxurious journeys through england and the continent he     was furnished with tutors for any study to which he turned his     mind when he went up to oxford at seventeen he knew many things     which are greek to the ordinary boy but was ignorant of almost     everything that a boy knows and that a man finds useful in dealing     with the world      illustration john ruskin     from a photograph by elliott and fry      sidenote training and its results      there were several results of this early discipline one was     ruskins devotion to art which came from his familiarity with     pictures and galleries another was his minute study of natural     objects which were to him in place of toys a third was his habit     of speaking his mind on every subject a fourth was his rhythmic     prose style which came largely from his daily habit of memorizing     the bible still another result of his lonely magnificence in     which he was deprived of boys society was that his affection went     out on a flood tide of romance to the first attractive girl he met     so he loved and was laughed at and was desperately unhappy then     he married not the woman of his choice but one whom his parents     picked out for him the tastes of the couple were hopelessly     different the end was estrangement with humiliation and sorrow     for ruskin      sidenote twenty years of art      at twentyfour he produced his first important work modern     painters 1843 which he began as a defense of the neglected     artist turner this controversial book led ruskin to a deeper study     of his subject which resulted in four more volumes on modern     painting before these were completed he had fairly created a new     literature of art by his seven lamps of architecture and     stones of venice he was appointed professor of fine arts at     oxford he gave several series of lectures which appeared later as     lectures on architecture and painting michael angelo and     tintoret val darno and the art of england      by this time he was renowned as an art critic but his theories     were strongly opposed and he was continually in hot water in his     zeal to defend turner or millais or burnejones he was rather     slashing in his criticism of other artists the libel suit brought     against him by whistler whom he described as a coxcomb who flung a     pot of paint in the face of the public is still talked about in     england the jury fancy a jury wrestling with a question of art     found ruskin guilty and decided that he should pay for the     artists damaged reputation the sum of one farthing whistler ever     afterwards wore the coin on his watch chain      sidenote ruskin the reformer      it was about the year 1860 that ruskin came under the influence of     carlyle and then began the effort at social reform which made     wreck of fame and hope and peace of mind carlyle had merely     preached of manual work but ruskin wholehearted in whatever he     did went out to mend roads and do other useful tasks to show his     belief in the doctrine carlyle railed against the industrial     system of england but ruskin devoted his fortune to remedying its     evils he established model tenements he founded libraries and     centers of recreation for workingmen he took women and children     out of factories and set them to spinning or weaving in their own     homes he founded st georges guild a wellhoused community which     combined work with education and which shared profits fairly among     the workers      england at first rubbed its eyes at these reforms then shrugged     its shoulders as at a harmless kind of madman but ruskin had the     temper of a crusader his sword was out against what was even then     called vested interests and presently his theories aroused a     tempest of opposition thackeray who as editor of the cornhill     magazine had gladly published ruskins first economic essays     was forced by the clamor of readers to discontinue the series     footnote while these essays were appearing there was published     1864 a textbook of english literature it spoke well of ruskins     books of art but added of late he has lost his way and has     written thingspapers in the cornhill chieflywhich are     not likely to add to his fame as a writer or to his character as a     man of common sense collier history of english     literature p 512 to this reform period belong unto this     last and other books dealing with political economy and also     sesame and lilies crown of wild olive and ethics     of the dust which were written chiefly for young people      sidenote end of the crusade      for twenty years this crusade continued then worn out and     misunderstood by both capitalists and workingmen ruskin retired     1879 to a small estate called brantwood in the lake district     his fortune had been spent in his attempt to improve labor     conditions and he lived now upon the modest income from his books     before he died in 1900 his friend charles eliot norton persuaded     him to write the story of his early life in præterita the     title is strange but the book itself is with one exception the     most interesting of ruskins works  works of ruskin the works of ruskin fall naturally into three classes which are called criticisms of art industry and life but which are in fact profound studies of the origin and meaning of art on the one hand and of the infinite value of human life on the other  the most popular of his art criticisms are st marks rest and mornings in florence which are widely used as guidebooks and which may be postponed until the happy time when in venice or florence one may read them to best advantage meanwhile in seven lamps of architecture or stones of venice or the first two volumes of modern painters one may grow acquainted with ruskins theory of art  sidenote his theory of art  his fundamental principle was summarized by pope in the line all nature is but art unknown to thee that nature is the artists source of inspiration that art at its best can but copy some natural beauty and that the copy should be preceded by careful and loving study of the originalthis was the sum of his early teaching next ruskin looked within the soul of the artist and announced that true art has a spiritual motive that it springs from the noblest ideals of life that the moral value of any people may be read in the pictures or buildings which they produced a third principle was that the best works of art reflecting as they do the ideals of a community should belong to the people not to a few collectors and a fourth exalted the usefulness of art in increasing not only the pleasure but the power of life so ruskin urged that art be taught in all schools and workshops and that every man be encouraged to put the stamp of beauty as well as of utility upon the work of his hands so also he formulated a plan to abolish factories and by a system of hand labor to give every worker the chance and the joy of selfexpression  sidenote theory of economics  in his theory of economics ruskin was even more revolutionary he wrote several works on the subject but the sum of his teaching may be found in unto this last and the sum is that political economy is merely commercial economy that it aims to increase trade and wealth at the expense of men and morals there is no wealth but life announced ruskin life including all its power of love of joy and of admiration and with minute exactness he outlined a plan for making the nation wealthy not by more factories and ships but by increasing the health and happiness of human beings  three quarters of a century earlier thomas jefferson in america had pleaded for the same ideal of national wealth and had characterized the race of the nations for commercial supremacy as a contagion of insanity jefferson was called a demagogue ruskin a madman but both men were profoundly right in estimating the wealth of a nation by its store of happiness for home consumption rather than by its store of goods for export they were misunderstood because they were too far in advance of their age to speak its trade language they belong not to the past or present but to the future  sidenote for young readers  if but one work of ruskin is to be read let it be sesame and lilies 1865 which is one of the books that no intelligent reader can afford to neglect the first chapter of kings treasuries is a noble essay on the subject of reading the second of queens gardens is a study of womans life and education a study which may appear oldfashioned now but which has so much of truth and beauty that it must again like colonial furniture become our best fashion these two essays footnote a third essay the mystery of life was added to sesame and lilies it is a sad despairing monologue and the book might be better off without it contain ruskins best thought on books and womanly character and also an outline of his teaching on nature art and society if we read sesame and lilies in connection with two other little books crown of wild olive which treats of work trade and war and ethics of the dust which deals with housekeeping we shall have the best that ruskin produced for his younger disciples  the quality of ruskin to the sensitiveness and sincerity of ruskin we have already called attention there is a third quality which appears frequently and which we call pedagogical insistence because the author seems to labor under the impression that he must drive something into ones head  this insistent note is apt to offend readers until they learn of ruskins motive and experience he lived in a commercial age an age that seemed to him blind to the beauty of the world and the purpose of his whole life was as he said to help those who having eyes see not his aim was high his effort heroic but for all his pains he was called a visionary a man with a dream book yet he was always exact and specific he would say go to a certain spot at a certain hour look in a certain direction and such and such beauties shall ye see and people would go and wag their heads and declare that no such prospect as ruskin described was visible to mortal eyes footnote for example ruskin gave in fors clavigera a description of a beautiful view from a bridge over the ettrick in scotland some people have sought that view in vain and a recent critic insists that it is invisible andrew lang history of english literature p 592 in venice or florence you may still meet travelers with one of ruskins books in hand peering about for the beauty which he says is apparent from such and such a spot and which every traveler ought to see  naturally ruskin with his dogmatic temper grew impatient of such blindness hence the increasing note of insistence of scolding even to which critics have called attention but we can forgive much in a writer who with marvelously clear vision sought only to point out the beauty of nature and the moral dignity of humanity  sidenote ruskins style  the beauty of ruskins style its musical rhythm or cadence its wealth of figure and allusion its brilliant coloring like a landscape of his favorite artist turnerall this is a source of pleasure to the reader entirely aside from the subject matter read for example the description of st marks cathedral in stones of venice or the reflected glories of nature in præterita or the contrast between salisbury towers and giottos campanile in seven lamps of architecture and see there descriptive eloquence at its best that this superb eloquence was devoted not to personal or party ends but to winning men to the love of beauty and truth and right living is the secret of ruskins high place in english letters and of his enduring influence on english life                                           summary the age of victoria 18371901 approaches our own so     closely that it is still difficult to form an accurate judgment of     its history or literature in a review of the history of the age we     noted three factors democracy science imperialism

have this double interest in early american literature that it is our own and unlike any other the literatures of europe began with wonder tales of a golden age with stories of fairy ships of kings akin to gods of heroes who ventured into enchanted regions and there waged battle with dragons or the powers of darkness american literature began with historical records with letters of love and friendship with diaries or journals of exploration with elegiac poems lamenting the death of beloved leaders or hearth companionsin a word with the chronicles of human experience in this respect of recording the facts and the truth of life as men and women fronted life bravely in the new world our early literature differs radically from that of any other great nation it brings us face to face not with myths or shadows but with our ancestors  two views of the pioneers it has become almost a habit among historians to disparage early american literature and nearly all our textbooks apologize for it on the ground that the forefathers had no artistic feeling their souls being oppressed by the gloom and rigor of puritanism  even as we read this apology our eyes rest contentedly upon a beautiful old piece of colonial furniture fashioned most artistically by the very men who are pitied for their want of art we remember also that the puritans furnished only one of several strong elements in early american life and that wherever the puritan influence was strongest there books and literary culture did most abound their private libraries for example make our own appear rather small and trashy by comparison footnote when plymouth consisted of a score of cabins and a meetinghouse it had at least two excellent libraries bradford had over three hundred books and brewster four hundred consisting of works of poetry philosophy science devotion and miscellanies covering the entire field of human knowledge in view of the scarcity of books in 1620 one of these collections which were common in all the new england settlements was equivalent to a modern library of thirty or forty thousand volumes cotton mather disciplined in the strictest of puritan homes wrote his poems in greek conducted a large foreign correspondence in latin read enormously published four hundred works and in thousands of citations proved himself intimate with the worlds books of poetry and history science and religion that the leaders of the colonies south and north were masters of an excellent prose style is evident from their own records that their style was influenced by their familiarity with the best literature appears in many waysin the immense collection of books in byrds mansion in virginia for instance or in the abundant quotations that are found in nearly all colonial writings before entering college and there was never another land with so few people and so many colleges as colonial america boys of fourteen passed a classical examination which few graduates would now care to face and the men of our early legislatures produced state papers which for force of reasoning and lucidity of expression have never been surpassed  sidenote the question of art  again our whole conception of american art may be modified by these considerations that it requires more genius to build a free state than to make a sonnet and the colonists were mighty statebuilders that a ship is a beautiful object and american ships with their graceful lines and towering clouds of canvas were once famous the world over that architecture is a noble art and colonial architecture still charms us by its beauty and utility after three hundred years of experimental building art is a great word and we use it too narrowly when we apply it to an ode of shelley or a mutilated statue of praxiteles but are silent before a colonial church or a free commonwealth or the constitution of the united states  illustration entrance to westover home of william byrd  instead of an apology for our early literature therefore we offer this possible explanation that our forefathers who set their faces to one of the most heroic tasks ever undertaken by man were too busy with great deeds inspired by the ideal of liberty to find leisure for the epic or drama in which the deeds and the ideal should be worthily reflected they left that work of commemoration to others and they are still waiting patiently for their poet meanwhile we read the straightforward record which they left as their only literary memorial not as we read the imaginative story of beowulf or ulysses but for the clear light of truth which it sheds upon the fathers and mothers of a great nation                                       the colonial period 16071765  the colonial period extends from the first english settlement at jamestown to the stamp act and other measures of taxation without representation which tended to unite the colonies and arouse the sleeping spirit of nationality during this century and a half the elizabethan dramatists produced their best work milton bunyan dryden and a score of lesser writers were adding to the wealth of english literature but not a single noteworthy volume crossed the atlantic to reflect in europe the lyric of the wilderness the drama of the commonwealth the epic of democracy such books as were written here dealt largely with matters of religion government and exploration and we shall hardly read these books with sympathy and therefore with understanding unless we remember two facts that the colonists grown weary of ancient tyranny were determined to write a new page in the worlds history and that they reverently believed god had called them to make that new page record the triumph of freedom and manhood hence the historical impulse and the moral or religious bent of nearly all our early writers  illustration plymouth in 1662 bradfords house on right  annalists and historians of the fifty or more annalists of the period we select two as typical of the rest the first is william bradford cir 15901657 a noble and learned man at one time governor of the plymouth colony in collaboration with winslow he wrote a journal of the mayflowers voyage long known as mourts relation and he continued this work independently by writing of plimouth plantation a ruggedly sincere history of the trials and triumph of the pilgrim fathers the second annalist is william byrd 16741744 who a century after bradford wrote his history of the dividing line and two other breezy journals that depict with equal ease and gayety the southern society of the early days and the march or campfire scenes of an exploring party in the wilderness  illustration william byrd  these two writers unconsciously reflected two distinct influences in colonial literature which are epitomized in the words puritan and cavalier bradford though a pilgrim not a puritan was profoundly influenced by the puritanic spirit of his age with its militant independence its zeal for liberty and righteousness its confidence in the divine guidance of human affairs when he wrote his history therefore he was in the mood of one to whom the lord had said as to abraham get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy fathers house and i will make of thee a great nation byrd though born and bred in democratic virginia had in him something of the aristocrat he reminds us of the gay cavaliers who left england to escape the stern discipline of cromwell and the triumphant puritans when he looked forth upon his goodly plantation or upon the wilderness with its teeming game he saw them not with the eyes of prophet or evangelist but as one who remembered that it was written and god saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good so he wrote his journal in an entertaining way making the best of misfortune cracking a joke at difficulty or danger and was well content to reflect this pleasant world without taking it upon his conscience to criticize or reform it  the same two types of cavalier and puritan appear constantly in our own and other literatures as representative of two worldviews two philosophies chaucer and langland were early examples in english poetry the one with his canterbury tales the other with his piers plowman and ever since then the same two classes of writers have been reflecting the same life from two different angles they are not english or american but human types they appear in every age and in every free nation  colonial poetry there were several recognized poets in colonial days and even the annalists and theologians had a rhyming fancy which often broke loose from the bounds of prose the quantity of colonial verse is therefore respectable but the quality of it suffered from two causes first the writers overlooked the feeling of their own hearts the true source of lyric poetry and wrote of indian wars theology and other unpoetic matters second they wrote poetry not for its own sake but to teach moral or religious lessons footnote the above criticism applies only to poetry written in english for ordinary readers at that time many college men wrote poetry in greek and latin and the quality of it compares favorably with similar poetry written in england during the same period several specimens of this scholars poetry are preserved in mathers magnalia and there is one remarkable poem in greek which was written in harvard college by an indian one of eliots boys who a few years earlier had been a whooping savage thus the most widely read poem of the period was the day of doom which aimed frankly to recall sinners from their evil ways by holding before their eyes the terrors of the last judgment it was written by michael wigglesworth in 1662 this man who lived a heroic but melancholy life had a vein of true poetry in him as when he wrote his dear new england dearest land to me and from his bed of suffering sent out the call to his people    cheer on brave souls my heart is with you all  but he was too much absorbed in stern theological dogmas to find the beauty of life or the gold of poesie and his masterpiece once prized by an immense circle of readers seems now a grotesque affair which might appear even horrible were it not rendered harmless by its jigging yankeedoodle versification  the most extravagantly praised versifier of the age and the first to win a reputation in england as well as in america was anne bradstreet 16121672 who wrote a book of poems that a london publisher proudly issued under the title of the tenth muse 1650 the best of colonial poets was thomas godfrey of philadelphia 17361763 whose juvenile poems with the prince of parthia a tragedy contained a few lyrics odes and pastorals that were different in form and spirit from anything hitherto attempted on this side of the atlantic this slender volume was published in 1765 soon after godfreys untimely death with its evident love of beauty and its carefulness of poetic form it marks the beginning here of artistic literature that is literature which was written to please readers rather than to teach history or moral lessons  nature and human nature in the literature of the world the two subjects of abiding poetic interest are nature and human nature but as these subjects appear in colonial records they are uniformly prosaic and the reason is very simple before nature can be the theme of poets she must assume her winsome mood must soothe and heal and bless the human heart after the clamor of politics the weariness of trade the cruel strife of society to read wordsworths tintern abbey or bryants to a waterfowl is to understand the above criticism but the nature which the colonists first looked upon seemed wild and strange and often terrible their somber forests were vast mysterious forbidding and they knew not what perils lurked in them or beyond them the new climate might give them sunshine or healing rain but was quite as likely to strike their houses with thunderbolts or harrow their harvests with a cyclone meanwhile marauding crows pulled up their precious corn fierce owls with tufted heads preyed upon their poultry bears and eagles harried their flocks the winter wail of the wolf pack or the scream of a hungry panther sounding through icy echoless woods made them shiver in their cabins and draw nearer the blazing fire of pine knots on the hearth  illustration new amsterdam new york in 1663  we can understand therefore why there was little poetry of nature in colonial literature and why instead of sonnets to moonbeams or nightingales we meet quaint and fascinating studies of natural or unnatural history such are josselyns new englands rarities discovered and the first part of william woods new englands prospect and such are many chapters of byrds dividing line and other annals that deal with plant or animal lifebooks that we now read with pleasure since the nature that was once wild and strange has become in our eyes familiar and dear  as for the second subject of poetic interest human nature the colonists had as much of that as any other people but human nature as it revealed itself in religious controversy or became a burden in the immigrants that were unloaded on our shores for the relief of europe or the enrichment of the early transportation companies as bradford and beverley both tell usthis furnished a vital subject not for poetry but for prose and protest  sidenote the indians  the indians especially the wild men as they were called slipping out of the shadows or vanishing into mysterious distances were a source of anxiety and endless speculation to the early settlers european writers like rousseau who had never seen an indian or heard a warwhoop had been industrious in idealizing the savages attributing to them all manner of noble virtues and the sentimental attitude of these foreign writers was reflected here after the eastern indians had wellnigh vanished in such stories as mrs mortons quabi or the virtues of nature a romance in verse which was published in 1790 in the same romantic strain are coopers last of the mohicans helen hunts ramona and some of the early poems of freneau and whittier  the colonists on the other hand had no poetic illusions about the savages their enjoyment of this phase of human nature was hardly possible so long as they had to proceed warily on a forest trail their eyes keen for the first glimpse of a hideously painted face their ears alert for the twang of a bowstring or the hiss of a feathered arrow their deep but practical interest in the indians found expression in scores of books which fall roughly into three groups in the first are the scholarly works of the heroic john eliot the apostle to the indians of daniel gookin also and of a few others who made careful studies of the language and customs of the various indian tribes in the second group are the startling experiences of men and women who were carried away by the savages leaving slaughtered children and burning homes behind them such are mary rowlandsons the sovereignty and goodness of god and john williamss the redeemed captive both famous in their day and still of lively interest in the third group are the fighting stories such as john masons history of the pequot war the adventures and hairbreadth escapes recorded as sober facts in these narratives were an excellent substitute for fiction during the colonial period moreover they furnished a motive and method for the indian tales and wild west stories which have since appeared as the sands of the sea for multitude  religious writers a very large part of our early writings is devoted to religious subjects and for an excellent reason namely that large numbers of the colonists came to america to escape religious strife or persecution at home in the new world they sought religious peace as well as freedom of worship and were determined to secure it not only for themselves but for their childrens children hence in nearly all their writings the religious motive was uppermost hardly were they settled here however when they were rudely disturbed by agitators who fomented discord by preaching each his own pet doctrine or heresy presently arose a score of controversial writers and then anne hutchinson roger williams and the early quakers were disciplined or banished not because of their faith for the fact is that all the colonies contained men of widely different beliefs who lived peaceably together but because these unbalanced reformers were obstinately bent upon stirring up strife in a community which had crossed three thousand miles of ocean in search of peace  of the theological writers we again select two not because they were typicalfor it is hard to determine who among the hundred writers that fronted the burning question of religious tolerance were representative of their agebut simply because they towered head and shoulders above their contemporaries these are cotton mather and jonathan edwards the one the most busy man of his age in politics religion education and all philanthropic endeavor the other a profound thinker who was in the world but not of it and who devoted the great powers of his mind to such problems as the freedom of the human will and the origin of the religious impulse in humanity  illustration cotton mather  sidenote cotton mather  cotton mather 16631728 is commonly known by his wonders of the invisible world which dealt with the matter of demons and witchcraft but that is one of the least of his four hundred works and it has given a wrong impression of the author and of the age in which he lived his chief work is the magnalia christi americana or the ecclesiastical history of new england 1702 which is a strange jumble of patriotism and pedantry of wisdom and foolishness written in the fantastic style of robert burtons anatomy of melancholy the most interesting and valuable parts of this chaotic work are the second and third books which give us the life stories of bradford winthrop eliot phipps and many other heroic worthies who helped mightily in laying the foundation of the american republic  illustration jonathan edwards  the most famous works of jonathan edwards 17031758 are the socalled freedom of the will and the treatise concerning the religious affections but these are hard reading not to be lightly undertaken it is from the authors minor and neglected works that one receives the impression that he was a very great and noble man shackled by a terrible theology by his scholarship his rare sincerity his love of truth his original mind and his transparent style of writing he exercised probably a greater influence at home and abroad than any other writer of the colonial era in whittiers poem the preacher there is a tribute to the tender humanity of edwards following this picture of his stern thinking    in the church of the wilderness edwards wrought   shaping his creed at the forge of thought   and with thors own hammer welded and bent   the iron links of his argument   which strove to grasp in its mighty span   the purpose of god and the fate of man                                       the revolutionary period 17651800  the literary period included in the above term is in general the latter half of the eighteenth century more particularly it extends from the stamp act 1765 which united the colonies in opposition to britains policy of taxation to the adoption of the constitution 1787 and the inauguration of washington as first president of the new nation  sidenote party literature  the writings of this stormy period reflect the temper of two very different classes who were engaged in constant literary party warfare in the tense years which preceded the literature revolution the american people separated into two hostile parties the tories or loyalists who supported the mother country and the whigs or patriots who insisted on the right of the colonies to manage their own affairs and who furnished the armies that followed washington in the war of independence then when america had won a place among the free nations of the world her people were again divided on the question of the constitution on the one side were the federalists who aimed at union in the strictest sense that is at a strongly centralized government with immense powers over all its parts on the other side were the antifederalists or antis who distrusted the monarchical tendency of every centralized government since time began and who aimed to safeguard democracy by leaving the governing power as largely as possible in the hands of the several states it is necessary to have these distinctions clearly in mind in reading revolutionary literature for a very large part of its prose and poetry reflects the antagonistic aims or ideals of two parties which stood in constant and most bitter opposition  in general the literature of the revolution is dominated by political and practical interests it deals frankly with this present world aims to find the best way through its difficulties and so appears in marked contrast with the theological bent and pervasive other worldliness of colonial writings  benjamin franklin standing between the two eras and marking the transition from spiritual to practical interests is benjamin franklin 17061790 a selfmade man who seems well content with his handiwork during the latter part of his life and for a century after his death he was held up to young americans as a striking example of practical wisdom and worldly success  illustration benjamin franklin  the narrative of franklins patriotic service belongs to political rather than to literary history for though his pen was busy for almost seventy years during which time he produced an immense amount of writing his end was always very practical rather than aesthetic that is he aimed to instruct rather than to please his readers only one of his works is now widely known the incomplete autobiography which is in the form of a letter telling a straightforward story of franklins early life of the disadvantages under which he labored and the industry by which he overcame them for some reason the book has become a classic in our literature and young americans are urged to read it though they often show an independent taste by regarding it askance as an example of what may be accomplished by perseverance and as a stimulus to industry in the prosaic matter of getting a living it doubtless has its value but one will learn nothing of love or courtesy or reverence or loyalty to high ideals by reading it neither will one find in its selfsatisfied pages any conception of the moral dignity of humanity or of the infinite value of the human soul the chief trouble with the autobiography and most other works of franklin is that in them mind and matter character and reputation virtue and prosperity are for the most part hopelessly confounded  on the other hand there is a sincerity a plain directness of style in the writings of franklin which makes them pleasantly readable unlike some other apostles of common sense he is always courteous and of a friendly spirit he seems to respect the reader as well as himself and even in his argumentative or humorous passages is almost invariably dignified in expression  illustration franklins shop  other works of franklin which were once popular are the maxims of his poor richards almanac which appeared annually from 1732 to 1757 these maximssuch as light purse heavy heart diligence is the mother of good luck he who waits upon fortune is never sure of a dinner god helps them who help themselves honesty is the best policy and many others in a similar veinwere widely copied in colonial and european publications and to this day they give to americans abroad a reputation for yankee shrewdness the best of them were finally strung together in the form of a discourse the alleged speech of an old man at an auction where people were complaining of the taxes which under various titles such as the way to wealth and father abrahams speech has been translated into every civilized language following is a brief selection from which one may judge the spirit of the entire address      it would be thought a hard government that should tax its people     one tenth part of their time to be employed in its service but     idleness taxes many of us much more sloth by bringing on     diseases absolutely shortens life sloth like rust consumes     faster than labor wears while the used key is always bright as     poor richard says but dost thou love life then do not squander     time for that is the stuff life is made of as poor richard says     how much more than is necessary do we spend in sleep forgetting     that the sleeping fox catches no poultry and that there will be     sleeping enough in the grave as poor richard says if time be of     all things the most precious wasting time must be as poor richard     says the greatest prodigality since as he elsewhere tells us     lost time is never found again and what we call time enough     always proves little enough let us then be up and be doing and     doing to the purpose so by diligence shall we do more with less     perplexity sloth makes all things difficult but industry all     easy and he that riseth late must trot all day and shall scarce     overtake his business at night while laziness travels so slowly     that poverty soon overtakes him drive thy business let not that     drive thee and early to bed and early to rise makes a man     healthy wealthy and wise as poor richard says  revolutionary poetry the poetry of the revolution an abundant but weedy crop was badly influenced by two factors by the political strife between patriots and loyalists and by the slavish imitation of pope and other formalists who were then the models for nearly all versifiers on both sides of the atlantic the former influence appears in numerous ballads or narrative poems which were as popular in the days of washington as ever they were in the time of robin hood every important event of the revolution was promptly celebrated in verse but as the country was then sharply divided almost every ballad had a whig or a tory twist to it in consequence we must read two different collections such as moores songs and ballads of the american revolution and sargents loyalist poetry of the revolution for supplementary views of the same great struggle  sidenote the hartford wits  the influence of pope and his school is especially noticeable in the work of a group of men called the hartford wits who at the beginning of our national life had the worthy ambition to create a national literature prominent among these socalled wits were joel barlow 17541812 and timothy dwight 17521817 in such ponderous works as barlows columbiad and dwights conquest of canaan both written in mechanical rhymed couplets we have a reflection not of the glories of american history as the authors intended but of two aspiring men who without genius or humor hoped by industry to produce poems that in size at least should be worthy of a country that stretched between two oceans  more gifted than either of his fellow wits was john trumbull 17501831 who had the instinct of a poet but who was led aside by the strife of whigs and tories into the barren field of political satire his bestknown work is mfingal 1775 a burlesque poem in the doggerel style of butlers hudibras which ridiculed a tory squire and described his barbarous punishment at the hands of a riotous mob of whigs it was the most widely quoted poem of the entire revolutionary period and is still interesting as an example of rough humor and as a reflection of the militant age in which it was produced  sidenote freneau  by far the best poet of the revolution was philip freneau 17521832 in his early years he took milton instead of pope for his poetic master then as his independence increased he sought the ancient source of all poetry in the feeling of the human heart in presence of nature or human nature in such poems as the house of night indian burying ground wild honeysuckle eutaw springs ruins of a country inn and a few others in which he speaks from his own heart he anticipated the work of wordsworth coleridge and other leaders of what is now commonly known as the romantic revival in english poetry  when the revolution drew on apace freneau abandoned his poetic dream and exercised a ferocious talent for satiric verse in lashing english generals native tories royal proclamations and other matters far removed from poetry in later years he wrote much prose also and being a radical and outspoken democrat he became a thorn in the side of washington and the federal party the bulk of his work both prose and verse is a redpeppery kind of commentary on the political history of the age in which he lived  illustration philip freneau  orators and statesmen for a full century or from the stamp act to the civil war oratory was a potent influence in molding our national life and unlike other influences which grow by slow degrees it sprang into vigorous life in the period of intense agitation that preceded the revolution never before or since has the power of the spoken word been more manifest than during the years when questions of state were debated not by kings or counselors behind closed doors but by representative men in open assembly by farmers and artisans in town halls fronting a village green by scholarly ministers in the pulpits of churches whose white steeples with their golden vanes spoke silently ceaselessly of god and freedom as the two motives which had inspired the fathers to brave the perils of a savage wilderness  among the most famous addresses of the age were the speech of james otis in the town hall at boston 1761 and the liberty or death speech of patrick henry to the virginia burgesses assembled in st johns church in richmond 1775 to compare these stirring appeals to patriotism with the parliamentary addresses of a brilliant contemporary edmund burke is to note a striking difference between english and american oratory of the period the one charming the ear by its eloquence the other rousing the will to action like a bugle call  illustration thomas jefferson  the statesmen of the revolution that glorious band whom washington led were also voluminous writers and masters of a clear forceful style but it would probably surprise them now to find themselves included in a history of literature in truth they hardly belong there for they wrote not with any artistic impulse to create a work of beauty that should please their readers their practical aim was to inculcate sound political principles or to move their readers to the right action if we contrast them with certain of their british contemporaries with goldsmith and burns for example the truth of the above criticism will be evident nevertheless these statesmen produced a body of socalled citizen literature devoted to the principles and duties of free government which has never been rivaled in its own field and which is quite as remarkable in its own way as the nature poetry of bryant or the romances of cooper or any other purely literary work produced in america  illustration alexander hamilton  hamilton and jefferson these two statesmen who became bitter antagonists during the struggle over the constitution may be selected as typical of all the rest the story of their splendid services in the cause of liberty cannot be told here such men belong to history rather than to literature but we may at least note that they deserve more careful and unprejudiced study than rival political parties have thus far given them their work has a broad human interest which extends far beyond the borders of america since they stand for two radically different conceptions of life one aristocratic the other democratic which appear in every age and explain the political and social divisions among free peoples hamilton the federalist denied the right and the ability of common men to govern themselves he was the champion of aristocracy of class privilege of centralized power in the hands of the few whom he deemed worthy by birth or talent to govern a nation the most significant trait of jefferson the antifederalist was his lifelong devotion to democracy he believed in common men in their ability to choose the right and their purpose to follow it and he mightily opposed every tendency to aristocracy or class privilege in america in the struggle over the constitution he was fearful that the united states government would become monarchical if given too much authority and aimed to safeguard democracy by leaving the governing power as largely as possible in the hands of the several states to readers who are not politicians the most interesting thing concerning these two leaders is that hamilton the champion of aristocracy was obscurely born and appeared here as a stranger to make his own way by his own efforts while jefferson the uncompromising democrat came from an excellent virginia family and was familiar from his youth with aristocratic society  illustration monticello the home of jefferson in virginia the westward front  sidenote typical writings  the bestknown work of hamilton to which madison and jay contributed liberally is the federalist 1787 this is a remarkable series of essays supporting the constitution and illuminating the principles of union and federation the one work of jefferson which will make his name remembered to all ages is the declaration of independence besides this document which is less a state paper than a prose chant of freedom he wrote a multitude of works a part of which are now collected in ten large volumes these are known only to historians but the casual reader will find many things of interest in jeffersons letters in his autobiography and in his summary view of the rights of america 1774 the lastnamed work gave burke some information and inspiration for his famous oration on conciliation with america and was a potent influence in uniting the colonies in their struggle for independence  miscellaneous works in the miscellaneous works of the period may be found more pleasurable reading than in the portly volumes that contain the epics of the hartford wits or the arguments of revolutionary statesmen as a type of the forceful political pamphlet a weapon widely used in england and america in the eighteenth century there is nothing equal to thomas paines common sense 1776 and the crisis 17761783 the former hastened on the declaration of independence the latter cheered the young patriots in their struggle to make that declaration valid in the sight of all nations jonathan carvers travels through the interior parts of north america 1778 is an excellent outdoor book dealing with picturesque incidents of exploration in unknown wilds the letters of abigail adams eliza wilkinson and dolly madison portray quiet scenes of domestic life and something of the brave helpful spirit of the mothers of the revolution crèvecoeurs letters from an american farmer 1782 draws charming almost idyllic pictures of american life during the revolutionary period and incidentally calls attention to the melting pot in which people of various races are here fused into a common stock this mongrel meltingpot idea a crazy notion is supposed to be modern and has lately occasioned some flighty dramas and novels but that it is as old as unrestricted immigration appears plainly in one of crèvecoeurs fanciful sketches      what then is the american this new man he is either a european     or a descendant of a european hence that strange mixture of blood     which you will find in no other country i could point out to you a     family whose grandfather was an englishman whose wife was dutch     whose son married a french woman and whose present four sons have     now four wives of different nations he is an american who     leaving behind him all his ancient prejudices and manners receives     new ones from the new mode of life he has embraced the new     government he obeys the new rank he holds he becomes an american     by being received in the broad lap of our great alma mater      here individuals of all nations are melted into a new race of men     whose labours and posterity will one day cause great changes in the     world americans are the western pilgrims who are carrying along     with them that great mass of arts sciences vigour and industry     which began long since in the east they will finish the great     circle the americans were once scattered all over europe here     they are incorporated into one of the finest systems of population     which has ever appeared and which hereafter will become distinct     by the power of the different climate they inhabit the american is     a new man who acts upon new principles he must therefore     entertain new ideas and form new opinions from involuntary     idleness servile dependence penury and useless labour he has     passed to toils of a very different nature rewarded by ample     subsistence this is an american  finally there is the journal of john woolman 1774 written by a gentle member of the society of friends which records a spiritual rather than a worldly experience and which in contrast with the general tumult of revolutionary literature is as a thrush song in the woods at twilight it is a book for those who can appreciate its charm of simplicity and sincerity but the few who know it are inclined to prize it far above the similar work of franklin and to unite with channing in calling it the sweetest and purest autobiography in the english language  beginning of american fiction those who imagine that american fiction began with irving or cooper or poe as is sometimes alleged will be interested to learn of susanna rowson daughter of an english father and an american mother whose later stories at least belong to our literature in 1790 she published charlotte temple a romance that was immensely popular in its own day and that has proved far more enduring than any modern best seller during the next century the book ran through more than one hundred editions the last appearing in 1905 and from first to last it has had probably more readers than any novel of scott or cooper or dickens the reception of this work indicates the widespread interest in fiction here in the late eighteenth century moreover as there were then two types of fiction in england the sentimentalism of richardson and the realism of fielding so in america the gushing romances of mrs rowson were opposed by the female quixotism and other alleged realistic stories of tabitha tenney both schools of fiction had here their authors and their multitudinous readers while irving and cooper were learning their alphabet and poe was yet unborn  illustration charles brockden brown  into the crude but hopeful beginnings of american fiction we shall not enter for the simple reason that our earliest romances are hardly worth the time or patience of any but historical students at the close of the revolutionary period however appeared a writer whom we may call with some justice the first american novelist this was charles brockden brown 17711810 who is worthy to be remembered on three counts he was the first in this country to follow literature as a profession he chose american rather than foreign heroes and pictured them against an american background and finally his use of horrible or grotesque incidents was copied by poe his indian adventures suggested a fruitful theme to cooper and his minute analysis of motives and emotions was carried out in a more artistic way by hawthorne hence we may find in browns neglected works something of the material and the method of our three greatest writers of fiction  sidenote the motive of horror  the six romances of brown are all dominated by the motive of horror and are modeled on the socalled gothic novel with its sentimental heroine its diabolical villain its ghastly mystery its passages of prolonged agony if we ask why an american writer should choose this bizarre type the answer is that agonizing stories were precisely what readers then wanted and brown depended upon his stories for his daily bread at the present time a different kind of fiction is momentarily popular yet if we begin one of browns bloodcurdling romances the chances are that we shall finish it since it appeals to that strange interest in morbid themes which leads so many to read poe or some other purveyor of horrors and mysteries wieland 1798 is commonly regarded as the best of browns works but is too grotesque and horrible to be recommended edgar huntley 1801 with its indian adventures depicted against a background of wild nature is a little more wholesome and may serve very well as a type of the romances that interested readers a century or more ago                                           summary the colonial period covers the century and a half from the     settlement of jamestown in 1607 to the stamp act of 1765 the     literature of this early age shows two general characteristics one     historical the other theological the colonists believed that they     were chosen by god to establish a new nation of freemen hence     their tendency to write annals and to preserve every document that     might be of use to the future republic moreover they were for the     most part religious men and women they aimed to give their     children sound education and godly character hence their     insistence on schools and universities seven colleges were quickly     founded in the wilderness for the training of leaders of the     people hence also the religious note which sounds through nearly     all their writing      in our review of the colonial period we noted four classes of     writers i the annalists and historians of whom bradford and     byrd were selected as typical of two classes of writers who appear     constantly in our own and other literatures 2 the poets of whom     wigglesworth anne bradstreet and godfrey are the most notable 3     a few characteristic books dealing with nature and the indians     which served readers of those days in the place of fiction 4     theological writers among whom cotton mather and jonathan edwards     are the most conspicuous      the revolutionary period extends from 1765 to the close of the     century a large part of the literature of this period deals in     the early years with the strife of loyalists and patriots or in     the later years with the word wars of federalists and     antifederalists these are the political parties into which     america was divided by the revolution and by the question of the     constitution in general revolutionary writing has a practical     bent in marked contrast with the theological spirit of colonial     writing      our study of revolutionary literature includes 1 benjamin     franklin who marks the transition from colonial to revolutionary     times from spiritual to worldly interests 2 revolutionary     poetry with its numerous ballads and political satires the effort     of the hartford wits to establish a national literature and the     work of philip freneau who was a romantic poet at heart but who     was led aside by the strife of the age into political and satiric     writing 3 orators and statesmen of whom otis and henry     hamilton and jefferson were selected as typical 4 miscellaneous     writers

nineteenth     century that america began to be counted among the great nations of     the world and it was precisely at that time that she produced her     first national literature a literature so broadly human that it     appealed not only to the whole country but to readers beyond the     sea irving cooper and bryant are commonly regarded as the first     notable new world writers and we may better understand them and     their enthusiastic young contemporaries if we remember that they     grew up with the country that they reflected life at a time when     america having won her independence and emerged from a long period     of doubt and struggle was taking her first confident steps in the     sun and becoming splendidly conscious of her destiny as a leader     among the worlds free people      sidenote national enthusiasm      indeed there was good reason for confidence in those early days     for never had a young nation looked forth upon a more heartening     prospect the primitive hamlets of colonial days had been replaced     by a multitude of substantial towns the somber wilderness by a     prosperous farming country the power of a thousand rivers was     turning the wheels of as many mills or factories and to the     natural wealth of america was added the increase of a mighty     commerce with other nations by the louisiana purchase and the     acquisition of florida her territory was vastly increased and     still her sturdy pioneers were pressing eagerly into more spacious     lands beyond the mississippi best of all this enlarging nation     once a number of scattered colonies holding each to its own course     was now the union her people were as one in their patriotism     their loyalty their intense conviction that the brave new world     experiment in free government once scoffed at as an idle dream     was destined to a glorious future american democracy was not     merely a success it was an amazing triumph moreover this     democracy supposed to be the weakest form of government had     already proved its power it had sent its navy abroad to humble the     insolent barbary states and had measured the temper of its soul     and the strength of its arm in the second war with great britain      in fine the new world had brought forth a hopeful young giant of a     nation and its hopefulness was reflected with more of zeal than     of art in the prose and poetry of its literary men just as the     enthusiastic elizabethan spirit reflected itself in lyric or drama     after the defeat of the armada so the american spirit seemed to     exult in the romances of cooper and simms in the verse of     pinckney halleck drake and percival in a multitude of national     songs such as the american flag warrens address home sweet     home and the starspangled banner we would not venture to liken     one set of writings to the other for we should be on the weak side     of an elizabethan comparison we simply note that a great national     enthusiasm was largely responsible for the sudden appearance of a     new literature in the one land as in the other  literary environment in the works of four writers irving cooper bryant and poe we have the best that the early national period produced but we shall not appreciate these writers until we see them like pines in a wood lifting their heads over numerous companions all drawing their nourishment from the same soil and air the growth of towns and cities in america had led to a rapid increase of newspapers magazines and annuals collections of contemporary prose and verse which called with increasing emphasis for poems stories essays light or polite literature the rapid growth of the nation set men to singing the old psalm of sursum corda and every man and woman who felt the impulse added his story or his verse to the national chorus when the first attempt at a summary of american literature was made in 1837 the author royal robbins found more than two thousand living writers demanding his attention  sidenote knickerbocker school  it was due one must think to geography rather than to any spirit of sectionalism to difficulty of travel between the larger towns rather than to any difference of aim or motive that the writers of this period associated themselves in a number of socalled schools or literary centers new york which now offered a better field for literary work than boston or philadelphia had its important group of writers called the knickerbocker school which included fitzgreene halleck and joseph rodman drake both poets and cheerful satirists of new world society the versatile nathaniel parker willis writer of twenty volumes of poems essays stories and sketches of travel and james kirke paulding also a voluminous writer who worked with irving in the salmagundi essays and whose historical novels such as the dutchmans fireside 1831 are still mildly interesting footnote irving cooper and bryant are sometimes classed among the knickerbockers but the work of these major writers is national rather than local or sectional and will be studied later in detail  sidenote southern writers  in the south was another group of young writers quite as able and enthusiastic as their northern contemporaries among these we note especially william gilmore simms 18061870 whose yemassee border beagles katherine walton and many other historical romances of colonial and revolutionary days were of more than passing interest he was a highminded and most industrious writer who produced over forty volumes of poems essays biographies histories and tales but he is now remembered chiefly by his novels which won him the title of the cooper of the south at least one of his historical romances should be read partly for its own sake and partly for a comparison with coopers work in the same field thus the yemassee 1835 dealing with frontier life and indian warfare may be read in connection with coopers the deerslayer 1841 which has the same general theme or the partisan 1835 dealing with the bitter struggle of southern whigs and tories during the revolution may well be compared with coopers the spy 1821 which depicts the same struggle in a northern environment  illustration william gilmore simms  other notable writers of the south during this period were richard henry wilde the poet now remembered by the song from an unfinished opera beginning my life is like the summer rose william wirt the essayist and biographer and john pendleton kennedy writer of essays and stories which contain many charming pictures of social life in virginia and maryland in the days before the war  sidenote new england and the west  in new england was still another group who fortunately avoided the name of any school sparks prescott ticknor story danathe very names indicate how true was boston to her old scholarly traditions meanwhile connecticut had its popular poet in james gates percival maine had its versatile john neal and all the northern states were reading the goody goody books of peter parley samuel goodrich the somewhat byronic zophiel and other emotional poems of maria gowen brooks whom southey called maria del occidente and the historical romances of catherine sedgwick and sarah morton  illustration john pendleton kennedy  the west also everything beyond the alleghenies was then the west made its voice heard in the new literature timothy flint wrote a very interesting journal from his missionary experiences and a highly colored romance from his expansive imagination and james hall drew some vigorous and sympathetic pictures of frontier life in letters from the west tales of the border and wilderness and warpath  there are many other writers who won recognition before 1840 but those we have named are more than enough for each name is an invitation and invitations when numerous are simply bothersome for example the name of catherine sedgwick invites us to read hope leslie and the linwoods both excellent in their day and still interesting as examples of the novels that won fame less than a century ago or the name of kennedy leads us to swallow barn alluring title with its bright pictures of virginia life and to horseshoe robinson a crude but stirring tale of revolutionary heroism the point in naming these minor writers once as popular as any presentday favorite is simply this that the major authors whom we ordinarily study as typical of the age were not isolated figures but part of a great romantic movement in literature that they were influenced on the one hand by european letters and on the other by a host of native writers who were all intent on reflecting the expanding life of america in the early part of the nineteenth century                                       washington irving 17831859  a very pleasant writer is irving a man of romantic and somewhat sentimental disposition but sound of motive careful of workmanship invincibly cheerful of spirit the genial quality of his work may be due to the fact that from joyous boyhood to serene old age he did very much as he pleased that he lived in what seemed to him an excellent world and wrote with no other purpose than to make it happy in summarizing his career an admirer of irving is reminded of what the book of proverbs says of wisdom her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace  sidenote the man and his times  the historian sees another side of irvings work should it be asked what did he do that had not been as well or better done before him the first answer is that the importance of any mans work must be measured by the age in which he did it a schoolboy now knows more about electricity than ever franklin learned but that does not detract from our wonder at franklins kite so the work of irving seems impressive when viewed against the gray literary dawn of a century ago at that time america had done a mighty work for the world politically but had added little of value to the worlds literature she read and treasured the best books but she made no contribution to their number and her literary impotence galled her sensitive spirit as if to make up for her failure the writers of the knickerbocker charleston and other schools praised each others work extravagantly but no responsive echo came from overseas where englands terse criticism of our literary effort was expressed in the scornful question who reads an american book  irving answered that question effectively when his sketch book bracebridge hall and tales of a traveller found a multitude of delighted readers on both sides of the atlantic his graceful style was hardly rivaled by any other writer of the period and england at a time when scott and byron were playing heroic parts welcomed him heartily to a place on the literary stage thus he united the english and the american reader in a common interest and as it were charmed away the sneer from one face the resentment from the other he has been called father of our american letters for two reasons because he was the first to win a lasting literary reputation at home and abroad and because of the formative influence which his graceful style and artistic purpose have ever since exerted upon our prose writers  illustration washington irving      life two personal characteristics appear constantly in irvings     work the first that he was always a dreamer a romance seeker     the second that he was inclined to close his eyes to the heroic     present and open them wide to the glories real or imaginary of     the remote past though he lived in an american city in a day of     mighty changes and discoveries he was far less interested in the     modern new york than in the ancient new amsterdam and though he     was in europe at the time of the napoleonic wars he apparently saw     nothing of them being then wholly absorbed in the battles of the     longvanished moors only once in his books of western     exploration did he seriously touch the vigorous life of his own     times and critics regard these books as the least important of all     his works      sidenote boyhood      he was born in new york 1783 when the present colossal city was a     provincial town that retained many of its quaint dutch     characteristics over all the straggling town from the sunny     battery with its whitewinged ships to the harlem woods where was     good squirrel shooting irving rambled at ease on many a day when     the neighbors said he ought to have been at his books he was the     youngest of the family his constitution was not rugged and his     gentle mother was indulgent she would smile when he told of     reading a smuggled copy of the arabian nights in school     instead of his geography she was silent when he slipped away from     family prayers to climb out of his bedroom window and go to the     theater while his sterner father thought of him as sound asleep in     his bed      little harm came from these escapades for irving was a merry lad     with no meanness in him but his schooling was sadly neglected his     brothers had graduated from columbia but on the plea of delicate     health he abandoned the idea of college with a sigh in which there     was perhaps as much satisfaction as regret at sixteen he entered a     law office where he gave less time to studying blackstone than to     reading novels and writing skits for the newspapers      sidenote finding himself      this happy indifference to work and learning this disposition to     linger on the sunny side of the street went with irving through     life experimentally he joined his brothers who were in the     hardware trade but when he seemed to be in danger of consumption     they sent him to europe where he enjoyed himself greatly and     whence he returned perfectly well next he was sent on business to     england and there when the irving brothers failed their business     having been ruined by the war of 1812 irving manfully resolved to     be no longer a burden on others and turned to literature for his     support with characteristic love of doing what he liked he refused     a good editorial position which walter scott obtained for him and     busied himself with his sketch book 1820 this met with a     generous welcome in england and america and it was followed by the     equally popular bracebridge hall and tales of a     traveller by these three works irving was assured not only of     literary fame but what was to him of more consequence of his     ability to earn his living      sidenote life abroad      next we find him in spain whither he went with the purpose of     translating navarretes voyages of columbus a spanish book     in which he saw a chance of profit from his countrymens interest     in the man who discovered america instead of translating another     mans work however he wrote his own life and times of     columbus 1828 the financial success of this book which is     still our most popular biography of the great explorer enabled     irving to live comfortably in spain where he read diligently and     accumulated the material for his later works on spanish history      illustration sunnyside home of irving      by this time irvings growing literary fame had attracted the     notice of american politicians who rewarded him with an     appointment as secretary of the legation at london this pleasant     office he held for two years but was less interested in it than in     the reception which english men of letters generously offered him     then he apparently grew homesick after an absence of seventeen     years and returned to his native land where he was received with     the honor due to a man who had silenced the galling question who     reads an american book      sidenote his mellow autumn      the rest of irvings long life was a continued triumph amazed at     first and then a little stunned by the growth the hurry the     onward surge of his country he settled back into the restful past     and was heard with the more pleasure by his countrymen because he     seemed to speak to them from a vanished age once inspired by the     tide of life weeping into the west he journeyed beyond the     mississippi and found material for his pioneering books but an     active life was far from his taste and presently he built his     house sunnyside appropriate name at tarrytown on the hudson     there he spent the remainder of his days with the exception of     four years in which he served the nation as ambassador to spain     this honor urged upon him by webster and president tyler was     accepted with characteristic modesty not as a personal reward but     as a tribute which america had been wont to offer to the profession     of letters  chief works of irving a good way to form a general impression of irvings works is to arrange them chronologically in five main groups the first consisting of the salmagundi essays the knickerbocker history and a few other trifles we may call the oldstyle group after the pseudonym assumed by the author footnote ever since revolutionary days it had been the fashion for young american writers to use an assumed name irving appeared at different times as jonathan oldstyle diedrich knickerbocker and geoffrey crayon gent the second or sketchbook group includes the sketch book bracebridge hall and tales of a traveller the third or alhambra group devoted to spanish and moorish themes includes the conquest of granada spanish voyages of discovery the alhambra and certain similar works of a later period such as moorish chronicles and legends of the conquest of spain the fourth or western group contains a tour on the prairies astoria and adventures of captain bonneville the fifth or sunnyside group is made up chiefly of biographies oliver goldsmith mahomet and his successors and the life of washington besides these are some essays and stories assembled under the titles of spanish papers and wolferts roost  the salmagundi papers and others of the oldstyle group would have been forgotten long ago if anybody else had written them in other words our interest in them is due not to their intrinsic value for they are all small potatoes but to the fact that their author became a famous literary man most candid readers would probably apply this criticism also to the knickerbocker history had not that grotesque joke won an undeserved reputation as a work of humor  sidenote knickerbocker history  the story of the knickerbocker fabrication illustrates the happygolucky method of all irvings earlier work he had tired of his salmagundi fooling and was looking for variety when his eyes lighted on dr mitchills picture of new york a grandiloquent work written by a prominent member of the historical society in a lightheaded moment irving and his brother peter resolved to burlesque this history and in the approved fashion of that day to begin with the foundation of the world then peter went to europe on more important business and irving went on with his joke alone he professed to have discovered the notes of a learned dutch antiquarian who had recently disappeared leaving a mass of manuscript and an unpaid boardbill behind him after advertising in the newspapers for the missing man irving served notice on the public that the profound value of knickerbockers papers justified their publication and that the proceeds of the book would be devoted to paying the boardbill then appeared in time to satisfy the aroused curiosity of the historical society to whom the book was solemnly dedicated the history of new york from the beginning of the world to the end of the dutch dynasty by diedrich knickerbocker 1809  this literary hoax made an instant sensation it was denounced for its scandalous irreverence by the members of the historical society especially by those who had dutch ancestors but was received with roars of laughter by the rest of the population those who read it now from curiosity for its merriment has long since departed leaving it dull as any thricerepeated joke are advised to skip the first two books which are very tedious fooling and to be content with an abridged version of the stories of wouter van twiller william the testy and peter the headstrong these are the names of real dutch governors of new amsterdam and the dates given are exact dates but there history ends and burlesque begins the combination of fact and nonsense and the strain of gravity in which absurdities are related have led some critics to place the knickerbocker history first in time of the notable works of socalled american humor that is doubtless a fair classification but other critics assert that real humor is as purely human as a smile or a tear and has therefore no national or racial limitations  sidenote sketch book  the sketch book chief of the second group of writings is perhaps the best single work that irving produced we shall read it with better understanding if we remember that it was the work of a young man who having always done as he pleased proceeds now to write of whatever pleasant matter is close at hand being in england at the time he naturally finds most of his material there and being youthful romantic and sentimental he colors everything with the hue of his own disposition he begins by chatting of the journey and of the wide sea that separates him from home he records his impressions of the beautiful english country tells what he saw or felt during his visit to stratford on avon and what he dreamed in westminster abbey a place hallowed by centuries of worship and humanized by the presence of the great dead he sheds a ready tear over a rural funeral and tries to make us cry over the sorrows of a poor widow then to relieve our feelings he pokes a bit of fun at john bull something calls his attention to isaac walton and he writes a waltonian kind of sketch about a fisherman in one chapter he comments on contemporary literature then as if not quite satisfied with what authors are doing he lays aside his record of present impressions goes back in thought to his home by the hudson and produces two stories of such humor charm and originality that they make the rest of the book appear almost commonplace as the careless sketches of a painter are forgotten in presence of his inspired masterpiece  these two stories the most pleasing that irving ever wrote are rip van winkle and the legend of sleepy hollow they should be read if one reads nothing else of the authors twenty volumes  illustration rip van winkle  sidenote spanish themes  the works on spanish themes appeal in different ways to different readers one who knows his history will complain and justly that irving is superficial that he is concerned with picturesque rather than with important incidents but one who likes the romance of history and who reflects that romance plays an important part in the life of any people will find the legends and chronicles of this spanish group as interesting as fiction we should remember moreover that in irvings day the romance of old spain familiar enough to european readers was to most americans still fresh and wondrous in emphasizing the romantic or picturesque side of his subject he not only pleased his readers but broadened their horizon he also influenced a whole generation of historians who in contrast with the scientific or prosaic historians of today did not hesitate to add the element of human interest to their narratives  sidenote the alhambra  the most widely read of all the works of the spanish group is the alhambra 1832 this is on the surface a collection of semihistorical essays and tales clustering around the ancient palace in granada which was the last stronghold of the moors in europe in reality it is a record of the impressions and dreams of a man who finding himself on historic ground gives free rein to his imagination at times indeed he seems to have his eye on his american readers who were then in a romantic mood rather than on the place or people he was describing the book delighted its first critics who called it the spanish sketch book but though pleasant enough as a romantic dream of history it hardly compares in originality with its famous predecessor  sidenote western stories  except to those who like a brave tale of exploration and who happily have no academic interest in style irvings western books are of little consequence in fact they are often omitted from the list of his important works though they have more adventurous interest than all the others combined a tour on the prairies which records a journey beyond the mississippi in the days when buffalo were the explorers mainstay is the best written of the pioneer books but the adventures of captain bonneville a story of wandering up and down the great west with plenty of adventures among indians and free trappers furnishes the most excitement unfortunately this journal which vies in interest with parkmans oregon trail cannot be credited to irving though it bears his name on the titlepage footnote the adventures is chiefly the work of a frenchman a daring freerover who probably tried in vain to get his work published irving bought the work for a thousand dollars revised it slightly gave it his name and sold it for seven or eight times what he paid for it in astoria the third book of the western group he sold his services to write up the records of the fur house established by john jacob astor and made a poor job of it   illustration old dutch church sleepy hollow mentioned by irving in the legend of sleepy hollow  sidenote biographies  of the three biographies oliver goldsmith 1849 is the best probably because irving had more sympathy and affinity with the author of the deserted village than with mahomet or washington the life of washington 18551859 was plainly too large an undertaking for irvings limited powers but here again we must judge the work by the standards of its own age and admit that it is vastly better than the popular but fictitious biographies of washington written by weems and other romancers even in irvings day washington was still regarded as a demigod his name was always printed in capitals and the rash novelist who dared to bring him into a story as cooper did in the spy was denounced for his lack of reverence in consequence of this false attitude practically all washingtons biographers with the exception of the judicious marshall depicted him as a ponderously dignified creature stilted unlovely unhuman who must always appear with a halo around his head irving was too much influenced by this absurd fashion and by his lack of scholarship to make a trustworthy book but he gave at least a touch of naturalness and humanity to our first president and set a new biographical standard by attempting to write as an honest historian rather than as a mere heroworshiper  an appreciation of irving the three volumes of the sketchbook group and the romantic alhambra furnish an excellent measure of irvings literary talent at first glance these books appear rather superficial dealing with pleasant matters of no consequence but on second thought pleasant matters are always of consequence and irving invariably displays two qualities humor and sentiment in which humanity is forever interested his humor at first crude and sometimes in doubtful taste as in his knickerbocker history grew more refined more winning in his later works until a thoughtful critic might welcome it with its kindness its culture its smile in which is no cynicism and no bitterness as a true example of american humorif indeed such a specialized product ever existed his sentiment was for the most part tender sincere and manly though it now seems somewhat exaggerated and at times dangerously near to sentimentality that may not be altogether a fault for the same criticism applies to longfellow dickens and indeed to most other writers who have won an immense audience by frankly emphasizing or even exaggerating the honest sentiments that plain men and women have always cherished both in life and in literature  sidenote style of irving  the style of irving with its suggestion of goldsmith and addison who were his first masters is deserving of more unstinted praise a charming style we call it and the word though indefinite is expressive of the satisfaction which irvings manner affords his readers one who seeks the source of his charm may find it in this that he cherished a high opinion of humanity and that the friendliness the sense of comradeship which he felt for his fellow men was reflected in his writing unconsciously at first perhaps and then deliberately by practice and cultivation in consequence we do not read irving critically but sympathetically for readers are like children or animals in that they are instinctively drawn to an author who trusts and understands them  thackeray who gave cordial welcome to irving and who called him the first ambassador whom the new world of letters sent to the old was deeply impressed by the fact not that the young american had an excellent prose style but that his gate was forever swinging to visitors that is an illuminating criticism for we can understand the feeling of the men and women of a century ago who having read the sketch book were eager to meet the man who had given them pleasure by writing it in brief though irving wrote nothing of great import though he entered not into the stress of life or scaled its heights or sounded its deeps we still read him for the sufficient but uncritical reason that we like him  in this respect of winning our personal allegiance irving stands in marked contrast to his greatest american contemporary cooper we read the one because we are attracted to the man the other for the tale he has to tell                                       william cullen bryant 17941878  bryant has been called the father of american song and the year 1821 when his first volume appeared is recorded as the natal year of american poetry many earlier singers had won local reputations but he was the first who was honored in all the states and who attained by his poetry alone a dominating place in american letters  that was long ago and times have changed and poets with them in any collection of recent american verse one may find poems more imaginative or more finely wrought than any that bryant produced but these later singers stand in a company and contribute to an already large collection while bryant stood alone and made a brave beginning of poetry that we may honestly call native and national before he won recognition by his independent work the best that our american singers thought they could do was to copy some english original but after 1821 they dared to be themselves in poetry as they had ever been in politics they had the successful bryant for a model and the young longfellow was one of his pupils moreover he stands the hard test of time and seems to have no successor he is still our puritan poeta little severe perhaps but american to the corewho reflects better than any other the rugged spirit of that puritanism which had so profoundly influenced our country during the early formative days of the republic  illustration william cullen bryant      life in the boyhood of bryant we shall find the inspiration for     all his enduring work he was of pilgrim stock and was born 1794     in the little village of cummington in western massachusetts     there with the berkshire hills and the ancient forest forever in     sight he grew to mans stature working on the farm or attending     the district school by day and reading before the open fire at     night his father was a physician a scholarly man who directed his     sons reading his mother was a puritan one of those quiet     inspiring women who do their work cheerfully as by gods grace     and who invariably add some sign or patent of nobility to their     sons and daughters there was also in the home a puritan     grandfather who led the family devotions every evening and whose     prayers with their rich phraseology of psalm or prophecy were     poems from beginning to end so said bryant who attributed to     these prayers his earliest impulse to write poetry       between these two influences nature without and puritanism within     the poet grew up in their shadow he lived and died little else of     consequence is reflected in the poems that are his best memorial      sidenote the citizen      the visible life of bryant lies almost entirely outside the realm     of poesie he as fitted for williams by country ministers as was     customary in that day but poverty compelled him to leave college     after two brief terms then he studied law and for nine or ten     years practiced his profession doggedly unwillingly with many a     protest at the chicanery he was forced to witness even in the     sacred courts of justice grown weary of it at last he went to new     york found work in a newspaper office and after a few years     apprenticeship became editor of the evening post a position     which he held for more than half a century his worldly affairs     prospered he became a leading citizen of new york prominent in     the social and literary affairs of a great city he varied the     routine of editorship by trips abroad by literary or patriotic     addresses by cultivating a country estate at long island in his     later years as a literary celebrity he loaned his name rather too     freely to popular histories anthologies and gift books which     better serve their catchpenny purpose if some famous man can be     induced to add tone to the rubbish      sidenote the poet      and bryants poetry ah that was a thing forever apart from his     daily life an almost sacred thing to be cherished in moments     when his days work done he was free to follow his spirit and     give outlet to the feelings which as a strong man and a puritan     he was wont to restrain he had begun to write poetry in childhood     when his father had taught him the value of brevity or compression     and the difference between poetic enthusiasm and fustian     therefore he wrote slowly carefully and allowed ample time for     change of thought or diction so his early thanatopsis was hidden     away for years till his father found and published it and made     bryant famous in a day all this at a time when english critics     were exalting sudden inspiration sustained effort and poems     done at one sitting      once bryant had found himself and the blank verse and simple     fourline stanza which suited his talent he seldom changed and he     never improved his first little volume poems 1821     contains some of his best work in the next fifty years he added to     the size but not to the quality of that volume and there is little     to indicate in such poems as thanatopsis and the flood of years     that the one was written by a boy of seventeen and the other by a     sage of eighty his love of poetry as a thing apart from life is     indicated by the fact that in old age to forget the grief     occasioned by the death of his wife he gave the greater part of     six years to a metrical translation of the greek poet homer that     he never became a great poet or even fulfilled his early promise is     due partly to his natural limitations no doubt but more largely     to the fact that he gave his time and strength to other things and     a poet is like other men in that he cannot well serve two masters  the poetry of bryant besides the translation of the iliad and the odyssey there are several volumes of prose to bryants credit but his fame now rests wholly on a single book of original poems the best of these the result of fifty years of writing which could easily be printed on fifty pages may be grouped in two main classes poems of death and poems of nature outside of which are a few miscellaneous pieces such as the antiquity of freedom planting of the apple tree and the poet in which he departs a little from his favorite themes  sidenote poems of death  bryants poems on death reflect something of his puritan training and of his personal experience while threatened with consumption they are also indicative of the poetic fashion of his age which was abnormally given to funereal subjects and greatly influenced by such melancholy poems as grays elegy and youngs night thoughts he began his career with thanatopsis or view of death a boyhood piece which astonished america when it was published in 1817 and which has ever since been a favorite with readers the idea of the poem that the earth is a vast sepulcher of human life was borrowed from other poets but the stately blank verse and the noble appreciation of nature are bryants own they mark moreover a new era in american poetry an original era to replace the long imitative period which had endured since colonial times other and perhaps better poems in the same group are the death of the flowers the return of youth and tree burial in which bryant goes beyond the pagan view of death presented in his first work  that death had a strange fascination for bryant is evident from his returning again and again to a subject which most young poets avoid its somber shadow and unanswered question intrude upon nearly all of his nature pieces so much so that even his june portrays that blithe inspiring month of sunshine and bird song as an excellent time to die it is from such poems that one gets the curious idea that bryant never was a boy that he was a graybeard at sixteen and never grew any younger  sidenote poems of nature  it is in his poems of nature that bryant is at his best even here he is never youthful never the happy singer whose heart overflows to the call of the winds he is rather the priest of nature who offers a prayer or hymn of praise at her altar and it may be that his noble forest hymn is nearer to a true expression of human feeling certainly of primitive or elemental feeling than shelleys skylark or burnss mountain daisy thoreau in one of his critical epigrams declared it was not important that a poet should say any particular thing but that he should speak in harmony with nature that the tone of his voice is the main thing if that be true bryant is one of our best poets he is always in harmony with nature in her prevailing quiet mood his voice is invariably gentle subdued merging into the murmur of trees or the flow of watermuch like indian voices but as unlike as possible to the voices of those who go to nature for a picnic or a camping excursion  among the best of his nature poems are to a waterfowl his most perfect single work forest hymn hymn to the sea summer wind night journey of a river autumn woods to a fringed gentian among the trees the fountain and a rain dream to read such poems is to understand the fact mentioned in our biography that bryants poetry was a thing apart from his daily life his friends all speak of him as a companionable man receptive responsive abounding in cheerful anecdote and with a certain overflowing of strength in mirth or kindly humor but one finds absolutely nothing of this genial temper in his verse there he seems to regard all such bubblings and overflowings as unseemly levity lo the puritan which he must lay aside in poetry as on entering a church he is as we have said the priest of nature in whom reverence is uppermost and he who reads aloud the forest hymn with its solemn organ tone has an impression that it must be followed by the sublime invitation o come let us worship and bow down let us kneel before the lord our maker  illustration bryants home at cummington  sidenote in lighter mood  though bryant is always serious it is worthy of note that he is never gloomy that he entirely escapes the pessimism or despair which seizes upon most poets in times of trouble moreover he has a lighter mood not gay but serenely happy which finds expression in such poems as evening wind gladness of nature and especially robert of lincoln the exuberance of the lastnamed so unlike anything else in bryants book of verse may be explained on the assumption that not even a puritan could pull a long face in presence of a bobolink the intense americanism of the poet appears in nearly all his verse and occasionally his patriotism rises to a prophetic strain as in the prairie for example written when he first saw what was then called the great american desert it is said that the honeybee crossed the mississippi with the first settlers and bryant looks with kindled imagination on this little pioneer who    fills the savannas with his murmurings   and hides his sweets as in the golden age   within the hollow oak i listen long   to his domestic hum and think i hear   the sound of that advancing multitude   which soon shall fill these deserts from the ground   comes up the laugh of children the soft voice   of maidens and the sweet and solemn hymn   of sabbath worshippers the low of herds   blends with the rustling of the heavy grain   over the dark brown furrows all at once   a fresher wind sweeps by and breaks my dream   and i am in the wilderness alone  our pioneer poet from one point of view our first national poet is a summary of all preceding american verse and a prophecy of better things to come to be specific practically all our early poetry shows the inclination to moralize to sing a song and then add a lesson to it this is commonly attributed to puritan influence but in truth it is a universal poetic impulse a tribute to the early office of the bard who was the tribal historian and teacher as well as singer this ancient didactic or moralizing tendency is very strong in bryant to his first notable poem thanatopsis he must add a final so live and to his waterfowl must be appended a verse which tells what steadfast lesson may be learned from the mutable phenomena of nature  again most of our colonial and revolutionary poetry was strongly or weakly imitative and bryant shows the habit of his american predecessors the spiritual conception of nature revealed in some of his early poems is a new world echo of wordsworth his somber poems of death indicate that he was familiar with gray and young his evening wind has some suggestion of shelley we suspect the influence of scotts narrative poems in the neglected stella and little people of the snow but though influenced by english writers the author of thanatopsis was too independent to imitate them and in his independence with the hearty welcome which it received from the american public we have a prophecy of the new poetry  sidenote his originality  the originality and sturdy independence of bryant are clearly shown in his choice of subjects in his early days poetry was formal and artificial after the manner of the eighteenth century the romantic movement had hardly gained recognition in england burns was known only to his own countrymen wordsworth was ridiculed or barely tolerated by the critics and poets on both sides of the atlantic were still writing of larks and nightingales of moonlight in the vale of love in a rosecovered cottage of ivymantled towers weeping willows neglected gravesa medley of tears and sentimentality you will find all these and little else in the garland the token and many other popular collections of the period but you will find none of them in bryants first or last volume from the beginning he wrote of death and nature somewhat coldly to be sure but with manly sincerity then he wrote of freedom the watchword of america not as other singers had written of it but as a puritan who had learned in bitter conflict the price of his heritage    o freedom thou art not as poets dream   a fair young girl with light and delicate limbs   and wavy tresses gushing from the cap   with which the roman master crowned his slave   when he took off the gyves a bearded man   armed to the teeth art thou one mailéd hand   grasps the broad shield and one the sword thy brow   glorious in beauty though it be is scarred   with tokens of old wars thy massive limbs   are strong with struggling  he wrote without affectation of the past of winter of the north star of the crowded street of the yellow violet and the fringed gentian if the lastnamed poems now appear too simple for our poetic taste remember that simplicity is the hardest to acquire of all literary virtues and that it was the dominant quality of bryant remember also that these modest flowers of which he wrote so modestly had for two hundred years brightened our spring woods and autumn meadows waiting patiently for the poet who should speak our appreciation of their beauty another century has gone and no other american poet has spoken so simply or so well of other neglected treasures of the twin flower for example most fragrant of all blooms or of that other welcomenodding blossom beloved of bumblebees which some call wild columbine and others whippoorwills shoes  in a word bryant was and is our pioneer poet in the realm of native american poetry as emerson said he was our first original poet and was original because he dared to be sincere                                       james fenimore cooper 17891851  in point of time cooper is the first notable american novelist judging by the booksellers no other has yet approached him in the sustained interest of his work or the number of his readers  sidenote the man  on first analysis we shall find little in cooper to account for his abiding popularity the man himself was not exactly lovable indeed he had almost a genius for stirring up antagonism as a writer he began without study or literary training and was stilted or slovenly in most of his work he was prone to moralize in the midst of an exciting narrative he filled countless pages with wooden dialogue he could not portray a child or a woman or a gentleman though he was confident that he had often done so to perfection he did not even know indians or woodcraft though indians and woodcraft account for a large part of our interest in his forest romances  sidenote the storyteller  one may enjoy a good story however without knowing or caring for its authors peculiarities and the vast majority of readers are happily not critical but receptive hence if we separate the man from the author and if we read the red rover or the last of the mohicans just for the story we shall discover the source of coopers power as a writer first of all he has a tale to tell an epic tale of heroism and manly virtue then he appeals strongly to the pioneer spirit which survives in all great nations and he is a master at portraying wild nature as the background of human life the vigor of elemental manhood the call of adventure the lure of primeval forests the surge and mystery of the seathese are written large in coopers best books they make us forget his faults of temper or of style and they account in large measure for his popularity with young readers of all nations for he is one of the few american writers who belong not to any country but to humanity at present he is read chiefly by boys but half a century or more ago he had more readers of all classes and climes than any other writer in the world      life the youthful experiences of cooper furnished him with the     material for his best romances he was born 1789 in new jersey     but while he was yet a child the family removed to central new     york where his father had acquired an immense tract of wild land     on which he founded the village that is still called cooperstown     there on the frontier of civilization where stood the primeval     forest that had witnessed many a wild indian raid the novelist     passed his boyhood amid the picturesque scenes which he was to     immortalize in the pioneers and the deerslayer      sidenote his training      cooper picked up a little book learning in a backwoods school and     a little more in a ministers study at albany at thirteen he     entered yale but he was a selfwilled lad and was presently     dismissed from college a little later after receiving some scant     nautical training on a merchantman he entered the navy as     midshipman but after a brief experience in the service he married     and resigned his commission that was in 1811 and the date is     significant it was just before the second war with great britain     the author who wrote so much and so vividly of battles indian     raids and naval engagements never was within sight of such affairs     though the opportunity was present in his romances we have the     product of a vigorous imagination rather than of observation or     experience      illustration james fenimore cooper      his literary work seems now like the result of whim or accident     one day he flung down a novel that he was reading declaring to his     wife that he could write a better story himself try it     challenged his wife i will said cooper and the result was     precaution a romance of english society he was then a     farmer in the hudson valley and his knowledge of foreign society     was picked up one must think from silly novels on the subject      strange to say the story was so well received that the gratified     author wrote another this was the spy 1821 dealing with     a revolutionary hero who had once followed his dangerous calling in     the very region in which cooper was now living the immense success     of this book fairly drove its author into a career he moved to new     york city and there quickly produced two more successful romances     thus in four years an unknown man without literary training had     become a famous writer and had moreover produced four different     types of fiction the novel of society in precaution the     historical romance in the spy and the adventurous romance     of forest and of ocean in the pioneers and the pilot      sidenote years of strife      cooper now went abroad as most famous authors do his books     already translated into several european languages had made him     known and he was welcomed in literary circles but almost     immediately he was drawn into squabbles being naturally inclined     that way he began to write political tirades and even his     romances of the period the bravo the heidenmauer     the headsman were devoted to proclaiming the glories of     democracy then he returned home and proceeded to set his     countrymen by the ears in such books as home as found by     writing too frankly of their crudity in contrast with the culture     of europe then followed long years of controversy and lawsuits     during which our newspapers used cooper scandalously and cooper     prosecuted and fined the newspapers it is a sorry spectacle of no     interest except to those who would understand the bulk of coopers     neglected works he was an honest man vigorous straightforward     absolutely sincere but he was prone to waste his strength and     embitter his temper by trying to force his opinion on those who     were well satisfied with their own he had no humor and had never     pondered the wisdom of who drives fat oxen should himself be fat      illustration otsego hall home of cooper      the last years of his life were spent mostly at the old home at     cooperstown no longer a frontier settlement but a thriving     village from which natty bumppo and chingachgook had long since     departed before his death 1851 the fires of controversy had sunk     to ashes but cooper never got over his resentment at the public     and with the idea of keeping forever aloof he commanded that none     of his private papers be given to biographers it is for lack of     such personal letters and documents that no adequate life of cooper     has yet been written  coopers works there are over sixty volumes of cooper but to read them all would savor of penance rather than of pleasure of his miscellaneous writings only the history of the navy and lives of distinguished naval officers are worthy of remembrance of his thirtytwo romances the half at least may be ignored though critics may differ as to whether certain books the bravo and lionel lincoln for example should be placed in one half or the other there remain as the measure of coopers genius some sixteen works of fiction which fall naturally into three groups the historical novels the tales of pioneer life and the romances of the sea  sidenote the spy  the spy was the first and probably the best of coopers historical romances even his admirers must confess that it is crudely written and that our patriotic interest inclines us to overestimate a story which throws the glamor of romance over the revolution yet this faulty tale attempts to do what very few histories have ever done fairly namely to present both sides or parties of the fateful conflict and its unusual success in this difficult field may be explained by a bit of family history cooper was by birth and training a stanch whig or patriot but his wife to whom he was devotedly attached was the daughter of an unbending tory or loyalist and his divided allegiance is plainly apparent in his work ordinarily his personal antagonisms his hatred of yankees puritans and all politicians of the other party are dragged into his stories and spoil some of them but in the spy he puts his prejudices under restraint tells his tale in an impersonal way dealing honestly with both whigs and tories and so produces a work having the double interest of a good adventure story and a fair picture of one of the heroic ages of american history  aside from its peculiar american interest the spy has some original and broadly human elements which have caused it notwithstanding its dreary artificial style to be highly appreciated in other countries in south american countries especially the secret of its appeal lies largely in this that in harvey birch a brave man who serves his country without hope or possibility of reward cooper has strongly portrayed a type of the highest the most unselfish patriotism  the other historical novels differ greatly in value prominent among them are mercedes of castile dealing with columbus and the discovery of america satanstoe and the wept of wishtonwish depicting colonial life in new york and new england respectively and lionel lincoln which is another story of the revolution more labored than the spy and of less sustained interest  sidenote the sea stories  coopers first sea story the pilot 1823 was haphazard enough in both motive and method footnote the waverley novels by the great unknown were appearing at this time scott was supposed to be the author of them but there was much debate on the subject one day in new york a member of coopers club argued that scott could not possibly have written the pirate which had just appeared because the nautical skill displayed in the book was such as only a sailor could possess cooper maintained on the contrary that the pirate was the work of a landsman and to prove it he declared that he would write a sea story as it should be written that is with understanding as well as with imagination the pilot was the result but it gave pleasure to a multitude of readers and it amazed critics by showing that the lonely sea could be a place of romantic human interest cooper was thus the first modern novelist of the ocean and to his influence we are partly indebted for the stirring tales of such writers as herman melville and clark russell a part of the action of the pilot takes place on land the style and the characters of this part are wretchedly stilted but the chief interest of the story lies in the adventures of an american privateer commanded by a disguised hero who turns out to be john paul jones cooper could not portray such a character and his effort to make the dashing young captain heroic by surrounding him with a fog of mystery is like his labored attempt to portray the character of washington in the spy on the other hand he was thoroughly at home on a ship or among common sailors his sea pictures of gallant craft driven before the gale are magnificent and long tom coffin is perhaps the most realistic and interesting of all his characters not excepting even leatherstocking  another and better romance of the sea is the red rover 1828 in this story the action takes place almost wholly on the deep and its vivid word pictures of an ocean smiling under the sunrise or lashed to fury by midnight gales are unrivaled in any literature other notable books of the same group are the water witch afloat and ashore and wing and wing some readers will prize these for their stories but to others they may appear tame in comparison with the superb descriptive passages of the red rover  sidenote leatherstocking tales  when cooper published the pioneers 1823 he probably had no intention of writing a series of novels recounting the adventures of natty bumppo or leatherstocking and his indian friend chingachgook otherwise he would hardly have painted so shabby a picture of these two old heroes neglected and despised in a land through which they had once moved as masters readers were quick to see however that these old men had an adventurous past and when they demanded the rest of the story cooper wrote four other romances which are as so many acts in the stirring drama of pioneer life when these romances are read therefore they should be taken in logical sequence beginning with the deerslayer which portrays the two heroes as young men on their first war trail and following in order with the last of the mohicans the pathfinder the pioneers and the prairie if one is to be omitted let it be the pathfinder which is comparatively weak and dull and if only one is to be read the last of the mohicans is an excellent choice  after nearly a century of novel writing these five books remain our most popular romances of pioneer days and leatherstocking is still a wingéd name a name to conjure with in most civilized countries meanwhile a thousand similar works have come and gone and been forgotten to examine these later books which attempt to satisfy the juvenile love of indian stories is to discover that they are modeled more or less closely on the original work of the first american novelist  coopers scenes and characters even in his outdoor romances cooper was forever attempting to depict human society especially polite society but that was the one subject he did not and could not understand the sea in its grandeur and loneliness the wild lakes stretching away to misty unknown shores or nestling like jewels in their evergreen setting the forest with its dim trails its subdued light its rustlings whisperings hints of mystery or perilthese are his proper scenes and in them he moves as if at ease in his environment  illustration coopers cave scene of indian fight in the last of the mohicans  in his characters we soon discover the same contrast if he paints a hero of history he must put him on stilts to increase his stature if he portrays a woman he calls her a female makes her a model of decorum and bores us by her sentimental gabbing if he describes a social gathering he instantly betrays his unfamiliarity with real society by talking like a book of etiquette but with rough men or manly men on land or sea with halfmutinous crews of privateers or disciplined manofwars men with woodsmen trappers indians adventurous characters of the border or the frontierwith all these cooper is at home and in writing of them he rises almost to the height of genius  sidenote the return to nature  if we seek the secret of this contrast we shall find it partly in the author himself partly in a popular halfbaked philosophy of the period that philosophy was summed up in the words the return to nature and it alleged that all human virtues flow from solitude and all vices from civilization such a philosophy appealed strongly to cooper who was continually at odds with his fellows who had been expelled from yale who had engaged in many a bitter controversy who had suffered abuse from newspapers and who in every case was inclined to consider his opponents as blockheads no matter in what society he found himself in imagination he was always back in the free but lawless atmosphere of the frontier village in which his youth was spent hence he was well fitted to take the point of view of natty bumppo in the pioneers who looked with hostile eyes upon the greed and waste of civilization hence he portrayed his uneducated backwoods hero as a brave and chivalrous gentleman without guile or fear or selfishness who owed everything to nature and nothing to society europe at that time was ready to welcome such a type with enthusiasm the world will always make way for him whether he appears as a hero of fiction or as a man among men  general characteristics the faults of cooperhis stilted style and slipshod english his tedious moralizing his artificial dialogue his stuffed gentlemen and inane females his blunders in woodcraftall these are so easily discovered by a casual reader that the historian need not linger over them his virtues are more interesting and the first of these is that he has a story to tell ever since anglosaxon days the talebringer has been a welcome guest and that cooper is a good talebringer is evident from his continued popularity at home and abroad he may not know much about the art of literature or about psychology or about the rule that motives must be commensurate with actions but he knows a good story and that after all is the main thing in a novel  again there is a love of manly action in cooper and a robustness of imagination which compel attention he is rather slow in starting his tale but he always sees a long trail ahead and knows that every turn of the trail will bring its surprise or adventure it is only when we analyze and compare his plots that we discover what a prodigal creative power he had he wrote let us say seven or eight good stories but he spoiled ten times that number by hasty or careless workmanship in the neglected wept of wishtonwish for example there is enough wasted material to furnish a modern romancer or dramatist for half a lifetime  sidenote descriptive power  another fine quality of cooper is his descriptive power his astonishing vigor in depicting forest sea prairieall the grandeur of wild nature as a background of human heroism his descriptions are seldom accurate for he was a careless observer and habitually made blunders but he painted nature as on a vast canvas whereon details might be ignored and he reproduced the total impression of nature in a way that few novelists have ever rivaled it is this sustained power of creating a vast natural stage and peopling it with elemental men the pioneers of a strong nation that largely accounts for coopers secure place among the worlds fiction writers  sidenote moral quality  finally the moral quality of cooper his belief in manhood and womanhood his cleanness of heart and of tongue are all reflected in his heroes and heroines very often he depicts rough men in savage or brutal situations but unlike some modern realists there is nothing brutal in his morals and it is precisely where we might expect savagery or meanness that his simple heroes appear as chivalrous gentlemen without fear and without reproach that he was here splendidly true to nature and humanity is evident to one who has met his typical men woodsmen plainsmen lumbermen lonely trappers or timbercruisers in their own environment and experienced their rare courtesy and hospitality in a word cooper knew what virtue is virtue of white man virtue of indian and he makes us know and respect it of a hundred strong scenes which he has vividly pictured there is hardly one that does not leave a final impression as pure and wholesome as the breath of the woods or the sea                                       edgar allan poe 18091849  it is a pleasant task to estimate irving or bryant but poe offers a hard nut for criticism to crack the historian is baffled by an author who secretes himself in the shadow or perplexed by conflicting biographies or put on the defensive by the fact that any positive judgment or opinion of poe will almost certainly be challenged  at the outset therefore we are to assume that poe is one of the most debatable figures in our literature his life may be summed up as a pitiful struggle for a little fame and a little bread when he died few missed him and his works were neglected following his recognition in europe came a revival of interest here during which poe was absurdly overpraised and the american people berated for their neglect of a genius then arose a literary controversy which showed chiefly that our critics were poles apart in their points of view though the controversy has long endured it has settled nothing of importance for one reader regards poe as a literary poseur a writer of melodious nonsense in verse and of grotesque horrors in prose while another exalts him as a double master of poetry and fiction an artist without a peer in american letters  somewhere between these extremes hides the truth but we shall not here attempt to decide whether it is nearer one side or the other we note merely that poe is a writer for such mature readers as can appreciate his uncanny talent what he wrote of abiding interest or value to young people might be printed in a very small book      biographical sketch notwithstanding all that has been written     about poe we do not and cannot know him as we know most other     american authors whose lives are as an open book he was always a     secretive person a lover of mystery and retreats and such     accounts of his life as he gave out are not trustworthy he came     from a good maryland family but apparently from one of those     offshoots that are not true to type his father left the study of     law to become a strolling actor and presently married an english     actress it was while the father and mother were playing their     parts in boston that edgar was born in 1809      illustration edgar allan poe      actors led a miserable life in those days and the poes were no     exception they died comfortless in richmond their three children     were separated and edgar was adopted by john allan a wealthy     tobacco merchant it was in the luxurious allan home that the boy     began the drinking habits which were his bane ever afterwards      sidenote poes school days      the allans were abroad on business from 1815 to 1820 and during     these years edgar was at a private school in the suburbs of london     it was the master of that school who described the boy as a clever     lad spoiled by too much pocket money the prose tale william     wilson has some reflection of these school years and so far as     known it is the only work in which poe introduced any of his     familiar experiences      soon after his return to richmond the boy was sent to the     university of virginia where his brilliant record as a student was     marred by his tendency to dissipation after the first year mr     allan finding that the boy had run up a big gambling debt took     him from college and put him to work in the tobacco house     whereupon edgar always resentful of criticism quarreled with his     foster father and drifted out into the world he was then at     eighteen a young man of fine bearing having the taste and manners     of a gentleman but he had no friend in the world no heritage of     hard work no means of earning a living      illustration west range university of virginia      sidenote his wanderings      next we hear vaguely of poe in boston where he published a tiny     volume tamerlane and other poems by a bostonian 1827     failing to win either fame or money by his poetry he enlisted in     the army under an assumed name and served for about two years of     his army life we know nothing nor do we hear of him again until     his foster father secured for him an appointment to the military     academy at west point there poe made an excellent beginning but     he soon neglected his work was dismissed and became an ishmael     again after trying in vain to secure a political office he went to     baltimore where he earned a bare living by writing for the     newspapers the popular but mythical account of his life for which     he himself is partly responsible portrays him at this period in a     byronic rôle fighting with the greeks for their liberty      sidenote first success      his literary career began in 1833 when his manuscript found in a     bottle won for him a prize offered by a weekly newspaper the same     manuscript brought him to the attention of john pendleton     kennedy who secured for him a position on the staff of the     southern literary messenger he then settled in richmond     and in his grasp was every thing that the heart of a young author     might desire he had married his cousin virginia clem a beautiful     young girl whom he idolized he had a comfortable home and an     assured position kennedy and other southern writers were his loyal     friends the messenger published his work and gave him a     reputation in the literary world of america fortune stood smiling     beside him when he quarreled with his friends left the messenger     and began once more his struggle with poverty and despair      sidenote a life of fragments      it would require a volume to describe the next few years and we     must pass hurriedly over them his pen was now his only hope and     he used it diligently in an effort to win recognition and a living     he tried his fortune in different cities he joined the staffs of     various periodicals he projected magazines of his own in every     project success was apparently within his reach when by some     weakness or misfortune he let his chance slip away he was living     in fordham a suburb of new york now called the bronx when he did     his best work but there his wife died in need of the common     comforts of life and so destitute was the home that an appeal was     made in the newspapers for charity one has but to remember poes     pride to understand how bitter was the cup from which he drank      after his wifes death came two frenzied years in which not even     the memory of a great love kept him from unmanly wooing of other     women but poe was then unbalanced and not wholly responsible for     his action at forty he became engaged to a widow in richmond who     could offer him at least a home generous friends raised a fund to     start him in life afresh but a little later he was found     unconscious amid sordid surroundings in baltimore he died there     in a hospital before he was able to give any lucid account of his     last wanderings it was a pitiful end but one who studies poe at     any part of his career has an impression of a perverse fate that     dogs the man and that insists on an ending in accord with the rest     of the story  the poetry of poe most people read poes poetry for the melody that is in it to read it in any other way to analyze or explain its message is to dissect a butterfly that changes in a moment from a delicate living creature to a pinch of dust bright colored but meaningless it is not for analysis therefore but simply for making poe more intelligible that we record certain facts or principles concerning his verse  sidenote theory of poetry  perhaps the first thing to note is that poe is not the poet of smiles and tears of joy and sorrow as the great poets are but the poet of a single mooda dull despairing mood without hope of comfort next he had a theory a strange theory in view of his mood that the only object of poetry is to give pleasure and that the pleasure of a poem depends largely on melody on sound rather than on sense finally he believed that poetry should deal with beauty alone that poetic beauty is of a supernal or unearthly kind and that such beauty is forever associated with melancholy to poe the most beautiful imaginable object was a beautiful woman but since her beauty must perish the poet must assume a tragic or despairing attitude in face of it hence his succession of shadowy helens and hence his wail of grief that he has lost or must soon lose them  sidenote the raven  all these poetic theories or delusions appear in poes most widely known work the raven which has given pleasure to a multitude of readers it is a unique poem and its popularity is due partly to the fact that nobody can tell what it means to analyze it is to discover that it is extremely melodious that it reflects a gloomy mood that at the root of its sorrow is the mysterious lost lenore and that as in most of poes works a fantastic element is introduced an ungainly fowl addressed with grotesque dignity as sir or madame to divert attention from the fact that the poets grief is not simple or human enough for tears    and the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting   on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door   and his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming   and the lamplight oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor   and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor       shall be liftednevermore  equally characteristic of the author are to one in paradise the sleeper and annabel leeall melodious all in hopeless mood all expressive of the same abnormal idea of poetry other and perhaps better poems are the coliseum israfel and especially the second to helen beginning helen thy beauty is to me  young readers may well be content with a few such lyrics leaving the bulk of poes poems to such as may find meaning in their vaporous images as an example study these two stanzas from ulalume a work which some may find very poetic and others somewhat lunatic    the skies they were ashen and sober     the leaves they were crispéd and sere     the leaves they were withering and sere   it was night in the lonesome october     of my most immemorial year   it was hard by the dim lake of auber     in the misty mid region of weir   it was down by the dank tarn of auber     in the ghoulhaunted woodland of weir    here once through an alley titanic     of cypress i roamed with my soul     of cypress with psyche my soul   these were days when my heart was volcanic     as the scoriac rivers that roll     as the lavas that restlessly roll   their sulphurous currents down yaanek     in the ultimate climes of the pole   that groan as they roll down mount yaanek     in the realms of the boreal pole  this is melodious to be sure but otherwise it is mere word juggling a stringing together of names and rimes with a total effect of lugubrious nonsense it is not to be denied that some critics find pleasure in ulalume but uncritical readers need not doubt their taste or intelligence if they prefer countingout rimes the jabberwock or other nonsense verses that are more frankly and joyously nonsensical  poes fiction should it be asked why poes tales are nearly all of the bloodcurdling variety the answer is that they are a triple reflection of himself of the fantastic romanticism of his age and of the taste of readers who were then abnormally fond of ghastly effects in fiction let us understand these elements clearly for otherwise poes horrible stories will give us nothing beyond the mere impression of horror  sidenote the man and his times  to begin with the personal element poe was naturally inclined to morbidness he had a childish fear of darkness and hobgoblins he worked largely on his nerves he had an abnormal interest in graves ghouls and the terrors which preternatural subjects inspire in superstitious minds as a writer he had to earn his bread and the fiction most in demand at that time was of the gothic or mysteries of udolpho kind with its diabolical villain its pallid heroine in a haunted room its medley of mystery and horror footnote as richardson suggests the popular novels of poes day are nearly all alike in that they remind us of the fat boy in pickwick who just wanted to make your flesh creep jane austen and later scott and cooper had written against this morbid tendency but still the gothic novel had its thousands of shuddering readers on both sides of the atlantic at the beginning of the century charles brockden brown had made a success of the american gothic a story of horror modified to suit american readers and poe carried on the work of brown with precisely the same end in view namely to please his audience he used the motive of horror partly because of his own taste and training no doubt but more largely because he shrewdly followed the market in fiction then as now there were many readers who enjoyed as stevenson says being frightened out of their boots and to such readers he appealed his individuality and perhaps his chief excellence as a storywriter lay in his use of strictly logical methods in his ability to make the most impossible yarn seem real by his reasonable way of telling it moreover he was a discoverer an innovator a maker of new types since he was the first to introduce in his stories the blend of calm logical science and wild fancy of a terrifying order so he served as an inspiration as well as a point of departure for jules verne and other writers of the same pseudoscientific school  sidenote groups of stories  poes numerous tales may be grouped in three or four classes standing by itself is william wilson a story of double personality one good and one evil genius in the same person to which stevenson was indebted in his strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde next are the tales of pseudoscience and adventure such as hans pfaall and the descent into the maelstrom which represent a type of popular fiction developed by jules verne h g wells and many others all of whom were more or less influenced by poe a third group may be called the ingeniousmystery stories one of the most typical of these is the gold bug a tale of cipherwriting and buried treasure which contains the germ at least of stevensons treasure island to the same group belong the murders in the rue morgue and other stories dealing with the wondrous acumen of a certain dupin who is the father of old sleuth sherlock holmes and other amateur detectives who do such marvelous things in fictionto atone no doubt for their extraordinary dullness in real life  still another group consists of phantom storiesghastly yarns that serve no purpose but to make the readers spine creep the mildest of these horrors is the fall of the house of usher which some critics place at the head of poes fiction it is a story of atmosphere that is a story in which the scene the air the vague feeling of a place arouse an expectation of some startling or unusual incident many have read this story and found pleasure therein but others ask frankly why bother to write or to read such palpable nonsense with all poes efforts to make it real ushers house is not a home or even a building in which dwells a man it is a vacuum inhabited by a chimera of necessity therefore it tumbles into melodramatic nothingness the moment the author takes leave of it  sidenote what to read  if it be asked what shall one read of poes fiction the answer must depend largely upon individual taste the gold bug is a good story having the adventurous interest of finding a pirates hidden gold at least that is how most readers regard it though poe meant us to be interested not in the gold but in his ingenious cryptogram or secret writing the allegory of william wilson is perhaps the most original of poes works and for a thriller the house of usher may be recommended as the least repulsive of the tales of horror to the historian the chief interest of all these tales lies in the influence which they have exerted on a host of shortstory writers at home and abroad  illustration southern literary messenger building  an estimate of poe any summary of such a difficult subject is unsatisfactory and subject to challenge we shall try here simply to outline poes aim and method leaving the student to supply from his own reading most of the details and all the exceptions  poes chief purpose was not to tell a tale for its own sake or to portray a human character he aimed to produce an effect or impression in the readers mind an impression of unearthly beauty in his poems and of unearthly horror in his prose some writers hawthorne for example go through life as in a dream but if one were to judge poe by his work one might think that he had suffered a long nightmare of this familiar experience his youth his army training his meeting with other men his impressions of nature or humanity there is hardly a trace in his work of despair terror and hallucinations there is a plethora  sidenote his method  his method was at once haphazard and carefully elaborateda paradox it seems till we examine his work or read his records thereof in his poetry words appealed to him as they appeal to some children not so much for their meaning as for their sound thus the word nevermore a gloomy terrible word comes into his mind and he proceeds to brood over it the shadow of a great loss is in the word and loss meant to poe the loss of beauty in the form of a woman therefore he invents the lost lenore to rime with his nevermore some outward figure of despair is now needed something that will appeal to the imagination and for that poe selects the sable bird that poets have used since anglosaxon times as a symbol of gloom or mystery then carefully line by line he hammers out the raven a poem which from beginning to end is built around the word nevermore with its suggestion of pitiless memories  or again poe is sitting at the bedside of his dead wife when another word suddenly appeals to him it is shakespeares                      duncan is in his grave   after lifes fitful fever he sleeps well  and from that word is born for annie with an ending to the first stanza which is an epitome of the poem and which longfellow suggested as a fitting epitaph for poes tomb    and the fever called living     is conquered at last  he reads coleridges rime of the ancient mariner and his manuscript found in a bottle is the elaborated result of his chance inspiration he sees cooper make a success of a sea tale and irving of a journal of exploration and though he knows naught of the sea or the prairie he produces his hairraising arthur gordon pym and his journal of julius rodman some sailors yarn of a maelstrom in the north sea comes to his ears and he fabricates a story of a man who went into the whirlpool he sees a newspaper account of a premature burial and his house of usher and several other stories reflect the imagined horror of such an experience the same criticism applies to his miscellaneous thrillers in which with rare cunning he uses phantoms curtains shadows cats the moldy odor of the graveand all to make a gruesome tale inspired by some wild whim or nightmare  in fine no other american writer ever had so slight a human basis for his work no other ever labored more patiently or more carefully the unending controversy over poe commonly reduces itself to this deadlock one reader asks what did he do that was worth a mans effort in the doing and another answers what did he do that was not cleverly skillfully done                                           summary the early part of the nineteenth century sometimes called     the first national period of american letters was a time of     unusual enthusiasm the country had recently won its independence     and taken its place among the free nations of the world it had     emerged triumphant from a period of doubt and struggle over the     constitution and the union it was increasing with amazing rapidity     in territory in population and in the wealth which followed a     successful commerce its people were united as never before by     noble pride in the past and by a great hope for the future it is     not surprising therefore that our first really national     literature that is a literature which was read by practically the     whole country and which represented america to foreign nations     should appear in this expansive age as an expression of the     national enthusiasm      sidenote chief writers      the four chief writers of the period are irving the pleasant     essayist storyteller and historian bryant the poet of primeval     nature cooper the novelist who was the first american author to     win worldwide fame and poe the most cunning craftsman among our     early writers who wrote a few melodious poems and many tales of     mystery or horror some critics would include also among the major     writers william gilmore simms sometimes called the cooper of the     south author of many adventurous romances dealing with pioneer     life and with colonial and revolutionary history      the numerous minor writers of the age are commonly grouped in local     schools the knickerbocker school of new york includes the poets     halleck and drake the novelist paulding and one writer of     miscellaneous prose and verse nathaniel p willis who was for a     time more popular than any other american writer save cooper in     the southern school led by poe and simms were wilde kennedy and     william wirt the west was represented by timothy flint and james     hall in new england were the poets percival and maria brooks the     novelists sarah morton and catherine sedgwick and the historians     sparks and bancroft the writers we have named are merely typical     there were literally hundreds of others who were more or less     widely known in the middle of the last century      sidenote foreign influence      the first common characteristic of these writers was their     patriotic enthusiasm the second was their romantic spirit the     romantic movement in english poetry was well under way at this     time and practically all our writers were involved in it they     were strongly influenced moreover by english writers of the     period or by settled english literary traditions thus irving     modeled his style closely on that of addison the early poetry of     bryant shows the influence of wordsworth the weird tales of poe     and his critical essays were both alike influenced by coleridge     and the quickening influence of scott appears plainly in the     romances of cooper the minor writers were even more subject to     foreign influences especially to german and english romanticism     there was however a sturdy independence in the work of most of     these writers which stamps it as original and unmistakably     american the nature poetry of bryant with its rugged strength and     simplicity the old dutch legends and stories of irving the     pioneer romances of cooper and simms the effective short stories     of poethese have hardly a counterpart in foreign writings of the     period they are the first striking expressions of the new

the dead       political history to study the history of america after 1840 is to     have our attention drawn as by a powerful lodestone to the civil     war it looms there in the middle of the nineteenth century a     stupendous thing dominating and dwarfing all others to it     converge many ways that then seemed aimless or wandering the     unanswered questions of the constitution the compromises of     statesmen the intrigues of politicians the clamor of impatient     reformers the silent degradation of the slave and from it all     its passion and suffering forgotten its heroism remembered     proceed the unexpected blessings of a finer love of country a     broader sense of union a surer faith in democracy a better     understanding of the spirit of america more gratitude for her     glorious past more hope for her future so every thought or     mention of the mighty conflict draws us onward as the first sight     of the rockies massive and snow crowned lures the feet of the     wanderer on the plains      we shall not attempt here to summarize the war between the south     and the north or even to list its causes and consequences the     theme is too vast we note only that the main issues of the     conflict state rights and slavery had been debated for the better     part of a century and might still have found peaceful solution had     they not been complicated by the minor issues of such an age of     agitation as america never saw before and as we devoutly hope may     never see again      illustration the man abraham lincoln      sidenote the age of agitation      such agitation was perhaps inevitable in a country that had grown     too rapidly for its government to assimilate the new possessions     by the oregon treaty the war with mexico and the annexation of     texas vast territories had suddenly been added to the union each     with its problem that called for patient and wise deliberation but     that a passionate and halfinformed congress was expected to settle     overnight with the expansion of territory in the west came a     marvelous increase of trade and wealth in the north and a     corresponding growth in the value of cotton and slave labor in the     south then arose an economic strife the agricultural interests of     one part of the country clashed with the manufacturing interests of     another in such matters as the tariff for example and in the     tumult of party politics it was impossible to reach any harmonious     adjustment finally the violent agitation of the slave question     forced it to the front not simply as a moral or human but as a     political issue for the old balance of power between the states     was upset when the north began to outstrip the south in population     and every state was then fiercely jealous of its individual rights     and obligations in a way that we can now hardly comprehend      as a result of these conflicting interests and the local or     sectional passions which they aroused there was seldom a year     after 1840 when the country did not face a situation of extreme     difficulty or danger indeed even while webster was meditating his     prophetic oration with its superb climax of liberty and union now     and forever one and inseparable many of the most thoughtful     minds south and north believed that congress faced a problem     beyond its power to solve that no single government was wise     enough or strong enough to meet the situation especially a     government divided against itself      sidenote the wind and the whirlwind      in the midst of the political tumult which was increased by the     clamor of agitators and reformers came suddenly the secession of a     state from the union an act long threatened long feared but     which arrived at last with the paralyzing effect of a thunderbolt     then the clamor ceased minor questions were swept aside as by a     tempest and the main issues were settled not by constitutional     rights not by orderly process of law or the ballot but by the     fearful arbitrament of the sword and even as the thunderbolt fell     and the union trembled came also unheralded one gaunt heroic     heavensent man to lead the nation in its hour of peril        oh slow to smite and swift to spare         gentle and merciful and just       who in the fear of god didst bear         the sword of power a nations trust      such is an outline of the period of conflict an outline to which     the political measures or compromises of the time its sectional     antagonism its score of political parties its agitators     reformers and all other matters of which we read confusedly in the     histories are but so many illuminating details      social and intellectual changes the mental ferment of the period     was almost as intense as its political agitation thus the     antislavery movement which aimed to rescue the negro from his     servitude was accompanied by a widespread communistic attempt to     save the white man from the manifold evils of our competitive     system of industry brook farm footnote this was a massachusetts     society founded in 1841 by george ripley it included hawthorne     dana and curtis in its large membership and it had the support of     emerson greeley channing margaret fuller and a host of other     prominent men and women was the most famous of these communities     but there were more than thirty others scattered over the country     all holding property in common working on a basis of mutual     helpfulness aiming at a nobler life and a better system of labor     than that which now separates the capitalist and the workingman      sidenote widening horizons      this brave attempt at human brotherhood of which brook farm was     the visible symbol showed itself in many other ways in the     projection of a hundred social reforms in the establishment of     lyceums throughout the country where every man with a message     might find a hearing in education our whole school system was     changed by applying the methods of pestalozzi a swiss reformer     for the world had suddenly become small thanks to steam and     electricity and what was spoken in a corner the newspapers     immediately proclaimed from the housetops in religious circles the     unitarian movement under channings leadership gained rapidly in     members and in influence in literature the american horizon was     broadened by numerous translations from the classic books of     foreign countries in the realm of philosophy the western mind was     stimulated by the teaching of the idealistic system known as     transcendentalism      sidenote transcendentalism      emerson was the greatest exponent of this new philosophy which     made its appearance here in 1836 it exalted the value of the     individual man above society or institutions and in dealing with     the individual it emphasized his freedom rather than his subjection     to authority his soul rather than his body his inner wealth of     character rather than his outward possessions it taught that     nature was an open book of the lord in which he who runs may read a     divine message and in contrast with eighteenthcentury philosophy     which had described man as a creature of the senses born with a     blank mind and learning only by experience it emphasized the     divinity of mans nature his inborn ideas of right and wrong his     instinct of god his passion for immortalityin a word his     higher knowledge which transcends the knowledge gained from the     senses and which is summarized in the word transcendentalism      we have described this in the conventional way as a new philosophy     though in truth it is almost as old as humanity most of the great     thinkers of the world in all ages and in all countries have been     transcendentalists but in the original way in which the doctrine     was presented by emerson it seemed like a new revelation as all     fine old things do when they are called to our attention and it     exercised a profound influence on our american life and literature  literature of the period the violent political agitation and the profound social unrest of the period found expression in multitudinous works of prose or verse but the curious fact is that these are all minor works and could without much loss be omitted from our literary records they are mostly sectional in spirit and only what is national or human can long endure  sidenote minor works  to illustrate our criticism the terrible war that dominates the period never had any worthy literary expression there are thousands of writings but not a single great poem or story or essay or drama on the subject the antislavery movement likewise brought forth its poets novelists orators and essayists some of the greater writers were drawn into its whirlpool of agitation and whittier voiced the conviction that the age called for a man rather than a poet in a cry which was half defiance and half regret    better than selfindulgent years     the outflung heart of youth   than pleasant songs in idle ears     the tumult of the truth  that was the feeling in the heart of many a promising young southern or northern poet in midcentury just as it was in 1776 when our best writers neglected literature for political satires against whigs or tories yet of the thousand works which the antislavery agitation inspired we can think of only one mrs stowes uncle toms cabin which lives with power to our own day and there is something of universal human nature in that famous book written not from knowledge or experience but from the imagination which appeals broadly to our human sympathy and which makes it welcome in countries where slavery as a political or a moral issue has long since been forgotten  sidenote general characteristics  though the ferment of the age produced no great books it certainly influenced our literature making it a very different product from that of the early national period for example nearly every political issue soon became a moral issue and there is a deep ethical earnestness in the essays of emerson the poems of longfellow and the novels of hawthorne which sets them apart as of a different spirit from the works of irving poe and cooper  again the mental unrest of the period showed itself in a passion for new ideas new philosophy new prose and poetry we have already spoken of the transcendental philosophy but even more significant was the sudden broadening of literary interest american readers had long been familiar with the best english poets now they desired to know how our common life had been reflected by poets of other nations in answer to that desire came first the establishment of professorships of belleslettres in our american colleges and then a flood of translations from european and oriental literatures as we shall presently see every prominent writer from emerson to whitman was influenced by new views of life as reflected in the worlds poetry longfellow is a conspicuous example with his songs inspired by spanish or german or scandinavian originals he is at times more like an echo of europe than a voice from the new world  illustration birthplace of longfellow at falmouth now portland maine  sidenote an age of poetry  finally this period of conflict was governed more largely than usual by ideals by sentiment by intense feeling witness the war with the heroic sentiments which it summoned up south and north as the deepest human feeling cannot be voiced in prose we confront the strange phenomenon of an american age of poetry this would be remarkable poetry enough to one who remembers that the genius of america had hitherto appeared practical and prosaic given to action rather than speech more concerned to get on in life than to tell what life means but it is even more remarkable in view of the war which covers the age with its frightful shadow as lincoln sad and overburdened found the relief of tears in the beautiful ending of longfellows building of the ship so it seems the heart of america torn by the sight of her sons in conflict found blessed relief in songs of love of peace of home of beautyof all the lovely and immortal ideals to which every war offers violent but impotent contradiction and this may be the simple explanation of the fact that the most cherished poems produced by any period of war are almost invariably its songs of peace                                       the greater poets  henry wadsworth longfellow 18071882  when longfellow sent forth his voices of the night in 1839 that modest little volume met with a doubly warm reception critics led by poe pounced on the work to condemn its sentimentality or moralizing while a multitude of readers who needed no leader raised a great shout of welcome  now as then there are diverse critical opinions of longfellow and unfortunately these opinions sometimes obscure the more interesting facts that longfellow is still the favorite of the american home the most honored of all our elder poets that in foreign schools his works are commonly used as an introduction to english verse and that he has probably led more young people to appreciate poetry than any other poet who ever wrote our language that strange literary genius lafcadio hearn advised his japanese students to begin the study of poetry with longfellow saying that they might learn to like other poets better in later years but that longfellow was most certain to charm them at the beginning  the reason for this advice given to the antipodes was probably this that young hearts and pure hearts are the same the world over and longfellow is the poet of the young and pure in heart      life the impression of serenity in longfellows work may be     explained by the gifts which fortune offered him in the way of     endowment training and opportunity by nature he was a gentleman     his home training was of the best to his college education four     years of foreign study were added a very unusual thing at that     time and no sooner was he ready for his work than the way opened     as if the magic sesame were on his lips his own college     gave him a chair of modern languages and literature which was the     very thing he wanted then harvard offered what seemed to him a     wider field and finally his country called him from the     professors chair to teach the love of poetry to the whole nation     before his long and beautiful life ended he had enjoyed for half a     century the two rewards that all poets desire and the most of them     in vain namely fame and love the first may be fairly won the     second is a free gift      illustration henry wadsworth longfellow      longfellow was born 1807 in the town of falmouth maine which     has since been transformed into the city of portland like bryant     he was descended from pilgrim stock but where the older poets     training had been strictly puritanic longfellows was more liberal     and broadly cultured bryant received the impulse to poetry from     his grandfathers prayers but longfellow seems to have heard his     first call in the sea wind some of his best lyrics sing of the     ocean his early book of essays was called driftwood his     last volume of poetry in the harbor and in these lyrics and     titles we have a reflection of his boyhood impressions in looking     forth from the beautiful falmouth headland then a wild     woodfringed pasture but now a formal park        i remember the black wharves and the slips         and the sea tides tossing free       and spanish sailors with bearded lips       and the beauty and mystery of the ships         and the magic of the sea      sidenote the call of books      this first call was presently neglected for the more insistent     summons of literature and thereafter longfellows inspiration was     at second hand from books rather than from nature or humanity     soon after his graduation from bowdoin 1825 he was offered a     professorship in modern languages on condition that he prepare     himself for the work by foreign study with a glad heart he     abandoned the law which he had begun to study in his fathers     office and spent three happy years in france spain and italy     there he steeped himself in european poetry and picked up a     reading knowledge of several languages strangely enough the     romantic influence of europe was reflected by this poet in a book     of prose essays outre mer modeled on irvings sketch     book      sidenote years of teaching      for five years longfellow taught the modern languages at bowdoin     and his subject was so new in america that he had to prepare his     own textbooks then after another period of foreign study this     time in denmark and germany he went to harvard where he taught     modern languages and literature for eighteen years in 1854 he     resigned his chair and for the remainder of his life devoted     himself wholeheartedly to poetry      his literary work began with newspaper verses the best of which     appear in the earlier poems of his collected works next he     attempted prose in his outre mer driftwood essays     and the romances hyperion and kavanagh in 1839     appeared his first volume of poetry voices of the night     after which few years went by without some notable poem or volume     from longfellows pen his last book in the harbor     appeared with the news of his death in 1882      sidenote his serenity      aside from these milestones there is little to record in a career     so placid that we remember by analogy the old clock on the     stairs for the better part of his life he lived in cambridge     where he was surrounded by a rare circle of friends and whither     increasing numbers came from near or far to pay the tribute of     gratitude to one who had made life more beautiful by his singing     once only the serenity was broken by a tragedy the death of the     poets wife who was fatally burned before his eyesa tragedy     which occasioned his translation of dantes divina commedia     by which work he strove to keep his sorrow from overwhelming him     and the exquisite cross of snow the latter seemed too sacred for     publication it was found after the poets death among his     private papers      sidenote his work and influence      reading longfellows poems one would never suspect that they were     produced in an age of turmoil to be sure one finds a few poems on     slavery sentimental effusions written on shipboard to relieve the     monotony of a voyage but these were better unwritten since they     added nothing to the poets song and took nothing from the slaves     burden longfellow has been criticized for his inaction in the     midst of tumult but possibly he had his reasons when everybodys     shouting is an excellent time to hold your tongue he had his own     work to do a work for which he was admirably fitted that he did     not turn aside from it is to his credit and our profit one demand     of his age was as we have noted elsewhere to enter into the     wealth of european poetry and he gave thirty years of his life to     satisfying that demand our own poetry was then sentimental a kind     of sugared angelcake and longfellow who was sentimental enough     but whose sentiment was balanced by scholarship made poetry that     was like wholesome bread to common men lowell was a more brilliant     writer and whittier a more inspired singer but neither did a work     for american letters that is comparable to that of longfellow who     was essentially an educator a teacher of new ideas new values     new beauty his influence in broadening our literary culture in     deepening our sympathy for the poets of other lands and in making     our own poetry a true expression of american feeling is beyond     measure  minor poems it was by his first simple poems that longfellow won the hearts of his people and by them he is still most widely and gratefully remembered to name these old favorites the day is done resignation ladder of st augustine rainy day footsteps of angels light of stars reaper and the flowers hymn to the night midnight mass excelsior village blacksmith psalm of life is to list many of the poems that are remembered and quoted wherever in the round world the english language is spoken  sidenote vesper songs  ordinarily such poems are accepted at their face value as a true expression of human sentiment but if we examine them critically remembering the people for whom they were written we may discover the secret of their popularity the anglosaxons are first a busy and then a religious folk when their days work is done their thoughts turn naturally to higher matters and any examination of longfellows minor works shows that a large proportion of them deal with the thoughts or feelings of men at the close of day such poems would be called abendlieder in german a good oldenglish title for them would be evensong and both titles suggest the element of faith or worship in writing these poems longfellow had unconsciously perhaps the same impulse that leads one man to sing a hymn and another to say his prayers when the day is done because he expresses this almost universal feeling simply and reverently his work is dear to men and women who would not have the habit of work interfere with the divine instinct of worship  further examination of these minor poems shows them to be filled with sentiment that often slips over the verge of sentimentality the sentiments expressed are not of the exalted imaginative kind they are the sentiments of plain people who feel deeply but who can seldom express their feeling now most people are sentimental though we commonly try to hide the fact mores the pity and we are at heart grateful to the poet who says for us in simple musical language what we are unable or ashamed to say for ourselves in a word the popularity of longfellows poems rests firmly on the humanity of the poet  sidenote typical poems  besides these vesper songs are a hundred other short poems among which the reader must make his own selection the ballads should not be neglected for longfellow knew how to tell a story in verse if he were too prone to add a moral to his tale a moral that does not speak for itself were better omitted we can overlook the fault since his moral was a good one and his readers liked it the occasional poems also written to celebrate persons or events such as building of the ship hanging of the crane morituri salutamus bells of lynn robert burns chamber over the gate well deserved the welcome which the american people gave them and the sonnets such as three friends victor and vanquished my books nature milton president garfield giottos tower are not only the most artistic of longfellows works but rank very near to the best sonnets in the english language  american idyls in the same spirit in which tennyson wrote his english idyls the american poet sent forth certain works reflecting the beauty of common life on this side of the ocean and though he never collected or gave them a name we think of them as his american idyls many of his minor poems belong to this class but we are thinking especially of evangeline miles standish and hiawatha the lastnamed with its myths and legends clustering around one heroic personage is commonly called an epic but its songs of chibiabos minnehaha nokomis and the little hiawatha are more like idyllic pictures of the original americans  sidenote evangeline  evangeline a tale of acadie 1847 met the fate of longfellows earlier poems in that it was promptly attacked by a few critics while a multitude of people read it with delight its success may be explained on four counts first it is a charming story not a modern or realistic but a tender pathetic story such as we read in old romances and such as young people will cherish so long as they remain young people second it had a new world setting one that was welcomed in europe because it offered readers a new stage more vast shadowy mysterious than that to which they were accustomed and doubly welcomed here because it threw the glamor of romance over familiar scenes which deserved but had never before found their poet third this old romance in a new setting was true to universal human nature its sentiments of love faith and deathless loyalty were such as make the heart beat faster wherever true hearts are found finally it was written in an unusual verse form the unrimed hexameter which longfellow handled as well let us say as most other english poets who have tried to use that alluring but difficult measure for hexameters are like the italian language which is very easy to pick up but which few foreigners ever learn to speak with the rhythm and melody of a child of tuscany  longfellow began his hexameters fairly well as witness the opening lines of evangeline    this is the forest primeval the murmuring pines and the hemlocks   bearded with moss and in garments green indistinct in the twilight   stand like druids of eld with voices sad and prophetic   stand like harpers hoar with beards that rest on their bosoms   loud from its rocky caverns the deepvoiced neighboring ocean   speaks and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest  occasionally also he produced a very good but not quite perfect line or passage    and as the voice of the priest repeated the service of sorrow   so with a mournful sound like the voice of a vast congregation   solemnly answered the sea and mingled its roar with the dirges  one must confess however that such passages are exceptional and that one must change the proper stress of a word too frequently to be enthusiastic over longfellows hexameters some of his lines halt or hobble refusing to move to the chosen measure and others lose all their charm when spoken aloud    when she had passed it seemed like the ceasing of exquisite music  that line has been praised by critics but one must believe that they never pronounced it to voice its sibilant hissing is to understand the symbol for a white man in the indian sign language that is two fingers of a hand extended before the face like the fork of a serpents tongue footnote this curious symbol a snakes tongue to represent an englishman was invented by some indian whose ears were pained by a language in which the s sounds occur too frequently our plurals are nearly all made that way unfortunately but longfellow was able to make a hissing line without the use of a single plural on the whole longfellows verse should be judged not by itself but as a part of the tale he was telling holmes summed up the first impression of many readers by saying that he found these brimming lines an excellent medium for a charming story  that is more than one can truthfully say of the next important idyl the courtship of miles standish 1858 the story is a good one and more than all the histories has awakened a romantic interest in the pilgrims but its unhappy hexameters go jolting along continually upsetting the musical rhythm until we wish that the tale had been told in either prose or poetry  sidenote song of hiawatha  the song of hiawatha 1855 was longfellows greatest work and by it he will probably be longest remembered as a world poet the materials for this poem its musical names its primitive traditions its fascinating folklore were all taken from schoolcrafts books about the ojibway indians its peculiar verse form with its easy rhythm and endless repetition was copied from the kalevala the national epic of finland material and method the tale and the verse form were finely adapted to each other and though longfellow showed no originality in hiawatha his poetic talent or genius appears in this that these tales of childhood are told in a childlike spirit that these forest legends have the fragrance of hemlock in them and that as we read them even now we seem to see the wigwam with its curling smoke and beyond the wigwam the dewy earth the shining river and the blue sky with its pillars of tree trunks and its cloud of rustling leaves the simplicity and naturalness of primitive folklore is in this work of longfellow who of a hundred writers at home and abroad was the first to reveal the poetry in the soul of an indian  as the poem is well known we forbear quotation as it is too long perhaps we express a personal preference in naming hiawathas childhood his friends his fishing and his wooing as the parts most likely to please the beginner the best that can be said of hiawatha is that it adds a new tale to the worlds storybook that book of the centuries has only a few stories each of which portrays a man from birth to death fronting the problems of this life meeting its joy or sorrow in man fashion and then setting his face bravely to ponemah the land of the hereafter that longfellow added a chapter to the volume which preserves the stories of ulysses beowulf arthur and roland is undoubtedly his best or most enduring achievement  illustration the taproom wayside inn sudbury  his experimental works unless the student wants to encourage a sentimental mood by reading hyperion longfellows prose works need not detain us much more valuable and readable are his translations from various european languages and of these his metrical version of the divine comedy of dante is most notable he attempted also several dramatic works among which the spanish student 1843 is still readable though not very convincing in christus a mystery he attempted a miracle play of three acts dealing with christianity in the apostolic medieval and modern eras but not even his admirers were satisfied with the result the golden legend one version of which caxton printed on the first english press and which a score of different poets have paraphrased is the only part of christus that may interest young readers by its romantic portrayal of the middle ages to name such works is to suggest longfellows varied interests and his habit of experimenting with any subject or verse form that attracted him in foreign literatures  the tales of a wayside inn 18631873 is the most popular of longfellows miscellaneous works here are a score of stories from ancient or modern sources as told by a circle of the poets friends in the red horse inn at sudbury the title suggests at once the canterbury tales of chaucer but it would be unwise to make any comparison between the two works or the two poets the ballad of paul reveres ride is the best known of the wayside inn poems the viking tales of the saga of king olaf are the most vigorous the mellow coloring of the middle ages appears in such stories as the legend beautiful and the bell of atri  characteristics of longfellow the broad sympathy of longfellow which made him at home in the literatures of a dozen nations was one of his finest qualities he lived in cambridge he wrote in english he is called the poet of the american home but had he lived in finland and written in a scandinavian tongue his poems must still appeal to us indeed so simply did he reflect the sentiments of the human heart that finland or any other nation might gladly class him among its poets  sidenote a poet of all peoples  for example many englishmen have written about their wellington but as hearn says not even tennysons poem on the subject is quite equal to longfellows warden of the cinque ports the spirit of the spanish missions with their selfsacrificing monks and their soldiers with hearts of fire and steel is finely reflected in the bells of san blas the halfsuperstitious loyalty of the russian peasant for his hereditary ruler has never been better reflected than in the white czar the story of belisarius has been told in scores of histories and books of poetry but you will feel a deeper sympathy for the neglected old roman soldier in longfellows poem than in anything else you may find on the same theme and there are many other foreign heroes or brave deeds that find beautiful expression in the verse of our american poet of late it has become almost a critical habit to disparage longfellow but no critic has pointed out another poet who has reflected with sympathy and understanding the feelings of so many widely different peoples  illustration longfellows library in craigie house cambridge  naturally such a poet had his limitations in comparison with chaucer for example we perceive instantly that longfellow knew only one side of life the better side unhappy or rebellious or turbulent souls were beyond his ken he wrote only for those who work by day and sometimes go to evensong at night who hopefully train their children or reverently bury their dead and who cleave to a writer that speaks for them the fitting word of faith or cheer or consolation on every proper occasion as humanity is largely made of such men and women longfellow will always be a popular poet for him with his serene outlook there were not nine muses but only three and their names were faith hope and charity  sidenote poetic faults  concerning his faults perhaps the most illuminating thing that can be said is that critics emphasize and ordinary readers ignore them the reason for this is that every poem has two elements form and content a critic looks chiefly at the one an ordinary reader at the other because the form of longfellows verse is often faulty it is easy to criticize him to show that he copies the work of others that he lacks originality that his figures are often forced or questionable but the reader the young reader especially may be too much interested in the charm of the poets story or the truth of his sentiment to dissect his poetic figures thus in the bestknown of his earlier poems a psalm of life he uses the famous metaphor of footprints on the sands of time that is so bad a figure that to analyze is to reject it yet it never bothers young people who would understand the poet and like him just as well even had he written signboards instead of footprints the point is that longfellow is so obviously a true and pleasant poet that his faults easily escape attention unless we look for them there is perhaps no better summary of our poets qualities than to record again the simple fact that he is the poet of young people to whom sentiment is the very breath of life should you ask the reason for his supremacy in this respect the answer is a paradox longfellow was not an originator he had no new song to sing no new tale to tell he was the poet of old heroes old legends old sentiments and ideals therefore he is the poet of youth                                       john greenleaf whittier 18071892  the strange mixture of warrior and peace lover in whittier has led to a strange misjudgment of his work from the obscurity of a new england farm he emerged as the champion of the abolitionist party and for thirty tumultuous years his poems were as war cries by such work was he judged as the trumpeter of a cause and the judgment stood between him and his audience when he sang not of a cause but of a country even at the present time most critics speak of whittier as the antislavery poet stedman for example focuses our attention on certain lyrics of reform which he calls words wrung from the nations heart but the plain fact is that only a small part of the nation approved these lyrics or took any interest in the poet who wrote them  such was whittier on one side a militant poet of reform sending forth verses that had the brattle of trumpets and the waving of banners in them    lift again the stately emblem on the bay states rusted shield   give to northern winds the pine tree on our banners tattered field   sons of men who sat in council with their bibles round the board   answering englands royal missive with a firm thus saith the lord   rise again for home and freedom set the battle in array   what the fathers did of old time we their sons must do today  on the other side he was a friend or quaker and the peaceful spirit of his people found expression in lyrics of faith that have no equal in our poetry he was also a patriot to the core he loved america with a profound love her ideals her traditions her epic history were in his blood and he glorified them in ballads and idyls that reflect the very spirit of brave colonial days to judge whittier as a trumpeter therefore is to neglect all that is important in his work for his reform poems merely awaken the dying echoes of party clamor while his ballads and idyls belong to the whole american people and his hymns of faith to the wider audience of humanity      life the span of whittiers life was almost the span of the     nineteenth century he was born 1807 in the homestead of his     ancestors at haverhill massachusetts and spent his formative     years working in the fields by day reading beside the open fire at     night and spending a few terms in a deestrict school presided     over by teachers who came or went with the spring his schooling     was therefore of the scantiest kind his real education came from     a noble home from his countrys history from his toil and outdoor     life with its daily contact with nature the love of home and of     homely virtues the glorification of manhood and womanhood the     pride of noble traditions and always a background of meadow or     woodland or sounding seathese were the subjects of whittiers     best verse because these were the things he knew most intimately      sidenote first verses      it was a song of burns that first turned whittier to poetry but     hardly had he begun to write songs of his own when garrison the     antislavery agitator turned his thought from the peaceful farm to     the clamoring world beyond attracted by certain verses whittiers     sister elizabeth had sent them secretly to garrisons paper the     editor came over to see his contributor and found to his surprise a     country lad who was in evident need of education instead of asking     for more poetry therefore garrison awakened the boys ambition     for two terms he attended the haverhill academy supporting himself     meanwhile by making shoes then his labor was needed at home but     finding his health too delicate for farm work he chose other     occupations and contributed manfully to the support of his family      illustration john greenleaf whittier      for several years thereafter whittier was like a man trying to find     himself he did factory work he edited newspapers he showed a     talent for political leadership he made poems which he sold at a     price to remind him of what he had once received for making shoes     while poetry and politics both called to him alluringly a crisis     arose garrison summoned him and with a sad heart knowing that he     left all hope of political or literary success behind he went over     to the abolitionist party that was in 1833 when whittier was     twentysix years old at that time the abolitionists were detested     in the north as well as in the south and to join them was to     become an outcast      sidenote storm and stress      then came the militant period of whittiers life he became editor     of antislavery journals he lectured in the cause he was stoned     for his utterances his printing shop was burned by a mob     meanwhile his poems were sounding abroad like trumpet blasts     making friends making enemies it was a passionate age when     political enemies were hated like hessians but whittier was always     chivalrous with his opponents read his randolph of roanoke for a     specific example his laus deo 1865 a chant of exultation     written when he heard the bells ringing the news of the     constitutional amendment prohibiting slavery was the last poem of     this period of storm and stress      illustration oak knoll whittiers home danvers massachusetts      in the following year whittier produced snowbound his     masterpiece though he had been writing for half a century he had     never won either fame or money by his verse but the publication of     this beautiful idyl placed him in the front rank of american poets     thereafter he was a national figure and the magazines which once     scorned his verses were now most eager to print them so he made an     end of the poverty which had been his portion since childhood      sidenote peaceful years      for the remainder of his life he lived serenely at amesbury for     the most part in a modest house presided over by a relative he     wrote poetry now more carefully for a wider audience and every     few years saw another little volume added to his store ballads     of new england miriam and other poems hazel     blossoms poems of nature st gregorys quest     at sundown when he died 1892 he was honored not so widely     perhaps as longfellow but more deeply as we honor those whose     peace has been won through manful strife holmes the ready poet of     all occasions expressed a formal but sincere judgment in the     lines        best loved and saintliest of our singing train         earths noblest tributes to thy name belong       a lifelong record closed without a stain         a blameless memory shrined in deathless song  earlier works footnote though we are concerned here with whittiers poetry we should at least mention certain of his prose works such as legends of new england leaves from margaret smiths journal and old portraits and modern sketches the chief value of these is in their pictures of colonial life in whittiers poetry we note three distinct stages and note also that he was on the wrong trail until he followed his own spirit his earliest work was inspired by burns but this was of no consequence next he fell under the spell of scott and wrote mogg megone and the bridal of pennacook these indian romances in verse are too much influenced by scotts border poems and also by sentimental novels of savage life such as mrs childs hobomok they do not ring true and in this respect are like almost everything else in literature on the subject of the indians  sidenote reform poems  in voices of freedom 1849 and other poems inspired by the antislavery campaign whittier for the first time came close to his own age he was no longer an echo but a voice a mans voice shouting above a tumult he spoke not for the nation but for a party and it was inevitable that his reform lyrics should fall into neglect with the occasions that called them forth they are interesting now not as poems but as sidelights on a critical period of our history their intensely passionate quality appears in faneuil hall song of the free the pine tree randolph of roanoke and the farewell of an indian slave mother  there is a fine swinging rhythm in these poems in massachusetts to virginia especially which recalls macaulays armada and two of them at least show astonishing power and vitality one is laus deo to which we have referred in our story of the poets life the other is ichabod 1850 written after the seventh of march speech of webster when that statesman seemed to have betrayed the men who elected and trusted him surprise anger scorn indignation sorrowall these emotions were loosed in a flood after websters speech but whittier waited till he had fused them into one emotion and when his slow words fell at last they fell with the weight of judgment and the scorching of fire upon their victim if words could kill a man these surely are the words ichabod is the most powerful poem of its kind in our language but it is fearfully unjust to webster those who read it should read also the lost occasion written thirty years later which whittier placed next to ichabod in the final edition of his poems so he tried to right a wrong unfortunately after the victim was dead by offering generous tribute to the statesman he had once misjudged  ballads and american idyls whittiers manly heart and his talent for flowing verse made him an excellent ballad writer but his work in this field is so different from that of his predecessors that he came near to inventing a new type of poetry thus many of the old ballads celebrate the bravery that mounts with fighting but whittier always lays emphasis on the higher quality that we call moral courage barclay of ury will illustrate our criticism the verse has a martial swing the hero is a veteran who has known the lust of battle but his courage now appears in selfmastery in the ability to bear in silence the jeers of a mob again the old ballad aims to tell a story nothing else and drives straight to its mark but whittier portrays the whole landscape and background of the action he deals largely with colonial life in new england and his descriptions of place and people are unrivaled in our poetry read one of his typical ballads the wreck of rivermouth or the witchs daughter or the garrison of cape ann or skipper iresons ride and see how closely he identifies himself with the place and time of his story  illustration street in old marblehead skipper iresons home on extreme right  sidenote patriotic quality  there is one quality however in which our quaker poet resembles the old ballad makers namely his intense patriotism and this recalls the fact that ballads were the first histories the first expression not only of brave deeds but of the national pride which the deeds symbolized though whittier keeps himself modestly in the background as a story teller ought to do he can never quite repress the love of his native land or the quickened heartbeats that set his verse marching as if to the drums this patriotism though intense was never intolerant but rather sympathetic with men of other lands as appears in the pipes at lucknow a ballad dealing with a dramatic incident of the sepoy rebellion the scotsman who could read that ballad unmoved without a kindling of the eye or a stirring of the heart would be unworthy of his clan or country  even better than whittiers ballads are certain narrative poems reflecting the life of simple people to which we give the name of idyls telling the bees in school days my playmate maud muller the barefoot boythere are no other american poems quite like these none so tender none written with such perfect sympathy some of them are like photographs and the lens that gathered them was not a glass but a human heart others sing the emotion of love as only whittier the galahad of poets could have sung itas in this stanza from a sea dream    draw near more near forever dear     whereer i rest or roam   or in the citys crowded streets     or by the blown sea foam     the thought of thee is home  snowbound the best of whittiers idyls is snowbound 1866 into which he gathered a boys tenderest memories in naming this as the best poem in the language on the subject of home we do not offer a criticism but an invitation because all that is best in human life centers in the ideal of home and because whittier reflected that ideal in a beautiful way snowbound should be read if we read nothing else of american poetry there is perhaps only one thing to prevent this idyl from becoming a universal poem its natural setting can be appreciated only by those who live within the snow line who have seen the white flakes gather and drift confining every family to the circle of its own hearth fire in what emerson calls the tumultuous privacy of storm  the plan of the poem is simplicity itself it opens with a description of a snowstorm that thickens with the december night the inmates of an old farmhouse gather about the open fire and whittier describes them one by one how they looked to the boy for snowbound is a recollection of boyhood and what stories they told to reveal their interests the rest of the poem is a reverie as of one no longer a boy who looks into his fire and sees not the firepictures but those other scenes or portraits that are graved deep in every human heart  sidenote charm of snowbound  to praise such a work is superfluous and to criticize its artless sincerity is beyond our ability many good writers have explained the poem yet still its deepest charm escapes analysis perhaps because it has no name the best criticism that the present writer ever heard on the subject came from a habitant farmer in the province of quebec a simple unlettered man who was a poet at heart but who would have been amazed had anyone told him so his children who were learning english literature through the happy medium of evangeline and snowbound brought the latter poem home from school and the old man would sit smoking his pipe and listening to the story when they read of the winter scenes of the fire roaring its defiance up the chimneythroat at the storm without    what matter how the night behaved   what matter how the northwind raved   blow high blow low not all its snow   could quench our hearthfires ruddy glow  then he would stir in his chair make his pipe glow fiercely and blow a cloud of smoke about his head but in the following scene with its memories of the dead and its immortal hope he would sit very still as if listening to exquisite music when asked why he liked the poem his face lighted wy i lak heem msieu whittier i lak heem cause he speak de true he know de storm and de leetle cabane and heart of de boy an hees moder oui oui he know de man also  nature home the heart of a boy and a man and a motherthe poet who can reflect such elemental matters so that the simple of earth understand and love their beauty deserves the critics best tribute of silence  poems of faith and nature aside from the reform poems it is hard to group whittiers works which are all alike in that they portray familiar scenes against a natural background in his tent on the beach 1867 he attempted a collection of tales in the manner of longfellows wayside inn but of these only one or two ballads such as abraham davenport and the wreck of rivermouth are now treasured the best part of the book is the prelude which pictures the poet among his friends and records his impressions of sky and sea and shore  sidenote two views of nature  the outdoor poems of whittier are interesting aside from their own beauty as suggesting two poetic conceptions of nature which have little in common the earlier regards nature as a mistress to be loved or a divinity to be worshiped for her own sake she has her own laws or mercies and man is but one of her creatures the anglosaxon scops viewed nature in this way so did bryant in whose forest hymn is the feeling of primitive ages many modern poets and novelists also like scott and cooper have outgrown this conception they regard nature as a kind of stage for the drama of human life which is allimportant  whittier belongs to this later school he portrays nature magnificently but always as the background for some human incident sad or tender or heroic which appears to us more real because viewed in its natural setting note in the wreck of rivermouth for example how the merry party in their sailboat the mowers on the salt marshes the witch mumbling her warning the challenge of a careless girl the skippers fear the river the breeze the laughing seaeverything is exactly as it should be it is this humanized view of the natural world which makes whittiers ballads unique and which gives deeper meaning to his hampton beach among the hills trailing arbutus the vanishers and other of his best nature poems  sidenote whittiers creed  our reading of whittier should not end until we are familiar with the eternal goodness trust my soul and i the prayer of agassiz and a few more of his hymns of faith our appreciation of such hymns will be more sympathetic if we remember first that whittier came of ancestors whose souls approved the opening proposition of the declaration of independence and second that he belonged to the society of friends who believed that god revealed himself directly to every human soul the inner light they called it and that a mans primal responsibility was to god and his own conscience the creed of whittier may therefore be summarized in two articles i believe in the divine love and in the equality of men the latter article appears in all his poems the former is crystallized in the eternal goodness a hymn so trustful and reverent that it might well be the evensong of humanity  characteristics of whittier one may summarize whittier in the statement that he is the poet of the home and the hills and of that freedom without which the home loses its chief joy and the hill its inspiration in writing of such themes whittier failed to win the highest honors of a poet and the failure was due not to his lack of culture as is sometimes alleged for there is no other culture equal to right living but rather to the stern conditions of his life to his devotion to duty to his struggle for liberty to his lifelong purpose of helping men by his singing great poems are usually the result of seclusion of aloofness but whittier was always a worker in the world  sidenote a natural singer  his naturalness is perhaps his best poetic virtue there is in his verse a spontaneous singing quality which leaves the impression that poetry was his native language it is easy to understand why burns first attracted him for both poets were natural singers who remind us of what bede wrote of cædmon he learned not the art of poetry from men next to his spontaneity is his rare simplicity his gift of speaking straight from a heart that never grew old sometimes his simplicity is as artless as that of a child as in maud muller generally it is noble as in his modest proem to voices of freedom occasionally it is passionate as in the exultant cry of laus deo and at times it rises to the simplicity of pure art as in telling the bees the lastnamed poem portrays an old colonial custom which provided that when death came to a farmhouse the bees must be told and their hives draped in mourning it portrays also as a perfect natural background the path to whittiers home and his sisters oldfashioned flower garden in which the daffodils still bloom where she planted them long ago  sidenote the man and the poet  that whittier was not a great poet as the critics assure us may be frankly admitted that he had elements of greatness is also without question and precisely for this reason because his power is so often manifest in noble or exquisite passages there is disappointment in reading him when we stumble upon bad rimes careless workmanship mishandling of his native speech our experience here is probably like that of whittiers friend garrison the latter had read certain poems that attracted him he came quickly to see the poet and out from under the barn his clothes sprinkled with hayseed crawled a shy country lad who explained bashfully that he had been hunting hens nests anything could be forgiven after that interest in the boy would surely temper criticism of the poet  even so our present criticism of whittiers verse must include certain considerations of the man who wrote it that he smacked of his native soil that his education was scanty and hardly earned that he used words as his father and mother used them and was not ashamed of their rural accent his own experience moreover had weathered him until he seemed part of a rugged landscape he knew life and he loved it he had endured poverty and glorified it he had been farm hand shoemaker selfsupporting student editor of country newspapers local politician champion of slaves worker for reform defender of a hopeless cause that by the awful judgment of war became a winning cause and always and everywhere he had been a man one who did his duty as he saw it spake truth as he believed it and kept his conscience clean his heart pure his faith unshaken all this was in his verse and ennobled even his faults which were part of his plain humanity as longfellow was by study of european literatures the poet of books and culture so whittier was by experience the poet of life the homely quality of his verse which endears it to common men is explained on the ground that he was nearer than any other american poet to the body and soul of his countrymen                                       james russell lowell 18191891  the work of lowell is unusual and his rank or position hard to define though never a great or even a popular writer he was regarded for a considerable part of his life as the most prominent man of letters in america at the present time his reputation is still large but historians find it somewhat easier to praise his works than to read them as poet critic satirist editor and teacher he loomed as a giant among his contemporaries overtopping whittier and longfellow at one time but he left no work comparable to snowbound or hiawatha and one is puzzled to name any of his poems or essays that are fairly certain to give pleasure to read his volumes is to meet a man of power and brilliant promise but the final impression is that the promise was not fulfilled that the masterpiece of which lowell was capable was left unwritten      biographical sketch lowell came from a distinguished family that     had made history in america his father was a cultured clergyman     he grew up in a beautiful home elmwood in the college town of     cambridge among his first companions were the noble books that     filled the shelves of the family library from the beginning     therefore he was inclined to letters and though he often turned     aside for other matters his first and last love was the love of     poetry      at fifteen he entered harvard where he read almost everything he     said except the books prescribed by the faculty then he studied     law and opened an office in boston where he found few clients     being more interested in writing verses than in his profession     with his marriage in 1844 the first strong purpose seems to have     entered his indolent life his wife was zealous in good works and     presently lowell who had gayly satirized all reformers joined in     the antislavery campaign and proceeded to make as many enemies as     friends by his reform poems      illustration james russell lowell      sidenote varied tasks      followed then a period of hard purposeful work during which he     supported himself by editing the pennsylvania freeman and by     writing for the magazines in 1848 his banner year he published     his best volume of poems sir launfal a fable for     critics and the first series of the biglow papers it     was not these volumes however but a series of brilliant lectures     on the english poets that caused lowell to be called to the chair     in harvard which longfellow had resigned he prepared for this work     by studying abroad and for some twenty years thereafter he gave     courses in english italian spanish and german literatures for a     part of this time he was also editor in turn of the atlantic     monthly and the north american review      sidenote life abroad      in the simpler days of the republic when the first question asked     of a diplomat was not whether he had money enough to entertain     society in a proper style the profession of letters was honored by     sending literary men to represent america in foreign courts and     lowells prominence was recognized by his appointment as ambassador     to spain 1877 and to england 1880 it was in this patriotic     service abroad that he won his greatest honors in london     especially he made his power felt as an american who loved his     country as a democrat who believed in democracy and as a cultured     gentleman who understood anglosaxon life because of his     familiarity with the poetry in which that life is most clearly     reflected next to keeping silence about his proper business     perhaps the chief requirement of an ambassador is to make speeches     about everything else and no other foreign speaker was ever     listened to with more pleasure than the witty and cultured lowell     one who summed up his diplomatic triumph said tersely that he found     the englishmen strangers and left them all cousins      he was recalled from this service in 1885 the remainder of his     life was spent teaching at harvard writing more poetry and editing     his numerous works his first volume of poems a years     life was published in 1841 his last volume heartsease and     rue appeared almost half a century later in 1888 that his     death occurred in the same house in which he was born and in which     he had spent the greater part of his life is an occurrence so rare     in america that it deserves a poem of commemoration  lowells poetry there are golden grains everywhere in lowells verse but never a continuous vein of metal in other words even his best work is notable for occasional lines rather than for sustained excellence as a specific example study the commemoration ode one of the finest poems inspired by the civil war the occasion of this ode to commemorate the college students who had given their lives for their country was all that a poet might wish the brilliant audience that gathered at cambridge was most inspiring and beyond that local audience stood a nation in mourning a nation which had just lost a million of its sons in a mighty conflict it was such an occasion as lowell loved and one who reads the story of his life knows how earnestly he strove to meet it when the reading of his poem was finished his audience called it a noble effort and that is precisely the trouble with the famous ode it is too plainly an effort it does not sing does not overflow from a full heart does not speak the inevitable satisfying word in consequence and perhaps this criticism applies to most ambitious odes we are rather glad when the effort is at an end yet there are excellent passages in the poem notably the sixth and the last stanzas one with its fine tribute to lincoln the other expressive of deathless loyalty to ones native land  sidenote lyrics  the best of lowells lyrics may be grouped in two classes the first dealing with his personal joy or grief the second with the feelings of the nation typical of the former are the first snowfall and a few other lyrics reflecting the poets sorrow for the loss of a little daughtersimple human poems in refreshing contrast with most others of lowell which strive for brilliancy the best of the national lyrics is the present crisis 1844 this was at first a party poem a ringing appeal issued during the turmoil occasioned by the annexation of texas but now with the old party issues forgotten we can all read it with pleasure as a splendid expression of the american heart and will in every crisis of our national history  in the nature lyrics we have a double reflection one of the external world the other of a poet who could not be singleminded and who was always confusing his own impressions of nature or humanity with those other impressions which he found reflected in poetry read the charming to a dandelion for example and note how lowell cannot be content with his    dear common flower that growst beside the way   fringing the dusty road with harmless gold  but must bring in eldorado and twenty other poetic allusions to glorify a flower which has no need of external glory then for comparison read bryants fringed gentian and see how the elder poet content with the flower itself tells you very simply how its beauty appeals to him or read an indiansummer reverie with its scattered lines of gold and note how lowell cannot say what he feels in his own heart but must search everywhere for poetic images and then because he cannot find exactly what he seeks or more likely because he finds a dozen tempting allusions where one is plenty he goes on and on in a vain quest that ends by leaving himself and his reader unsatisfied  sidenote sir launfal  the most popular of lowells works is the vision of sir launfal 1848 in which he invents an arthurian kind of legend of the search for the holy grail most of his long poems are labored but this seems to have been written in a moment of inspiration the prelude begins almost spontaneously and when it reaches the charming passage and what is so rare as a day in june the verse fairly begins to singa rare occurrence with lowell critical readers may reasonably object to the poets moralizing to his imperfect lines and to his setting of an old world legend of knights and castles in a new world landscape but uncritical readers rejoice in a moral feeling that is fine and true and are content with a good story and a good landscape without inquiring whether the two belong together moreover sir launfal certainly serves the first purpose of poetry in that it gives pleasure and so deserves its continued popularity among young readers  sidenote satires  two satiric poems that were highly prized when they were first published and that are still formally praised by historians who do not read them are a fable for critics and the biglow papers the former is a series of doggerel verses filled with grotesque puns and quips aimed at american authors who were prominent in 1848 the latter written in a tortured yankee dialect is made up of political satires and conceits occasioned by the mexican and civil wars both works contain occasional fine lines and a few excellent criticisms of literature or politics but few young readers will have patience to sift out the good passages from the mass of glittering rubbish in which they are hidden  much more worthy of the readers attention are certain neglected works such as lowells sonnets his prometheus columbus agassiz portrait of dante washers of the shroud under the old elm with its noble tribute to washington and stanzas on freedom it is a pity that such poems all of which contain memorable lines should be kept from the wide audience they deserve and largely because of the authors digressiveness to examine them is to conclude that like most of lowells works they are not simple enough in feeling to win ordinary readers like the poetry of longfellow and not perfect enough in form to excite the admiration of critics like the best of poes melodies  illustration lowells house cambridge in winter  lowells prose in brilliancy at least lowell has no peer among american essayists though others excel him in the better qualities of originality or charm or vigor the best of his prose works are the scintillating essays collected in my study window and among my books in his political essays he looked at humanity with his own eyes but the titles of the volumes just named indicate his chief interest as a prose writer which was to interpret the worlds books rather than the worlds throbbing life for younger readers the most pleasing of the prose works are the comparatively simple sketches my garden acquaintance cambridge thirty years ago and on a certain condescension in foreigners in these sketches we meet the author at his best alert witty and so widely read that he cannot help giving literary flavor to whatever he writes among the best of his essays on literary subjects are those on chaucer dante keats walton and emerson  sidenote quality of the essays  one who reads a typical collection of lowells essays is apt to be divided between open admiration and something akin to resentment on the one hand they are brilliant stimulating filled with good things on the other they are always digressive sometimes fantastic and too often selfconscious that is they call our attention to the author rather than to his proper subject when he writes of dante he is concerned to reveal the soul of the italian master but when he writes of milton he seems chiefly intent on showing how much more he knows than the english editor of miltons works when he presents emerson he tries to make us know and admire the concord sage but when he falls foul of emersons friends thoreau and carlyle his personal prejudices are more in evidence than his impersonal judgment in consequence some of the literary essays are a better reflection of lowell himself than of the men he wrote about  an author must be finally measured however by his finest work by his constant purpose rather than by his changing mood and the finest work of lowell his critical studies of the elder poets and dramatists are perhaps the most solid and the most penetrating that our country has to show he certainly kept the great tradition in criticism a tradition which enjoins us in simple language to seek only the best and to reverence it when we find it as he wrote    great truths are portions of the soul of man   great souls are portions of eternity   each drop of blood that eer through true heart ran   with lofty message ran for thee and me                                       oliver wendell holmes 18091894  it is a sad fate for a writer to be known as a humorist nobody will take him seriously ever afterward even a book suffers from such a reputation the famous don quixote for example which we read as a type of extravagant humor but which is in reality a tragedy since it portrays the disillusionment of a man who believed the world to be like his own heart noble and chivalrous and who found it filled with villainy because holmes who was essentially a moralist and a preacher could not repress the bubbling wit that was part of his nature our historians must set him down as a humorist and name the onehoss shay as his most typical work yet his best poems are as pathetic as the last leaf as sentimental as the voiceless as patriotic as old ironsides as worshipful as the hymn of trust as nobly didactic as the chambered nautilus his novels are studies of the obscure problems of heredity and his most characteristic prose work the autocrat of the breakfast table is an original commentary on almost everything under the sun  evidently we prize a laugh above any other product of literature and because there is a laugh or a smile hidden in many a work of holmes he must still keep the place assigned to him as an american humorist even so he is perhaps our most representative writer in this field for he is as thoroughly american as a man can be and his rare culture and kindness are in refreshing contrast to the crude horseplay or sensationalism that is unfortunately trumpeted abroad as new world humor      a placid life though holmes never wrote a formal autobiography he     left a very good reflection of himself in his works and it is in     these alone that we become acquainted with hima genial witty     observant kindhearted and purehearted man whom it is good to     know      he belonged to what he called the brahmin caste of intellectual     aristocrats as described in his novel elsie venner for     he came from an old new england family extending back to anne     bradstreet and the governors of the bay colony he was born in     cambridge he was educated at andover and harvard he spent his     life in boston a city which satisfied him so completely that he     called it the hub of the solar system most ambitious writers     like a large field with plenty of change or variety but holmes was     content with a small and very select circle with himself at the     center of it      for his profession he chose medicine and studied it four years the     latter half of the time in paris at that period his foreign     training was as rare in medicine as was longfellows in poetry he     practiced his profession in boston and managed to make a success of     it though patients were a little doubtful of a doctor who wrote     poetry and who opened his office with the remark that small     fevers would be gratefully received also he was for thirtyfive     years professor of anatomy at the harvard medical school what with     healing or teaching or learning this doctor might have been very     busy but he seems to have found plenty of leisure for writing and     the inclination was always present whoso has once tasted type he     said must indulge the taste to the end of his life      illustration oliver wendell holmes      sidenote the writer      his literary work began at twentyone when he wrote old     ironsides in protest against the order to dismantle the frigate     constitution which had made naval history in the war of     1812 that first poem which still rings triumphantly in our ears     accomplished two things it saved the glorious old warship and it     gave holmes a hold on public attention which he never afterward     lost during the next twentyfive years he wrote poetry and was so     much in demand to furnish verses for special occasions that he was     a kind of poetlaureate of his college and city he was almost     fifty when the atlantic monthly was projected and lowell     demanded as a condition of his editorship that holmes be engaged     as the first contributor feeling in the mood for talk as he     commonly did holmes responded with the autocrat thereafter     he wrote chiefly in prose making his greatest effort in fiction     but winning more readers by his table talk in the form of essays     his last volume over the teacups appeared when he was past     eighty years old      sidenote pet prejudices      we have spoken of the genial quality of holmes as revealed in his     work but we would hardly be just to him did we fail to note his     pet prejudices his suspicion of reformers his scorn of     homeopathic doctors his violent antipathy to calvinism though he     had been brought up in the calvinistic faith his father was an     oldstyle clergyman he seemed to delight in clubbing or     satirizing or slinging stones at it the very mildest he could do     was to refer to yon wheyfaced brother to express his opinion of     those who still clung to puritanic doctrines curiously enough he     still honored his father and was proud of his godly ancestors who     were all stanch puritans the explanation is of course that     holmes never understood theology not for a moment he only     disliked it and was consequently sure that it must be wrong and     that somebody ought to put an end to it in later years he mellowed     somewhat one cannot truthfully say that he overcame his prejudice     but he understood men better and was inclined to include even     reformers and calvinists in what he called the larger humanity     into which i was born so long ago  works of holmes in the field of occasional poetry written to celebrate births dedications feasts and festivals of every kind holmes has never had a peer among his countrymen he would have made a perfect poetlaureate for he seemed to rise to every occasion and have on his lips the right word to express the feeling of the moment whether of patriotism or sympathy or sociability in such happy poems as the boys bill and jo all here and nearly forty others written for his class reunions he reflects the spirit of college men who gather annually to live the good old days over again footnote it may add a bit of interest to these poems if we remember that among the members of the class of 29 was samuel smith author of america a poem that now appeals to a larger audience than the class poet ever dreamed of he wrote also some seventy other poems for special occasions the quality of which may be judged from old ironsides under the violets grandmothers story and numerous appreciations of lowell burns bryant whittier and other wellknown poets  among poems of more general interest the best is the chambered nautilus which some read for its fine moral lesson and others for its beautiful symbolism or almost perfect workmanship others that deserve to be remembered are the last leaf lincolns favorite nearing the snow line meeting of the alumni questions and answers and the voicelessnone great poems but all good and very well worth the reading  sidenote humorous poems  the deacons masterpiece or the wonderful onehoss shay is the most popular of the humorous poems many readers enjoy this excellent skit without thinking what the author meant by calling it a logical story it is in fact the best pebble that he hurled from his sling against his bête noire for the old shay which went to pieces all at once was a symbol of calvinistic theology that theology was called an iron chain of logic every link so perfectly forged that it could not be broken at any point even so was the shay built unbreakable in every single part but when the deacon finds himself sprawling and dumfounded in the road beside the wrecked masterpiece the poet concludes    end of the wonderful onehoss shay   logic is logic thats all i say  other typical verses of the same kind are the height of the ridiculous daily trials the comet and contentment in the lastnamed poem holmes may have been poking fun at the brook farmers and other enthusiasts who were preaching the simple life poets and preachers of this gospel in every age are apt to insist that to find simplicity one must return to nature or the farm or else camp in the woods and eat huckleberries as thoreau did but holmes remembered that some people must live in the city while others incomprehensibly prefer to do so and wrote his contentment to express their idea of the simple life    little i ask my wants are few     i only wish a hut of stone   a very plain brown stone will do     that i may call my own   and close at hand is such a one   in yonder street that fronts the sun    i care not much for gold or land     give me a mortgage here and there   some good bankstock some note of hand     or trifling railroad share   i only ask that fortune send   a little more than i shall spend  sidenote the autocrat  the most readable of the prose works is the autocrat of the breakfast table 1858 a series of monologues in which holmes who was called the best talker of his age transferred his talk in a very charming way to paper as the book professes to record the conversation at the table of a certain boston boardinghouse it has no particular subject the author rambles pleasantly from one topic to another illuminating each by his wisdom or humor or sympathy other books of the same series are the professor at the breakfast table the poet at the breakfast table and over the teacups most critics consider the autocrat the best and the poet second best of the series but there is a tender vein of sentiment and reminiscence in the final volume which is very attractive to older readers  the slight story element in the breakfasttable books probably led holmes to fiction and he straightway produced three novels elsie venner the guardian angel and a mortal antipathy these are studies of heredity of the physical element in morals of the influence of mind over matter and other subjects more suitable for essays than for fiction but a few mature readers who care less for a story than for an observation or theory of life will find the guardian angel an interesting novel and some will surely prize elsie venner for its pictures of new england life its description of boarding school or evening party or social hierarchy at a time when many a new england family had traditions to which it held as firmly and almost as proudly as any european court  illustration old colonial doorway holmess birthplace at cambridge  the quality of holmes the intensely personal quality of the works just mentioned is their most striking characteristic for holmes always looks at a subject with his own eyes and measures its effect on the reader by a previous effect produced upon himself if i like this he says in substance why you must like it too if it strikes me as absurd you cannot take any other attitude for are we not both human and therefore just alike it never occurred to holmes that anybody could differ with him and still be normal those who ventured to do so found the doctor looking keenly at them to discover their symptoms in an ordinary egoist or politician or theologian this would be insufferable but strange to say it is one of the charms of holmes who is so witty and pleasantspoken that we can enjoy his dogmatism without the bother of objecting to it in one of his books he hints that talking to certain persons is like trying to pet a squirrel if you are wise you will not imitate that frisky little beast but assume the purringkitten attitude while listening to the autocrat  sidenote firsthand impressions  another interesting quality of holmes is what we may call his rationalism his habit of taking nothing for granted of judging every matter by observation rather than by tradition or sentiment or imagination and herein he is in marked contrast with longfellow and other romantic writers of the period we shall enjoy him better if we remember his bent of mind as a boy he was fond of tools and machinery as a man he was interested in photography safety razors inventions of every kind as a physician he rebelled against drugs then believed to have almost magical powers and imposed on suffering stomachs in horrible doses and observed his patients closely to discover what mentally ailed them and as boy or man or physician he cared very little for books but a great deal for his own observation of life hence there is always a surprise in reading holmes which comes partly from his flashes of wit but more largely from his independent way of looking at things and recording his firsthand impressions his autocrat especially is a treasure and ranks with thoreaus walden among the most original books of american literature                                       sidney lanier 18421881  the name of lanier is often associated with that of timrod and the two southern poets were outwardly alike in that they struggled against physical illness and mental depression but where we see in timrod the tragedy of a poet broken by pain and neglect the tragedy of laniers life is forgotten in our wonder at his triumph it is doubtful if any other poet ever raised so pure a song of joy out of conditions that might well have occasioned a wail of despair  illustration sidney lanier  the joyous song of lanier is appreciated only by the few he is not popular with either readers or critics and the difficulty of assigning him a place or rank may be judged from recent attempts one history of american literature barely mentions lanier in a slighting reference to a small cult of poetry in parts of america footnote trent history of american literature 1913 p 471 another calls him the only southern poet who had a national horizon and accords his work ample criticism footnote moses literature of the south 1910 pp 358383 a third describes him as a true artist having a lyric power hardly to be found in any other american but the brief record ends with the cutting criticism that his work is hardly national footnote wendell literary history of america 1911 pp 495498 and so with all other histories one dismisses him as the author of a vague rhapsody called the marshes of glynn another exalts him as a poet who rivals poe in melody and far surpasses him in thought or feeling evidently there is no settled criticism of lanier as of bryant or longfellow he is not yet secure in his position among the elder poets and what we record here is such a personal appreciation as any reader may formulate for himself      life america has had its puritan and its cavalier writers but     seldom one who combines the puritans stern devotion to duty with     the cavaliers joy in nature and romance and music lanier was such     a poet and he owed his rare quality to a mixed ancestry he was     descended on his mothers side from scotchirish and puritan     forbears and on his fathers side from huguenot french exiles     who were musicians at the english court one of his ancestors     nicholas lanier is described as a musician painter and engraver     for queen elizabeth and king james and as the composer of music     for some of ben jonsons masques      sidenote early traits      his boyhood was spent at macon georgia where he was born in 1842     a study of that boyhood reveals certain characteristics which     reappear constantly in the poets work one was his rare purity of     soul another was his brave spirit a third was his delight in     nature a fourth was his passion for music at seven he made his     first flute from a reed and ever afterwards though he learned to     play many instruments the flute was to him as a companion and a     voice with it he cheered many a weary march or hungry bivouac     through it he told all his heart to the woman he loved by it he     won a place when he had no other means of earning his bread hence     in the symphony a poem which fronts one of lifes hard problems     it is the flute that utters the clearest and sweetest note      sidenote in war time      lanier had finished his course in oglethorpe university a     primitive little college in midway georgia and was tutoring there     when the war came and the college closed its doors because     teachers and students were away at the first call to join the army     for four years he was a confederate soldier serving in the ranks     with his brother and refusing the promotion offered him for gallant     conduct in the field there was a time during this period when he     might have sung like the minstrels of old for romance had come to     him with the war by day he was fighting or scouting with his life     in his hand but when camp fires were lighted he would take his     flute and slip away to serenade the girl who waited for him till     the war was over      we mention these small incidents with a purpose there is a     delicacy of feeling in laniers verse which might lead a reader to     assume that the poet was effeminate when in truth he was as manly     as any norse scald or saxon scop who ever stood beside his chief in     battle of the war he never sang but we find some reflection of     the girl who waited in the poem my springs      sidenote wars aftermath      lanier was at sea as signal officer on a blockade runner when his     ship was captured by a federal cruiser and he was sent to the     military prison at point lookout 1864 a hard and bitter     experience it was and his only comfort was the flute which he had     hidden in his ragged sleeve when released the following year he     set out on foot for his home five hundred miles away and reached     it more dead than alive for consumption had laid a heavy hand upon     him for weeks he was desperately ill and during the illness his     mother died of the same wasting disease then he rose and set out     bravely to earn a livingno easy matter in a place that had     suffered as georgia had during the war      sidenote the gleam      we shall not enter into his struggle for bread or into his     wanderings in search of a place where he could breathe without     pain he was a law clerk in his fathers office at macon when     knowing that he had but a slender lease of life he made his     resolve to the remonstrances of his father he closed his ears     saying that music and poetry were calling him and he must follow     the call the superb climax of tennysons merlin and the gleam     was in his soul        o young mariner       down to the haven       call your companions       launch your vessel       and crowd your canvas       and ere it vanishes       over the margin       after it follow it       follow the gleam      thus bravely he went northward to baltimore taking his flute with     him he was evidently a wonderful artist playing not by the score     but making his instrument his voice so that his audience seemed to     hear a soul speaking in melody his was a magic flute soon he was     supporting himself by playing in the peabody orchestra living     joyously meanwhile in an atmosphere of music and poetry and books     for he was always a student determined to understand as well as to     practice his art he wrote poems stories anything to earn an     honest dollar he gave lectures on music and literature he planned     a score of books that he did not and could not write for he was     living in a fever of mind and body music and poetry were surging     within him for expression but his strength was failing his time     short      sidenote the struggle      in 1879 he was appointed lecturer at johns hopkins university and     for the first time he had an assured income small indeed but     very heartening since it was enough to support his family he began     teaching with immense enthusiasm but presently he was speaking in     a whisper from an invalids chair under such circumstances were     uttered some of our most cheering words on art and poetry two     years later he died in a tent among the hills near asheville     north carolina whither he had gone in a vain search for health        illustration the village of mcgaheysville virginia       near here lanier spent his summers during the last years of his life      there is in all laniers verse a fragmentariness a sense of     something left unsaid which we may understand better if we     remember that his heart was filled with the noblest emotions but     that when he strove to write them his pen failed for weariness     read the daily miracle of dawn in sunrise for example and find     there the waiting oaks the stars the tide the marsh with its     dreaming pools light color fragrance melodyeverything except     that the hand which wrote the poem was too weak to guide the     pencil the rush of impressions and memories in sunrise its     tender beauty and vague incompleteness as of something left     unsaid may be explained by the fact that it was laniers last     song  works of lanier many readers have grown familiar with laniers name in connection with the boys froissart the boys king arthur the boys mabinogion and the boys percy four books in which he retold in simple language some of the old tales that are forever young his chief prose works the english novel and the science of english verse are of interest chiefly to critics they need not detain us here except to note that the latter volume is devoted to laniers pet theory that music and poetry are governed by the same laws of more general interest are his scattered notes which contain suggestions for many a poem that was never written intermingled with condensed criticisms of the poet swinburne he says he invited me to eat the service was silver and gold but no food therein except salt and pepper one might say less than that with more words or read a whole

souls with his argument seems to be that because the mississippi is long therefore every american is a god  sidenote his best poems  those who read laniers poems should begin with the simplest with his love songs my springs and in absence or his ballad of trees and the master or his outdoor poems such as tampa robins song of the chattahoochee mocking bird and evening song in the lastnamed lyrics he began the work carried out more fully in his later poems of interpreting in words the harmony which his sensitive ear detected in the manifold voices of nature  next in order are the poems in which is hidden a thought or an ideal not to be detected at first glance for to lanier poetry was like certain oriental idols which when opened are found to be filled with exquisite perfumes the stirrup cup is one of the simplest of these allegories it was a custom in olden days when a man was ready to journey for one who loved him to bring a glass of wine which he drank in the saddle and this was called the stirrup or parting cup in the cup offered lanier was a rare cordial filled with sweet herbs from all antiquity and the name of the cordial was death    then time let not a drop be spilt   hand me the cup wheneer thou wilt   t is thy rich stirrup cup to me   ill drink it down right smilingly  in four stanzas of night and day he compresses the tragedy of othello not the tragedy that shakespeare wrote but the tragedy that was in the moors soul when desdemona was gone in life and song he sought to express the ideal of a poet and the closing lines might well be the measure of his own heroic life    his song was only living aloud   his work a singing with his hand  in how love looked for hell the lesson is hidden deeper for the profound yet simple meaning of the poem is that search high or low love can never find hell because he takes heaven with him wherever he goes another poem of the same class but longer and more involved is the symphony here lanier faces one of the greatest problems of the age the problem of industrialism with its false standards and waste of human happiness and his answer is the same that tennyson gave in his later poems namely that the familiar love in human hearts can settle every social question when left to its own unselfish way    vainly might platos brain revolve it   plainly the heart of a child might solve it  sidenote marshes of glynn  the longer poems of lanier are of uneven merit and are all more or less fragmentary the chief impression from reading the psalm of the west for example is that it is the prelude to some greater work that was left unfinished more finely wrought and more typical of laniers mood and method is the marshes of glynn his bestknown work it is a marvelous poem one of the most haunting in our language yet it is like certain symphonies in that it says nothing being all feelingvague inexpressible feeling some readers find no meaning or satisfaction in it others hail it as a perfect interpretation of their own mood or emotion when they stand speechless before the sunrise or the afterglow or a landscape upon which the very spirit of beauty and peace is brooding  the quality of lanier in order to sympathize with lanier and so to understand him it is necessary to keep in mind that he was a musician rather than a poet in our ordinary understanding of the term in his verse he used words exactly as he used the tones of his flute not so much to express ideas as to call up certain emotions that find no voice save in music as he said music takes up the thread that language drops which explains that beautiful but puzzling line which closes the symphony    music is love in search of a word  sidenote music and poetry  we have spoken of the symphony as an answer to the problem of industrial waste and sorrow but it contains also laniers confession of faith namely that social evils arise among men because of their lack of harmony and that spiritual harmony the concord of souls which makes strife impossible may be attained through music the same belief appears in tiger lilies a novel written by lanier in his early days in which a certain character makes these professions      to make a home out of a household given the raw     materialsto wit wife children a friend or two and a housetwo     other things are necessary these are a good fire and good music     and inasmuch as we can do without the fire for half the year i may     say music is the one essential      late explorers say they have found some nations that have no god     but i have not read of any that had no music music means     harmony harmony means love love meansgod  one may therefore summarize lanier by saying that he was poet who used verbal rhythm as a musician uses harmonious chords to play upon our better feelings his poems of nature give us no definite picture of the external world but are filled with murmurings tremblings undertonesall the vague impressions which one receives when alone in the solitudes as if the world were alive but inarticulate    ye marshes how candid and simple and nothingwitholding and free   ye publish yourselves to the sky and offer yourselves to the sea   tolerant plains that suffer the sea and the rains and the sun   ye spread and span like the catholic man that hath mightily won   god out of knowledge and good out of infinite pain   and sight out of blindness and purity out of a stain  his poems of life have similar virtues and weaknesses they are melodious they are nobly inspired they appeal to our finest feelings but they are always vague in that they record no definite thought and speak no downright message  sidenote lanier and whittier  the criticism may be more clear if we compare lanier with whittier a man equally noble who speaks a language that all men understand the poems of the two supplement each other one reflecting the reality of life the other its mysterious dreams in whittiers poetry we look upon a landscape and a people and we say i have seen that rugged landscape with my own eyes i have eaten bread with those people and have understood and loved them then we read laniers poetry and say yes i have had those feelings at times but i do not speak of them to others because i cannot tell what they mean to me both poets are good and both fail of greatness in poetry whittier because he has no exalted imagination lanier because he lacks primitive simplicity and strength one poet sings a song to cheer the days labor the other makes a melody to accompany our twilight reveries                                       walt whitman 18191892  since whitman insisted upon being called walt instead of walter so let it be the name accords with the freeandeasy style of his verse if you can find some abridged selections from that verse read them by all means but if you must search the whole of it for the passages that are worth reading then pass it cheerfully by for such another vain display of egotism vulgarity and rant never appeared under the name of poetry whitman was so absurdly fond of his chants and so ignorant of poetry that he preserved the whole of his work in a final edition and his publishers still insist upon printing it rubbish and all the result is that the few rare verses which stamp him as a poet are apt to be overlooked in the multitudinous gabblings which of themselves might mark him as a mere freak or sensation in our modest literature  illustration walt whitman      biographical sketch ordinarily when we read poetry we desire to     know something of the man who wrote it of his youth his training     the circumstance of his work and the personal ideals which made him     view life steadily in one light rather than in another in dealing     with whitman it is advisable to leave such natural curiosity     unsatisfied and for two reasons first the man was far from     admirable or upright and to meet him at certain stages is to lose     all desire to read his poetry and second he was so extremely     secretive about himself while professing boundless goodfellowship     with all men that we can seldom trust his own record much less     that of his admirers there are great blanks in the story of his     life his real biography has not yet been written and in the     jungle of controversial writings which has grown up around him one     loses sight of whitman in a maze of extravagant or contradictory     opinions footnote of the many biographies of whitman perhaps the     best for beginners is perrys walt whitman 1906 in     american men of letters series      sidenote traits and incidents      let it suffice then to record in catalogue fashion that whitman     was born 1819 on long island of stubborn farmer stock that he     spent his earliest years by the sea which inspired his best verse     that he grew up in the streets of brooklyn and was always     fascinated by the restless tide of city life as reflected in such     poems as crossing brooklyn ferry that his education was scanty     and of the picked up variety that to the end of his life though     ignorant of what literary men regard as the abc of     knowledge he was supremely well satisfied with himself that till     he was past forty he worked irregularly at odd jobs but was by     choice a loafer that he was a man of superb physical health and     gloried in his body without much regard for moral standards that     his strength was broken by nursing wounded soldiers during the war     a beautiful and unselfish service that he was then a government     clerk in washington until partly disabled by a paralytic stroke     and that the remainder of his life was spent at camden new jersey     his leaves of grass published first in 1855 and     republished with additions many times brought him very little     return in money and his last years were spent in a state of     semipoverty relieved by the gifts of a small circle of admirers  whitmans verse in a single book leaves of grass whitman has collected all his verse this book would be a chaos even had he left his works in the order in which they were written but that is precisely what he did not do instead he enlarged and rearranged the work ten different times mixing up his worst and his best verses so that it is now very difficult to trace his development as a poet we may however tentatively arrange his work in three divisions his early shouting to attract attention as summarized in the line i sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world his war poems and his later verse written after he had learned something of the discipline of life and poetry  the quality of his early work may be judged from a few disjointed lines of his characteristic song of myself    has any one supposed it lucky to be born   i hasten to inform him or her that it is just as lucky to die and i know                 it    i pass death with the dying and birth with the newwashd babe and am                 not containd between my hat and boots   and peruse manifold objects no two alike and every one good   the earth good and the stars good and their adjuncts all good    the big doors of the country barn stand open and ready   the dried grass of the harvesttime loads the slowdrawn wagon   the clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged   the armfuls are packd to the sagging mow   i am there i help i came stretchd atop of the load   i felt its soft jolts one leg reclined on the other   i jump from the crossbeams and seize the clover and timothy   and roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps    the boatmen and clamdiggers arose early and stopt for me   i tuckd my trowser ends in my boots and went and had a good time   you should have been with us that day round the chowderkettle  thus he rambles on gabbing of every place or occupation or newspaper report that comes into his head when he ends this grotesque song of myself after a thousand lines or more he makes another just like it we read a few words here and there amazed that any publisher should print such rubbish and then when we are weary of whitmans conceit or bad taste comes a flash of insight of imagination of poetry    afoot and lighthearted i take to the open road   healthy free the world before me   the long brown path before me leading wherever i choose   these yearnings why are they these thoughts in the darkness why are                 they   why are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight                 expands my blood   why when they leave me do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank   why are there trees i never walk under but large and melodious thoughts                 descend upon me  there are in short hundreds of pages of such chanting with its grain of wheat hid in a bushel of chaff we refer to it here not because it is worth reading but to record the curious fact that many european critics hail it as typical american poetry even while we wonder why anybody should regard it as either american or poetic  sidenote foreign opinion  the explanation is simple europeans have not yet rid themselves of the idea that america is the strange wild land coopers pioneers and that any poetry produced here must naturally be uncouth misshapen defiant of all poetic laws or traditions to such critics whitmans crudity seems typical of a country where one is in nightly danger of losing his scalp where arguments are settled by revolvers and where a hungry man needs only to shoot a buffalo or a bear from his back door meanwhile america the country that planted colleges and churches in a wilderness that loves liberty because she honors law that never saw a knight in armor but that has even in her plainsmen and lumberjacks a chivalry for woman that would adorn a bayardthat real america ignores the bulk of whitmans work simply because she knows that of all her poets he is the least representative of her culture her ideals her heroic and aspiring life  sidenote drum taps  the second division of whitmans work is made up chiefly of verses written in war time to some of which he gave the significant title drum taps in such poems as as beat beat drums cavalry crossing a ford and by the bivouacs fitful flame he reflected the emotional excitement of 61 and the stern days that followed note for example the startling vigor of ethiopia saluting the colors which depicts an old negro woman by the roadside looking with wonder on the free flag which she sees for the first time aloft over marching men    who are you dusky woman so ancient hardly human   with your woollywhite and turband head and bare bony feet   why rising by the roadside here do you the colors greet  another side of the war is reflected in such poems as come up from the fields father an exquisite picture of an old mother and father receiving the news of their sons death on the battlefield in the same class belong two fine tributes o captain my captain and when lilacs last in the dooryard bloomed written in moments of noble emotion when the news came that lincoln was dead the former tribute with its rhythmic swing and lyric refrain indicates what whitman might have done in poetry had he been a more patient workman so also does pioneers a lyric that is wholly american and western and exultant         have the elder races halted   do they droop and end their lesson wearied over there beyond the seas   we take up the task eternal and the burden and the lesson        pioneers o pioneers  sidenote later poems  in the third class of whitmans works are the poems written late in life when he had learned to suppress his blatant egotism and to pay some little attention to poetic form and melody though his lines are still crude and irregular many of them move to a powerful rhythm such as the impressive with huskyhaughty lips o sea which suggests the surge and beat of breakers on the shore in others he gives finely imaginative expression to an ideal or a yearning and his verse rises to high poetic levels note this allegory of the spider an insect that when adrift or in a strange place sends out delicate filaments on the air currents until one thread takes hold of some solid substance and is used as a bridge over the unknown    a noiseless patient spider   i markd where on a little promontory it stood isolated   markd how to explore the vacant vast surrounding   it launchd forth filament filament filament out of itself   ever unreeling them ever tirelessly speeding them    and you o my soul where you stand   surrounded detached in measureless oceans of space   ceaselessly musing venturing throwing seeking the spheres to connect                 them   till the bridge you will need be formd till the ductile anchor hold   till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere o my soul  illustration whitmans birthplace west hills long island  among the best of whitmans works are his poems to death joy shipmate joy deaths valley darest thou now o soul last invocation goodbye my fancyin such haunting lyrics he reflects the natural view of death not as a terrible or tragic or final event but as a confident going forth to meet new experiences other notable poems that well repay the reading are the mystic trumpeter the manofwar bird the ox tamer thanks in old age and aboard at a ships helm  in naming the above works our purpose is simply to lure the reader away from the insufferable whitmanesque chant and to attract attention to a few poems that sound a new note in literature a note of freedom of joy of superb confidence which warms the heart when we hear it when these poems are known others will suggest themselves rise o days from your fathomless deeps i hear america singing there was a boy went forth the road unknown out of the cradle endlessly rocking there is magic in such names but unfortunately in most cases the reader will find only an alluring title and a few scattered lines of poetry the rest is whitman  sidenote democracy  the author of the song of myself proclaimed himself the poet of democracy and wrote many verses on his alleged subject but those who read them will soon tire of one whose idea of democracy was that any man is as good as wise as godlike as any other perhaps his best work in this field is thou mother with thy equal brood a patriotic poem read at commencement time in dartmouth college 1872 there is too much of vainglorious boasting in the poem for america should be modest and can afford to be modest but it has enough of prophetic vision and exalted imagination to make us overlook its unworthy spreadeagleism  sidenote prayer of columbus  as a farewell to whitman one should read what is perhaps his noblest single work the prayer of columbus the poem is supposed to reflect the thought of columbus when as a wornout voyager an old man on his last expedition he looked out over his wrecked ships to the lonely sea beyond but the reader may see in it another picture that of a broken old man in his solitary house at camden writing with a trembling hand the lines which reflect his unshaken confidence    my terminus near   the clouds already closing in upon me   the voyage balkd the course disputed lost   i yield my ships to thee   my hands my limbs grow nerveless   my brain feels rackd bewilderd   let the old timbers part i will not part   i will cling fast to thee o god though the waves buffet me   thee thee at least i know    is it the prophets thought i speak or am i raving   what do i know of life what of myself   i know not even my own work past or present   dim evershifting guesses of it spread before me   of newer better worlds their mighty parturition   mocking perplexing me    and these things i see suddenly what mean they   as if some miracle some hand divine unseald my eyes   shadowy vast shapes smile through the air and sky   and on the distant waves sail countless ships   and anthems in new tongues i hear saluting me                                       the prose writers  ralph waldo emerson 18031882  emerson is the mountaineer of our literature to read him is to have the impression of being on the heights it is solitary there far removed from ordinary affairs but the air is keen the outlook grand the heavens near our companions are the familiar earth by day or the mysterious stars by night and these are good if only to recall the silent splendor of gods universe amid the pother of human inventions there also the very spirit of liberty which seems to have its dwelling among the hills enters into us and makes us sympathize with emersons message of individual freedom  it is still a question whether emerson should be classed with the poets or prose writers and our only reason for placing him with the latter is that his nature seems more typical than his wood notes though in truth both works convey precisely the same message he was a great man who used prose or verse as suited his mood at the moment but he was never a great poet and only on rare occasions was he a great prose writer      life emerson has been called the wingéd franklin the yankee     shelley and other contradictory names which strive to express the     union of shrewd sense and lofty idealism that led him to write     hitch your wagon to a star and many another aphorism intended to     bring heaven and earth close together we shall indicate enough of     his inheritance if we call him a puritan of the puritans a     moralist descended from seven generations of heroic ministers who     had helped to make america a free nation and who had practiced the     love of god and man and country before preaching it to their     congregations      illustration ralph waldo emerson      the quality of these ancestors entered into emerson and gave him     the granite steadfastness that is one of his marked     characteristics meeting him in his serene old age one would hardly     suspect him of heroism but to meet him in childhood is to     understand the kind of man he was and must be if you would     appreciate the quality of that childhood picture to yourself a     bare house with an open fire and plenty of books but little else     of comfort there are a mother and six children in the house     desperately poor for the father is dead and has left his family     nothing and everythingnothing that makes life rich everything     in the way of ideals and blessed memories to make life wealthy the     mother works as only a poor woman can from morning till night the     children go to school by day but instead of playing after     schoolhours they run errands for the neighbors drive cows from     pasture shovel snow pick huckleberries earn an honest penny in     the evening they read together before the open fire when they are     hungry as they often are a puritan aunt who shares their poverty     tells them stories of human endurance the circle narrows when an     older brother goes to college the rest reduce their meals and     spare their pennies in order to help him after graduation he     teaches school and devotes his earnings to giving the next brother     his chance all the while they speak courteously to each other     remember their fathers teaching that they are children of god and     view their hard life steadily in the light of that sublime     doctrine      sidenote the college boy      the rest of the story is easily told emerson was born in boston     then a straggling town in 1803 when his turn came he went to     harvard and largely supported himself there by such odd jobs as     only a poor student knows how to find wasted time he called it     for he took little interest in college discipline or college fun     and was given to haphazard reading sinfully strolling from book     to book from care to idleness as he said later he declared that     the only good thing he found in harvard was a solitary chamber      sidenote the preacher      after leaving college he taught school and shared his earnings     according to family tradition then he began to study for the     ministry or perhaps we should say read for emerson never really     studied anything at twentythree he was licensed to preach and     three years later was chosen pastor of the second church in boston     it was the famous old north church in which the mathers had     preached and the puritan divines must have turned in their graves     when the young radical began to utter his heresies from the ancient     pulpit he was loved and trusted by his congregation but presently     he differed with them in the matter of the ritual and resigned his     ministry      next he traveled in europe where he found as little of value as he     had previously found in college the old institutions which roused     the romantic enthusiasm of irving and longfellow were to him only     relics of barbarism he went to europe he said to see two men     and he found them in wordsworth and carlyle his friendship with     the latter and the letters which passed between the sage of     chelsea and the sage of concord as collected and published by     charles eliot norton in his correspondence of carlyle and     emerson are the most interesting result of his pilgrimage      sidenote the lecturer      on his return he settled in the village of concord which was to be     his home for the remainder of his long life he began to lecture     and so well was the lyceum established at that time that he was     soon known throughout the country for forty years this lecturing     continued and the strange thing about it is that in all that time     he hardly met one audience that understood him or that carried away     any definite idea of what he had talked about something noble in     the man seemed to attract people as lowell said they did not go     to hear what emerson said but to hear emerson      sidenote the writer      meanwhile he was writing prose and poetry his literary work began     in college and consisted largely in recording such thoughts or     quotations as seemed worthy of preservation in his private     journal now published in several volumes may be found     practically everything he put into the formal works which he sent     forth from concord these had at first a very small circle of     readers but the circle widened steadily and the phenomenon is     more remarkable in view of the fact that the author avoided     publicity and had no ambition for success he lived contentedly in     a country village he cultivated his garden and his neighbors he     spent long hours alone with nature he wrote the thoughts that came     to him and sent them to make their own way in the world while he     himself remained as he said far from fame behind the birch     trees      the last years of his life were as the twilight of a perfect day     his mental powers failed slowly he seemed to drift out of the     present world into another of pure memories even his friends     became spiritualized lost the appearance of earth and assumed     their eternal semblance when he stood beside the coffin of     longfellow looking intently into the poets face he was heard to     murmur a sweet a gracious personality but i have forgotten his     name to the inevitable changes the last came in 1882 he adapted     himself with the same serenity which marked his whole life he even     smiled as he read the closing lines of his terminus        as the bird trims her to the gale       i trim myself to the storm of time       i man the rudder reef the sail       obey the voice at eve obeyed at prime       lowly faithful banish fear       right onward drive unharmed       the port well worth the cruise is near       and every wave is charmed  emersons poetry there is a ruggedness in emersons verse which attracts some readers while it repels others by its unmelodious rhythm it may help us to measure that verse if we recall the authors criticism thereof in 1839 he wrote      i am naturally keenly susceptible to the pleasures of rhythm and     cannot believe but one day i shall attain to that splendid dialect     so ardent is my wish and these wishes i suppose are ever only     the buds of power but up to this hour i have never had a true     success in such attempts  one must be lenient with a poet who confesses that he cannot attain the splendid dialect especially so since we are inclined to agree with him in the following passage from each and all we may discover the reason for his lack of success    little thinks in the field yon redcloaked clown   of thee from the hilltop looking down   the heifer that lows in the upland farm   farheard lows not thine ear to charm   the sexton tolling his bell at noon   deems not that great napoleon   stops his horse and lists with delight   whilst his files sweep round yon alpine height   nor knowest thou what argument   thy life to thy neighbors creed has lent   all are needed by each one   nothing is fair or good alone   i thought the sparrows note from heaven   singing at dawn on the alder bough   i brought him home in his nest at even   he sings the song but it cheers not now   for i did not bring home the river and sky   he sang to my ear they sang to my eye   the delicate shells lay on the shore   the bubbles of the latest wave   fresh pearls to their enamel gave   and the bellowing of the savage sea   greeted their safe escape to me   i wiped away the weeds and foam   i fetched my seaborn treasures home   but the poor unsightly noisome things   had left their beauty on the shore   with the sun and the sand and the wild uproar  our first criticism is that the poem contains both fine and faulty lines and that the total impression is an excellent one next we note that the verse is labored for emerson was not a natural singer like whittier and was hampered by his tendency to think too much instead of giving free expression to his emotion footnote most good poems are characterized by both thought and feeling and by a perfection of form that indicates artistic workmanship with emerson the thought is the main thing feeling or emotion is subordinate or lacking and he seldom has the patience to work over his thought until it assumes beautiful or perfect expression finally he is didactic that is he is teaching the lesson that you must not judge a thing by itself as if it had no history or connections but must consider it in its environment as a part of its own world  as in each and all so in most of his verse emerson is too much of a teacher or moralist to be a poet in the rhodora one of his most perfect poems he proclaims that beauty is its own excuse for being but straightway he forgets the word and devotes his verse not to beauty but to some ethical lesson very rarely does he break away from this unpoetic habit as when he interrupts the moralizing of his world soul to write a lyric that we welcome for its own sake    spring still makes spring in the mind     when sixty years are told   love wakes anew this throbbing heart     and we are never old   over the winter glaciers     i see the summer glow   and through the widepiled snowdrift     the warm rosebuds below  sidenote typical poems  the most readable of emersons poems are those in which he reflects his impressions of nature such as seashore the humblebee the snowstorm days fable forbearance the titmouse and woodnotes in another class are his philosophical poems devoted to transcendental doctrines the beginner will do well to skip these since they are more of a puzzle than a source of pleasure in a third class are poems of more personal interest such as the noble threnody a poem of grief written after the death of emersons little boy goodbye in which the poet bids farewell to fame as he hies him to the country to ellen which half reveals his love story written in rome which speaks of the society he found in solitude and the concord hymn written at the dedication of battle monument with its striking opening lines    by the rude bridge that arched the flood     their flag to aprils breeze unfurled   here once the embattled farmers stood     and fired the shot heard round the world  prose works perhaps the most typical of emersons prose works is his first book to which he gave the name nature 1836 in this he records not his impressions of bird or beast or flower as his neighbor thoreau was doing in walden but rather his philosophy of the universe nature always wears the colors of the spirit every animal function from the sponge up to hercules shall hint or thunder to man the laws of right and wrong and echo the ten commandments the foundations of man are not in matter but in spirit and the element of spirit is eternityscores of such expressions indicate that emerson deals with the soul of things not with their outward appearance does a flower appeal to him its scientific name and classification are of no consequence like wordsworth he would understand what thought of god the flower speaks to him nature is a mirror in which the almighty reflects his thought again it is a parable a little story written in trees or hills or stars frequently it is a living presence speaking melodiously in winds or waters and always it is an inspiration to learn wisdom at first hand      our age is retrospective it builds the sepulchres of the fathers     it writes biographies histories criticisms the foregoing     generations beheld god and nature face to face we through their     eyes why should not we also enjoy an original relation to the     universe why should not we have a poetry and philosophy of     insight and not of tradition  the last quotation might well be an introduction to emersons second work the american scholar 1837 which was a plea for laying aside european models and fronting life as free men in a new world holmes called this work our intellectual declaration of independence and it was followed by a succession of volumesessays representative men conduct of life society and solitude and several othersall devoted to the same two doctrines of idealism and individuality  sidenote representative men  among these prose works the reader must make his own selection all are worth reading none is easy to read even the best of them is better appreciated in brief instalments since few can follow emerson long without wearying english traits is a keen but kindly criticism of our cousins overseas which an american can read with more pleasure than an englishman representative men is a series of essays on plato shakespeare napoleon and other world figures which may well be read in connection with carlyles heroes and hero worship since the two books reflect the same subject from widely different angles carlyle was in theory an aristocrat and a forceworshiper emerson a democrat and a believer in ideals one author would relate us to his heroes in the attitude of slave to master the other in the relation of brothers and equals  sidenote the essays  of the shorter prose works collected in various volumes of essays we shall name only a few in two main groups which we may call the ideal and the practical in the first group are such typical works as the oversoul compensation spiritual laws and history in the latter are heroism selfreliance literary ethics an address to young collegians character and manners  it is difficult to criticize such writings which have a daring originality of thought and a springlike freshness of expression that set them apart from all other essays ancient or modern they are the most quotable the fittest to point a moral or adorn a tale that have ever appeared in our literature but they are also disjointed oracular hard to follow and the explanation is found in the manner of their production when emerson projected a new lecture or essay he never thought his subject out or ordered it from beginning to end that would have been another mans way of doing it he collected from his notebooks such thoughts as seemed to bear upon his subject strung them together and made an end when he had enough the connection or relation between his thoughts is always frail and often invisible some compare it with the thread which holds the pearls of a necklace together others quote with a smile the epigram of goldwin smith who said that he found an emersonian essay about as coherent as a bag of marbles and that suggests a fair criticism of all emersons prose namely that it is a series of expressions excellent in themselves but having so little logical sequence that a paragraph from one essay may be placed at the beginning middle or end of any other where it seems to be equally at home  the doctrine of emerson since we constantly hear of idealism in connection with emerson let us understand the word if we can or rather the fact for idealism is the most significant quality of humanity the term will be better understood if we place it beside materialism which expresses an opposite view of life the difference may be summarized in the statement that the idealist is a man of spirit or idea in that he trusts the evidence of the soul while the materialist is a man of flesh or sense in that he believes only what is evident to the senses one judges the world by himself the other judges himself by the world  to illustrate our meaning the materialist looking outward sees that the world is made up of forcedriven matter of gas carbon and mineral and he says even so am i made up he studies an object sees that it has its appointed cycle of growth and decay and concludes even so do i appear and vanish to him the world is the only reality and the world perishes and man is but a part of the world  sidenote the idealist  the idealist looking first within perceives that selfconsciousness is the great fact of life and that consciousness expresses itself in words or deeds then he looks outward and is aware of another consciousness that expresses itself in the lowly grass or in the stars of heaven looking inward he finds that he is governed by ideas of truth beauty goodness and duty looking outward he everywhere finds evidence of truth and beauty and moral law in the world he sees moreover that while his body changes constantly his self remains the same yesterday today and forever and again his discovery is a guide to the outer world with its seedtime and harvest which is but the symbol or garment of a divine self that abides without shadow of change in a constantly changing universe to him the only reality is spirit and spirit cannot be harmed by fire or flood neither can it die or be buried for it is immortal and imperishable  such in simple words was the idealism of emerson an idealism that was born in him and that governed him long before he became involved in transcendentalism with its scraps of borrowed hindu philosophy it gave message or meaning to his first work nature and to all the subsequent essays or poems in which he pictured the world as a symbol or visible expression of a spiritual reality in other words nature was to emerson the book of the lord and the chief thing of interest was not the book but the idea that was written therein  sidenote the individualist  having read the universe and determined its spiritual quality emerson turned his eyes on humanity presently he announced that a mans chief glory is his individuality that he is a free being different from every other that his business is to obey his individual genius that he should therefore ignore the past with its traditions and learn directly from the divine soul which inspires all men having announced that doctrine he spent the rest of his life in illustrating or enlarging it and the sum of his teaching was do not follow me or any other master follow your own spirit never mind what history says or philosophy or tradition or the saints and sages the same inspiration which led the prophets is yours for the taking and you have your work to do as they had theirs revere your own soul trust your intuition and whatever you find in your heart to do do it without doubt or fear though all the world thunder in your ears that you must do otherwise as for the voice of authority let not a man quit his belief that a popgun is a popgun though the anointed and honorable of the earth affirm it to be the crack of doom  illustration emersons home concord  such was emersons pet doctrine of individualism it appeared with startling vigor in the american scholar at a time when our writers were prone to imitate english poetry german sentimentality or some other imported product it came also with good grace from one whose life was noble but it had a weak or dangerous or grotesque side that emerson overlooked thus every crank or fanatic or rainbowchaser is also an individualist and most of them believe as strongly as emerson in the oversoul the only difference is that they do not have his sense or integrity or humor to balance their individualism while emerson exalted individual liberty he seemed to forget that america is a country devoted to liberty under law and that at every period of her history she has had need to emphasize the law rather than the liberty moreover individualism is a quality that takes care of itself being finest in one who is least conscious of his own importance and to study any strongly individual character a washington or a lincoln for example is to discover that he strove to be true to his race and traditions as well as to himself hence emersons doctrine to live in the present and have entire confidence in yourself needs to be supplemented by another to revere the past with its immortal heroes who by their labor and triumph have established some truths that no sane man will ever question  sidenote a new world writer  there are other interesting qualities of emerson his splendid optimism for instance which came partly from his spiritual view of the universe and partly from his association with nature for the writer who is in daily contact with sunshine or rain and who trusts his souls ideals of truth and beauty has no place for pessimism or despair even in moments of darkness he looks upward and reads his lesson    teach me your mood o patient stars     who climb each night the ancient sky   leaving on space no shade no scars     no trace of age no fear to die  though he was and still is called a visionary there is a practical quality in his writing which is better than anything you will find in poor richards almanac thus the burden of franklins teaching was the value of time a lesson which the sage of concord illuminates as with celestial light in his poem days and to which he brings earths candle in his prose essay work and days footnote the two works should be read in connection as an interesting example of emersons use of prose and verse to reflect the same idea holmes selects the same two works to illustrate the essential difference between prose and poetry see holmes ralph waldo emerson p 310 indeed the more one reads emerson the more is one convinced that he is our typical new world writer a rare genius who combines the best qualities of franklin and edwards having the practical sense of the one and the spiritual insight of the other footnote in 1830 channing published an essay national literature in which he said that benjamin franklin and jonathan edwards were the only writers up to that time who had worthily presented the american mind with its practical and ideal sides to foreign readers with his idealism and individuality his imagination that soars to heaven but is equally at home on solid earth his sound judgment to balance his mysticism his forceful style that runs from epigram to sustained eloquence his straightfibered manhood in which criticism finds nothing to pardon or regretwith all these sterling qualities he is one of the most representative writers that america has ever produced                                       nathaniel hawthorne 18041864  some great writers belong to humanity others to their own land or people hawthorne is in the latter class apparently for ever since lowell rashly characterized him as the greatest imaginative genius since shakespeare our critics commonly speak of him in superlatives meanwhile most european critics who acclaim such unequal writers as cooper and poe whitman and mark twain either leave hawthorne unread or else wonder what americans find in him to stir their enthusiasm  the explanation is that hawthornes field was so intensely local that only those who are familiar with it can appreciate him almost any reader can enjoy cooper since he deals with adventurous men whom everybody understands but hawthorne deals with the new england puritan of the seventeenth century a very peculiar hero and to enjoy the novelist one must have some personal or historic interest in his subject moreover he alienates many readers by presenting only the darker side of puritanism he is a man who never laughs and seldom smiles in his work he passes over a hundred normal and therefore cheerful homes to pitch upon some gloomy habitation of sin or remorse and makes that the burden of his tale in no other romancer do we find genius of such high order at work in so barren a field      life there is an air of reserve about hawthorne which no biography     has ever penetrated a schoolmate who met him daily once said i     love hawthorne i admire him but i do not know him he lives in a     mysterious world of thought and imagination which he never permits     me to enter that characterization applies as well today as when     it was first spoken almost a century ago to his family and to a     very few friends hawthorne was evidently a genial man footnote     intimate but hardly trustworthy pictures of hawthorne and his     family are presented by his son julian hawthorne in nathaniel     hawthorne and his wife a dozen other memoirs have appeared     but hawthorne did not want his biography written and there are     many unanswered questions in the story of his life but from the     world and its affairs he always held aloof wrapped in his mantle     of mystery      a study of his childhood may help us to understand the somber     quality of all his work he was descended from the puritans who     came to boston with john winthrop and was born in the seaport of     salem massachusetts in 1804 he was only four years old when his     father a sea captain died in a foreign port whereupon the mother     draped herself in weeds retired from the sight of neighbors and     for the next forty years made life as funereal as possible besides     the little boy there were two sisters in the family and the elder     took her meals in her own room as did the mother the others went     about the darkened house on tiptoe or peeped out at the world     through closed shutters      illustration nathaniel hawthorne      the shadow of that unnatural home was upon hawthorne to the end of     his life it accounts in part for his shyness his fear of society     his lack of interest in his own age or nation      sidenote seclusion at salem      at seventeen hawthorne went to bowdoin college where longfellow     was his classmate and franklin pierce later president of the     united states one of his friends his college life seems to have     been happy even gay at times but when he graduated 1825 and his     classmates scattered to find work in the world he returned to his     salem home and secluded himself as if he had no interest in     humanity it was doubtful he said afterwards whether a dozen     people knew of his existence in as many years      all the while he was writing gathering material for his romances     or patiently cultivating his fine style for days he would brood     over a subject then he would compose a story or parable for the     magazines the stamp of originality was on all these works but     they were seldom accepted when they returned to him having found     no appreciative editor he was apt to burn them and complain that     he was neglected studying the man as he reveals himself at this     time in his notebooks published in a garbled edition by     the hawthorne family one has the impression that he was a shy     sensitive genius almost morbidly afraid of the world from a     distance he sent out his stories as feelers when these were     ignored he shrank into himself more deeply than before      illustration old customhouse boston     where hawthorne worked      love brought him out of his retreat as it has accomplished many     another miracle when he became engaged his immediate thought was     to find work and one of his friends secured a position for him in     the boston customhouse where he weighed coal until he was replaced     by a party spoilsman footnote hawthorne profited three times by     the spoils system when his boston experience was repeated at salem     he took his revenge in the opening chapter of the scarlet     letter which ridicules those who received political jobs from     the other party there were no civilservice rules in those days     hoping to secure a home he invested his savings in brook farm     worked there for a time with the reformers detested them lost his     money and gained the experience which he used later in his     blithedale romance then he married and lived in poverty     and great happiness for four years in the old manse at concord     another friend obtained for him political appointment as surveyor     of the salem customhouse again he was replaced by a spoilsman and     again he complained bitterly the loss proved a blessing however     since it gave him leisure to write the scarlet letter a     novel which immediately placed hawthorne in the front rank of     american writers      sidenote farewell greatness      he was now before an appreciative world and in the flush of fine     feeling that followed his triumph he wrote the house of the     seven gables a wonder book and the snow image     literature was calling him most hopefully when at the very prime     of life he turned his back on fortune his friend pierce had been     nominated by the democrats 1852 and he was asked to write the     candidates biography for campaign purposes it was hardly a worthy     task but he accepted it and did it well when pierce was elected     he persuaded hawthorne to accept the office of consul at     liverpool the emoluments some seven thousand dollars a year     seemed enormous to one who had lived straitly and in the four     years of pierces administration our novelist saved a sum which     with the income from his books placed him above the fear of want     then he went for a long vacation to italy where he collected the     material for his marble faun but he wrote nothing more of     consequence      sidenote the unfinished story      the remainder of his life was passed in a pleasant kind of     hermitage in emersons village of concord his habits of solitude     and idleness cursed habits he called them were again upon him     though he began several romancesdr grimshawes secret     septimius felton the ancestral footstep and the     dolliver romancehe never made an end of them in his work he     was prone to use some symbol of human ambition and the symbol of     his own later years might well have been the unfinished manuscript     which lay upon the coffin when his body was laid under the pines in     the old concord burying ground 1864 his friend longfellow has     described the scene in his beautiful poem hawthorne  short stories and sketches many young people become familiar with hawthorne as a teller of bedtime stories long before they meet him in the role of famous novelist in his earlier days he wrote grandfathers chair modeled on a similar work by scott dealing with colonial legends and broadened his field in biographical stories for children other and better works belonging to the same juvenile class are a wonder book 1851 and tanglewood tales 1853 which are modern versions of the classic myths and stories that greek mothers used to tell their children long ago  sidenote pictures of the past  the best of hawthornes original stories are collected in twicetold tales mosses from an old manse and the snow image and other twicetold tales as the bulk of this work is rather depressing we select a few typical tales arranging them in three groups in the first are certain sketches as hawthorne called them which aim not to tell a story but to give an impression of the past the old manse in mosses from an old manse is an excellent introduction to this group others in which the author comes out from the gloom to give his humor a glimpse of pale sunshine are a rill from the town pump main street little annies ramble sights from a steeple and as suggestive of hawthornes solitary outings footprints on the seashore  sidenote allegories  in the second group are numerous allegories and symbolical stories to understand hawthornes method of allegory footnote an allegory is a figure of speech in rhetoric or a story in literature in which an external object is described in such a way that we apply the description to our own inner experience many proverbs such as people who live in glass houses should not throw stones are condensed allegories so also are fables and parables such as the fable of the fox and the grapes or the parable of the lost sheep bunyans famous allegory the pilgrims progress describes a journey from one city to another but in reading it we are supposed to think of a christians experience in passing through this world to the next read the snow image which is the story of a snowy figure that became warm living and companionable to some children until it was spoiled by a hardheaded person without imagination or real sense who forgot that he was ever a child himself or that there is such a beautiful and precious thing as a childview of the universe  in his constant symbolism that is in his use of an outward sign or token to represent an idea hawthorne reflected a trait that is common to humanity in all ages thus every nation has its concrete symbol its flag or eagle or lion a great religion is represented by a cross or a crescent in art and poetry the sword stands for war and the dove for peace an individual has his horseshoe or rabbits foot or mascot as the simple expression of an idea that may be too complex for words among primitive people such symbols were associated with charms magic baleful or benignant influences and hawthorne accepted this superstitious idea in many of his works though he was apt to hint as in lady eleanors mantle that the magic of his symbol might have a practical explanation in this story the ladys gorgeous mantle is a symbol of pride its blighting influence may be due to the fact thatbut to tell the secret is to spoil the story and that is not fair to hawthorne or the reader  sidenote the black veil  some of these symbolic tales are too vague or shadowy to be convincing in others the author makes artistic use of some simple object such as a flower or an ornament to suggest the mystery that broods over every life in the ministers black veil for example a clergyman startles his congregation by appearing with a dark veil over his face the veil itself is a familiar object on a woman or a bonnet it would pass unnoticed but on the minister it becomes a portentous thing at once fascinating and repellent yesterday they knew the man as a familiar friend today he is a stranger and they fear him with a vague nameless fear forty years he wears the mysterious thing dies and is buried with it and in all that time they never have a glimpse of his face though there is a deal of nonsense in the story and a hocuspocus instead of a mystery we must remember that veil as a striking symbol of the loneliness of life of the gulf that separates a human soul from every other  another and better symbolic tale is the great stone face which appeals strongly to younger readers especially to those who have lived much out of doors and who cherish the memory of some natural object some noble tree or mossy cliff or singing brook that is forever associated with their thoughts of childhood to others the tale will have added interest in that it is supposed to portray the character of emerson as hawthorne knew him  sidenote legendary tales  in the third group are numerous stories dealing with colonial history and of these the gray champion and the gentle boy are fairly typical hawthorne has been highly praised in connection with these tales as the artist who created the puritan in literature most readers will gladly recognize the artist since every tale has its line or passage of beauty but some will murmur at the creation the trouble with hawthorne was that in creating his puritan he took scant heed of the man whom the almighty created he was not a scholar or even a reader his custom was to brood over an incident of the past often a grotesque incident such as he found in winthrops old journal and from his brooding he produced an imaginary character some heartless fanatic or dismal wretch who had nothing of the puritan except the label of the real puritan who knew the joy and courtesy as well as the stern discipline of life our novelist had only the haziest notion in consequence his gentle boy and parts also of his scarlet letter leave an unwarranted stain on the memory of his ancestors footnote occasionally as in the gray champion and endicott and the red cross hawthorne paints the stern courage of the puritan but never his gentle or humane qualities his typical tale presents the puritan in the most unlovely guise in the maypole of merrymount for example morton and his men are represented as inoffensive artloving people who were terrorized by the dismal wretches of a nearby colony of puritans nothing could be farther from the truth mortons crew were a lawless set and a scandal to new england but they were tolerated until they put all the settlements in danger by debauching the indians and selling them rum muskets and gunpowder the dismal wretches were the pilgrims of plymouthgentle heroic men lovers of learning and liberty who profoundly influenced the whole subsequent history of america  the four romances the romances of hawthorne are all studies of the effects of sin on human development if but one of these romances is to be read let it be the house of the seven gables 1851 which is a pleasanter story than hawthorne commonly tells and which portrays one character that he knew by experience rather than by imagination many of hawthornes stories run to a text and the text here is the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the childrens teeth are set on edge the characters are represented as under a curse foonote this is a reflection of a family tradition an ancestor of hawthorne was judge at the salem witch trials in 1692 one of the poor creatures condemned to death is said to have left a curse on the judges family in his note books hawthorne makes mention of the traditional curse and analyzes its possible effect on his own character that is they are bearing the burden and sorrow of some old iniquity committed before they were born but the affliction is banished in a satisfactory way without leaving us in the haze of mystery that envelops so much of hawthornes work his humor is also in evidence his interest in life overcomes for a time his absorption in shadowy symbols and his whole story is brightened by his evident love of phoebe pyncheon the most natural and winsome of all his characters  illustration the house of seven gables salem built in 1669  the other romances deal with the same general theme the blighting effect of sin but vary greatly in their scenes and characters the marble faun published in england as transformation 1860 is the most popular possibly because its scene is laid in rome a city to which all travelers go or aspire to go before they die but though it moves in an atmosphere of art among the studios of the eternal city it is the least artistic of all the authors works footnote the marble faun ends in a fog as if the author did not know what to do with his characters it has the amateurish fault of halting the narrative to talk with the reader and it moralizes to such an extent that the heroine who is pictured as of almost angelic virtue eventually becomes a prig and a preachertwo things that a woman must never be nevertheless the romance has a host of enthusiastic readers and to criticize it adversely is to bring a storm about ones ears in the blithedale romance 1852 hawthorne deals with the present rather than the past and apparently makes use of his observation since his scenes and characters are strongly suggestive of the brook farm community of reformers among whom he spent one critical and unhappy year the scarlet letter 1850 is not only the most original and powerful of the romances but is commonly ranked by our critics at the head of american fiction the scene is laid in boston in the old puritan days the main characters are vividly drawn and the plot moves to its gloomy but impressive climax as if wyrd or fate were at the bottom of it  characteristics of hawthorne almost the first thing we notice in hawthorne is his style a smooth leisurely classic style which moves along like a meadow brook without hurry or exertion gradually as we read we become conscious of the novelists characters whom he introduces with a veil of mystery around them they are interesting as dreams and other mysterious things always are but they are seldom real or natural or lifelike at times we seem to be watching a pantomime of shadows rather than a drama of living men and women  sidenote method of work  the explanation of these shadowy characters is found in hawthornes method of work as revealed by the notebooks in which he stored his material here is a typical record which was occasioned no doubt by the authors meeting with some old nurse whom he straightway changed from her real semblance to a walking allegory      change from a gay young girl to an old woman melancholy events     the effects of which have clustered around her character     becomes a lover of sick chambers taking pleasure in receiving     dying breaths and laying out the dead having her mind full of     funeral reminiscences and possessing more acquaintances beneath     the turf than above it  this is enough of a story in itself we need not read edward fanes rosebud to see how hawthorne filled in the details the strange thing is that he never studied or questioned the poor woman to discover whether she was anything like what he imagined her to be on another page we read      a snake taken into a mans stomach and nourished there from     fifteen to thirty five years tormenting him most horribly then     follows the inevitable moral type of envy or some other evil     passion  illustration hawthornes birthplace salem massachusetts  there are many such storyrecords in the notebooks but among them you will find no indication that the storyteller ever examined the facts with a purpose to discover whether a snake could survive thirtyfive years or minutes in the acids of a human stomach or how long a puritan church would tolerate a minister who went about with a veil on his face or whether any other of his symbols had any vital connection with human experience in a word hawthorne was prone to make life conform to his imagination instead of making his imagination conform to life living as he did in the twilight between the day and the night he seems to have missed the chief lesson of each the urge of the one and the repose of the other and especially did he miss the great fact of cheerfulness the deathless courage of man his invincible hope that springs to life under the most adverse circumstances like the cyclamen abloom under the snows of winterthis primal and blessed fact seems to have escaped his notice at times he hints at it but he never gives it its true place at the beginning middle and end of human life  sidenote artist and moralist  thus far our analysis has been largely negative and hawthorne was a very positive character he had the feeling of an artist for beauty and he was one of the few romancers who combine a strong sense of art with a puritanic devotion to conscience and the moral law hence his stories all aim to be both artistic and ethical to satisfy our sense of beauty and our sense of right in his constant moralizing he was like george eliot or rather to give the figure its proper sequence george eliot was so exclusively a moralist after the hawthornesque manner that one suspects she must have been familiar with his work when she began to write both novelists worked on the assumption that the moral law is the basis of human life and that every sin brings its inevitable retribution the chief difference was that hawthorne started with a moral principle and invented characters to match it while george eliot started with a human character in whose experience she revealed the unfolding of a moral principle  sidenote a solitary genius  the individuality of hawthorne becomes apparent when we attempt to classify hima vain attempt since there is no other like him in literature in dealing with almost any other novelist we can name his models or at least point out the storytellers whose methods influenced his work but hawthorne seems to have had no predecessor subject style and method were all his own developed during his long seclusion at salem and from them he never varied from his twicetold tales to his unfinished dolliver romance he held steadily to the purpose of portraying the moral law against a background of puritan history  such a field would have seemed very narrow to other american writers who then as now were busy with things too many or things too new but to hawthorne it was a world in itself a world that lured him as the indies lured columbus in imagination he dwelt in that somber puritan world eating at its longvanished tables or warming himself at its burntout fires until the impulse came to reproduce it in literature and he did reproduce it powerfully singleheartedly as only genius could have done it that his portrayal was inaccurate is perhaps a minor consideration for one writer must depict life as he meets it on the street or in books while another is confined to what ezekiel calls the chambers of imagery hawthornes liberties with the facts may be pardoned on the ground that he was not an historian but an artist the historian tells what life has accomplished the artist what life means                                       secondary writers of prose or verse  the poets among the fifty or more poets of the period of conflict henry timrod paul hamilton hayne and abram j ryan are notable for this reason that their fame once local seems to widen with the years they are commonly grouped as southern poets because of the war lyrics in which they voiced the passionate devotion of the south to its leaders but what makes them now interesting to a larger circle of readers are their poems of an entirely different kindpoems that reflect in a tender and beautiful way the common emotions of men in all places and in all ages two other prominent singers of the southern school are theodore ohara and james ryder randall  illustration henry timrod  in another group are such varied singers as richard henry stoddard george h boker henry howard brownell thomas b read john g saxe j g holland and bayard taylor these were all famous poets in their own day and some of them were prolific writers holland and taylor especially the latter produced thirty volumes of poems essays novels and sketches of travel but with the exception of his fine translation of goethes faust and a few of his original lyrics the works which he sent forth so abundantly are now neglected he is typical of a hundred writers who answer the appeal of today and win its applause and who are forgotten when tomorrow comes with its new interests and its new favorites  illustration paul hamilton hayne  fiction writers comparatively few novels were written during this period perhaps because the terrible shadow of war was over the country and readers were in no mood for fiction the most popular romance of the age and one of the most widely read books that america has ever produced was uncle toms cabin 1852 which has been translated and dramatized into so many tongues that it is known all over the earth the author harriet beecher stowe 18111896 wrote several other stories all characterized by humor kindness and intense moral earnestness some of these such as oldtown folks the ministers wooing the pearl of orrs island and oldtown fireside stories have decidedly more literary charm than her famous story of slavery  illustration harriet beecher stowe  sidenote tales of the sea  the midcentury produced some very good sea stories and in these we see the influence of cooper who was the first to use the ocean successfully as a scene of romantic interest danas two years before the mast 1840 was immensely popular when our fathers were boys it contained moreover such realistic pictures of sailor life that it was studied by aspirants for the british and american navies in the days when the flag rippled proudly over the beautiful old sailing ships this excellent book is largely a record of personal experience but in the tales of herman melville 18191891 we have the added elements of imagination and adventure typee white jacket moby dickthese are capital tales of the deep the lastnamed especially  typee a story well known to stevenson evidently is remarkable for its graphic pictures of sailor life afloat and ashore in the marquesas islands a new field in those days the narrative is continued in white jacket which tells of the return from the south pacific aboard a manofwar in moby dick we have the real experience of a sailorman and whaler melville himself and the fictitious wanderings of a stout captain a primeval kind of person who is at times an interesting lunatic and again a ranting philosopher in the latter we have an echo of carlyle who was making a stir in america in 1850 and who affected melville so strongly that the latter soon lost his bluff hearty sailor fashion of writing which everybody liked and assumed a crotchety style that nobody cared to read  sidenote from romance to realism  a few other novels of the period are interesting as showing the sudden change from romance to realism a change for which the war was partly responsible and which will be examined more closely in the following chapter john esten cooke 18301886 may serve as a concrete example of the two types of fiction in his earlier romances notably in leather stocking and silk and the virginia comedians 1854 he aimed to do for the cavalier society of the south what hawthorne was doing for the old puritan régime in new england but his later stories such as surrey of eagles nest are chiefly notable for their realistic pictures of the great war  illustration john esten cooke  the change from romance to realism is more openly apparent in theodore winthrop and edward eggleston whose novels deal frankly with pioneers of the middle west not such pioneers as cooper had imagined in the prairie but such plain men and women as one might meet anywhere beyond the alleghenies in 1850 winthrops john brent 1862 and egglestons the hoosier schoolmaster and the circuit rider 1874 are so true to a real phase of american life that a thoughtful reader must wonder why they are not better known they are certainly refreshing to one who tires of our present socalled realism with its abnormal or degenerate characters  more widely read than any of the novelists just mentioned are certain others who appeared in answer to the increasing demand of young people for a good story it is doubtful if any american writer great or small has given more pleasure to young readers than louisa m alcott with her little women 1868 and other stories for girls or john t trowbridge author of cudjos cave jack hazard a chance for himself and several other juveniles that once numbered their boy readers by tens of thousands  illustration louisa m alcott  thoreau among the many secondary writers of the period the most original and most neglected was henry d thoreau 18171862 a man who differed greatly from other mortals in almost every respect but chiefly in this that he never was known to go with the crowd not even on the rare occasions when he believed the crowd to be right he was one of the few persons who select their own way through life and follow it without the slightest regard for the worlds opinion  numerous examples of thoreaus oddity might be given but we note here only his strange determination to view life with his own eyes this may appear a simple matter until we reflect that most men measure life by what others have said or written concerning lifes values they accept the standards of their ancestors or their neighbors they conform themselves to a world in which governments and other longestablished institutions claim their allegiance they are trained to win success in such a world by doing one thing well and to measure their success by the fame or money or office or social position which they achieve by a lifetime of labor and selfdenial  illustration henry d thoreau  sidenote his originality  thoreau sharply challenged this whole conception of life which he said was more a matter of habit than of reason or conviction he saw in our social institutions as much of harm as of benefit to the individual he looked with distrust on all traditions saying that he had listened for thirty years without hearing one word of sound advice from his elders he was a good workman and learned to do several things passing well but he saw no reason why a free man should repeat himself daily in a world of infinite opportunities also he was a scholar versed in classical lore and widely read in oriental literature but unlike his friend emerson he seldom quoted the ancients being more concerned with his own thoughts of life than by the words of philosophers and more fascinated by the wild birds that ate crumbs from his table than by all the fabled gods of mythology as for success the fame or money for which other men toiled seemed to him but empty bubbles the only wealth he prized was his souls increase in love and understanding if the day and the night are such that you greet them with joy and life emits a fragrance like sweetscented herbsis more elastic starry and immortalthat is your success  sidenote walden  there are other interesting matters in thoreaus philosophy but these will appear plainly enough to one who reads his own record his bestknown work is walden 1854 a journal in which he recorded what he saw or thought or felt during the two years when he abandoned society to live in a hut on the shore of walden pond near his native village of concord if there be any definite lesson in the book it is the proof of thoreaus theory that simplicity is needed for happiness that men would be better off with fewer possessions and that earning ones living should be a matter of pleasure rather than of endless toil and anxiety what makes walden valuable however is not its theories but its revelation of an original mind fronting the facts of life its gleams of poetry and philosophy its startling paradoxes its firsthand impressions of the world its nuggets of sense or humor and especially its intimate observation of the little wild neighbors in feathers or fur who shared thoreaus solitude it is one of the few books in american literature that successive generations have read with profit to themselves and with increasing respect for the original genius who wrote it  the historians the honored names of bancroft sparks prescott motley and parkman are indicative of the importance attached to historywriting in america ever since colonial days and of the remarkably fine and sometimes heroic quality of american historians another matter suggested by these names is the changing standard or ideal of historical writing in an earlier time history was a dry chronicle of important events or of such events as seemed important to the chronicler at the present day it threatens to degenerate into an equally dry chronicle of economic forces and between these thirsty extremes are various highly colored records glorifying kings or conquerors or political parties as the chief things of history  sidenote the epic of history  these american historians had a different standard they first consulted all available records to be sure of the facts or events then they closely examined the scene in which the event had come to pass knowing that environment is always a factor in human history finally they studied historical personages not as others had described them but as they revealed themselves in letters diaries speechespersonal records revealing human motives that all men understand because man is everywhere the same from such a combination of event scene and characters our historians wrote a dramatic narrative giving it the heroic cast without which history the prose epic of liberty is little better than a dull catalogue another very important matter was that they cultivated their style as well as their knowledge they were literary men no less than historians and in the conviction that the first object of literature is to give pleasure they produced works that have charmed as well as instructed a multitude of readers there are chapters in prescotts conquest of mexico and conquest of peru over which one must sit up late as over a novel of scott in motleys rise of the dutch republic and history of the united netherlands there are scores of glowing passages dealing with great characters or great events which stir the reader like a tale of gallant adventure  prescott deals with force in action and the action at times seems to be an exaltation of violence and cruelty motley also delights in action but he is at heart an apostle of liberty or perhaps we should say of the american ideal of liberty and his narrative often assumes the character of a partisan chant of freedom  sidenote parkman  to the native at least francis parkman 18231893 is probably the most interesting of our historians partly because of his lucid style and partly because of his american theme early in life he selected his subject the old french wars and spent the best part of forty years in making himself familiar not only with what occurred during the struggle between france and england for possession of the new world but also with the primeval scene and all the motley characters of the fateful drama it is doubtful if any other historian ever had a more minute knowledge of his subject and the astonishing the heroic part of the matter is that he attained this vast knowledge in spite of the handicap of almost constant suffering and blindness in a dozen volumes he tells his story volumes crowded with action or adventure and written in such a vividly convincing style that one has the impression that parkman must have been an eyewitness of the events which he describes  illustration francis parkman  among these volumes the second part of pioneers of france in the new world and la salle and the discovery of the great west are recommended to the beginner the former deals with the career of champlain who opened the way for future settlements in the north the latter with one of the most adventurous lionhearted men that ever cheerfully faced toil and endless danger standing apart from parkmans main theme is a single volume the california and oregon trail 1849 which recounts the picturesque incidents of the authors trip through the northwest then an unknown country with a tribe of unspoiled indians those who like a tale of adventure need not go to fiction to find it for it is here in parkmans narrativea tale of carefree wandering amid plains or mountains and what is historically more important a picture of a vanished life that will never be seen here again                                           summary the period of conflict has no definite limits on either     side but for convenience we may think of it as included between     the years 1840 and 1876 its earlier years were filled with an     everincreasing agitation of the questions of slavery and state     rights its center was the civil war its close was the centennial     exposition at philadelphia which we have selected as an outward     symbol of a reunited country      the most noticeable feature of the age apart from the great war     was its ceaseless political turmoil of deeper significance to the     student of literature was the profound mental unrest which showed     itself in reform movements in various communistic societies like     brook farm in an eager interest in the poetry of other nations in     the establishment of college professorships of foreign literatures     in the philosophical doctrine of transcendentalism and in many     other efforts of midcentury americans to enlarge their mental     horizon      a host of minor writings of the period reflect the sectional     passions or interests that stirred our people deeply at the time     but that are now almost forgotten the comparatively small body of     major literature was concerned with the permanent ideals of america     or with the simple human feelings that have no age or nationality     in general it was a time of poetry rather than of prose being     distinguished above all other periods of american literature by the     number and quality of its poets      our detailed study of the age

rest   for thee the future                                          whitman thou mother   some critics find little or no american literature of a distinctly national spirit prior to 1876 and they explain the lack of it on the assumption that americans were too far apart and too much occupied with local or sectional interests for any author to represent the nation it was even said at the time of the centennial exposition that our countrymen had never met save on the battlefields of the civil war until the common interest in jubilee year drew men and women from the four quarters of america around the old family altar at philadelphia whatever exaggeration there may be in that fine poetic figure it is certain that our literature once confined to a few schools or centers began in the decade after 1870 to be broadly representative of the whole country millers songs of the sierras hays pikecounty ballads hartes tales of the argonauts cables old creole days mark twains tom sawyer miss jewetts deephaven stocktons rudder grange harriss uncle remusa host of surprising books suddenly appeared with the announcement that america was too large for any one man or literary school to be its spokesman it is because of these new voices coming from north south east or west and heard with delight by the whole nation that we venture to call the years after 1876 the allamerica period of our literature  sidenote contemporary history  we are still too near that period to make a history of it for the simple reason that a true history implies distance and perspective no historian could read much less measure and compare a tenth part of the books that have won recognition since 1876 in such works as he might select as typical he must be governed by his own taste or judgment and the writer was never born who could by such personal standards forecast the judgment of time and of humanity in a word contemporary or uptodate histories are vain attempts at the impossible save in the unimportant matter of chronicling names or dates they are all alike untrustworthy the student should bear in mind therefore that the following summary of our recent literature is based largely upon personal opinion that it selects a few authors by way of illustration omitting many others who may be of equal or greater importance we are confronted by a host of books that serve the prime purpose of literature by giving pleasure but what proportion of them are enduring books or what few of them will be known to readers of the next century as the sketch book and snowbound are known to usthese are questions that only father time can answer  the short story the period after 1876 has been called the age of fiction but the shortstory age might be a better name for it since the short story is apparently more popular than any other form of literature and since it has been developed here more abundantly than in any other landpossibly because america offers such an immense and eversurprising field to an author in search of a strange or picturesque tale readers of the short story demand life and variety and here are all races and tribes and conditions of men living in all kinds of atmosphere from the trappers hut to the steel skyscraper and from the crowded city slums to the vast open places where ones companionship is with the hills or the stars hence a double tendency in our recent stories to make them expressive of new world life and to make each story a reflection of some peculiar type of americanismone of the many types that here meet in a common citizenship  the truth of the above criticism may become evident by reviewing the history of the short story in america irving began with mere hints or outlines of stories sketches he called them and added a few legendary tales of the dutch settlers on the hudson then came poe dealing with the phantoms of his own brain rather than with human life or endeavor next appeared hawthorne who dealt largely in moral allegories and whose tales are always told in an atmosphere of mystery and twilight shadows finally after the war came a multitude of writers who insisted on dealing with our american life as it is with miners immigrants money kings mountaineers planters cowboys woodsmena host of varied characters each speaking the speech and typifying the customs or ideals of his particular locality it was these postbellum writers who invented the socalled story of local color a story true to a certain place or a certain class of men which is americas most original contribution to the worlds literature  illustration bret harte  sidenote bret harte  francis bret harte 18391902 is generally credited with the invention of the localcolor story but he was probably indebted to earlier works of the same kind notably to longstreets georgia scenes 1836 and baldwins flush times of alabama and mississippi 1853 he had followed the fortyniners to california in a headlong search for gold when finding himself amid the picturesque scenes and characters of the early mining camps it suddenly occurred to him that he had before his eyes a literary gold mine such as no other modern romancer had discovered thereupon he wrote the luck of roaring camp first published in the overland monthly 1868 and followed it with the outcasts of poker flat and tennessees partner  these stories took the literary world by storm and almost overnight harte became a celebrity following up his advantage he proceeded to write some thirty volumes of the same general kind which were widely read and promptly forgotten though he was plainly too sentimental and sensational there was a sense of freshness or originality in his early stories and poems which made them wonderfully attractive his first three tales were probably his best and they are still worth readingnot for their literary charm or truth but as interesting early examples of the localcolor story  illustration george w cable  sidenote cable  the interest aroused by the miningcamp tales influenced other american writers to discover the neglected literary wealth of their several localities but they were fortunately on guard against hartes exaggerated sentimentality and related their stories with more art and more truth to nature as a specific example read cables old creole days and madame delphine with their exquisite pictures of life in the old french city of new orleans these are romances or creations of fancy to be sure but in their lifelike characters their natural scenes and soft creole dialect they are as realistic that is as true to a real type of american life as anything that can be found in literature they are in fact studies as well as stories such minute and affectionate studies of old people old names and old customs as the great french novelist balzac made in preparation for his work though time holds its own secrets one can hardly avoid the conviction that old creole days and madame delphine are not books of a day but permanent additions to american fiction  sidenote typical storywriters  cable was accompanied by so many other good writers that it would require a volume to do them justice we name only by way of indicating the wide variety that awaits the reader the charming stories of grace king and writers kate chopin dealing with plantation life the new england stories powerful or brilliant or somber of sarah orne jewett rose terry cooke and mary e wilkins the tender and cheery southern stories of thomas nelson page the impressive stories of mountaineer life by mary noailles murfree charles egbert craddock the humorous aliceinwonderland kind of stories told by frank stockton and a bewildering miscellany of other works of which the names thomas bailey aldrich hamlin garland alice french octave thanet rowland robinson frank norris and henry c bunner are as a brief but inviting index  it would be unjust at the present time to discriminate among these writers or to compare them with others perhaps equally good whom we have not named occasionally in the flood of short stories appears one that compels attention aldrichs marjorie daw edward everett hales the man without a country stocktons the lady or the tigereach of these impresses us so forcibly by its delicate artistry or appeal to patriotism or whimsical ending that we hail it as a new classic forgetting that the term classic carries with it the implication of something old and proved safe from change or criticism undoubtedly a few of our recent stories deserve the name they will be more widely known a century hence than they are now and may finally rank above rip van winkle or the gold bug or the snow image but until the perfect tale is sifted from the thousand that are almost perfect every ambitious critic is free to make his own prophecy  illustration mary e wilkinsfreeman  some recent novelists there is a difference between our earlier and later fiction which becomes apparent when we compare specific examples as a type of the earlier novel take coopers the spy or longfellows hyperion or hawthornes the house of the seven gables or simmss katherine walton or cookes the virginia comedians and read it in connection with a recent novel such as howellss annie kilburn or miss jewetts deephaven or harold fredericks illumination or james lane allens the reign of law or frank norriss the octopus disregarding the important element of style we note that the earlier novels have a distant background in time or space that their chief interest lies in the story they have to tell that they take us far away from present reality into regions where people are more impressive and sentiments more exalted than in our familiar prosaic world the later novels interest us less by the story than by the analysis of character they deal with human life as it is here and now not as we imagine it to have been elsewhere or in a golden age in a word our later novels are realistic in purpose and in this respect they are in marked contrast with our novels of an earlier age which are nearly all of the romantic kind footnote in the above comparison we have ignored a large number of recent novels that are quite as romantic as any written before the war romance is still as in all past ages more popular than realism witness the millions of readers of lew wallace e p roe and other modern romancers  the realistic movement in american fiction began as we have noted with the shortstory writers and presently the most talented of these writers having learned the value of real scenes and characters turned to the novel and produced works having the double interest of romance and realism that is they told an old romantic tale of love or heroism and set it amid scenes or characters that were typical of american life miss jewetts novels of northern village life for example are even finer than her short stories in the same field the same criticism applies to miss murfree with her novels of mountaineer life in tennessee to james lane allen with his novels of his native kentucky and to many another recent novelist who tells a brave tale of his own people we call these in the conventional way novels of new england or the south or the west in reality they are novels of humanity of the old unchanging tragedies or comedies of human life which seem more true or real to us because they appear in a familiar setting  there is another school of realism which subordinates the story element which avoids as untrue all unusual or heroic incidents and deals with ordinary men or women and of this school william dean howells is a conspicuous example judging him by his novels alone it would be difficult to determine his rank but judging him by his high aim and distinguished style a style remarkable for its charm and purity in an age too much influenced by newspaper slang and smartness he is certainly one of the best of our recent prose writers since his first modest volume appeared in 1860 he has published many poems sketches of travel appreciations of literature parlor comedies novelsan immense variety of writings but whatever one reads of his sixtyodd books whether venetian life or a boys town one has the impression of an author who lives for literature who puts forth no hasty or unworthy work and who aims steadily to be true to the best traditions of american letters  illustration william dean howells  in middle life howells turned definitely to fiction and wrote among various other novels a womans reason the ministers charge a modern instance and the rise of silas lapham these are all realistic in that they deal frankly with contemporary life but in their plots and conventional endings they differ but little from the typical romance footnote several of howellss earlier novels deal with new england life but superficially and without understanding however minutely they depict its manners or mannerisms they seldom dip beneath the surface if the reader wants not the body but the soul of new england he must go to some other fiction writer to sarah orne jewett for example or to rose terry cooke then howells fell under the influence of tolstoi and other european realists and his later novels such as annie kilburn a hazard of new fortunes and the quality of mercy are rather aimless studies of the speech dress mannerisms and inanities of american life with precious little of its idealswhich are the only things of consequence since they alone endure he appears here as the photographer rather than the painter of american life and his work has the limited interest of another persons family album  illustration mark twain  another realist of a very different kind is samuel l clemens 18351910 who is more widely known by his pseudonym of mark twain he grew up he tells us in a loafing downattheheels town in missouri he was educated on the river and in most of his work he attempted to deal with the roughandready life which he knew intimately at first hand his life on the mississippi a vivid delineation of river scenes and characters is perhaps his best work or at least the most true to his aim and his experience roughing it is another volume from his store of personal observation this time in the western mining camps but here his realism goes as far astray from truth as any old romance in that it exaggerates even the sensational elements of frontier life  the remaining works of mark twain are with one or two exceptions of very doubtful value their great popularity for a time was due largely to the authors reputation as a humorista strange reputation it begins to appear for he was at heart a pessimist an iconoclast a thrower of stones and with the exception of his earliest work the celebrated jumping frog 1867 which reflected some rough fun or horseplay it is questionable whether the term humorous can properly be applied to any of his books thus the blatant innocents abroad is not a work of humor but of ridicule a very different matter which jeers at travelers who profess admiration for the scenery or institutions of european admiration that was a sham to mark twain because he was incapable of understanding it so with the grotesque capers of a connecticut yankee at king arthurs court with the sneering spirit of the man that corrupted hadleyburg with the labored attempts to be funny of adams diary and with other alleged humorous works readers of the next generation may ask not what we found to amuse us in such works but how we could tolerate such crudity or cynicism or bad taste in the name of american humor  the most widely read of mark twains works are tom sawyer and huckleberry finn the former a glorification of a liar and his dimenovel adventures has enough descriptive power to make the story readable but hardly enough to disguise its sensationalism its lawlessness its false standards of boy life and american life in huckleberry finn a much better book the author depicts the life of the middle west as seen by a homeless vagabond with a runaway slave as a companion the hero huck finn drifts down the mississippi on a raft meeting with startling experiences at the hands of quacks and imposters of every kind one might suppose if one took this picaresque record seriously that a large section of our country was peopled wholly by knaves and fools the adventures are again of a sensational kind but the characters are powerfully drawn and the vivid pictures of the mighty river by day or night are among the best examples of descriptive writing in our literature  sidenote crane and norris  still another type of realism is suggested by the names stephen crane and frank norris these young writers influenced by the french novelist zola condemned the old romance as false and proclaimed somewhat grandly at first that they would tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth then they straightway forgot that health and moral sanity are the truth of life and proceeded to deal with degraded or degenerate characters as if these were typical of humanity their earlier works are studies of brutality miscalled realism but later crane wrote his red badge of courage a rather wildly imaginative story of the civil war and norris produced works of real power in the octopus and the pit one a prose epic of the railroad the other of a grain of wheat from the time it is sown in the ground until it becomes a matter of good food or of crazy speculation there is an impression of vastness of continental breadth and sweep in these two novels which sets them apart from all other fiction of the period  the flood of dialect stories which appeared after 1876 may seem at first glance to be mere variations of bret hartes localcolor stories but they are something more and better than that the best of themsuch for example as pages in ole virginia or rowland robinsons danvis folkare written on the assumption that we can never understand a man that is the soul of a man unless we know the very language in which he expresses his thought or feeling these dialect stories therefore are intimate studies of american life rather than of local speech or manners  sidenote harris  joel chandler harris 18481908 is not our best writer of dialect stories but only the happy and most fortunate man who wrote uncle remus 1880 and wrote it by the way as part of his days work as a newspaper man without a thought that it was a masterpiece a work of genius the first charm of the book is that it fascinates children with its frolicsome adventures of brer rabbit brer tarrypin brer bar brer fox and the wonderful tar baby the second that it combines in a remarkable way a primitive or universal with a local and intensely human interest thus almost everybody is interested in folklore especially in the animal stories which are part of the tradition of every primitive tribe but folklore as commonly written is not a branch of fiction but of science before it can enter the golden door of literature it must find or create some human character who interests us not by his stories but by his humanity and harris furnished this character in the person of uncle remus a very lovable old plantation negro drawn with absolute fidelity to life  illustration joel chandler harris  other novelists have portrayed a negro in fiction but harris did a more original work by creating his brer rabbit in the adventures of this happygolucky creature with his childishness and humor we have the symbol not of any one negro but of the whole race of negroes as the author knew them intimately in a condition of servitude the creation of these two original characters as real as poor richard or natty bumppo and far more fascinating is one of the most notable achievements of american fiction  sidenote problem novels  aside from the realistic movement our recent fiction is like a river flowing sluggishly over hidden bowlders the surface is so broken by whirlpools eddies and aimless flotsam that it is difficult to determine the main current here our attention is attracted by clever stories of society in the making there by somber problemnovels dealing with city slums lonely farms department stores political rings business corruption religious creeds social injusticewith every conceivable matter that can furnish a novelist not with a story but with a cry for reform the propaganda novel is evidently a favorite in america but whether it has any real influence in reforming abuses as the novels of dickens led to better schools and prisons in england is yet to be determined  occasionally appears a reform novel great enough to make us forget the reform such as helen hunt jacksons ramona 1884 this famous story began as an attempt to plead the cause of the oppressed indian to do for him what uncle toms cabin was supposed to have done for the negro it ended in an idyllic story so well told that readers forgot to cry lo the poor indian as the author intended at the present time ramona is not classed with the problemnovels but with the most readable of american romances  sidenote popular romances  while the new realistic novel occupied the attention of critics the old romance had as usual an immensely larger number of readers moral romances with a happy ending have always been popular and of these e p roe furnished an abundance his barriers burned away a face illumined opening of a chestnut burr and natures serial story depict american characters in an american landscape and have a wholesome atmosphere of manliness and cleanness that makes them eminently safe reading unfortunately they are melodramatic and sentimental and critics commonly sneer or jeer at them but that is not a rational criticism romances that won instant welcome from a host of readers and that are still widely known after half a century have at least the power to live and vitality the quality that makes a character or a story endure is always one of the marks of a good romance  another romancer untouched by the zeal for realism was marion crawford who in a very interesting essay the novel proclaimed with some show of reason that the novel was simply a pocket theater a convenient stage whereon the reader could enjoy by himself any comedy or tragedy that pleased him that crawford lived abroad the greater part of his life and was familiar with society in a dozen countries may explain the fact that his fortyodd novels are nearly all of the social kind his roman novels saracinesca sant ilario and a dozen others are perhaps his best work they are good stories they take us among cultured foreign people and give us glimpses of a life that is hidden from most travelers but they are superficial and leave the impression that the author was a man without much heart that he missed the deeper meanings of life because he had little interest in them his characters are as puppets that are sent through a play for our amusement and for no other reason in this however he remained steadily true to his own ideal of fiction as a convenient substitute for the theater moreover he was a good workman his stories were for the most part well composed and very well written  more popular even than the romances of roe and crawford are the stories with a background of colonial or revolutionary history a type to which america has ever given hearty welcome fords janice meredith mitchells hugh wynne mary johnstons to have and to hold maurice thompsons alice of old vincennes churchills richard carvelthe reader can add to the list of recent historical romances almost indefinitely but no critic can now declare which shall be called great among them to the same interesting group of writers belong lew wallace whose enormously popular ben hur has obscured his better story the fair god and mary hartwell catherwood whose lady of fort st john and other stirring tales of the northwest have the same savage wilderness background against which parkman wrote his histories  for other romances of the period we have no convenient term except to call them oldfashioned such for instance are blanche willis howards one summer and arthur sherburne hardys passe rose and but yet a womanpleasant leisurely exquisitely finished romances which belong to no particular time or place and which deserve the fine old name of romance because they seem to grow young rather than old with the passing years  poetry since 1876 it is commonly assumed that the last half century has been almost exclusively an age of prose the student of literature knows on the contrary that one difficulty of judging our recent poetry lies in the amount and variety of it since 1876 more poetry has been published here than in all the previous years of our history and the quality of it if one dare judge it as a whole is surprisingly good the designation of the prose age therefore should not blind us to the fact that america never had so many poets as at present whether a future generation will rank any of these among our elder poets is another question of late years we have had no singer to compare with longfellow to be sure but we have had a dozen singers who reflect the enlarging life of america in a way of which longfellow never dreamed he lived mostly in the past and was busy with legends folklore songs of the night our later singers live in the present and write songs of the day and this suggests the chief characteristic of recent poetry namely that it aims to be true to life as it is here and now rather than to life as it was romantically supposed to be in classic or medieval times footnote the above characterization applies only to the best or to what most critics deem best of our recent poetry it takes no account of a large mass of verse which leaves an impression of faddishness in the matter of form or phrase or subject such verse appeals to the taste of the moment but time has an effective way of dealing with it and with all other insincerities in literature  this emancipation of our poetry from the past with the loss and gain which such a change implies was not easily accomplished and the terrible reality of the great war was perhaps the decisive factor in the struggle before the war our poetry was largely conventional imitative sentimental and even after the war when millers songs of the sierras and john hays pikecounty ballads began to sing however crudely of vigorous life the acknowledged poets and critics of the time were scandalized thus to read the letters of bayard taylor is to meet a poet who bewails the lack of poetic material in america and who hungers as he says for the romance and beauty of other lands he writes songs of the orient lars a pastoral of norway prince deukalion and many other volumes which seem to indicate that poetry is to be found everywhere save at home even his song of the camp is located in the crimea as if heroism and tenderness had not recently bloomed on a hundred southern battlefields so also stedman wrote his alectryon and the blameless prince and aldrich spent his best years in making artificial nosegays as holmes told him frankly when he ought to have been making poems these and many other poets said proudly that they belonged to the classic school they all read shelley and keats dreamed of medieval or classic beauty and in unnumbered reviews condemned the crudity of those who were trying to find beauty at their own doors and to make poetry of the stuff of american life  illustration edmund clarence stedman  sidenote stedman and aldrich  it was the war or rather the new american spirit that issued from the war which finally assured these poets and critics that mythology and legend were so far as america was concerned as dead as the mastodon and that life itself was the only vitally interesting subject of poetry edmund clarence stedman 18331908 after writing many finished poems that were praised and forgotten manfully acknowledged that he had been following the wrong trail and turned at last to the poetry of his own people his alice of monmouth an idyl of the war and a few short pieces such as wanted a man are the only parts of his poetical works that are now remembered thomas bailey aldrich 18361907 went through the same transformation he had a love of formal beauty and in the exquisite finish of his verse has had few rivals in american poetry but he spent the great part of his life in making pretty trifles then he seemed to waken to the meaning of poetry as a noble expression of the truth or beauty of this present life and his last little book of songs and sonnets contains practically all that is worth remembering of his eight or nine volumes of verse  illustration thomas bailey aldrich  sidenote joaquin miller  one of the first in time of the new singers was cincinnatus heine miller or as he is commonly known joaquin miller 18411912 his songs of the sierras 1871 and other poems of the west have this advantage that they come straight from the heart of a man who has shared the stirring life he describes and who loves it with an overmastering love to read his my own story or the preface to his ship in the desert is to understand from what fullness of life came lines like these    room room to turn round in to breathe and be free   to grow to be giant to sail as at sea   with the speed of the wind on a steed with his mane   to the wind without pathway or route or a rein   room room to be free where the whitebordered sea   blows a kiss to a brother as boundless as he   where the buffalo come like a cloud on the plain   pouring on like the tide of a stormdriven main   and the lodge of the hunter to friend or to foe   offers rest and unquestioned you come or you go   my plains of america seas of wild lands   i turn to you lean to you lift you my hands  indeed there was a splendid promise in miller but the promise was never fulfilled he wrote voluminously feeling that he must express the lure and magic of the boundless west but he wrote so carelessly that the crude bulk of his verse obscures the originality of his few inspired lines to read the latter is to be convinced that he was a true poet who might have accomplished a greater work than whitman since he had more genius and manliness than the eastern poet possessed but his personal oddities his zeal for reforms his love of solitude his endless quest after some unnamed good which kept him living among the indians or wandering between mexico and the ends of alaskaall this hindered his poetic development it may be that an indiandriven arrow which touched his brain in one of his numerous adventures had something to do with his wanderings and his failure  there is a poetry of thought that can be written down in words and there is another poetry of glorious living keenly felt in the winds of the wilderness or the rush of a splendid horse or the flight of a canoe through the rapids for which there is no adequate expression miller could feel superbly this poetry of the mountaineer the plainsman and the voyageur that he could even suggest or half reveal it to others makes him worthy to be named among our most original singers  sidenote irwin russell  the hundred other poets of the period are too near for criticism too varied even for classification but we may at least note two or three significant groupings in one group are the dialect poets who attempt to make poetry serve the same end as fiction of the localcolor school irwin russell with his gay negro songs tossed off to the twanging accompaniment of his banjo belongs in this group his verses are notable not for their dialect others have done that better but for their fidelity to the negro character as russell had observed it in the old plantation days there is little of poetic beauty in his work it is chiefly remarkable for its promise for its opening of a new field of poesie but unfortunately the promise was spoiled by the authors fitful life and his untimely death  illustration joaquin miller  sidenote carleton and riley  closely akin to the dialect group in their effective use of the homely speech of country people are several popular poets of whom will carleton and james whitcomb riley are the most conspicuous carletons over the hills to the poorhouse and other early songs won him a wide circle of readers whereupon he followed up his advantage with farm ballads and other volumes filled with rather crude but sincere verses of home and childhood for half a century these sentimental poems were as popular as the early works of longfellow and they are still widely read by people who like homely themes and plenty of homely sentiment in their poetry  riley won an even larger following with his old swimmin hole rhymes of childhood days and a dozen other volumes that aimed to reflect in rustic language the joys and sorrows of country people judged by the number of his readers he would be called the chief poet of the period but judged by the quality of his work it would seem that he wrote too much and wrote too often with his eye on the gallery he was primarily an entertainer a platform favorite and in his impersonation of country folk was always in danger of giving his audience what he thought they would like not what he sincerely felt to be true hence the impression of the stage and a makeup in a considerable part of his work at times however riley could forget the platform and speak from the heart as a plain man to plain men his work at such moments has a deeper note more simple and sincere and a few of his poems will undoubtedly find a permanent place in american letters the best feature of his work is that he felt no need to go far afield to the orient or to mythology but found the beauty of fine feeling at his door and dared to call one of his collections poems here at home  sidenote typical poets  in a third group of recent poets are those who try to reflect the feeling of some one type or race of the many that make up the sum total of american life such are emma lazarus speaking finely for the jewish race and paul lawrence dunbar voicing the deeper life of the negronot the negro of the old plantation but the negro who was once a slave and must now prove himself a man in the same group we are perhaps justified in placing lucy larcom singing for the mill girls of new england and eugene field who shows what fun and sentiment may brighten the life of a busy newspaper man in a great city  finally come a larger number of poets who cannot be grouped who sing each of what he knows or loves best celia thaxter of the stormswept northern ocean madison cawein of nature in her more tender moods edward rowland sill of the aspirations of a rare puritan soul more varied in their themes are edith thomas emily dickinson henry c bunner richard watson gilder george edward woodberry william vaughn moody richard hovey and several others who are perhaps quite as notable as any of those whom we have too briefly reviewed they all sing of american life in its wonderful complexity and have added poems of real merit to the book of recent american verse and that is a very good book to read more inspiring and perhaps more enduring than the popular book of prose fiction  miscellaneous prose the historian who is perplexed by our recent poetry or fiction must be overwhelmed by the flood of miscellaneous works covering every field of human endeavor as one who wanders through a forest has no conception of the forest itself but only of individual trees so the reader of latterday literature can form no distinct impression of it as a whole but must linger over the individual authors who happen to attract his attention hence in all studies of contemporary literature we have the inevitable confusion of what is important with what merely seems so because of its nearness or newness or appeal to our personal interests the reader is amused by a david harum or made thoughtful by a looking backward or wonderstruck by a life of lincoln as big as a tenvolume history and he thinks this is surely a book to live but a year passes and david harum is eclipsed by a more popular hero of fiction looking backward is relegated to the shelf of forgotten tracts and nicolay and hays monumental biography becomes a source book which someone it is to be hoped will some day use in making a life of lincoln that will be worthy of the subject and of the name of literature  sidenote nature writers  there is one feature in our recent literature however which attracts the attention of all critics namely the number of nature writers who have revealed to us the beauty of our natural environment as ruskin awakened his readers to the beauty of art and joaquin miller to the unsung glory of the pioneers in this respect of adding to our enjoyment of human life by a new valuation of all life our nature literature has no parallel in any age or nation  to be specific one must search continental literatures carefully to find even a single book that belongs unmistakably to the outdoor school in english literature we find several poets who sing occasionally of the charms of nature but only two books in fourteen centuries of writing that deal frankly with the great outdoors for its own sake one is isaac waltons complete angler 1653 the other gilbert whites natural history of selborne 1789 footnote there were other works of a scientific nature and some of exploration but no real nature books until the first notable work of richard jefferies one of the best of nature writers appeared in 1878 by that time the nature movement in america was well under way in american literature the story is shorter but of the same tenor until recent times from the beginning we have had many journals of exploration but though the joy of wild nature is apparent in such writings they were written to increase our knowledge not our pleasure in life josselyns new englands rarities 1672 alexander wilsons american ornithology 1801 audubons birds of america 1827these were our nearest approach to nature books until thoreaus walden 1854 called attention to the immense and fascinating field which our writers had so long overlooked  thoreau it will be remembered was neglected by his own generation but after the war when writers began to use the picturesque characters of plantation or mining camp as the material for a new american literature then the living world of nature seemed suddenly opened to their vision bradford torrey himself a charming nature writer edited thoreaus journals and lo these neglected chronicles became precious because the eyes of america were at last opened maurice thompson wrote as a poet and scholar in the presence of nature john muir as a reverent explorer and william hamilton gibson as an artist with an eye single to beauty then in rapid succession came charles abbott rowland robinson john burroughs olive thorne miller florence bailey frank bolles and a score more of a somewhat later generation most of these are frankly nature writers not scientists they aim not simply to observe the shy fleeting life of the woods or fields but to reflect that life in such a way as to give us a new pleasure by awakening a new sense of beauty  it is a remarkable spectacle this rediscovery of nature in an age supposed to be given over to materialism and its influence appears in every branch of our literature the nature writers have evidently done a greater work than they knew they have helped a multitude of people to enjoy the beauty of a flower without pulling it to pieces for a latin name to appreciate a living bird more than a stuffed skin and to understand what thoreau meant when he said that the anima of an animal is the only interesting thing about him because they have given us a new valuation of life a new sense of its sacredness and mystery their work may appeal to a future generation as the most original contribution to recent literature  sidenote history and biography  another interesting feature of recent times is the importance attached to historical and biographical works which have increased so rapidly since 1876 that there is now no period of american life and no important character or event that lacks its historian the number of such works is astonishing but their general lack of style and broad human interest places them outside of the field of literature the tendency of recent historical writing for example is to collect facts about persons or events rather than to reproduce the persons or events so vividly that the past lives again before our eyes the result of such writing is to make history a puppet show in which dead figures are moved about by unseen economic forces meanwhile the only record that lives in literature is the one that represents history as it really was in the making that is as a drama of living selfdirecting men  illustration john fiske  there is at least one recent historian however whose style gives distinction to his work and makes it worthy of especial notice this is john fiske 18421901 whose field and method are both unusual he began as a student of law and philosophy and his first notable book outlines of cosmic philosophy attracted instant attention in england and america by its literary style and rare lucidity of statement it was followed by a series of essays such as the idea of god the destiny of man and the origin of evil which were so far above others of their kind that for a time they were in danger of becoming popular of a thousand works occasioned by the theory of evolution when that theory was a nine days wonder they are among the very few that stand the test of time by affording as much pleasure and surprise as when they were first written  it was comparatively late in life that our philosopher turned historian and his first work in this field american political ideals viewed from the standpoint of universal history announced that here at last was a writer with broad horizons who saw america not as an isolated nation making a strange experiment but as adding a vital chapter to the great worlds history it was a surprising work unlike any other in the field of american history and it may fall to another generation to appreciate its originality finally fiske took up the study of particular periods or epochs viewed them with the same deep insight the same broad sympathy and reflected them in a series of brilliant narratives old virginia and her neighbors the beginnings of new england dutch and quaker colonies in america and a few others the series ending chronologically with a critical period of american history the critical period being the time of doubt and struggle over the constitution these narratives though not unified form a fairly complete history from the colonial period to the formation of the union  to read any of these books is to discover that fiske is concerned not chiefly with events but with the meaning or philosophy of events that he has a rare gift of delving below the surface of seeing in the endeavors of a handful of men at jamestown or plymouth or philadelphia a profoundly significant chapter of universal history hence we seem to read in his pages not the story of america but the story of man moreover he had enthusiasm which means that his heart was young and that he could make even dull matters vital and interesting perhaps the best thing that can be said of his work is that it is a pleasure to read ita criticism which is spoken for mature or thoughtful readers rather than for those who read history for its dramatic or heroic interest  sidenote literary history  another feature of our recent prose is the number of books devoted to the study of american letters and that like the study of nature is a phenomenon which is without precedent notwithstanding emersons plea for independence in the american scholar 1837 our critics were busy long after that date with the books of other lands thinking that there was no american literature worthy of their attention in the same year that emerson made his famous address royal robbins made what was probably the first attempt at a history of american literature footnote chambers history of the english language and literature to which is added a history of american contributions to the english language and literature by royal robbins hartford 1837 it is interesting to note that the author complained of the difficulty of his task in view of the fact that there were at that time over two thousand living american authors it consisted of a few tagends attached to a dry catalogue of english writers and the scholarly author declared that as there was only one poor literary history then in existence namely chambers he must depend largely on his own memory for correcting the english part of the book and creating a new american part nor were conditions improved during the next forty years  illustration edward everett hale  after the war however the viewpoint of our historians was changed they began to regard american literature with increasing respect as an original product as a true reflection of human life in a new field and under the stimulus of new incentives to play the fine old game of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness in 1878 appeared tylers history of american literature 16071765 in two bulky volumes that surprised readers by revealing a mass of important writings in a period supposed to be barren of literary interest and the surprise increased when the same author produced two more volumes dealing with the literature of the revolution in 1885 came stedmans poets of america an excellent critical study of new world poetry and two years later richardson published the first of his two splendid volumes of american literature these good beginnings were followed by a host of biographies dealing with every important american author until we now have choice of a large assortment of literary material where royal robbins had none at all  such formal works are for the student but the reader who goes to books for recreation has also been remembered edward everett hales james russell lowell and his friends higginsons old cambridge howellss literary friends and acquaintance trowbridges my own story mrs fields authors and friends stoddards homes and haunts of our elder poets curtiss homes of american authors mitchells american lands and lettersthese are but few of many recent books of reminiscences all bearing witness to the fact that american literature has a history and tradition of its own it is no longer an appendix to english literature but an original record to be cherished as we cherish any other precious national heritage and to stand or fall among the literatures of the world as it shall be found true or false to the fundamental ideals of american life
