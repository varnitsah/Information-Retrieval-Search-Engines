66106126	his last bow  an epilogue of sherlock holmes   by  sir arthur conan doyle   part of a collection of stories by sir arthur conan doyle published as a book entitled his last bow     it was nine oclock at night upon the second of augustthe most terrible august in the history of the world  one might have thought already that gods curse hung heavy over a degenerate world for there was an awesome hush and a feeling of vague expectancy in the sultry and stagnant air  the sun had long set but one bloodred gash like an open wound lay low in the distant west  above the stars were shining brightly and below the lights of the shipping glimmered in the bay the two famous germans stood beside the stone parapet of the garden walk with the long low heavily gabled house behind them and they looked down upon the broad sweep of the beach at the foot of the great chalk cliff in which von bork like some wandering eagle had perched himself four years before  they stood with their heads close together talking in low confidential tones  from below the two glowing ends of their cigars might have been the smouldering eyes of some malignant fiend looking down in the darkness  a remarkable man this von borka man who could hardly be matched among all the devoted agents of the kaiser  it was his talents which had first recommended him for the english mission the most important mission of all but since he had taken it over those talents had become more and more manifest to the halfdozen people in the world who were really in touch with the truth  one of these was his present companion baron von herling the chief secretary of the legation whose huge 100horsepower benz car was blocking the country lane as it waited to waft its owner back to london  so far as i can judge the trend of events you will probably be back in berlin within the week the secretary was saying  when you get there my dear von bork i think you will be surprised at the welcome you will receive  i happen to know what is thought in the highest quarters of your work in this country  he was a huge man the secretary deep broad and tall with a slow heavy fashion of speech which had been his main asset in his political career  von bork laughed  they are not very hard to deceive he remarked  a more docile simple folk could not be imagined  i dont know about that said the other thoughtfully  they have strange limits and one must learn to observe them  it is that surface simplicity of theirs which makes a trap for the stranger  ones first impression is that they are entirely soft then one comes suddenly upon something very hard and you know that you have reached the limit and must adapt yourself to the fact  they have for example their insular conventions which simply must be observed  meaning good form and that sort of thing von bork sighed as one who had suffered much  meaning british prejudice in all its queer manifestations  as an example i may quote one of my own worst blundersi can afford to talk of my blunders for you know my work well enough to be aware of my successes  it was on my first arrival  i was invited to a weekend gathering at the country house of a cabinet minister  the conversation was amazingly indiscreet  von bork nodded  ive been there said he dryly  exactly  well i naturally sent a resume of the information to berlin  unfortunately our good chancellor is a little heavyhanded in these matters and he transmitted a remark which showed that he was aware of what had been said  this of course took the trail straight up to me  youve no idea the harm that it did me  there was nothing soft about our british hosts on that occasion i can assure you  i was two years living it down  now you with this sporting pose of yours  no no dont call it a pose  a pose is an artificial thing this is quite natural  i am a born sportsman  i enjoy it  well that makes it the more effective  you yacht against them you hunt with them you play polo you match them in every game your fourinhand takes the prize at olympia  i have even heard that you go the length of boxing with the young officers  what is the result nobody takes you seriously  you are a good old sport quite a decent fellow for a german a harddrinking nightclub knockabouttown devilmaycare young fellow  and all the time this quiet country house of yours is the centre of half the mischief in england and the sporting squire the most astute secretservice man in europe  genius my dear von borkgenius  you flatter me baron  but certainly i may claim my four years in this country have not been unproductive  ive never shown you my little store  would you mind stepping in for a moment  the door of the study opened straight on to the terrace  von bork pushed it back and leading the way he clicked the switch of the electric light  he then closed the door behind the bulky form which followed him and carefully adjusted the heavy curtain over the latticed window  only when all these precautions had been taken and tested did he turn his sunburned aquiline face to his guest  some of my papers have gone said he  when my wife and the household left yesterday for flushing they took the less important with them  i must of course claim the protection of the embassy for the others  your name has already been filed as one of the personal suite there will be no difficulties for you or your baggage  of course it is just possible that we may not have to go  england may leave france to her fate  we are sure that there is no binding treaty between them  and belgium  yes and belgium too  von bork shook his head  i dont see how that could be  there is a definite treaty there  she could never recover from such a humiliation  she would at least have peace for the moment  but her honor  tut my dear sir we live in a utilitarian age  honour is a mediaeval conception  besides england is not ready  it is an inconceivable thing but even our special war tax of fifty million which one would think made our purpose as clear as if we had advertised it on the front page of the times has not roused these people from their slumbers here and there one hears a question  it is my business to find an answer  here and there also there is an irritation  it is my business to soothe it but i can assure you that so far as the essentials gothe storage of munitions the preparation for submarine attack the arrangements for making high explosivesnothing is prepared how then can england come in especially when we have stirred her up such a devils brew of irish civil war windowbreaking furies and god knows what to keep her thoughts at home  she must think of her future  ah that is another matter  i fancy that in the future we have our own very definite plans about england and that your information will be very vital to us  it is today or tomorrow with mr john bull  if he prefers today we are perfectly ready if it is tomorrow we shall be more ready still  i should think they would be wiser to fight with allies than without them but that is their own affair  this week is their week of destiny but you were speaking of your papers  he sat in the armchair with the light shining upon his broad bald head while he puffed sedately at his cigar  the large oakpanelled booklined room had a curtain hung in the further corner  when this was drawn it disclosed a large brassbound safe  von bork detached a small key from his watch chain and after some considerable manipulation of the lock he swung open the heavy door  look said he standing clear with a wave of his hand  the light shone vividly into the opened safe and the secretary of the embassy gazed with an absorbed interest at the rows of stuffed pigeonholes with which it was furnished  each pigeonhole had its label and his eyes as he glanced along them read a long series of such titles as fords harbourdefences aeroplanes ireland egypt portsmouth forts the channel rosythe and a score of others  each compartment was bristling with papers and plans  colossal said the secretary  putting down his cigar he softly clapped his fat hands  and all in four years baron  not such a bad show for the harddrinking hardriding country squire  but the gem of my collection is coming and there is the setting all ready for it he pointed to a space over which naval signals was printed  but you have a good dossier there already  out of date and waste paper  the admiralty in some way got the alarm and every code has been changed  it was a blow baronthe worst setback in my whole campaign  but thanks to my checkbook and the good altamont all will be well tonight  the baron looked at his watch and gave a guttural exclamation of disappointment  well i really can wait no longer  you can imagine that things are moving at present in carlton terrace and that we have all to be at our posts  i had hoped to be able to bring news of your great coup  did altamont name no hour  von bork pushed over a telegram  will come without fail tonight and bring new sparking plugs  altamont  sparking plugs eh  you see he poses as a motor expert and i keep a full garage  in our code everything likely to come up is named after some spare part  if he talks of a radiator it is a battleship of an oil pump a cruiser and so on  sparking plugs are naval signals  from portsmouth at midday said the secretary examining the superscription  by the way what do you give him  five hundred pounds for this particular job  of course he has a salary as well  the greedy rogue  they are useful these traitors but i grudge them their blood money  i grudge altamont nothing  he is a wonderful worker  if i pay him well at least he delivers the goods to use his own phrase besides he is not a traitor  i assure you that our most pangermanic junker is a sucking dove in his feelings towards england as compared with a real bitter irishamerican  oh an irishamerican  if you heard him talk you would not doubt it  sometimes i assure you i can hardly understand him  he seems to have declared war on the kings english as well as on the english king  must you really go  he may be here any moment  no  im sorry but i have already overstayed my time  we shall expect you early tomorrow and when you get that signal book through the little door on the duke of yorks steps you can put a triumphant finis to your record in england  what  tokay  he indicated a heavily sealed dustcovered bottle which stood with two high glasses upon a salver  may i offer you a glass before your journey  no thanks  but it looks like revelry  altamont has a nice taste in wines and he took a fancy to my tokay he is a touchy fellow and needs humouring in small things  i have to study him i assure you  they had strolled out on to the terrace again and along it to the further end where at a touch from the barons chauffeur the great car shivered and chuckled  those are the lights of harwich i suppose said the secretary pulling on his dust coat  how still and peaceful it all seems  there may be other lights within the week and the english coast a less tranquil place the heavens too may not be quite so peaceful if all that the good zepplin promises us comes true  by the way who is that  only one window showed a light behind them in it there stood a lamp and beside it seated at a table was a dear old ruddyfaced woman in a country cap  she was bending over her knitting and stopping occasionally to stroke a large black cat upon a stool beside her  that is martha the only servant i have left  the secretary chuckled  she might almost personify britannia said he with her complete selfabsorption and general air of comfortable somnolence  well au revoir von bork  with a final wave of his hand he sprang into the car and a moment later the two golden cones from the headlights shot through the darkness  the secretary lay back in the cushions of the luxurious limousine with his thoughts so full of the impending european tragedy that he hardly observed that as his car swung round the village street it nearly passed over a little ford coming in the opposite direction  von bork walked slowly back to the study when the last gleams of the motor lamps had faded into the distance  as he passed he observed that his old housekeeper had put out her lamp and retired  it was a new experience to him the silence and darkness of his widespread house for his family and household had been a large one  it was a relief to him however to think that they were all in safety and that but for that one old woman who had lingered in the kitchen he had the whole place to himself  there was a good deal of tidying up to do inside his study and he set himself to do it until his keen handsome face was flushed with the heat of the burning papers  a leather valise stood beside his table and into this he began to pack very neatly and systematically the precious contents of his safe he had hardly got started with the work however when his quick ears caught the sounds of a distant car  instantly he gave an exclamation of satisfaction strapped up the valise shut the safe locked it and hurried out on to the terrace  he was just in time to see the lights of a small car come to a halt at the gate  a passenger sprang out of it and advanced swiftly towards him while the chauffeur a heavily built elderly man with a gray moustache settled down like one who resigns himself to a long vigil  well asked von bork eagerly running forward to meet his visitor  for answer the man waved a small brownpaper parcel triumphantly above his head  you can give me the glad hand tonight mister he cried  im bringing home the bacon at last  the signals  same as i said in my cable  every last one of them semaphore lamp code marconia copy mind you not the original  that was too dangerous  but its the real goods and you can lay to that  he slapped the german upon the shoulder with a rough familiarity from which the other winced  come in he said  im all alone in the house  i was only waiting for this  of course a copy is better than the original if an original were missing they would change the whole thing you think its all safe about the copy  the irishamerican had entered the study and stretched his long limbs from the armchair  he was a tall gaunt man of sixty with clearcut features and a small goatee beard which gave him a general resemblance to the caricatures of uncle sam  a halfsmoked sodden cigar hung from the corner of his mouth and as he sat down he struck a match and relit it  making ready for a move he remarked as he looked round him say mister he added as his eyes fell upon the safe from which the curtain was now removed you dont tell me you keep your papers in that  why not  gosh in a wideopen contraption like that  and they reckon you to be some spy  why a yankee crook would be into that with a canopener if id known that any letter of mine was goin to lie loose in a thing like that id have been a mug to write to you at all  it would puzzle any crook to force that safe von bork answered you wont cut that metal with any tool  but the lock  no its a double combination lock  you know what that is  search me said the american  well you need a word as well as a set of figures before you can get the lock to work  he rose and showed a doubleradiating disc round the keyhole  this outer one is for the letters the inner one for the figures  well well thats fine  so its not quite as simple as you thought  it was four years ago that i had it made and what do you think i chose for the word and figures  its beyond me  well i chose august for the word and 1914 for the figures and here we are  the americans face showed his surprise and admiration  my but that was smart  you had it down to a fine thing  yes a few of us even then could have guessed the date  here it is and im shutting down tomorrow morning  well i guess youll have to fix me up also  im not staying in this goldarned country all on my lonesome  in a week or less from what i see john bull will be on his hind legs and fair ramping  id rather watch him from over the water  but youre an american citizen  well so was jack james an american citizen but hes doing time in portland all the same  it cuts no ice with a british copper to tell him youre an american citizen  its british law and order over here says he  by the way mister talking of jack james it seems to me you dont do much to cover your men  what do you mean von bork asked sharply  well you are their employer aint you  its up to you to see that they dont fall down  but they do fall down and when did you ever pick them up  theres james  it was jamess own fault  you know that yourself  he was too selfwilled for the job  james was a boneheadi give you that  then there was hollis  the man was mad  well he went a bit woozy towards the end  its enough to make a man bughouse when he has to play a part from morning to night with a hundred guys all ready to set the coppers wise to him but now there is steiner  von bork started violently and his ruddy face turned a shade paler  what about steiner  well theyve got him thats all  they raided his store last night and he and his papers are all in portsmouth jail  youll go off and he poor devil will have to stand the racket and lucky if he gets off with his life  thats why i want to get over the water as soon as you do  von bork was a strong selfcontained man but it was easy to see that the news had shaken him  how could they have got on to steiner he muttered  thats the worst blow yet  well you nearly had a worse one for i believe they are not far off me  you dont mean that  sure thing  my landlady down fratton way had some inquiries and when i heard of it i guessed it was time for me to hustle but what i want to know mister is how the coppers know these things  steiner is the fifth man youve lost since i signed on with you and i know the name of the sixth if i dont get a move on  how do you explain it and aint you ashamed to see your men go down like this  von bork flushed crimson  how dare you speak in such a way  if i didnt dare things mister i wouldnt be in your service but ill tell you straight what is in my mind  ive heard that with you german politicians when an agent has done his work you are not sorry to see him put away  von bork sprang to his feet  do you dare to suggest that i have given away my own agents  i dont stand for that mister but theres a stool pigeon or a cross somewhere and its up to you to find out where it is anyhow i am taking no more chances  its me for little holland and the sooner the better  von bork had mastered his anger  we have been allies too long to quarrel now at the very hour of victory he said  youve done splendid work and taken risks and i cant forget it  by all means go to holland and you can get a boat from rotterdam to new york  no other line will be safe a week from now  ill take that book and pack it with the rest  the american held the small parcel in his hand but made no motion to give it up  what about the dough he asked  the what  the boodle  the reward  the 500 pounds  the gunner turned damned nasty at the last and i had to square him with an extra hundred dollars or it would have been nitsky for you and me nothin doin says he and he meant it too but the last hundred did it  its cost me two hundred pound from first to last so it isnt likely id give it up without gettin my wad  von bork smiled with some bitterness  you dont seem to have a very high opinion of my honour said he you want the money before you give up the book  well mister it is a business proposition  all right  have your way  he sat down at the table and scribbled a check which he tore from the book but he refrained from handing it to his companion  after all since we are to be on such terms mr altamont said he i dont see why i should trust you any more than you trust me  do you understand he added looking back over his shoulder at the american  theres the check upon the table  i claim the right to examine that parcel before you pick the money up  the american passed it over without a word  von bork undid a winding of string and two wrappers of paper  then he sat gazing for a moment in silent amazement at a small blue book which lay before him  across the cover was printed in golden letters practical handbook of bee culture  only for one instant did the master spy glare at this strangely irrelevant inscription  the next he was gripped at the back of his neck by a grasp of iron and a chloroformed sponge was held in front of his writhing face  another glass watson said mr sherlock holmes as he extended the bottle of imperial tokay  the thickset chauffeur who had seated himself by the table pushed forward his glass with some eagerness  it is a good wine holmes  a remarkable wine watson  our friend upon the sofa has assured me that it is from franz josefs special cellar at the schoenbrunn palace might i trouble you to open the window for chloroform vapour does not help the palate  the safe was ajar and holmes standing in front of it was removing dossier after dossier swiftly examining each and then packing it neatly in von borks valise  the german lay upon the sofa sleeping stertorously with a strap round his upper arms and another round his legs  we need not hurry ourselves watson we are safe from interruption would you mind touching the bell  there is no one in the house except old martha who has played her part to admiration  i got her the situation here when first i took the matter up ah martha you will be glad to hear that all is well  the pleasant old lady had appeared in the doorway  she curtseyed with a smile to mr holmes but glanced with some apprehension at the figure upon the sofa  it is all right martha  he has not been hurt at all  i am glad of that mr holmes  according to his lights he has been a kind master  he wanted me to go with his wife to germany yesterday but that would hardly have suited your plans would it sir  no indeed martha  so long as you were here i was easy in my mind we waited some time for your signal tonight  it was the secretary sir  i know  his car passed ours  i thought he would never go  i knew that it would not suit your plans sir to find him here  no indeed  well it only meant that we waited half an hour or so until i saw your lamp go out and knew that the coast was clear  you can report to me tomorrow in london martha at claridges hotel  very good sir  i suppose you have everything ready to leave  yes sir  he posted seven letters today  i have the addresses as usual  very good martha  i will look into them tomorrow  goodnight these papers he continued as the old lady vanished are not of very great importance for of course the information which they represent has been sent off long ago to the german government  these are the originals which could not safely be got out of the country  then they are of no use  i should not go so far as to say that watson  they will at least show our people what is known and what is not  i may say that a good many of these papers have come through me and i need not add are thoroughly untrustworthy  it would brighten my declining years to see a german cruiser navigating the solent according to the minefield plans which i have furnished  but you watsonhe stopped his work and took his old friend by the shouldersive hardly seen you in the light yet  how have the years used you  you look the same blithe boy as ever  i feel twenty years younger holmes  i have seldom felt so happy as when i got your wire asking me to meet you at harwich with the car but you holmesyou have changed very littlesave for that horrible goatee  these are the sacrifices one makes for ones country watson said holmes pulling at his little tuft  tomorrow it will be but a dreadful memory  with my hair cut and a few other superficial changes i shall no doubt reappear at claridges tomorrow as i was before this american stunti beg your pardon watson my well of english seems to be permanently defiledbefore this american job came my way  but you have retired holmes  we heard of you as living the life of a hermit among your bees and your books in a small farm upon the south downs  exactly watson  here is the fruit of my leisured ease the magnum opus of my latter years  he picked up the volume from the table and read out the whole title practical handbook of bee culture with some observations upon the segregation of the queen  alone i did it behold the fruit of pensive nights and laborious days when i watched the little working gangs as once i watched the criminal world of london  but how did you get to work again  ah i have often marvelled at it myself  the foreign minister alone i could have withstood but when the premier also deigned to visit my humble roof  the fact is watson that this gentleman upon the sofa was a bit too good for our people  he was in a class by himself things were going wrong and no one could understand why they were going wrong  agents were suspected or even caught but there was evidence of some strong and secret central force  it was absolutely necessary to expose it  strong pressure was brought upon me to look into the matter it has cost me two years watson but they have not been devoid of excitement  when i say that i started my pilgrimage at chicago graduated in an irish secret society at buffalo gave serious trouble to the constabulary at skibbareen and so eventually caught the eye of a subordinate agent of von bork who recommended me as a likely man you will realize that the matter was complex  since then i have been honoured by his confidence which has not prevented most of his plans going subtly wrong and five of his best agents being in prison i watched them watson and i picked them as they ripened  well sir i hope that you are none the worse  the last remark was addressed to von bork himself who after much gasping and blinking had lain quietly listening to holmess statement he broke out now into a furious stream of german invective his face convulsed with passion  holmes continued his swift investigation of documents while his prisoner cursed and swore  though unmusical german is the most expressive of all languages he observed when von bork had stopped from pure exhaustion  hullo hullo he added as he looked hard at the corner of a tracing before putting it in the box  this should put another bird in the cage  i had no idea that the paymaster was such a rascal though i have long had an eye upon him mister von bork you have a great deal to answer for  the prisoner had raised himself with some difficulty upon the sofa and was staring with a strange mixture of amazement and hatred at his captor  i shall get level with you altamont he said speaking with slow deliberation  if it takes me all my life i shall get level with you  the old sweet song said holmes  how often have i heard it in days gone by  it was a favorite ditty of the late lamented professor moriarty   colonel sebastian moran has also been known to warble it and yet i live and keep bees upon the south downs  curse you you double traitor cried the german straining against his bonds and glaring murder from his furious eyes  no no it is not so bad as that said holmes smiling  as my speech surely shows you mr altamont of chicago had no existence in fact  i used him and he is gone  then who are you  it is really immaterial who i am but since the matter seems to interest you mr von bork i may say that this is not my first acquaintance with the members of your family  i have done a good deal of business in germany in the past and my name is probably familiar to you  i would wish to know it said the prussian grimly  it was i who brought about the separation between irene adler and the late king of bohemia when your cousin heinrich was the imperial envoy it was i also who saved from murder by the nihilist klopman count von und zu grafenstein who was your mothers elder brother  it was i  von bork sat up in amazement  there is only one man he cried  exactly said holmes  von bork groaned and sank back on the sofa  and most of that information came through you he cried  what is it worth what have i done  it is my ruin forever  it is certainly a little untrustworthy said holmes  it will require some checking and you have little time to check it  your admiral may find the new guns rather larger than he expects and the cruisers perhaps a trifle faster  von bork clutched at his own throat in despair  there are a good many other points of detail which will no doubt come to light in good time  but you have one quality which is very rare in a german mr von bork  you are a sportsman and you will bear me no illwill when you realize that you who have outwitted so many other people have at last been outwitted yourself  after all you have done your best for your country and i have done my best for mine and what could be more natural  besides he added not unkindly as he laid his hand upon the shoulder of the prostrate man it is better than to fall before some ignoble foe  these papers are now ready watson  if you will help me with our prisoner i think that we may get started for london at once  it was no easy task to move von bork for he was a strong and a desperate man  finally holding either arm the two friends walked him very slowly down the garden walk which he had trod with such proud confidence when he received the congratulations of the famous diplomatist only a few hours before  after a short final struggle he was hoisted still bound hand and foot into the spare seat of the little car  his precious valise was wedged in beside him  i trust that you are as comfortable as circumstances permit said holmes when the final arrangements were made  should i be guilty of a liberty if i lit a cigar and placed it between your lips  but all amenities were wasted upon the angry german  i suppose you realize mr sherlock holmes said he that if your government bears you out in this treatment it becomes an act of war  what about your government and all this treatment said holmes tapping the valise  you are a private individual  you have no warrant for my arrest  the whole proceeding is absolutely illegal and outrageous  absolutely said holmes  kidnapping a german subject  and stealing his private papers  well you realize your position you and your accomplice here if i were to shout for help as we pass through the village  my dear sir if you did anything so foolish you would probably enlarge the two limited titles of our village inns by giving us the dangling prussian as a signpost  the englishman is a patient creature but at present his temper is a little inflamed and it would be as well not to try him too far  no mr von bork you will go with us in a quiet sensible fashion to scotland yard whence you can send for your friend baron von herling and see if even now you may not fill that place which he has reserved for you in the ambassadorial suite  as to you watson you are joining us with your old service as i understand so london wont be out of your way  stand with me here upon the terrace for it may be the last quiet talk that we shall ever have  the two friends chatted in intimate converse for a few minutes recalling once again the days of the past while their prisoner vainly wriggled to undo the bonds that held him  as they turned to the car holmes pointed back to the moonlit sea and shook a thoughtful head  theres an east wind coming watson  i think not holmes  it is very warm  good old watson  you are the one fixed point in a changing age theres an east wind coming all the same such a wind as never blew on england yet  it will be cold and bitter watson and a good many of us may wither before its blast  but its gods own wind none the less and a cleaner better stronger land will lie in the sunshine when the storm has cleared  start her up watson for its time that we were on our way  i have a check for five hundred pounds which should be cashed early for the drawer is quite capable of stopping it if he can
